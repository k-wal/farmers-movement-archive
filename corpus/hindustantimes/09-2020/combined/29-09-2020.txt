29-09-2020||News||How the new farm bills are exploitative||Three farm bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Bypass Bill, and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — have disappointed farmers across the country. Before I come to the harsh provisions of the bills, I wish to note that their journey — without any meaningful consultation, debate, or majority in the Rajya Sabha — marks a new low in democratic lawmaking. The bills represent an unprecedented encroachment into the rights of the states: Agriculture is a state subject under the Constitution. The government introduced e-National Agriculture Market (eNAM) in 2016 to address issues arising from the inefficiencies in existing mechanisms and different APMC Acts in different states. Till May, the government was confident of adding more mandis to eNAM. However, the market was not well-designed and the states were not incentivised to push for its adoption. So, only 1,000 out of 6,900 APMCs had joined eNAM. As a result, the government’s hyperbole of doubling farmer incomes and offering them higher support prices has been exposed. A properly-implemented digital platform could have resulted in better terms for farmers. With the APMC Bypass Bill, even that halfhearted attempt to leverage digital technology as a step towards a unified agricultural market has been abandoned.APMCs have performed regulatory, match-making, and price discovery functions since inception. They have also assimilated the regional and local socio-economic landscape. Mandi fees and other associated costs of selling through APMCs constituted a key drawback as this reduced effective prices available to the farmers. This has needed reform for some time now. This could have been addressed by passing the burden of these costs to large corporate buyers, the use of technology, and by a financial line to the states to underwrite these expenses. This would have enabled APMCs to preserve its local character, allowed small and medium farmers to bargain collectively and to exchange crucial information. The Bypass Bill will help a few large farmers who can obtain favourable terms from buyers. Large buyers, in turn, driven by the need to minimise the cost of procurement, would prefer to deal with large farmers. This will create a separate ecosystem in which buyers divide up regions and large farmers among themselves, drive hard bargains and transact on terms that are publicly invisible. In the absence of a regulator, cartelisation of buyers and inferior terms for farmers cannot be prevented. The anti-competitive and exploitative impact of the bills has not been examined. Far from converging prices towards the minimum support price (MSP), the bills will create asymmetric markets in which farmers are the losers. In countless examples of privatisation from across the world, the “invisible hand” of regulation has been necessary to ensure favourable terms to those with the least bargaining power. The bills also lack any semblance of a genuine grievance redressal mechanism. Agriculture suffers from poor and uneven infrastructure and access to markets. In fact, there are too few mandis. As per the National Commission on Farmers, there should be a mandi every 80 sq km; there is only one every 435 sq km. Farmers hold a low share of warehousing facilities and have no access to good agri-logistic facilities like cold chain infrastructure and reliable grading and assaying facilities. Privatisation of trading will selectively benefit peri-urban farmers with access to better infrastructure and literate farmers, though the caveats listed here would continue to apply to them. The only important example of a large-scale experiment with the abolition of APMCs is available from Bihar, which repealed the APMC Act in 2006. Studies in the state have concluded that there has been little change in the way farmers sold their produce before and after the repeal. Small farmers continue to sell to traders on unfavourable terms, even when transport facilities are available. In any case, widely varying efficiency and modalities with which the Act has been implemented in the states make interstate comparisons meaningless.The bills divert attention from the anti-farmer stance of the government. Small and marginal farmers form 86% of the farming community and contribute over 50% of crop output. This majority faces substantial bottlenecks in connecting to markets and the bills bring no relief to them. There has been no systematic attempt by this government to infuse capital, technology and knowledge to make farming on small land-holdings profitable. In the absence of infrastructure, small and most medium farmers will continue to turn to local traders. With the marginalisation of APMCs, this relationship will turn even more adverse for the farmer. Input cost-price mismatch will worsen and rural indebtedness; as per the National Sample Survey Office, a farming household is likely to have 630% higher debt-to-asset ratio in 2013 than in 1992, and this has worsened in the last six years. Starting with demonetisation, withdrawal of support to agricultural research, the steep fall in international commodity prices, disruption of logistics on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, and forcing of APMCs into irrelevance are likely to push millions of farmers deeper into poverty and encourage profiteering, widen income and wealth inequalities and fuel social unrest.These reasons should convince us that while agricultural marketing and procurement need examination, this needs extensive consultation, most importantly with farmers, the organisations that represent them, and state governments, whose experience with the farm sector is much more vast, diverse, and nuanced than that of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-new-farm-bills-are-exploitative/story-wIiWHtJWAvQDXrRQ3HVxAP.html
29-09-2020||News||2020 is the year of Indian-Americans, and they’re not with Trump||Throughout the 232-year history of the United States (US) presidential elections, India had rarely been a campaign issue. The current election, pitting President Donald Trump and former vice-president Joe Biden, is changing that. With the election day less than seven weeks away and early voting already in progress in several states, both campaigns are touting their strong support for India.Foreign leaders and the politics of other countries become issues in US presidential campaigns only when they have direct implications for the US or foreign policy consequences. The exceptions have been Israel and Cuba. They are perennial campaign issues because of the presence of a large number of voters who have an interest in the domestic politics of those countries.India has become a campaign issue in the current election cycle for this same reason. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are touting their support for India to woo the 1.8-million Indian-American voters, who have a strong presence in battleground states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.Indian-American populations in swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida are large enough to tilt the race one way or the other. According to a survey by AAPI Data, which tracks demographic data on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander communities, there are 87,000 Indian-American voters in Florida, 61,000 in Pennsylvania, and 45,000 in Michigan.These are among the dozen states that will decide the fate of Trump and Biden on November 3. To put the size of the Indian-American electorate in context, Trump won Michigan in 2016 by 13,080 votes and Pennsylvania by 44,292.Trump’s campaign was the first to start focusing on India. Trump, who had professed his “love” for “Hindus” during his insurgent campaign in 2016, appeared with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in two public events over the past 12 months, in Houston last year and in Ahmedabad in February. For its part, the Biden campaign has also been courting the Indian-American community aggressively. On August 15, India’s Independence Day, Biden and vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris addressed the Indian-American community, where both vouched their strong support for India.Until recently, neither the Democratic nor the Republican Party made any concerted effort to earn Indian-American votes. This was due to the relatively small size of the Indian-American electorate and the fact that it was concentrated in reliably Democratic states such as California, New York and New Jersey and routinely voted Democratic.This year, the Indian-American electorate is on the radar screens of both Democrats and Republicans. Around 56% of Indian-American registered voters told the AAPI Data pollsters that they have been contacted by the Democrats in the past year and 48% said they were approached by the Republicans. Even though Trump was the first to begin targeting Indian-American voters, he doesn’t appear to have made a lot of progress. The recent AAPI Data survey found that only 28% of Indian-Americans plan to vote for Trump. Two-thirds of the registered voters said they will vote for Biden. There are many reasons the president hasn’t been able to move the needle substantially with the Indian-American community. First and foremost is the former vice-president’s long track record as a supporter of India, dating back to his Senate days. Second, Trump’s approach to India, much like his approach to politics and governing, in general, has primarily been one of sloganeering rather than consistency in policy positions. Finally, similar to a vast majority of Americans outside of Trump’s base, Indian Americans perceive the Trump presidency as one of chaos and confrontation for the US, India and the world.  At this point in time, however, it appears that verdict will be that Donald Trump should be a one-term president and that India should start developing its future relations with Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/2020-is-the-year-of-indian-americans-and-they-re-not-with-trump/story-yREJNlDKVrD8I3OQplVEfO.html
29-09-2020||News||The impact of Covid-19 on state economies||An unfortunate consequence of Covid-19 is the adverse impact on the economy. India’s economy contracted by 23.9% in the first quarter of the fiscal year, according to data from the government. It reveals that all sectors of the economy, except agriculture, shrank in the first quarter. Beyond the national level, however, we are keen to understand how state economies are doing. It might be a while before the data on state economies becomes available, so we used micro-data from the Google mobility report to analyse contractions in economic activity across states. We studied trends in the retail and recreation sector such as visits to restaurants, malls, commercial centres and so on to gauge the impact of Covid-19 on economic activity. The analysis reveals an overall sharp contraction of approximately 38% that still prevails across India, compared to the period prior to Covid (January 3 to February 6). The time trend shows an immediate decline of more than 75% as soon as the national lockdown was imposed and a further decline to approximately 85% by the end of April. The revival since has been slow and varied across states. Nevertheless, all states have experienced a severe contraction in mobility trends suggesting a sharp decline in economic activity. The biggest decline has been in states such as Manipur, Goa, Nagaland, Mizoram and Maharashtra while the least has been in Bihar, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. A natural hypothesis is that the extent and severity of the infection within a state would determine the magnitude of its economic slowdown. So we studied the relationship between Covid-19 prevalence (cases per million in the state) and severity (deaths per million) within a state and the economic contraction there. It is interesting to note that there is no discernible relationship between infection in a state and the decline in economic activity measured by mobility. It is puzzling to see states like Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram and Kerala witness a big decline in economic activity while the prevalence and severity of the infection remain low. Among large states, the biggest economic contraction is in Maharashtra. This is not surprising given the status of the infection in the state which is growing. Maharashtra has five districts within the group of the worst 10 affected districts in the country. If we proxy the government’s effort by the extent of Covid-19 testing, then Maharashtra has consistently reported the highest test positivity rate (TPR) in the country. The latest statistics show that this might worsen further. High and rising TPR indicates that the infection is way ahead of our knowledge from testing, as a larger fraction of cases is positive for every 100 tests. Against this reality, the performance of poorer states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar become noteworthy because they have maintained their TPR well below the World Health Organization prescribed benchmark of 5%. What remains a concern, however, is the growing share of antigen tests compared to the more reliable RT-PCR tests across states. In a meeting with the chief ministers of the seven biggest Covid-19-afflicted states, Narendra Modi stressed on increasing RT-PCR tests and emphasised on conducting follow up tests for all people who tested negative through the antigen tests. The policy implications from these empirical trends speak to health governance and the impact on the economy. Never before has the federal structure of health governance had such a profound bearing on India’s economy. Poor Covid-19 management in an economically-strategic state like Maharashtra affects the overall national fight against the virus and frustrates attempts at economic revival. A big decline in economic activity in states where the pandemic has been relatively muted in prevalence and severity also highlights the role of dispelling fear and panic among people. Until a vaccine becomes commonly available, we will have to learn to live with the virus. A low middle-income country like India cannot afford to be petrified into economic inaction. The Centre must take a leadership role and ensure better Covid-19 management — starting with Mumbai and Delhi. One can begin with the simplest policy objective of ensuring a minimum test positivity rate and share of RT-PCR in testing composition within these Covid-19 hotspot cities. India needs to reboot its Covid-19 strategy — for the sake of its economy. The pathway to economic recovery lies through the health care sector and collective Covid-19 management. Data shows that economic recovery has been higher and faster in several European countries struck by the pandemic in the summer months earlier this year. India, with a much lower mortality rate, continues to struggle with slow economic recovery. We need more confidence-building measures to overcome this. Data suggests that India has a high Covid-19 recovery rate and a majority of infected people are recovering at home with minimal intervention. The most credible strategy for economic recovery is easy access to Covid-19 testing and when required, easy access to hospital beds. This will dispel the widespread fear among people and help in boosting the economy. Without this, India’s economy will experience prolonged uncertainty and, therefore, a slow recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-state-economies/story-omzaH05tw6ahNSg5V5zgKK.html
29-09-2020||News||One million lives lost to Covid-19, writes WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus||One million people have now been lost to Covid-19 and many more are suffering because of the pandemic. This milestone is a difficult moment for the world but there are glimmers of hope that encourage us now and in the near future. Just nine months on from the virus first being identified, some of the best scientists in the world have collectively developed tests to diagnose cases, identified treatments like corticosteroids to reduce mortality in the most severe cases of Covid-19, and produced vaccine candidates that are now in final phase three trials. While we await further breakthroughs, we have seen that the virus can be effectively contained through the application of tried and tested public health measures. Many countries have driven an all-of-government, all-of-society response. With the right preparedness infrastructure in place, they were able to act early to contain outbreaks before transmission got out of hand. Thailand has a well-resourced medical and public health system. Informed by the best available scientific advice, and a trained and committed community health workforce, Thai authorities acted decisively to suppress the virus, to build trust and to increase public confidence.Italy was one of the first countries to experience a large outbreak outside China, and in many ways was a pioneer for other countries. Learning from the Wuhan experience, Italy put strong measures in place and was able to reduce transmission and save many thousands of lives. National unity and solidarity, combined with the dedication and sacrifice of health workers, and the engagement of the Italian people helped bring the outbreak under control. Although the Americas has so far been the most-affected region, Uruguay has reported the lowest number of cases and deaths in Latin America, both in total and on a per capita basis. This is not an accident. Uruguay has one of the most robust and resilient health systems in Latin America, with sustainable investment based on political consensus on the importance of investing in public health.Pakistan deployed the infrastructure built up over many years for polio to combat Covid-19. Community health workers who have been trained to go door-to-door vaccinating children against polio have been redeployed and utilized for surveillance, contact tracing and care. This has both suppressed the virus and, as the country stabilizes, the economy is also now picking up once again. Reinforcing the lesson that the choice is not between controlling the virus or saving the economy; the two go hand-in-hand. There are many other examples including Cambodia, Mongolia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Senegal, Spain, Vietnam and more. Many of these countries learnt lessons from previous disease outbreaks of SARS, MERS, measles, polio, Ebola and flu to hone their health system and respond to this new pathogen.But the key lesson is the same: No matter where a country is in an outbreak, it is never too late to turn things around. There are four essential steps that all countries, communities and individuals must focus on to take control the epidemic. First, prevent amplifying events. Covid-19 spreads very efficiently among clusters of people.Second, reduce deaths by protecting vulnerable groups, including older people, those with underlying conditions and essential workers.Third, individuals must play their part by taking the measures we know work to protect themselves and others – stay at least one metre away from others, clean your hands regularly, practice respiratory etiquette, and wear a mask. Avoid the “three Cs”: Closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings.And fourth, governments must take tailored actions to find, isolate, test and care for cases, and trace and quarantine contacts. Widespread stay-at-home orders can be avoided if countries take temporary and geographically-targeted interventions.The 75th session of the UN General Assembly provides a moment for the world to come together to reflect on the past year and to forge a collective way forward. This is critical, because this public health emergency of international concern needs a global solution.The global economy is expected to contract by $7 trillion in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Only by tackling it together, will lives and livelihoods be restored. Launched in April this year, the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is the only global initiative offering a solution to speed up the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.With the largest portfolio of Covid-19 tools in the world, investing in the ACT-Accelerator increases the probability of being able to access the “winning candidate” and hedges the risk that countries that have already entered individual bilateral agreements end up with products that are not viable. It needs US$35 billion to meet the goal of developing new tools and producing and delivering 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million diagnostic tests over the next year. That’s just 1% of what G20 governments have already committed to domestic economic stimulus packages.While today’s milestone gives us pause for reflection, this is a moment for us all to come together, in solidarity, to fight back against this virus. History will judge us on the decisions we do and don’t make in the months ahead. Let’s seize the opportunity and bridge national boundaries to save lives and livelihoods.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is director-general, World Health OrganizationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/one-million-lives-lost-to-covid-19-writes-who-chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus/story-z3CBZuvgKdf2W52ZqW2QPN.html
29-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad completes three lakh tests, plans to test 6,000 daily in October||The Ghaziabad district on Monday completed 300,00 Covid-19 since the first case was reported on March 5. Health department officials said that they have increased the daily testing to 5,000 and will scale it further to 6000 per day. The district at present has a test positivity rate (TPR, or number of positive results per 100 tests) of about 4.6% according to official records. Of the total 302,608 tests till September 28, almost 58% were done through rapid antigen kits, a less accurate but faster test than the “gold standard” molecular testing RT-PCR. “The testing has gone above 300,000 and we are now planning to ramp up daily testing to 6000 and above. For the purpose, we have approved 20 new lab technicians for more extensive testing across the district,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The district is now testing 332 per million of population per day. The World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) recommendation is of 140 tests per million residents a day. “We have 20 different testing centres in the district where anyone can walk in and get a test conducted free of cost. This is why we have about 90% of our testing conducted at our sampling centres. As per state government directions we will be taking up the testing to 6000 per day and we have started our efforts in this direction. Our teams conducted 5124 tests on Monday,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “As per directions, we will now be focussing on conducting at least one-third of total tests with the help of RT-PCR method which is ‘gold standard’ and more reliable than the rapid antigen kit test,” he added. With increased testing, the number of new cases coming in has also increased, crossing 14,000, according to state control room figures of September 29. The district achieved 10000 cases on September 10 and thereafter, every subsequent lot of 1000 cases till September 29 have come in a gap of four to six days. The experts said that with the increased testing, the district should now focus on conducting more tests in containment zones. “The number of cases has seen a spike in the month of September. If the testing capabilities are growing, it would be advisable to conduct 100% testing in containment zones. This will largely help to find out suspected cases in vulnerable areas and also help in checking spread of infection,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Overall, in the month of September, the Ghaziabad district conducted 105015 tests during the first 28 days which is the highest figure achieved in any month since March. During September, the average daily rate of testing is about 3750 tests conducted in 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-completes-three-lakh-tests-plans-to-test-6-000-daily-in-october/story-q35i3TFH4ro3fTpEpgQnDJ.html

The petitioner had argued that court’s observations on importance of the exam while disposing of a plea on the issue were not considered by PU while making the decision. The petitioner had also alleged that PU’s act was contemptuous. The decision to scrap the exam was taken on August 11 in view of Covid-19 outbreak, and was initially challenged by two law course aspirants, who argued that the premise not to hold the entrance was invalid when PU was conducting such exams for other courses. Class 12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course would neither be reasonable nor reliable, they had argued. Following the plea, the high court had asked PU to reconsider its decision by September 15. However, PU again decided against holding the exam, which resulted in the second round of litigation. The petition has been disposed of now with PU undertaking that it will take a fresh decision within three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/entrance-test-for-five-year-law-course-pu-to-reconsider-its-decision-in-three-days/story-OBjKKTV8JCSimvsLah2tpL.html
29-09-2020||Gurugram||Number of containment zones in Gurugram down from 115 to 96||The district administration on Tuesday released a revised order regarding the number of containment zones in the district to restrict the spread of Covid-19. As of September 29, there are 96 such containment zones in Gurugram, where public mobility continues to be restricted, and where testing camps continue to administer antigen tests to the community at large. Three weeks ago, on September 8, there were 115 containment zones. Once declared a containment zone by the deputy commissioner (who also serves as the chairperson of the district disaster management authority) under the Haryana Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and the Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020, an area may be denotified after a period of two weeks, if no new positive cases are detected in the area. “During these two weeks, we typically scale up surveillance by administering antigen tests at large, conducting door-to-door screening camps and reserving a larger share of RT PCR tests for PHCs in these areas,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.Tigra and Khandsa localities, with clusters of densely populated and often informal housing settlements, have the highest number of containment zones in the district at 23 and 12, respectively. However, improvements were seen in areas, such as Chanderlok, Badshahpur and Patel Nagar. While the former two now have under five containment zones each, Patel Nagar (a long-standing hotspot) has been denotified as a containment zone, as per the deputy commissioner’s latest order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/number-of-containment-zones-in-gurugram-down-from-115-to-96/story-leBV1wwS1IGH9HuEZCJWzM.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra bans dandiya, garba, processions in navratri||There will be no garba or dandiya events during Navratri this year, as part of the state government’s efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. The state home department issued guidelines on Tuesday for the celebration of Navratri, banning these community events and restricting the height of the idols to four feet in pandals and two feet in domestic celebrations. The guidelines also banned processions on the first and last day of Navratri, which begins on October 17. Ravan Dahan, which is usually celebrated on the last day of the festival and sees large crowds, will not be permitted. Gathering of more than five people in pandals and serving food or beverages are also prohibited. Organisers have been asked to make use of the digital medium for rituals like darshan, to avoid crowding in pandals. “These are the guidelines along the lines of those issued for Ganeshotsav and Bakri Eid. The responsibility of enforcing the restrictions will be on local authorities, including municipal corporations, police and collectors,” said an official from the home department. The state has also mandated that instead of idols made of plaster of Paris (PoP), organisers should opt for either clay or permanent idols. For immersion, artificial ponds should be constructed by local bodies near pandals as immersion at public places will not be allowed. Local police have been directed to issue orders on immersion day to avoid people gathering. Ganesh Naidu, who organise dandiya events at Kora Kendra in Borivli, said, “We are not against restrictions, but we should be allowed to organise orchestra at the pandal and telecast it so that people can play dandiya sitting at their home. In the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, people are fed up sitting at homes for the past six months and need some sort of entertainment and religious celebration,” he said. Dandiya and garba are particularly popular among the Gujarati community during Navratri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bans-dandiya-garba-processions-in-navratri/story-mj0qQOB3rvnKAq0MMMb0yH.html
29-09-2020||Gurugram||DTCP forms state-level teams to monitor illegal constructions, unauthorised colonies||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has formed multiple state-level teams to monitor illegal construction, development of unauthorised colonies across Haryana.The department has formed four monitoring teams—for Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula, Rohtak and Hisar (to be monitored by the same team) circles. The team that would oversee such activities in Gurugram would be headed by the director of the department, read the order issued by DTCP on Friday.Makrand Pandurang, director, town and country planning department, who issued the order said these teams will visit the actual sites in their respective jurisdiction to assess the quantum of action taken against illegal colonies, hold regular meetings with the task force and maintain a record as per standard operating measures.“These teams will also hold meetings with concerned district administration officials such as deputy commissioner (DC) superintendents of police (SP) . They will also get warning boards installed at illegal colonies and take other necessary actions as required,” he said.The objective of this move, officials said, is to prevent development of illegal colonies across Haryana and particularly in Gurugram, where, according to DTCP’s estimates, more than 100 colonies came up in the past two years illegally. The officials, however, said that large scale demolition drives have been carried out illegal colonies in the last six months and this was an ongoing process.As per the order, the DTPC director will head the Gurugram circle team, while chief town planner, Haryana will head the Faridabad circle, and the Rohtak-Hisar and Panchkula circles will be headed by senior DTCP officials.In a related development the district town planner has also constituted a team to look into the violations in houses that are carried out by owners after obtaining the Occupation Certificate (OC).RS Bhath, district town planner, said that five teams headed by respective junior engineers have been formed and they would conduct inspection of sites for which occupation certificates have been issued. “These inspections would be conducted preferably within 45 days after an OC is issued, as it has been found that a number of house owners have violated construction norms after getting the certificate,” he said.Bhath also said that large demolition drives have been carried out in the city against illegal colonies and more will be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-forms-state-level-teams-to-monitor-illegal-constructions-unauthorised-colonies/story-9S5B24vTmjXvvw9HzO05fO.html
29-09-2020||Gurugram||District administration proposes pedestrian-friendly changes for Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||To ensure smooth and safe movement of pedestrians at six major intersections on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the district administration has asked the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to make changes, including installation of mandatory traffic signage, creation of pathways for pedestrians, refuge islands and introduction of speed-calming measures for safety of road users. These six stretches include Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Khandsa cut, Sidhrawali cut and Bilaspur Chowk. The district road safety committee has also recommended that speed limit on certain road stretches that is currently limited to 60 to 70 kmph should be further reduced to 40 to 45 kmph. These locations in the past three years have seen several road accidents and fatalities and a study conducted by a road safety organisation working with district administration made these recommendations, said officials privy to the matter.Anurag Kulshreshtha, president, Trax, an NGO working with the district administration, said that facilities for pedestrian are minimal at these intersections and there is need for redesigning these stretches to create a safer environment for pedestrians. “The maximum number of people who are dying on the roads are pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycle riders. The main reason is speeding and poor road design. We are preparing a detailed report on these stretches that shall be submitted soon,” he said. As per the road safety committee, the key flaws at Rajiv Chowk are lack of pedestrian crossing, no refuge island and lack of speed-calming measures. At Hero Honda Chowk, the experts found rampant wrong-side driving, no pedestrian infrastructure, lack of signage and a need for stricter enforcement. Khandsa Cut also lacks pedestrian infrastructure, has no waiting space for pedestrians and speed calming measures. Shankar Chowk, on the other hand, witnesses random movement of pedestrians, lack of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and has high number of conflict points. The Sidhrawali Cut and Bilaspur Chowk on the NH 48 also suffer from similar issues apart from no road markings, open drainage and lack of speed-calming measures, the committee said. Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road transport expert, said that these traffic intersections have a number of structural flaws, which need to be corrected. “We have done a comprehensive study for the redesigning of some of the major intersections in the city and the authorities need to take action on this soon,” she said. Apart from changes at major intersections, the road safety committee has also proposed that speed limit on certain roads, such as MG Road, Golf Course Road, Manesar to Bilaspur Road, Rampura to Manesar Road,, Subash Chowk to Sohna Road, Rajiv Chowk to Kherkidaula toll plaza, Sidhrawali to Kapriwas, Netaji Subash Marg and Pataudi to Haily Mandi should be reduced between 40 to 45 kmph. Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, Gurugram, who is also the member secretary of district road safety committee, said that the objective of this exercise is to reduce fatalities to a bare minimum and prevent road accidents. “Remedial measures would be taken to make it safer for pedestrians to cross roads and prevent accidents. This will be done through changes in road designs and other interventions. The issue of reducing speed on roads is being studied by GMDA, which will take a call on this matter,” he said, adding these measures would be taken before the onset of winter.The NHAI on its part said that it will actively works with district administration to ensure road safety and implement the measures recommended by it. Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, Gurugram, when asked about the proposed changes, said that they are studying the recommendations made by the road safety committee. “A final decision on the changes can be taken only after a joint visit to the spot with the stakeholders and traffic experts. We will need to know the exact signage and spots where these need to be fixed,” said Mittal. Referring to the proposed visit to these spots, Kulshreshta said that a visit to these spots has been scheduled on October 5. “Experts from Trax, along with officials from concerned departments, will visit these spots and take a final decision,” he said. As far as reducing the speed on different roads is concerned, the GMDA said that the proposal is under consideration but since it involves multiple stakeholders, feedback from them is required before implementing the changes. JS Sindhu, engineer, traffic management, GMDA, said that this matter was under consideration of Committee on Traffic Managament formed by the GMDA and decision in this regard would be taken after obtaining feedback from different agencies and road users. “Each road has a different character and an analysis would be conducted by experts and traffic police department after which a decision will be taken. Feedback from different stakeholders including road users and residents would also be factored in,” said Sindhu. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that all efforts are being made to identify the traffic blind spots and find solutions to minimise road accidents and fatalities. “This is an ongoing process and multiple agencies are involved for better results,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-proposes-pedestrian-friendly-changes-for-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-jzaYjWeSiqlFXsO2VngYlJ.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 14,976 Covid-19 cases, 430 more deaths||Maharashtra on Tuesday reported fewer than 20,000 Covid-19 cases for a third day in a row, with 14,976 infections taking the tally to 1,366,129. With 430 more fatalities, the death toll of the state reached 36,181. A day after Mumbai breached the grim mark of 200,000 cases, the daily caseload, which was hovering between 2,000 and 2,300 lately, dropped to 1,713, taking the tally to 202,614 The city’s death toll touched 8,883 with 49 new fatalities reported on Tuesday. Like Mumbai, Pune district, too, clocked fewer cases on Tuesday. Pune saw 2,359 cases, including 1,005 in the city, 726 in rural parts and 628 in Pimpri-Chinchwad, and 44 deaths (25 in city, 17 in rural parts and two in Pimpri-Chichwad). Nagpur saw 1,045 cases and 49 fatalities, while Nashik clocked 1,301 cases and 14 deaths. Sangli and Kolhapur reported 478 and 318 cases, along with nine deaths each respectively. Of the 430 fatalities, 232 were from past 48 hours, 108 were from the past week and remaining 90 were from the period before it, according to the state health department. The cases in the state witnessed a decline over the past 10 days after reporting a daily addition of more than 20,000 cases over the major part of the past two months. Last 10 days (September 20-29) saw the addition of 178,114 cases and 3,965 deaths, against 220,666 cases and 4,429 fatalities in 10 days (September 10-19) before it. State conducted 91,1877 tests in the past 10 days, as opposed to 903,141 tests during September 10-19. State conducted 75,640 tests at a positivity rate of 19.79%. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.65%. The state government is planning to open up more activities, including restaurants and gymnasiums in next few weeks as part of its Mission Begin Again. Authorities are, however, wary about the rise in the cases because of the unlocking. “After the interdistrict restrictions on movement were lifted from September 2, a surge in cases was witnessed in the first two weeks of the month. Though there are similar possibilities after unlocking on the cards in the next few weeks, we have ramped up our machinery to contain the spread. The ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ drive will help us identify susceptible people and treat them early. Restrictions on commercial, industrial activities cannot remain in place for too long, but at the same time due care at all levels is required to be taken,” said an official from the health department. State government is expected to issue its notification to extend the ongoing lockdown by a month and opening up of certain activities from beginning of October. Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the state committee appointed to recommend steps to curb the spread, said that while easing curbs, the government should have more community participation. “The state is planning to allow restaurants to open and also suburban railway services. Restaurants starting at 40% of their capacity should not cause the spread, but for suburban railway service, I think, the government should continue with restricted entry and go for more number of services. More participation of people and community will help in educating and bringing awareness, commitment, involvement in the drive to keep the spread at the bay,” he said. Dr Supe said, “By end of October, there will be beginning of the decline in the cases and by December, the cases will see a drastic fall. “Mumbai should see the decline early as the spread was seen first in the city. At state level, the decline may begin by Diwali. More cases should not be the cause of worry unless the mortality is under control. The rise in the cases is because of the opening of activities and more number of tests,” he said. Dr Ravi Warkhedkar, former national president of Indian Medical Association, said that state authorities should focus on reducing mortality rate, which is still high in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-14-976-covid-19-cases-430-more-deaths/story-KDDiQJagyKLa3sfiT55uVK.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid impact: PU suspends employees’ LTC for 2020-21||The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed Panjab University (PU) into financial crises and forced its management to implement cuts under various budget heads this financial year. PU, in a recent communication to the heads of teaching and non-teaching departments, regional centres, and principals of constituent colleges, has informed about the downsizing. A special panel constituted for the austerity measures to curtail the spending has already made several recommendations to the university. According to the communication, the varsity has informed the stakeholders about the various steps approved by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar.Key decisionsBesides the suspension of leave travel concession/ home town concession and budget provisions under the seminar and field work head for financial year 2020-21, there will be trimming of 20% on the budget provisions of office and other general administrative expenditure. Also, the budget provisions for repair, maintenance and minor improvements will be reduced by 10% and those of the hostels by 40%. The budget for sport activities will be scaled back by 40% as well. It has also been decided that the overtime to employees will be discouraged, except in case of ‘C’ class employees, services of whom may be required for Covid-19 prevention activities. “The university should follow the system of job and process outsourcing instead of manpower outsourcing,” it has been recommended. What are expected lossesAs the classes are being held online for the first semester of 2020-21 session, the university will not earn any income from its hostels. According to the budget for 2020-21 approved by the PU senate in its December 2019 meeting, the estimated revenue for the year from hostels was pegged at ₹11 crore.The annual fee hike has already been put on hold this year and a concession of 5% in semester fee for all students means losses to the tune of ₹2 crore for PU. As per the estimates made by the university last year, the income from the traditional teaching departments was slated to increase by 16% in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20.

29-09-2020||Gurugram||MCG terminates services of 523 outsourced workers||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), in the last four days, terminated the services of 523 outsourced workers — a majority of whom included workers deputed at the water boosting stations in the city, said officials on Monday, adding that their termination might negatively affect the water supply in the city. The civic body terminated the services of 59 outsourced workers last Friday, followed by the termination of the services of 464 additional workers on Sunday — the highest in a single day since MCG was formed in 2008. These workers included 177 security guards deputed at water boosting stations, along with 45 water boosting operators and 38 water boosting assistants.MCG officials privy to the matter said that the termination of the workers, especially the boosting operators and the assistants, have left them extremely short in manpower. This could affect the water supply in the city, especially in summer of 2021, if the situation does not change by then.“The sacking of boosting operators and assistants has left us short of manpower. Given the existing staff strength, a single pump operator or assistant will now have to cover 6-7 boosting stations in one area. The lack of constant supervision and expertise will also affect services in the boosting stations, especially during the summer season. We are trying to figure out the best way possible to deal with the situation,” said a senior MCG official in the water supply division of MCG, seeking anonymity.The official further highlighted the importance of boosting operators and assistants in managing boosting stations. “A lot of our machinery is still operated manually. Following a power outage, a lot of machines do not automatically turn on through the help of backup generators. Human intervention is often required. Further, a regular presence in the boosting stations is important for tackling defects, leakages, and regulating the flow of water. Absence of manpower will gravely affect the maintenance operations and result in poor output,” the official further said.Earlier, in September 2019, a 126-page investigation report was presented by an MCG committee on the hiring of 1,950 outsourced workers during a House meeting. The report had highlighted many shortcomings in the hiring processes of such contractual workers. RS Rathee, councillor of ward 34 and the head of the MCG committee, said that the report highlighted the fact that the recruitment of many of these outsourced workers was needless. “Many of the 523 outsourced workers terminated recently had been interviewed by the MCG committee last year. Their shortcomings, such as lack of expertise for the job, hiring against multiple posts, lopsided deployment, needless posts, hiring on recommendations of bureaucrats and politicians, had all been highlighted in our report. MCG officials were alerted about the matter. As such, action against the outsourced workers is being taken periodically,” said Rathee.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said that termination of outsourced workers was carried out as their services were found to be “surplus” to the requirement of MCG. “We realised that a lot of workers were hired unnecessarily. The tasks they were carrying out did not need multiple posts. Hence, we have terminated the services of around 500 workers. If at a later stage, we feel that certain departments need additional manpower, we will review the situation, and hire more contractual workers if needed,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-terminates-services-of-523-outsourced-workers/story-PF2xKL9aTaYfIuA4v6VlnO.html

He had managed to fool the hospital authorities into thinking he had died in the room after he set his bed on fire and locked the door from inside.The hospital is an L-1 category facility dedicated to treat mild cases of Covid-19. It has a capacity to treat 350 patients but had only 36 patients when the man was admitted and hence, he was the only one in the room.Officials of the health department who went to the hospital on Tuesday morning said that they had initially been informed that the patient had died in the fire. “He was lodged at the SRM College facility at 9.30pm on Sunday night from Dasna jail. At 9am on Tuesday the staff reported to the police that the door to his room was locked. The police went and broke open the door. When we were told that he had died in the fire, we immediately rushed to the spot,” said Dr. N K Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO). “There were no signs of burning of any human body. Only the bedrolls were set afire and the window grille broken.” The man was earlier booked under Indian penal code section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and lodged at Dasna jail before he was shifted. “I have directed the local police to register FIR against the suspect and nab him at the earliest. The suspect’s stund could have proved risky for other patients,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “This is why I have asked the police to register an FIR against him under stringent IPC sections. The cops have also been asked to increase security as well.” The hospital falls under the jurisdiction of the Niwari police station whose station house officer (SHO) could not be reached for comment. “We have registered an FIR against the suspect and investigating the incident. Our teams will nab him soon,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, circle officer of Modinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-positive-patient-sets-room-afire-flees-hospital-at-modinagar/story-K3vPO1fdG1IlnN5gQNhGDL.html
29-09-2020||Noida||Land pooling policy to boost industrial growth in Gautam Budh Nagar||The Uttar Pradesh government has asked the industrial bodies, including Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida), to adopt and implement the land pooling policy for development rather than direct purchase from its owners. The objective is to procure litigation-free land, create a land bank and use the ready land to attract investment in the region. Industry experts and the officials feel the move will fuel growth, particularly in Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway area, where a slew of projects, including the Jewar international airport and the Film City, are expected to come up.What does the policy sayIn his letter dated September 25, 2020, Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary Alok Kumar asked all industrial authorities to implement the land pooling policy, first formulated in 2017.Land measuring at least 25 acres should be given priority, he wrote, and should be located at least 18 meters from roads so that parking and other supporting services can be developed around the plot. The policy allows industrial authorities to execute expressions of interest (EoI) and invite applications from those who wished to sell their land to the government. If a committee, headed by the authority chief executive officer (CEO), is satisfied with the proposal, they will acquire it with the condition that the government will not be required to pay immediately. Rather, they will develop the acquired land and grant 25% of it to the original owner.Of this 25%, 80% of it should be developed for industrial use, 12% for residential and 8% for commercial use. The person is also free to sell the whole share to anyone, including to the government. Till the owner gets the developed land, the authority will pay a rent of ₹5,000 per month per acre. However, the owner will also have to develop these units or prefer to sell the land in 10 years else face penalty.Earlier, the administration would either acquire the land using the Land acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 or directly purchase it. Both would result in intense litigation that would stall any project.Although the 2013 Act maybe used to acquire land owned by many people in the land pooling policy too, government officials think they may have a stronger case if at least 80% of owners consented or fell under the “strategic” category.What do the industrial authorities sayAll three authorities- Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority are likely to issue a notice in newspapers and website inviting applications from the interested farmers.“The land pooling policy will help in acquiring the land without the farmers facing any issues with it as the land owners will become the partners in the development. We have a target to acquire at least 3,000 acres from farmers and the land pooling policy will make it easier for us to prepare the land bank and provide the same to industries,” said Narendra Bhooshan, Greater Noida authority CEO that has notified 40,000 hectares between Noida and Yamuna Expressway area.“We will first identify the spots, where we need land for industrial units and then invite applications from farmers to start the process to implement this policy.” Nodia, however, has only very few areas left with undeveloped land and under the ownership of private people, including farmers.“We will try to implement this policy, wherever we can,” said Ritu Maheshwari, Noida authority CEO.The policy will prove to be boon for Yeida, where multiple mega industrial projects are proposed.“The policy will help us in acquiring the land with the support of farmers, who will become partners in the development. We hope the new policy will benefit immensely and boost growth,” said Arun Vir Singh CEO of the YEIDA.Farmers and industries Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s) Gautam Budh Nagar district president Ajaypal Sharma, however, feels that the new policy is against the interest of farmers.“The policy seems to be in favour of farmers on the face of it. But how can a farmer set up industry at developed land, when he does not have the funds. And how an unskilled farmer can set up and run a business. This policy will make farmers labourers as he will lose livelihood with land taken by the government. The government should make farmer a partner in the industrial project if he wants us to get benefited,” said Sharma.Noida entrepreneur association president Vipin Malhan said new policy will help industrial townships.“If the policy will help in providing the litigation-free land then it can fuel growth and enable mega industrial projects to flourish on time because court disputes delay and affect the industry, when farmers protest.”Indian entrepreneur association (IEA) general secretary Sanjeev Sharma said, “The new policy may benefit the industrial townships requiring the land above 25 acres. But instead of focusing only on bigger projects the government first must provide the basic civic amenities and better law and order to existing units in Noida and Greater Noida to fuel growth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/land-pooling-policy-to-boost-industrial-growth-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-IAAAmxHM85lWJC9Trm4ckM.html

29-09-2020||City||Delhi-Meerut e-way: NHAI plans to open UP Gate to Vijay Nagar stretch by Oct 15||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is expediting the work on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) project and has planned to open about 10km stretch from UP Gate to Vijay Nagar by October 15. The officials said this stretch is part of DME Phase 2, which spans 19.2km from UP Gate to Dasna. Two phases -- Phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) and Phase 4 (Dasna to Meerut) -- are presently under construction and have a deadline of December 2020. The two other phases -- Phase 1 (Akshardham in Delhi to UP Gate) and Phase 3 (Dasna to Hapur) are operational. The NHAI officials have planned that the 10.7km stretch of UP Gate to Vijay Nagar will be completed in another 15 days and opened to motorists. “At present, we have four lanes on each side, which are highway lanes, and they are open to motorists. In another 15 days, we will open the six expressway lanes as well. This will considerably reducing travel time to Delhi from the Meerut side. We have some extension work pending on the river Hindon overbridge near Chhajarsi. Once this is complete, the six expressway lanes will be opened,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. “The Phase 2 has about 17 underpasses and work on three is pending and these are located between Vijay Nagar and Dasna. With the opening of six expressway lanes from UP Gate to Vijay Nagar, the other underpasses in the stretch will also become functional,” he said. The 10.7km stretch is important for motorists as it is close to residential and industrial sectors of Ghaziabad and Noida and the route is majorly used by daily commuters who travel to Delhi for work. According to officials, the stretch is estimated to see movement of about 50,000 passenger car units on a daily basis. “The second part of Phase 2 -- from Vijay Nagar to Dasna -- has ongoing work on the major flyover at Chipiyana. The other pending work is the construction of a minor bridge over a drain near Crossings Republik. This also involves the shifting of Ganga water pipeline. This work will take place when the Ganga water supply is shut in October for the annual maintenance of the Upper Ganga Canal. Once these works are complete, the second part of Phase 2 will also become operational,” Garg said. The Phase 2 is about 84% complete while Phase 4 is about 75% complete at, NHAI officials said. The DME is a 14-lane project with the three inner lanes on each side dedicated as an expressway between Delhi and Meerut, covering a distance of about 60km. Once complete, motorists will be able to journey between the two cities in about 30-35 minutes, which now takes about one-and-half hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-meerut-e-way-nhai-plans-to-open-up-gate-to-vijay-nagar-stretch-by-oct-15/story-mZXrN4wS4hI2JeaDrT1e3N.html

Praveen Mishra, executive director, NMRC, confirmed that the tender has been issued. The 9.15km route in first phase will have five Metro stations -- Sector 122 and Sector 123 in Noida; and Sector 4, Ecotech 12 and Sector 2 in Greater Noida. In the second phase of 5.8km, there will be four Metro stations; in Greater Noida’s Sector 3, Sector 10, Greater Sector 12 and Knowledge Park 5.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said the Greater Noida West extension line is significant given the number of residential colonies in that area. “The NMRC has issued a tender on September 29 and the last date for submission of bids is October 31. The project will be completed in 24 months from the award of contract. Soil testing and geotechnical survey of the route have been completed,” she said. The project will be funded by the state government, the Centre, the Noida authority and the Greater Noida authority. As per the tender document, the project cost of the first phase is approximately ₹491.99 crore. The NMRC will also hold a pre-bids meeting on October 9. Greater Noida West residents said the extension corridor will immensely help ease commuting, as the Metro will go through the densely populated areas of Gaur City and Greater Noida West, which have around 3 lakh under-construction housing units and around 75,000 flats already occupied. Sumil Jalota, a resident of La Residentia, in Greater Noida West, said at present, people mostly use their personal cars for travelling to Noida and Delhi due to poor connectivity. “Once the Aqua Line reaches Greater Noida West, it will connect us to Delhi as well as Gurugram and Faridabad. This will also end traffic jams in areas nearby. We hope that the project is completed in a timebound manner,” he said. The NMRC commenced operations of the Aqua Line, comprising 21 stations from Sector 51 in Noida to Depot station in Greater Noida, on January 25, 2019. This existing corridor has 15 stations in Noida and six in Greater Noida. This 29.71km Aqua Line was developed at a cost of ₹5,503 crore. The average daily ridership in February, 2020, stood at 25,907. After the lockdown, it resumed services on September 7 and has an average daily ridership of 4,200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nmrc-to-build-5-metro-stations-on-greater-noida-west-extension-corridor-of-aqua-line/story-SlUjyUvrRXQ07pGmIwUWcN.html

However, an investigation has been ordered into the incident. According to our initial investigation, the deceased went to the factory in the morning and later, he was found hanging from a ceiling fan in the factory. We recovered a suicide note from his possession which said that he was taking the step due to financial issues. He mentioned that he had a loan of about ₹30-35 lakh.

The company has denied all allegations and said the four officials named in the FIR were on duty from 9.30am while Kumar was found dead around 8.30am. “It seems that there is a group of disgruntled persons and some of our former employees who have played a part in lodging this FIR. The deceased had come to the factory where he had tea and snacks and later, he borrowed a pen from a colleague and also a sheet of paper on which was written the suicide note, found in his pocket by the police. It mentions that the incident took place due to financial issues he was facing,” said AK Sharma, general manager of the unit.

Those not using the attachments with the harvesters will be charged under provisions of the Air (Pollution and Prevention) Act, 1981, and pay compensation or fine for harming the environment. “The district administration is working hard to prevent stubble burning. An awareness drive on the issue is continuing. Despite repeated warnings, punitive action will be taken against those who violate the directions of the state government,” said Girish Dayalan, Mohali’s deputy commissioner. Fines of Rs 50,000 will be charged for first time violation, Rs. 75,000 for the second violation and Rs 1 lakh the third time. Dayalan said nodal officers and district pollution control officers would keep an eye on stubble burning activities and those not following orders will have to pay fines ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000.

The PM made the announcement while inaugurating six mega projects in Uttarakhand under the Namami Gange Mission through video-conferencing. “To fight challenges of water scarcity in many parts of the country, Jal Jeevan Mission is working towards giving piped water connectivity to all villages in the country and promoting gram swarajya (village self-sufficiency) and empowering the villages.“Under Jal Jeevan Mission, a 100-day campaign will start from October 2, under which it will be ensured that all schools and aganwadi centres in the country are connected with tap water supply,” said the Prime Minister. The state governments have been told to take up this project on priority and complete it within 100 days. “Over 15 crore houses were not connected with water supply till six years ago. Now around 1 lakh houses are being connected with clean piped water supply every day and the Jal Shakti ministry is working at a fast pace to increase this number. In just one year, over 2 crore families in the country have been given piped water connections. The Uttarakhand government is working one step ahead; they are working on giving water connectivity to each and every house at Re 1 only and over 50,000 families have been given water connectivity in Uttarakhand in the past six months, despite the Covid-19 epidemic,” said Modi.Talking about government vision about Ganga, PM Modi said that the government is not just focused on making the river pollution-free but also working on holistic economic development and protecting the ecology of the area along Ganga. “From its source near Gangotri till Ganga Sagar, river Ganga supports almost 50% of the population of the country. Many projects were taken up in the past to clean Ganga river but it is still polluted. We worked with a new approach and vision which was not only restricted to cleaning the river but took it up as the largest river conservation project in the country.” The PM said that the Namami Gange Mission is being taken to the next step now, where the focus will also be economic development of areas set up along the river. “The focus will not just be on Swachhta of Ganga river, but on holistic economic and environmental development of all areas set up along river Ganga. The Central government is working to promote organic farming and cultivation of medicinal plants along the river and making an organic corridor,” he added. Listing the four-point approach of the central government towards making Ganga pollution-free, PM Modi said, “We followed a systematic approach towards cleaning Ganga which focused on tapping over 130 drains opening into Ganga and restricting the entry of polluted water into the river.” “Along with this, we made sure that all the STPs being set up for river Ganga have the capacity of working long-term, minimum for the next ten years. Further in these past years, 100 cities and 5,000 villages along Ganga have been declared as open defecation-free, further reducing pollution sources. The fourth approach is to now ensure that tributaries joining Ganga are also made pollution-free,” said the Prime Minister. The PM inaugurated a sewage treatment plant (STP) with capacity of 68 million litres per day (MLD), up-gradation of the existing 27 MLD at Jagjeetpur in Haridwar and a new 18 MLD STP at Sarai in Haridwar. Along with this, a 26 MLD STP was inaugurated at Lakkadghat in Rishikesh, country’s first four-storey 7.5 MLD STP at Chandreshwar Nagar in Muni ki Reti town in Tehri Garhwal district, five MLD STP at Chorpani, and two STPs with capacities of 1 MLD and 0.01 MLD at Badrinath. The Haridwar-Rishikesh zone contributes about 80% wastewater load into the River Ganga. Hence, the inauguration of these STPs will play a significant role in keeping river Ganga clean. With the inauguration of these STPs, the sewage treatment capacity of Uttarakhand will increase from 61.5 MLD in 2014 to 214.5 MLD in 2020, an increase of almost three and a half times. The Prime Minister also inaugurated “Ganga Avalokan”, the first museum on Ganga at Chandi Ghat Haridwar, dedicated to showcase the culture, biodiversity and rejuvenation activities done in Ganga river. He also launched a book, ‘Rowing down the Ganges’, co-published by National Mission for Clean Ganga and Wildlife Institute of India, which conceptualises the story of the Ganga as what one would see when one rows down from Gaumukh, its origin, to Ganga Sagar, the last point before entering the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/schools-anganwadis-to-have-tap-water-supply-within-100-days-pm-modi/story-Y6lr0KHIEfyn6H2LHmINBK.html

The civic body plans to create a health map of the city by identifying people with co-morbid health issues.From September 15, BMC started the campaign for early detection and treatment of the most vulnerable sections of society with an aim to reduce deaths related to Covid-19. Till date, BMC has screened 182,667 houses and 634,000 individuals have undergone screening for co-morbidities in the last two weeks.“We will have a database of individuals suffering from diabetes, hypertension, cardiac ailments and other serious health issues. This will help us to be more prepared in handling patients ward-wise,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “All this information is being synced with war rooms of the respective wards,” he added. However, many volunteers and field officers are facing hurdles while talking to residents who often refuse to disclose health information.Due to the fear of being quarantined, residents refuse to disclose information about their family or themselves, complain ward officers. “Whenever society members see volunteers in protective suits, they often turn hostile. They think that we will quarantine people with diabetes or hypertension. So, the field officers have to first convince them to share correct information for their own good,” said Sandhya Nandekar, ward officer, R North, that covers Dahisar. According to BMC’s dashboard, till Tuesday 963,290 senior citizens have been screened, of whom 3,139 have oxygen saturation levels below 95. The civic body has trained hundreds of volunteers in carrying out the survey. Along with the set of questions, the volunteers also check oxygen levels and temperature of the residents. If anyone is found with mild symptoms, they are asked to remain in home isolation for 14 days. Among senior citizens, if anyone is found with oxygen levels below 95%, with symptoms, they are immediately tested for Covid-19. By the end of October, BMC will have data of the surveyed people as per their comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-6-lakh-people-across-mumbai-screened-for-covid-19-comorbidities-under-my-family-my-responsibility-survey/story-04X1rzdyvOF4QWZfdOhr7O.html

Officials said that the minimum area of a micro forest will be around 2,000 square feet and at least 2,000 trees will be planted in every forest.MC junior engineer, horticulture wing, Kirpal Singh said,”The MC has already established eight micro forests alongside the nullah and more sites are being identified.” Sabharwal said he has directed the staff to conduct a survey of the entire stretch of the nullah (14kms within the city) so that more sites can be identified. BJP councillor Sunita Rani’s husband Uma Dutt Sharma and Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey have accused the MC of ignoring public representatives while taking decisions regarding development and setting up of micro forests.Sharma said that the MC had earlier developed a park alongside the nullah near Chand cinema and now they have proposed to develop a micro forest at the same site. He added that public money is being wasted and councillors are also not being taken into confidence by the MC. Sharma also had a heated argument with officials during the visit of STF chief.Sabharwal said that all the councillors will be involved in the process and he will conduct a meeting in this regard in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-stf-chief-inspects-micro-forests-alongside-buddha-nullah/story-42v4EYgVWCCofbRijbeLVL.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Power to streetlights snapped in four villages in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh electricity department has snapped power supply to streetlights in four villages under the municipal corporation’s jurisdiction.The action came on Monday night after the civic body failed to clear unpaid electricity bills worth ₹4.3 lakh. The affected villages are Dhanas, Sarangpur, Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, all located on the northern periphery of the city. The department is contemplating similar action in other villages if the MC continues to default of pending bills.“There is total darkness on the streets as night has descended,” said Kuljeet Singh Sandhu, former sarpanch of Dhanas, on Tuesday. “As there is no beat box here, I have called up police and requested them to intensify night patrolling in the village, as we fear an increase in thefts and other street crimes.” All electricity connections are in the name of the village sarpanch/block development and panchayat officer. Sarangpur village owes ₹1.47 lakh, followed by Khuda Lahora (₹1.04 lakh), Khuda Jassu (₹94,000), and Dhanas (₹83,481). Villagers complained that they were being victimised even though they had no role in paying the bills. “The villages came under the MC’s jurisdiction in January 2019, and the panchayat authority ended on December 31, 2018. The MC took over all revenue generation avenues (such as commercial properties and community centres) in the villages. It is now its responsibility to pay for public utilities,” said Sadhu Singh, former sarpanch, Sarangpur. What officials sayStating that they were left with no option, CD Sangwan, superintending engineer, UT electricity department, said: “We had been postponing the action as we didn’t want locals to suffer. But with the MC failing to respond to repeated notices for unpaid bills, we decided to snap power to streetlights in some areas only. Other divisions haven’t done it so far.” MC officials contended that most of the unpaid bills were from the time it had no jurisdiction over villages. Assuring that the civic body is working on restoring the supply, MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said: “We are getting the details and we will resolve the issue as early as possible.” Meanwhile, Devinder Singh Babla of the Congress, who is the leader of opposition in MC House, blamed the lack of coordination between the civic body and UT administration for the problem. “It is shameful that because of lapses on behalf of MC officials, the UT electricity department is making village residents suffer.” AAP chief spokesperson Nitin Goyal, in a letter to the MC commissioner has demanded: “Pay compensation to each household of the affected villages, which should be recovered from officials found responsible in the departmental inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/power-to-streetlights-snapped-in-four-villages-in-chandigarh/story-0UdvmTAgmQH7GMKUxdg5LM.html

Chahal on Tuesday also ordered BMC officials to immediately start the necessary process for the installation of hoardings at properties owned by the civic body.BMC has also asked staff members to ensure proper usage of masks by citizens, wherein their mouth and nose are properly covered. Chahal in a video conference last week had mentioned, “I see many citizens do not wear masks or those who wear masks have it on their chin. This does not help to control the spread of Covid-19. People have to ensure the wearing of masks and also to ensure they wear it properly.”Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “The arrival of the vaccine may take one more year, and citizens will have to wear masks and maintain social distancing along with hand hygiene to stop the spread of Covid-19.”Meanwhile, BMC has collected over ₹52 lakh in fines from over 14,200 citizens, for not wearing masks. Maximum action has been taken in the last two months, after it was made mandatory by BMC to wear masks in public on April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-mask-no-entry-on-mumbai-s-public-transport-bmc-chief-issues-covid-regulation/story-uNRcVAytrlhK0ClcodXWwI.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC directs north corporation to clear pending wages of all teachers at earliest||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that with Diwali approaching, no employee of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation should be deprived of the joy of festivity, while asking the municipal body to disburse pending salaries of 9,000 teachers engaged by the civic body.“Don’t forget the festival of Diwali is round the corner. We will not allow you to deprive any employee of that little joy of festivity,” a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said, adding that many people are already heartbroken and under depression due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The court’s observation comes while hearing a suo-motu PIL initiated by itself for the disbursement of unpaid salaries to teachers employed in schools run by the north Delhi corporation. The plea was initiated as a PIL in June after hearing a petition filed on behalf of North Delhi Municipal Corporation teachers by Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh. The Shikshak Sangh sought direction to the authorities to pay salaries of teachers which were due since March, when a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 was imposed.On Tuesday, during the hearing, the corporation told the court that on September 8, the civic body had released salaries of June to its teachers.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel said that it has released Rs 98.35 crore to the north corporation on September 3 and the amount will cover the salaries of teachers for September and October.The court asked the civic agency to disburse the salaries of teachers for the pending months. To this, the counsel for the municipal body said that he would seek instructions as to whether the civic body has received the amount from the Delhi government and that they are working on the issue of releasing salaries.The court asked the civic body to file a status report in this regard and listed the matter for further hearing on November 5.North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that the civic body is working on a three-pronged formula to be able to pay the due salaries of the staff. “We are making efforts to boast our revenue through an amnesty scheme for unauthorised regularised colonies. We are also in the process of clearing some major projects that will fetch us some decent amount of revenue. Thirdly, we have already written to the Delhi government to release the ₹ 1200 crores due to the corporation at the earliest. With all these efforts, we will ensure that the staff’s salaries are regularised by Diwali,” said Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-directs-north-corporation-to-clear-pending-wages-of-all-teachers-at-earliest/story-dO1iNcSi7VxmkwxperVqHN.html
29-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER modifies ‘on duty’ order for quarantined healthcare workers||Modifying its earlier order for treating the quarantine period of the doctors and healthcare workers on Covid-19 duties as ‘on duty’, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has now ordered that any employee who had come in contact with Covid positive employees or patients during duty will also be treated ‘on duty’ if they are advised to quarantine. “Those employees who came in contact with Covid positive employees and patients during the course of duty and are labelled as high risk and advised quarantine, for such period of quarantine may be treated as ‘on duty’,” the modified order stated. However, in such cases, the applicants should formally inform their controlling officer in writing and give supporting documents to show that they were directed to go into quarantine by the Hospital Infection Control team, epidemiologist of the institute, or in charge of the concerned Covid centre. The earlier order in this regard stated that the doctors and healthcare workers on Covid-19 duties who undergo quarantine will be treated as on duty but didn’t specify anything about the employees not on COVID-19 duty. Aswani Munjal, president, PGI employee union, said that it is a corrective step taken by the administration after their writing several requests to them. “Employees whose relatives within the hospital had tested positive were reporting to duties majorly because of the lack of such measures by the institute. Now, if someone has close contact who has tested positive can undergo quarantine without worrying about the leaves,” he said. The issue of ‘poor’ risk management had earlier brought the unions and the administration at loggerheads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-modifies-on-duty-order-for-quarantined-healthcare-workers/story-IQww89hZtpMu301XmrDhPM.html
29-09-2020||City||DU teachers move high court seeking pending salaries||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the response of four Delhi University colleges on a petition by teachers, who wanted a direction to those institutions affiliated to the university and fully funded by the Delhi government, to release their salaries pending for the last four months.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked the authorities of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhagini Nivedita College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies to file their status reports on the petition.The court also sought the response of the Delhi government and Delhi University to the plea and listed the matter for further hearing on November 4.Initially, the plea was filed against 12 colleges over non-payment salaries. However, the court deleted eight names from the memo of parties as two of the colleges have paid salaries to the staff till August and no employee from the rest of the six colleges have approached the court with their grievances.The 12 colleges mentioned in the plea are Acharya Narendra Dev College, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, Bhagini Nivedita College, DeenDayal Upadhyaya College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College, Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education & Sports Sciences, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Maharaja Agrasen College (DU), Maharshi Valmiki College of Education, Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies.Advocate Ashok Agarwal, who is appearing for eight teachers, argued that the Delhi government was punishing 2,000 families without any fault and that it should immediately release grants to colleges to enable them to pay the salaries of employees.In the plea, the teachers contended that they had not received their salaries for the months of May, June, July and August. The teachers said they are members of the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA), which on behalf of the aggrieved staff has been writing to the Delhi government to release funds to enable the 12 DU colleges, funded by the state government, to pay pending salaries to 1,500 teachers and non-teaching staff working there.The plea said due to non-payment of salaries to the teachers, they and all other employees working with these colleges are undergoing mental agony and harassment.It sought the direction to the authorities to pay salaries to the petitioners due from May this year to date and also ensure timely payment of salaries in the future.DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “The Delhi government should release the grants. Even if special audits are being conducted based on allegations of financial irregularities, salaries of staff should not be withheld. There is no rule which says so.”The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.On September 16, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had spoken of surplus funds in at least four of the 12 government-funded colleges based on an initial observation report by the auditors following a special audit. The colleges contested the claim, saying students society fund cannot be used for salary purposes.The Delhi government has been at the loggerheads with 12 DU colleges, which it fully funds, over the release of grants for the last six months. While the principals allege they have not been able to pay their staff since May as grants have not been issued, the Delhi government says with enough funds have been provided in the present academic year. The government has also ordered an independent audit in six of the 12 colleges over alleged “misappropriation” of funds, which triggered a fresh round of war of words.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-teachers-move-high-court-seeking-pending-salaries/story-PDFZcI9YK7p0af75dhEcRM.html
29-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: Controversy over farm bills merely a distraction, says BJP state president||A day after chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh expressed fears over the controversial farm laws having a detrimental impact on the security situation of the state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president, Ashwani Sharma, accused the CM of using the protests to deviate the attention of the people from the failures of his government.“Be it the worsening Covid situation or the death of innocent men in hooch tragedy, the ration scam or the scholarship scam, Captain’s government has failed on every front. In order to divert attention from the real issues, he has beguiled innocent famers and triggered protests against the Union government,” said Sharma.Targeting Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, Sharma said, “We honoured the Akali Dal as alliance partner. Sukhbir Badal even supported the farmer bills and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal even gave interviews in favour of them. Now both of them are saying the provisions in the bills were not discussed with them,” said Sharma.On farm bills, Sharma said, “We will not touch the established system of procurement. We have just provided another option to the farmers to sell their produce at a premium. The decision is being projected as harsh to cash in on the farmer vote bank, but these new laws are going to help farmers in the long run.”He added that a committee of BJP leaders had been formed to speak to the farmers about the new bills and their benefits.“When this ordinance was introduced, I had personally visited the farmer union leaders to assure that MSP and mandi system will stay put. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s objective is to uplift the social stature of farmers and double their income,” he said.Meanwhile, SAD worker Ravinder Verma along with former DPRO Gurdev Singh and his supporters joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-controversy-over-farm-bills-merely-a-distraction-says-bjp-state-president/story-YokPMksyGoQ0AmgzyRtBpI.html

The deceased was identified as Shiv Kumar, resident of Durga Puri. He had been working at the factory, Highway Industries, for the past several years. His co-workers and family members alleged that he was not given timely medical attention, which caused his death. Police said Kumar was working in the night shift on Monday when the accident took place.According to a co-worker, Kumar was working on a dye machine, when it suddenly exploded, leaving him severely injured. Other workers raised the alarm, following which Kumar was taken to the dispensary inside the factory. He was initially given only first aid, but his condition kept deteriorating. Later, he was taken to the ESIC Hospital, where he died during treatment. On Tuesday, Kumar’s co-workers observed a strike, seeking relief for the kin of the deceased and job for Kumar’s son. His family workers also reached the factory, demanding compensation, following which the Focal Point police reached the spot and tried to pacify them.Inspector Mohammad Jameel, station house officer (SHO), Focal Point police station, said as per preliminary investigation, the accident occurred when the worker put dye in a machine’s power pressure. The explosion was caused either due to some misalignment in the machine or due to Kumar putting the wrong dye in it. After the strike by the family and co-workers of Kumar, a compromise was reached with the factory owner. Therefore, no case was registered, the inspector said.WAS SOLE BREADWINNER OF FAMILY OF FOURKumar’s wife Sunita Devi said her husband was the lone bread winner of the family, comprising their two sons, aged 19 and 18. Her elder son was disabled.

If for some reason, the sarpanch was reluctant to do so, 20% of the village voters could sign and convene a session through the block development and panchayat officer.Mann appealed to all the sarpanches of Punjab to rise above party politics and convene gram sabhas in their respective villages to oppose the black laws. A few such meetings were being organised in Sangrur on Wednesday, he added.Punjab AAP in-charge Jarnail Singh said a helpline number will be launched to facilitate those seeking to gather requisite information in this regard.‘Badals back-stabbed farmers’Mann said that the Badals had back-stabbed the farmers by advocating in favour of the anti-agriculture laws, and were now hell bent on playing politics to torpedo the farmers’ struggle with nefarious designs to breaking the mobilisation.The chief minister, Mann said, was committing to a legal battle against the farmer laws, saying he would go to any extent to get them tweaked at all costs, but “the ground reality is that both the CM and Badal are trying to deceive the farmers as they both played a pivotal role in the passage of those laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-launches-gram-sabha-bulao-pind-bachao-in-ludhiana/story-y18q4t85jALXq7w4PqKDHK.html

The BJP now claims the support of an independent councillor, Parvinder Kaur.ALSO READ: Political dynamics in Ludhiana set to change as SAD, BJP go separate waysWhile the Congress party holds a majority in the MC General House with 64 councillors, followed by SAD and BJP, the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) comes in fourth with seven councillors.

Norms dictate that the votes of independent councillors don’t count in total tally. We have asked the mayor to take legal opinion if BJP makes any claim to the seat of leader of opposition.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu confirmed this and reiterated that legal opinion will indeed be sought over the issue should such a situation arise.BJP district president Pushpinder Singal, however, said the party had not made any claim to the position of the leader of opposition, yet. “We have not made any claims over the tag, but an independent vote will be counted as BJP’s vote since the councillor has extended support to the party from the onset.

The police had claimed that Nakul had died in the accident, however, the victim’s kin accused the eatery workers of beating him to death.According to Karan, he and Arjun had been on one bike, and Nakul on another bike during the chase. Near Samrala Chowk, Nakul’s bike had rammed into a truck.He alleged that Nakul had died because the accused had brutally beaten him while he was lying on the road after the crash, and not because of the crash itself.ALSO READ: 19-year-old killed after chase ends in crashHarish Kumar, the maternal uncle of the deceased, alleged that the police had shown them the CCTV footage only till the time Nakul’s bike collided with the truck.

29-09-2020||City||Himachal CID to start an awareness campaign on crimes against women and children||The Himachal Pradesh Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will be organising an awareness campaign on crimes against women and children across the state.The campaign will include awareness messages on All India Radio, local news channels and HP Police website; lectures/discussions in educational institutions; SMS campaign; poster-making and organising skits, essays, debates and painting competitions. The vulnerable sections of the society will also be apprised about the legal provisions in the aforesaid matter through Mahila Mandals and Anganwadi workers.Additional director general of police (CID) N Venugopal said there is no doubt that such crimes show the sick mindset of the offenders, which creates an atmosphere of fear and insecurity among children and women in the society, thus there is an urgent need to create mass awareness on the matter.“Women and children need to be sensitised about the impending risk to their modesty at the hands of friends, relatives or others, and early detection of warning signals relating to advances or inappropriate gestures,” he added.The CID has also sought active assistance and co-operation from the state social justice and empowerment department and the women and child development directorate to achieve the desired results.Venugopal said since the CID has no earmarked funds for the purpose, the department has urged the additional chief secretary, social justice and empowerment department and director of women and child development to provide monetary assistance of ₹3,00,000 for meeting the expenses of the awareness campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-cid-to-start-an-awareness-campaign-on-crimes-against-women-and-children/story-YoSEnsfhHaxWPWnvW6GfVM.html

Dr Harsh Vardhan also apprised the NC chief about the steps being taken in this direction.Farooq hoped that the health services would be upgraded on war-footing in Jammu and Kashmir in general and in the areas which lack facilities in particular.“This is not the time to review and assess the situation, but supplies need to be replenished and an emergency plan formulated to contain the spread of the virus,” he added.Till Monday, the UT recorded a cumulative count of 73,014 Covid cases and 1,146 deaths related to it. Jammu district has been witnessing an alarming increase in these numbers, while the hospitals in the region lack basic facilities like oxygen and ventilators for the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farooq-takes-up-jammu-s-crumbling-health-infra-with-centre/story-Zm2sdgCa4VZS06cokL3zVJ.html
29-09-2020||City||Army recruitment rally: J&K Cong seeks extension of registration dates||Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma on Tuesday urged the army authorities to extend the date of online registration for the upcoming recruitment rally.The recruitment fair is scheduled to be held for six districts from December 11 to 22 at ALG, Rajouri.“The online registration was opened during lockdown in April, which is a joke, as it has deprived most of the eligible unemployed youth from applying due to 2G mobile internet services in the region and complete lockdown,” he said in a statement issued here.Sharma was reacting to the representation of a number unemployed youth and their parents, from far-flung districts, who alleged that the army authorities sought online registration during the period of lockdown as the last date was fixed as April 21.He has sought the extension of date for online registration besides holding district-wise rally instead of inviting youth from six districts to Rajouri during the Covid pandemic.He hoped that the army and defence ministry would take appropriate decisions in the interest of the eligible youth.However, a defence official said last year over 44,000 youth had turned at the Samba rally and another 27,000 had participated in a similar rally in Reasi. “At that time too we had 2G network. In the ensuing rally, the youth were given adequate time to apply. However, the issue can be considered in view of Covid pandemic and subsequent restrictions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/army-recruitment-rally-j-k-cong-seeks-extension-of-registration-dates/story-iFofcHjXr4DgwGYZIGZpCO.html

Addressing a press conference, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said, “The university has asked PhD scholars to request for a 9B extension by September 30. The application requires submission of 90% of the PhD draft. However, many students have not been able to access the internet, library or labs and research material due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.” She called for an extension of the deadline.The students’ union also said despite letters, protests, and representations, the university had not initiated any plan to allow a phased-wise return of students to the campus. The Unlock 4.0 guidelines had allowed for a partial reopening of universities for research scholars and post-graduate students of technical and professional programmes requiring laboratory or experimental works. JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar said 9B rules have to be followed. “If students get the 9B extension, they have to submit their thesis by June 2021. If they haven’t finished 90% of their work till now, how can they submit their thesis by then? Students can opt to deregister themselves and then finish their work.” On JNUSU’s demand for a phased return, Kumar said, “We don’t have isolation or quarantine facilities on our campus. The hostels have shared washrooms and common areas. The Covid-19 disease is still spreading. Who will take responsibility if more people fall sick once we allow students to come back to campus?” The students’ body alleged mismanagement in the upcoming JNU entrance exams scheduled to be conducted from October 5-8 by the National Testing Agency (NTA), saying the schedule of the tests clashed with other exams. They said students may face issues in reaching the examination centre due to lack of transport facilities and called for a postponement of the examsKumar said the NTA, which is conducting other examinations as well, prepares the entrance exam schedule. “They have to manage the schedule accordingly and ensure all exams are conducted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnusu-demands-return-of-students-to-campus-in-a-phased-manner/story-GXQHCxmI7piR1aQmVarGFO.html

It is prohibited to use firecrackers within the territorial jurisdiction of Srinagar district,” a police spokesperson said.Shah could not be contacted for his reaction.The police said they have not yet arrested him owing to his upcoming ‘Firsal’— a ceremony during which the groom’s in-laws invite the couple and close family members for dinner after two-three days of marriage.“We summoned him on Tuesday, but his elders said he will come to the police station after ‘Firsal’ which we allowed,” said Batmaloo station house officer Manzoor Ahmad.Ahmad said Shah’s mistake was that firecrackers were burst during the night.“The deputy commissioner has banned any fireworks in Srinagar, whatever the occasion. Nobody is allowed to do it as people unnecessarily get alarmed,” he said.He said firecrackers during the night create confusion. “When there is a bang during the night it causes fear among people as to what happened, besides disturbing their sleep,” he said.The police urged people not to use firecrackers anywhere within the territorial jurisdiction of Srinagar district.On September 17, an encounter had raged between militants and security forces in Batmaloo in the night in which three militants were killed. A woman had also died in the crossfire. This year, Srinagar has witnessed at-least seven gunfights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/groom-booked-for-bursting-firecrackers-at-wedding-in-srinagar/story-k28la2J2HxwNbCHYiIL4uO.html

Private hospitals have recorded 182 deaths; 109 deaths (28%) in government hospitals; 19 in military hospitals and 68 during treatment from hospitals outside the district. Three people died on way to hospital. Twelve patients are on ventilator. Jalandhar is the second-worst district in the state with 381 deaths and 12,742 cases till Monday evening. The number of deaths at private hospitals has seen a spurt over the past month as previously, most such hospitals referred patients in acritical stage to the civil hospital. In August, however, deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori issued an order barring private hospitals from indulging in this practice. Jalandhar is the only district in the state where the civil hospital has level-3 beds (for critical patients) and the other required equipment to deal with such a situation. Treatment is expensive in private hospitals, while the civil hospital offers it free of cost, yet many prefer to go to private hospitals, said officials.“The district has reported an average of eight deaths per day for the past week, of which five-six cases are from private hospitals. Patients arrive late to hospitals for treatment, and most of those put on ventilators could not survive,” said an officer. Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) estate officer Navneet Kaur Bal who has been appointed as a covid patient tracking officer to minimise the fatality rate said they will run a campaign on the lines of the pulse polio drive to motivate people to report to hospital with fever or flu, and get tested for covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/half-of-jalandhar-s-covid-19-deaths-reported-from-private-hospitals/story-2Hkq2mDzhMw3DQQLJdcKIN.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sees driest September in 50 years||Chandigarh this year has witnessed the driest September in the past half-century, as per data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This comes with the forecast of no rain on the last day of this month and monsoon withdrawal likely to be declared by Thursday (October 1).With only 6.1mm rain throughout the month, which is considered the last of the four months that comprise the monsoon season, this is the lowest recorded in September since 1970, for which data was readily available with the IMD, Chandigarh. Before 2020, the lowest amount of rainfall in September was recorded in 1981 (12.8mm). Throwing light on reasons behind the month being so dry, IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said: “There were no winds coming from over the Bay of Bengal, due to which there was no rainfall. The monsoon trough was also positioned in other parts of India, and northwestern region as a whole got lesser rain.” During the withdrawal period, too, rain was expected in the region, but since there were no active western disturbances, no rain was recorded.The normal rain for September (average of the past 30 years) is 144.4 mm. With only 6.1mm rain this time, the month is 96% rain deficient. Monsoon 9% surplus, withdrawal likely by tomorrowOverall, the monsoon has been 9% surplus with 920.3mm rain received from June to September, as compared to a normal of 845.7mm. The city received more rainfall owing to its location on the foothills of the Himalayas, while it mostly remained on the lower side at other stations in the region, said the weatherman.While monsoon withdrawal has already started in western parts of Punjab, Paul said it is likely to happen in the city by Thursday, and will be followed by an anti-cyclonic movement developing over the region that will keep the weather dry in the coming days. Meanwhile, at 34.3°C, maximum temperature remained unchanged between Monday and Tuesday, while the minimum too went up just slightly from 20.6°C to 20.7°C. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain around 35°C while minimum is likely to stay around 20°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sees-driest-september-in-50-years/story-Iyh6zWdT8C9ZCPOd00VxeK.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||10 farm fires detected in Fatehabad over 3 days||The Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC) satellite has captured 10 farm fires in six Fatehabad villages over the last three days.Fatehabad deputy director (agriculture) Rajesh Sihag said, “HARSAC imagery indicates 10 instances of stubble burning in six villages of the district over the last three days. Fires were detected in Dhangar, Badhai Khera, Loha Khera, Samain, Chando Kalan and Jamalpur villages.”“We will send a team to inspect the fields where the fires were detected. Action will be taken against defaulting farmers,” Sihag said, adding that paddy harvesting had started at a few places and will gather pace in the first and second week of October and as such it was likely that more farmers will burn stubble in the district and state.A farmer, Satpal Singh of Fatehabad’s Jamalpur, said, “Farmers have no other option as the government is not providing us with the ₹100-per-quintal incentive for not burning stubble as directed by the Supreme Court last year.”“Most farmers cannot afford to purchase equipment required to clear fields for the rabi season. However, instead of assisting farmers, officials issue show-cause notices and impose fines,” he added.As per government data, in 2019, stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab had contributed to 44% of the pollution in the National Capital Region. Stubble burning is responsible for around 18%-40% of particulate matter in the air in the northern plains, say experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/10-farm-fires-detected-in-fatehabad-over-3-days/story-WbSeVuwTOYyv9X8FmoCqdI.html

29-09-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka bypoll a huge test for Cong’s DK Shivakumar and JDS’ HD Kumaraswamy||With the Election Commission announcing bypolls for two seats in Karnataka – Sira in Tumkur and Raja Rajeshwari Nagar (RR Nagar) seat in Bengaluru – it is the opposition Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress than the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that is trying to make a mark.The Sira seat became vacant after sitting JDS legislator B Sathyanarayana died due to novel coronavirus on 5 August. In the 2018 assembly elections, the RR Nagar constituency was won by Munirathna Naidu of Congress but he later switched over to the BJP.Ironically it was the then BJP candidate Tulsi Muniraju Gowda who went to court challenging Naidu’s election alleging he had created fake voter ID cards. The EC had subsequently declared Naidu’s election as null and void. With the ruling BJP having 117 seats in the 225-member assembly (including one nominated member) plus the support of two of the three independents, it is comfortably placed with a clear, simple majority. However it is the opposition parties who have a point to prove in the bypolls.DK Shivakumar, who was appointed as the Karnataka Congress president in March this year, is keen to prove that under his leadership, the party would be able to take on the BJP.For the JDS, it is a question of survival as both seats are Vokkaliga dominated and the party is traditionally seen to represent the interests of this community. It is also an electoral tussle between JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy and DK Shivakumar on who will be seen as the real Vokkaliga leader as both belong to the community.Kumaraswamy had recently acknowledged that the Sira seat would be a test, even as he swatted away rumours of increasing proximity to BJP. “We will win Sira,” Kumaraswamy had said on September 12 after holding a meeting of workers from the constituency.However, a senior JDS leader who did not want to be identified, said the party faces an uphill task. Due to age and health-related issues even before coronavirus claimed his life, Sathyanaryana was not very active in the constituency “so even if we give a ticket to one of his family members to encash the sympathy, it might not work. Also remember, even our party’s tallest leader Deve Gowda was defeated in Tumkur in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll.” Sira is an assembly constituency under Tumkur Lok Sabha seat.Both Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy will be in Sira on Wednesday to decide on their candidate and strategy.The Congress has already named former minister TB Jayachandra who had lost the previous assembly polls as its candidate. Karnataka president DK Shivakumar had declared on 17 September that ‘Jayachandra is the unanimous choice of workers and leaders from the constituency. He has won six assembly polls in the past. I am confident we will win the seat again.”The BJP, which is the third player in the constituency, is likely to field either SR Gowda or BK Manjunath. Both are party workers. In the RR Nagar seat, the BJP is likely to give Congress turncoat Munirathna Naidu the ticket, while Congress and JDS may field fresh faces. The parties are all in a huddle on finalising names of candidates except in Sira where Congress has already declared Jayachandra’s name.Political analyst Manjunath commenting on the bypoll prospects said “The ruling party has other challenges such as cabinet expansion and eventual replacement of Yediyurappa. The BJP will also be more concerned about winning the four legislative council seats for which elections have been announced as they lack a majority in the upper house. It is the JDS and Congress who are both out to prove a point in the assembly polls. While all the three will obviously try to win, it is the JDS which has the most to lose in case it does now win either of the assembly seats.”Election Commission has also announced polls for four graduates and teachers constituency for the Karnataka Legislative Council for which voting will happen on October 28. For the two assembly constituencies, voting will happen on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bypoll-a-huge-test-for-cong-s-dk-shivakumar-and-jds-hd-kumaraswamy/story-zhHNHeKQdDFFR30cgcyNeK.html
29-09-2020||Pune||Pune restaurant owners relieved as govt allows dine-in facility||Restaurant owners in the city have heaved a sigh of relief as the state government has agreed to allow restaurants to operate from the first week of October.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray made the promise to a delegation of restaurant owners from Pune during an online meeting.“Today we had a fruitful zoom meeting with the chief minister and his team regarding the reopening of dine-in facilities in restaurants. He has assured us that the restaurants will reopen in the first week of October,” said Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRHA).“We will be allowing 50 per cent of dine-in facility with 50 per cent staff. To operate at 50% will be a bit difficult for business, but its important to resume dine-in service. Also, the standard operating procedure (SOPs) issued by the chief minister’s office will have to be followed by the restaurants to ensure the safety of its patrons,” said Shetty.“CM has also assured that the excise license fees will be revised on pro-rata basis against the balance operational months of the year 2020-21,”he said.Pune has at least 8,700 big and small restaurants which are eager to start the business as in the last six month, they have suffered losses. As many as 20 per cent restaurants have shut business due to losses.Since June 1, the state government had allowed only take away service at restaurants.“We also need to check the response of the customers which will give us the idea of how to progress ahead with the business,” added Shetty.“It will be a blessing for us as take away business is not giving us a good profit. People love to eat food in a restaurant ambience and profit will definitely increase,” said Rakesh Patil, owner of Devika Seafood restaurant, Thergaon.Staff crunchWith most of the employees which have gone back to their hometowns, restaurants may face staff crunch time while restarting the dine-in facility.“We will be operating with 50 per cent staff. So restaurants who have employed locals will not have a problem. Most of the staff will be coming back and our strength will improve gradually. Same is the case with waiters and once the business gets going things will fall in place,” added Shetty.Food courts gear up to resume businessMall owners in the city have welcomed the assurance of the chief minister as food courts are one of the major attractions in the city.“It is good news. I want to thank the government finally for taking the decision as since the last six months it was closed. People who were associated with this industry like chefs, helpers, waiters, suppliers and vendors all were impacted badly and it will be a big relief for all of them,” said Arun Arora, centre director, Phoenix Marketcity.“I am sure with this start all the staff who have gone to native places will return back. The business will revive gradually and once the government is confident that all restaurants are safe then there will be definitely more relaxations than the current permission of 50 per cent,” added Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/to-operate-at-50-is-difficult-but-important-to-resume-dine-in-service-shetty/story-M8zfMRcUG6iH9xPT7PHguN.html
29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Capt Amarinder to fight farm laws on all fronts||Extending his government’s support to agitating farmers in this “aukhi ghari (difficult time)”, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday assured them of all possible legal and other help to fight the new farm laws, including a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss and decide the way forward. Chairing a meeting with representatives of 31 farmer unions to take their views on the matter, the chief minister said he would be discussing the issue with his legal team to finalise the line of action, including challenging farm laws in the Supreme Court. Besides farmer representatives, the AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, attended the meeting, along with cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLA Rana Gurjit Singh, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and advocate general Atul Nanda. “We will take all possible steps to counter the Union government’s assault on the state’s federal and constitutional rights, and fight for the interest of the farmers,” Captain Amarinder Singh told the farmers. If legal experts advise amendment to the state laws to fight the central laws, a special session of the Vidhan Sabha will be called to do so, he said. He, however, trashed Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s demand for a special Vidhan Sabha session as “cheap gimmickry” after supporting the central laws for months. “Where were the Akalis in the last session and why did Sukhbir not support the other parties at the all-party meeting?” he said. He said the Akalis, led by Sukhbir, had been supporting the farm ordinances throughout and had only backed out once their position in Punjab became untenable amid widespread angst among farmers. “If they were so concerned about the farmers’ interests, why did Harsimrat Kaur Badal not resign from the Union Cabinet the moment the farm ordinances were brought in by the Centre?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-capt-amarinder-to-fight-farm-laws-on-all-fronts/story-uvkY4EfYLVKwPhGYCucWXP.html

29-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 cases higher, but deaths a third compared to June: Delhi health minister||Even with a higher number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, fewer deaths have been reported as compared to June when Delhi had previously seen a surge in cases, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said in an interaction with the media on Tuesday. “If you look at the number of cases, it is comparatively much higher than... during the surge in June. The number of deaths is less than one-third than what was recorded then,” he said, on being asked about the 10-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) crossing the 1% mark. CFR is the proportion of people who die of Covid-19 among those who have tested positive for the infection. The 10-day CFR stood at 1.07% as per Monday’s health bulletin; lower than the cumulative CFR of 1.93%—calculated based on the total number of cases and deaths reported in the city so far. Also Read: Coronavirus: As Covid-19 deaths hit 1 million, scientist says toll may be doubleThe highest number of deaths recorded in a day during the surge in cases in September was 46. In comparison, the highest number of deaths recorded in a day during the June surge was 101, as per data shared by the chief minister’s office. The data shows that on average over 77 deaths—somewhat skewed because of the reconciliation of 437 deaths on June 16—had been recorded between the second week of June and first week of July when there had been a surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi. In comparison, 32 deaths were reported each day on average between the second week of September and now. “Now, with an increase in testing, more cases are being detected early on and patients are being admitted to hospitals early in case they need further management. This could be one of the reasons for fewer deaths. Another reason could be the standard treatment protocols that are in place now,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung Hospital. Also Read: Covid-19: Serum Institute to produce additional 100 million vaccine dosesThe minister also said that the number of ICU beds in the city had been increased by 500 in private hospitals and 500 in government hospitals before the matter was challenged in the Delhi high court by an association of healthcare providers. “The court hasn’t given a judgement in the matter, there is a hearing on October 9. We are increasing ICU beds in government hospitals, but many people who come for treatment from outside the state want to go the private sector only,” said Jain. He also said over 10,000 RT-PCR tests were being conducted every day in Delhi and all symptomatic persons are being tested. The Centre had claimed that the city can administer up to 27,000 tests a day. The minister also hit out at the municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) over non-payment of salaries to doctors in their hospitals, calling them the “mafia” that earned crores of rupees but did not know how to manage finance. “This is what the MCD does every time. We have already given them the funds as per the tax collection that has happened this year. But the BJP is unable to run the MCD; they cannot manage finances. The building department is a mafia that earns thousands of crores,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-cases-higher-but-deaths-a-third-compared-to-june-delhi-health-minister/story-cu4evityFGw2KDSMaLC51I.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Court restrains people from ‘dragging’ Arbaaz Khan’s name||A Mumbai civil court has restrained Delhi-based media professional Sakshi Bhandari, lawyer Vibhor Anand and other unknown persons from posting comments linking actor Arbaaz Khan with the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and his former manager Disha Salian.The court order came on Monday. Khan had moved a defamation suit before the city civil court, Mumbai, last week against Bhandari, Anand and other unknown persons for dragging his name in the alleged conspiracy theory behind the deaths. Along with the defamation suit, he had also sought to restrain them from posting or publishing any comment against him in this regard and also sought direction that existing comments be withdrawn. The actor has also made all the social media networks and micro blogging sites -- Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Google -- where the contents alleging his involvement in the deaths were published, party to the suit. Soon after Rajput’s death on June 14, several conspiracy theories were floated; one of them being its link to Salian’s death on June 8. Another one alleged that Khan was involved in both the deaths. In their posts on several social media platforms, Anand and Bhandari also published the same, prompting Khan’s action. In their arguments, lawyers for social media companies claimed that they were wrongly added as parties to the suit. The court has granted them two weeks to submit their detailed reply. Meanwhile, till further hearing, the court also restrained Bhandari, Anand and any other person from posting any contents naming Khan in the conspiracy theories. The court has also asked the social media companies to take steps for withdrawal of the comments posted against Khan and his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-court-restrains-people-from-dragging-arbaaz-khan-s-name/story-6R0HXQt59XH4SSD4IwvuyN.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers’ protest clicks with virtual followers||The Punjab farmers’ agitation against the central laws aimed at liberalising the farm sector is not limited to rail and road blockades. It is finding resonance on social media too thanks to tech-savvy youngsters posting videos from protest sites, uploading interviews of leaders and sharing press coverage clippings. The social media platforms are updated daily for the past one week and are getting an encouraging response in terms of views, likes, shares and comments. “Punjab farmer rights’ associations are using cyberspace to build momentum for the movement against the central laws. It is probably for the first time that non-political organisations are using social media platforms in this manner,” says Rubal Kanozia, a media analyst and an assistant professor at Central University of Punjab, Bathinda. The Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugraha) and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, Punjab, which are at the forefront of opposing the farm laws on the ground have registered an increase in following over the past week. As on Tuesday, the BKU (Ekta-Ugraha) has more than 58,000 followers on its Facebook page that has been ‘liked’ by 45,000 users. The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee has a following of 59,000 Facebook users and the page has 30,000 ‘likes’. The BKU (Sidhupur) has 22,000 followers and its FB page has gained 19,000 ‘likes’. AGITATION ACCELERATES TRANSITION BKU (Ekta-Ugraha) working president Jaswinder Longowal said the need to focus on social media was felt over the past week. “Though village youngsters associated with farmer organisations had been asking us to tap social media but this agitation has accelerated our transition in these changing times of communication. We are working to strengthen our presence on new media,” Longowal said. Earlier this month, the association organised a nine-day round-the-clock dharna outside the residence of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in a Muktsar village to protest the farmer laws. Pinder Ghumman, a lawyer and farmer at Sangrur’s Gharachon village, is the man behind the Ugraha group’s FB page. It was earlier a personal account of Ghumman but now he has converted it into the official account of the Left-leaning union that has its presence in Mansa, Sangrur, Barnala and Bathinda districts. “I go to every important event of the agitation for a Facebook live. Sometimes, volunteers at far-off villages send us videos and photos of protests or any farmer-related issues. The application to make ours a verified page is still pending with Facebook,” he said. NEW MEDIA AND SELF-RELIANCE Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, Punjab, president Satnam Singh Pannu, who has been spearheading the rail blockade agitation and camping on a track in Ferozepur since September 24, said social media is needed for public outreach. “Volunteers such as Sukhwant Singh in Ferozepur are working tirelessly to share the dissent of Punjab’s farmers. Some of them are engaged in private jobs but they update our social media accounts during their spare time. Now even NRIs have started supporting our agitation and are offering financial support ,” said Pannu. A law student from Muktsar, Karan Singh Bhuttiwala, who is managing the FB page of the BKU’s Sidhupur faction said, “New media has made us self-reliant. We can raise our voice independently. We don’t need conventional media to communicate farmers’ issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-protest-clicks-with-virtual-followers/story-IgOSpZ7jF1tCPhxtYzn8LM.html

29-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre for status report on action taken in Rakul Preet’s plea against ‘media trial’||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file a status report as to the steps taken pursuant to its order of September 17 where it had directed the authorities to treat as a representation actor Rakul Preet Singh’s plea restraining media from reporting on her in connection with Rhea Chakraborty drug case.Justice Navin Chawla also issued notices to the authorities on the application seeking the response of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry among other respondents and posted the matter for further hearing on October 15.Chakraborty is at the centre of a controversy surrounding actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14.Singh’s application was filed in the main petition alleging a media trial against her in the case after she was reportedly named by Chakrabarty in a statement to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) authorities.CBI, NCB, and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are the three central agencies which are probing Rajput’s death.Singh’s counsel Aman Hingorani told the court that fake news was being peddled against her. He submitted that after he filed the main petition in the HC, media reports said that she was summoned by the NCB authorities on September 24.He said Singh was in Hyderabad and had not received any summons. He said that fake news was being peddled against his client, where she was accused of stocking up drugs. He said that TV news channels alleged that she was dodging the NCB authorities, even though she received the summons later. He claimed that Singh was losing out on the work front, as she was removed from films because of her alleged drug links. “My right to dignity, privacy, which is to be left alone, is being violated,” Singh’s petition stated .However, the court sought to know whether it could pass any order when none of the TV news channels was present. It said that the petitioner needed to furnish a grievance or a broadcast with which she was aggrieved.Rahul Bhatia, the counsel for News Broadcasters Association (NBA), the collective voice of the TV news channels, told the court that they have been receiving a lot of complaints, which are being looked into on a daily basis. The court asked Bhatia to file a status report in this regard.The court also sought to know from Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma about what actions were taken on its September 17 order, where it had asked to consider Singh’s plea of media trial as a representation.ASG Sharma told the court that the NBA was aware of the matter and the process was in progress. He said Singh was not an accused and she was being investigated. He said that any order by the court at this stage would affect the ongoing probe in the case.The court issued notice on the urgent plea seeking to ensure that the TV news channels were barred to broadcast any report on Singh’s links to the NCB probe in the Chakraborty drug case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-delhi-hc-asks-centre-for-status-report-on-action-taken-in-rakul-preet-s-plea-against-media-trial/story-JOqQkS8vticYdw988z6wgO.html

Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar announced last week that the state government would not implement the farm laws in the state. Revenue minister and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat has claimed that all the three ruling parties have opposed the bills and the issue will be discussed in a coordination meeting to stop implementation of the bills.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray hasn’t made a public comment on the row over the farm laws in recent days.

Our stance on the bills will be cleared soon,” the Sena functionary said..On Monday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked all Congress-ruled states to explore the possibility of enacting legislation under Article 254(2) of the Constitution to negate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government’s “anti-agricultural laws” and prevent “grave injustice” from being done to farmers.Also Read: Sonia Gandhi urges Congress-ruled states to override Centre’s farm lawsA senior Congress leader in Maharashtra said they were holding consultations within the party and with their alliance partners on the next steps. “We are consulting on the matter with the law and judicial department seeking legal opinion. It will be discussed in a coordination meeting of ruling parties,” said a Congress leader.The Centre had issued three ordinances in June this year, replacing them with three bills - Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - which were passed by the Parliament last week.Maharashtra marketing director Satish Soni had issued a circular on the basis of the ordinances on August 10 that asked district authorities and departments to implement the ordinances in letter and spirit.“As per the provisions in the ordinances, the farmers are free to market his produce at field, factory, warehouse or cold storage without any hindrance and without any market fee applicable under APMC Act. Any other fee or charges applicable under APMC Act cannot be charged now as per the provisions made in the ordinances. The law and judiciary department has vetted the ordinances and validated its applicability. Though the existence of the APMCs has not been affected by promulgation of the ordinance, the farmers will have a parallel mechanism to get fair prices for their produce. The market committees are expected to implement the provisions in the ordinances effectively,” the circular states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farm-laws-opposed-by-congress-ncp-present-new-dilemma-for-uddhav-thackeray/story-cwRNrMrb0LnJ5Z5lBwAqhL.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Maharashtra to consider restarting public transport in a planned manner||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state government to consider reopening public transport facilities in a planned manner in a bid to ensure that people from all walks of life get to earn their livelihood, who have been financially hit hard because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The court made the suggestion while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking permission for lawyers to attend lower courts. The court has asked the petitioner lawyers to share a one-page note of suggestions with the Maharashtra government in a bid to help it take a decision by October 5.The state authorities have been directed to inform the court about their decision on the next date of the hearing of the related pleas on October 6. Also Read: Maharashtra: Number of active Covid-19 cases continues to reduceThe bench held that court and lawyers have to ensure that they do not look after their own needs, but also of the other people, who are starving because they have been deprived of their means of livelihood due to the viral outbreak.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Chief Justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa was informed by senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe that the petition was seeking directions to the state government to consider advocates as essential service providers and permit them to travel by suburban trains to attend lower courts. However, government counsel Poornima Kantharia opposed the plea and cited that despite the travel restrictions the Covid-19 pandemic situation was going from bad to worse, as suburban train services were running packed during peak hours.The court heard the submissions and drew the attention of Dr Sathe to media reports, which stated that the government was considering allowing employees of private organisations to travel by suburban trains. “We understand that the local trains are packed but we have to look at the needs of other people, too, as they have lost their means of livelihood. We read a report, where a manager of a hotel had to work as a helper of a dumper truck to support himself,” said (CJ) Datta. Also Read: One million lives lost to Covid-19, writes WHO chief Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusThe bench suggested that the lower courts could start functioning from 2 pm, as the trains were packed during peak hours. The court said the move would allow the lawyers to travel by trains in the afternoon when they are running upto 50% capacity. “We have to think about ways to overcome the situation. We need to guard against what has happened in Kerala, where there has been a 126% rise in Covid-19 cases since the Onam celebrations,” observed CJ Datta.“Allowing only lawyers can be biased on our part. Why not the other sectors? We cannot only think of lawyers, but we have to think of people from other sectors as well. People, who are starving, after losing their jobs,” the bench further observed.The bench asked Dr Sathe and advocate Dr Uday Warunjikar, who appeared in a related matter, to submit a one-page suggestion such as looking at staggered timing of local courts. The bench further directed the state to consider the suggestions and if it found them prima facie acceptable to take a decision for permitting local train, bus and other modes of transport for travel for the public and file a reply to this effect on October 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-maharashtra-to-consider-restarting-public-transport-in-a-planned-manner/story-VAW9P53AHuVqWqh5FFtihI.html

They said he shot himself||Two policemen have been suspended and a FIR filed against them after a 38-year-old man arrested by them died of a gunshot injury on Sunday night. The policemen had claimed that Rajpati Kushwaha had shot himself from the service revolver of one of the two policemen. A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder was registered against the policemen after protests by residents of a town in Madhya Pradesh’s Vindhya region. Satna district police chief Riyaz Iqbal was also shunted out by the state government.The two policemen are Singhpur police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and constable Ashish Kumar, said Rewa zone inspector general (IG) of police Umesh Joga. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the transfer of the district Superintendent of Police and Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia for Rajpati Kushwaha’s family.Shivraj Singh Chouhan also said a magisterial inquiry had been ordered. “If any police personnel is found guilty in the inquiry the state government will not spare him and take strict action against him,” he said.“An FIR has been registered against the police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and constable Ashish Kumar under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 348 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Singhpur police station,” Rewa Umesh Joga said. The man had been detained for interrogation in a theft case.The action followed protests led by Congress legislator Siddharth Kushwaha in Satna district, about 500 km north east of Bhopal, who alleged the police had killed the man.Rajpati Kushwaha’s daughter, Shivani, said her father was being harassed for a long time. “He can’t kill himself because he was a brave person and told us that he would come back from the police station as he didn’t commit any crime,” the 18-year-old said.Senior police officer Umesh Joga said Rajpati was called for questioning after a burglary was reported by the former village head of Narayapur village. He had alleged that the thief had stolen jewellery and a licensed rifle. “The former sarpanch in his written complaint expressed his doubt about involvement of Rajpati and two others in the crime. Police had interrogated Rajpati once last week. On Sunday, he was called again for interrogation to the police station,” Umesh Joga said.“The SP Riyaz Iqbal informed me that during interrogation, Rajpati snatched the revolver of police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and shot himself in the forehead.

The company had promised discounts depending on the fee that a private school charges.

The deputy director of education department for the Mumbai region took cognisance of the complaint and issued a circular. “There is no such fee reduction scheme by the state/Central government for private schools as stated by the company. Parents are requested not to trust such companies and should not provide any details and documents to them,” the circular stated. Also Read: Teachers raise concerns over weekly report mandate by Maharashtra education departmentAnil Sabale, deputy director of the education for the Mumbai region, said, “We have uploaded the circular on our website and have also urged private schools and parents not to trust such schemes. The post, which is doing the rounds on social media, is claiming that the group has an association with the state government. It is fake information.” Parents are also wary of the fake promises made by the company. “Many parents have lost their money and have also given their documents. This is a risky business, especially at a time when parents are already struggling to pay their children’s school fees because of the contagion. We are planning to lodge a police complaint in this matter,” said a parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/do-not-fall-for-false-fee-reduction-claims-education-department-urges-parents/story-gmRRPv6ZfS4i838Emf9mlL.html

The active viral caseload has come down to 2,65,033 cases until Monday. Over the past 11 days, there was a reduction of 36,719 Covid-19 cases, a record since the viral outbreak was reported in the country’s worst-affected state around seven months ago.State health and family welfare department officials attributed the discernible trend to an appreciable dip in fresh infections in the past few days.Also Read: One million lives lost to Covid-19, writes WHO chief Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusActive cases are the difference between total number of Covid-19 cases and the patients, who have recovered from their viral infection, or some of those, who had succumbed to the contagion.

29-09-2020||Environment||Aerial images show coastal road reclamation far beyond requirement: Environmentalist to SC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has allegedly undertaken more land reclamation for a road project in Mumbai than it was supposed to and damaged the city’s coastline in violation of Supreme Court orders, an environmental group has told the top court. NGO Conservation Action Trust (CAT) on Monday filed an affidavit requesting the court to stop BMC from further reclamation.The affidavit cited a series of aerial images of the reclamation through mud and debris dumping and added it has gone far beyond what was required for the road.The Supreme Court in December 2019 put on hold the Bombay high court’s July 2019 order quashing coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearances to the civic body. It allowed the reclamation but restricted BMC from carrying out any other development work. “The petitioners are free to reclaim the land, build the road thereon, and secure the road. They shall however not carry out any other development work until further orders of this court,” the Supreme Court said.Also Read: Online public consultation to finalise coastal maps for Sindhudurg, Palghar in Maharashtra face oppositionCAT’s executive trustee, Debi Goenka, said the depth and the width of the reclamation demonstrated that the Supreme Court order has been allegedly ignored and caused irreparable damage to Mumbai’s coastline. “We have attached photographs along Priyadarshini Park, Cumbala Hill, and Breach Candy area all showing illegal reclamation.”“This excessive reclamation has already caused severe and irreversible harm to the Mumbai coastline, and remaining areas need to be protected urgently.”The Supreme Court will again hear the matter on Wednesday.BMC’s chief engineer (coastal road project), Niranjan Khanolkar, dismissed the allegations as baseless and insisted they have only reclaimed 52 ha of the approved 90 ha cleared under the CRZ since March in South Mumbai for the 9.9-km Rs 14,000-crore eight-lane road project. “While we have requested the SC [Supreme Court] and the Centre for approval to reclaim an additional 21 ha, it will only commence once we complete the first 90 ha followed by permissions from the Union environment ministry.”Goenka said BMC’s reclamation work was in violation of its submissions before the Supreme Court and conditions for CRZ clearance. “BMC had assured the SC that it would only commence reclamation after clearances under the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), which it does not have at the moment. Secondly, the CRZ clearance stipulated that no work could commence without wildlife clearance due to the presence of corals [protected under the WLPA) and other marine biodiversity.”BMC on September 3 applied for wildlife clearance and submitted a proposal to move 18 coral colonies for further reclamation.HT on September 21 reported the Maharashtra forest department has temporarily stalled the clearance until the clarification of specific details.Khanolkar said they have submitted all required documents and maps for the project and brought on record the proposed plan for coral translocation. “Our plan is to complete this translocation and commence with reclamation across ecologically-sensitive zones by mid-October.”Divisional forest officer (Mangrove Cell) DR Patil said they have received the revised list of documents from BMC and it will take them at least a week to examine the material, assess impacts, and make a recommendation. “Following this, the proposal will be vetted by the Mangrove Cell head and finally the chief wildlife warden in Nagpur. The process will take time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/aerial-images-show-coastal-road-reclamation-far-beyond-requirement-environmentalist-to-sc/story-wi5KOA5EIqa4Qc0AlbbuyN.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police sub-inspector on the run after killing father-in-law, woman friend||Delhi Police teams have conducted raids at five different locations in the national capital and neighbouring Haryana to nab sub-inspector (S-I), Sandeep Dahiya (35), who allegedly shot dead his father-in-law (62) in Rohtak’s Bhainsi village on Monday morning.Dahiya had also shot at his woman friend in a car at Alipur in outer Delhi over 12 hours before the Rohtak incident.“We have raided five places, but Dahiya is yet to be caught. Our teams are trying to nab him,” said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), (north district), Delhi Police. Also read: Woman found murdered in Delhi’s Mohan GardenDahiya, who is posted at north Delhi’s Lahori Gate police station, is in possession of his service pistol and cartridges that were issued to him on September 26. That was the last time he had reported for work and was assigned night patrolling duty from 9 pm. It is not yet clear, whether Dahiya allegedly used his service weapon in both the crimes. He was driving his car during the crimes and is on the run along with it, said the officers, who are investigating the cases. Besides Dahiya’s family members, who live in a Haryana village, the police have also questioned his three friends – one in the national capital and two in his native state – to get more leads about his whereabouts. One of the friends had last spoken to Dahiya on Sunday morning. The friend told the police that Dahiya had informed him that he would be coming to meet him in the afternoon, the officers said.“Dahiya’s mobile phone was last active at Shalimar Bagh in Delhi until 3 pm on Sunday, around the time he had left his residence along with the woman friend in his car. His mobile phone was switched off since then,” said an officer, who did not want to be named.Police said Dahiya shot at the woman friend around 5.30 pm at Alipur on Sunday following an argument they had in his car. The woman, who was shot thrice in her right shoulder and arm, is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Delhi.She has told the police that Dahiya was taking her to meet his family members, who live at Sisana village in Sonepat, Haryana. On the way, they had an altercation and Dahiya allegedly shot at her and fled, leaving her bleeding on the roadside. She was spotted and admitted to the hospital by another passerby policeman, the officer said. The woman has told the police that she was in a relationship with Dahiya for the past year. “Dahiya deactivated his social media account and dropped his parents to his native village on Saturday, a day before he shot at his woman friend. We suspect that Dahiya may have planned the crimes well in advance,” the officer added.While the Delhi police teams were looking for Dahiya, he reportedly drove to his in-laws’ house in Rohtak’s Bhainsi village and shot his father in-law, Ranbir Singh, dead on Monday morning. Dahiya’s wife, Rajesh Devi, said the incident took place at around 7 am when her father was cleaning the road outside their house. She told the police that she had moved back to the parents’ house four years ago following a marital discord. She also said that a case was pending in the local court in Rohtak district.Police officials said Dahiya had joined Delhi Police as a constable in 2006. In 2016, he was promoted an S-I after he cleared the departmental examination. “Dahiya has been in a marital dispute with his wife, who has filed a dowry harassment case against him in a police station in Rohtak. He had also faced a departmental enquiry,” said an officer, who knows Dahiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-sub-inspector-on-the-run-after-killing-father-in-law-woman-friend/story-mjSTbVRdnIqL1BhAw89sJO.html

This is a new drive started to facilitate the public, who had lost their belongings to various property-related crimes such as snatching, robbery, dacoity, theft, and burglary, but were not able to collect them despite recoveries from criminals because of the prevailing coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak that has led to the imposition of various restrictions, police officers said. SN Shrivastava, commissioner, Delhi Police, tweeted about the drive and said the list includes Rs 21.43 lakh and approximately 5 kg gold jewellery. Delhi Police began a drive to return stolen properties recovered from thieves/robbers connected to a crime to its rightful owner after permission from the court. The list includes 21.43 lakhs rupees, approx 5 kg gold jewellery and 5000 vehicles👇@LtGovDelhi @HMOIndia @PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/DEK1TV5RGBBetween June 1 and September 17, 6,478 people were benefited because of this new initiative, called “case property disposal melas” that are being periodically organised at all the 15 police districts and other units, where cases are registered and probed. Officials said that thousands of such articles were lying in malkhanas following their recovery as case properties. The owners of the properties were not able to get them back because the procedure needed approval from courts concerned, whose functioning has become restricted because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“While the recovered stolen items were piling up in police stations, their owners were also facing difficulties in claiming them. As a result, we decided to pursue the matter in courts. We collected details of the finalised cases in bulk, presented them before courts and took permission for releasing these items. The case property disposal fairs are organised and the items are being returned to their rightful owners,” the officer said. Among the 6,478 people benefited from the new scheme is Rajesh Kumar, an insurance advisor from south Delhi’s Khirki village, whose mobile phone was lost following a snatching incident in his neighbourhood on July 24. “I was worried, as my mobile phone contained several office-related data that could have been misused. But I am thankful to the police because they not only recovered my stolen phone but also returned it in less than a month under their new scheme. The process is smooth and people-friendly. This initiative should continue,” said Kumar. The list revealed that $120 US and £325 recovered stolen foreign currencies were also returned to the complainants, who had lost them. Of the 3,996 recovered stolen vehicles, 3,418 were two-wheelers, followed by four-wheelers (432) and auto- rickshaws (146). The list showed that 4.97 kg of gold jewellery items, five diamond jewellery and 113 silver jewellery items were returned to their rightful owners after they were recovered. Besides, 472 mobile phones and 2,243 other articles such as laptops, electronic gadgets, and household items were also returned following the permission of courts, said an official, who did not want to be named. So far, over a dozen melas have been organised in various police districts in the national capital, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-returns-rs-21-50-lakh-gold-phones-vehicles-in-recovered-property-to-the-public/story-SjfRYrqQA6pcdYXyUBWvhM.html

29-09-2020||City||Pak opens heavy fire in J&K’s Poonch; no loss of life, property||Pakistan opened heavy fire on Indian posts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Mankote sector of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday.India retaliated to the firing. Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “at about 0430 hours (4.30 am), Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation in Mankote sector. Initially, they fired with small arms and then switched to intense mortar shelling. Indian Army retaliated befittingly.”There was no loss of life or injury on the Indian side when reports last came in. Mankote sector lies in Mendhar sub division, one of the densely populated areas of Poonch district.Amid a protracted India-China stand-off in eastern Ladakh, Pakistan has also upped the ante along the 744-km-long LoC and 198-km-long international border. While ceasefire violations and infiltration bids have seen a quantum jump since nullification of Article 370 on August 5 last year, Pakistan has also adopted a new modus operandi to fuel terrorism with the use of drones to push arms, ammunition, narcotics and hawala money into Indian territory.From January 26 in Arnia sector of Jammu district to June 20, when an arms-laden drone was shot down by the Border Security Force (BSF) personnel at Rathua in Kathua district’s Hiranagar sector, at least seven such bids have been foiled by the Indian forces this year. On August 29, BSF had detected a trans-border tunnel in Samba sector that was being dug to push armed terrorists into J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pak-opens-heavy-fire-in-j-k-s-poonch-no-loss-of-life-property/story-EQlXYfj0dzdWXAScbKW7GP.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Over 50% violations in Mumbai reported from areas in western suburbs, southern part||Over 50% of the total cases of Mumbaikars levied fine for not wearing a mask in public places in the last six months have been reported from at least five locations in western suburbs and southern parts of the city, respectively. These locations also include areas that are currently under coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots.Borivali, Kandivali, Malad, Andheri are located in the westerb suburbs and Churchgate, Colaba, Marine Drive, Charni Road, Malad Hill and Chowpatty are situated in south Mumbai. Also read: 43 volunteers selected for Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine trial in MumbaiOn Sunday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities had said that it had fined 14,207 Mumbaikars in the city since April for not wearing a mask and collected Rs 52.76 lakh as fines for violating the rule. Fines worth Rs 19 lakh were collected from 9,218 defaulters between September 13 and 26 alone.The BMC had made it mandatory for Mumbaikars to wear a mask in public places since April 8. Earlier, the civic body used to levy fines ranging between Rs 200 to 1,000 for not wearing a mask in public places.However, the penalty amount was brought down to Rs 200 in early September.According to the data, six hotspots, which had reported 36% of Mumbai’s total viral case load, had also reported 32% of Mumbaikars, who were penalised for not wearing a mask. The list revealed that 1,084 cases of Mumbaikars did not wear a mask in Borivali, Kandivali (1,331), Jogeshwari West (891), Malad (551). Andheri West and Vile Parle East had reported 586 violations each.

Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC said, “We need to understand that the launch of a Covid-19 vaccine will take time. Under the circumstances, the best we can do is to comply with social distancing, wear a mask and maintain hygiene in a bid to prevent the spread of the contagion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hot-spot/story-2pf04x55IJ6c1K18qlY5VP.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hoteliers face an uphill task as govt allows reopening of hotels, restaurants||The Maharashtra government has indicated that hotels and restaurants would be allowed to reopen from the first week of October, despite the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country’s worst-affected state.However, hoteliers and restaurateurs are likely to face an uphill task in running their businesses because of a raft of factors.Hotels and restaurants will be allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity, as the state government has insisted on compliance with social distancing, an acute shortage of labourers, severe financial crisis coupled with panic about the Covid-19 pandemic among customers.Hoteliers and restaurateurs said though they would not make any profit, they were relieved about the gradual unlocking of restrictions in a bid to revive economic activities battered by the viral outbreak.Consider the case of Udupi Srikrishna Boarding, a reputed south Indian eatery in Matunga that can accommodate up to 79 customers. “We will be able to cater to a maximum of 40 customers at one go. Our business will be reduced to half,” said Satish Nayak, the owner of the outlet. Also Read: Restaurants in Maharashtra likely to reopen from first week of OctoberNayak said it would be impossible for hotels and restaurants to break even in such a restrictive environment. “There were no earnings in the past six months. This move will at least provide us to pay our overheads to some extent,” he added. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, director, Pritam Hotels, cited an acute crisis of labourers because many migrants to the city had returned to their respective native places during the Covid-19-induced 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions. “It will be a Herculean task to bring back migrant labourers from their native places because of a shortage of outstation trains,” said Kohli. “Besides, local employees live in far-off places and they are not being allowed to travel by suburban trains,” he added.Hoteliers plan to petition the state government to allow their employees to travel by suburban trains and treat them as part of essential services. Regular patrons to hotels and restaurants are wary of eating out because of an uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases in both Maharashtra and Mumbai.“We are still apprehensive about the viral outbreak. We will wait for some more months before eating out,” said Vaishali Mandot, a Sewree resident, who used to dine out at least once a week during pre-Covid-19 days.Maharashtra has around four lakh hotels that have been closed for the past six weeks because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the state government had allowed takeaways and home deliveries, Mumbaikars were lukewarm to avail of the services. There was a growing chorus for reopening of hotels and restaurants as part of the state government’s Mission Begin Again campaign, which was accepted on Monday. Savio D’sa, a consultant to the food and beverage (F&B) sector, said the state government’s move was prompted due to economic issues. “Hotels and restaurants provide a huge amount of taxes to the state exchequer. It is imperative that the state government allows them to reopen,” said D’sa. He said any further delay would have broken the back of the F&B sector, which is reeling under an acute financial crisis because of the contagion-induced lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-hoteliers-face-an-uphill-task-as-govt-allows-reopening-of-hotels-restaurants/story-sgNmXs9qj5pDx9v4gO19ZI.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi-NCR among top 10 global trips market, says Uber||Ride hailing platform Uber has said Delhi-NCR ranked among its top 10 markets globally based on the number of trips taken in the month of September. Delhi is the only Indian city to have made it to the top 10, highlighting its strategic importance in Uber’s global portfolio, with residents taking more than one million rides each week, a statement from Uber said. “As Delhi residents resume travel after the lengthy lockdown, Uber data reveals that cars have emerged as the most preferred mode of commuting, followed closely by low cost products such as Auto and Moto,” it added. There has also been an increase in longer distance trips, with the busiest hours weekly being 8AM - 10AM. Also, Mondays and Fridays are the busiest days of the week for drivers, the statement said.A nationwide lockdown was imposed at the end of March by the government and like many other businesses, cab companies like Uber and Ola saw a major impact on their business. With the lockdown being lifted in phases, these cab aggregators have seen gradual resumption in business.According to news agency PTI, Uber India and South Asia President Prabhjeet Singh said they are thrilled to see Delhi as one of Uber’s top 10 global markets in terms of number of trips in the month of September, which underscores India’s important role as a contributor to Uber’s business growth.Earlier this month, Uber had said its affordable Uber Auto service was recovering briskly with cities like Delhi rebounding to almost 80% of pre-Covid levels, followed by Jaipur and Chandigarh recovering to 50%.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-ncr-among-top-10-global-trips-market-says-uber/story-P3jPsBImrh5BHm1w8g37MN.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Life with a kitchen novelty||It is taking so much space in the small kitchen. But Babua Singh won’t crib about that. “You stack the bartan (dishes) in it, go to office, and when you come back in the evening everything is spotlessly clean and dry,” she says.A textile designer, Ms Singh is showing her newly acquired dish-washing machine in the Ghaziabad flat that she shares with her husband and college-going daughter. Like many middle-class households, Ms Singh used to depend on the services of a part-time house maid for washing the dishes. The coronavirus pandemic changed that as visits from the outside now involve fears of getting the virus. Ms Singh says she nevertheless supported Asha, her long-time housemaid, until she left for her village in Bihar a couple of months ago.While her family would give a hand in household chores during the ongoing pandemic, Ms Singh would still find herself too involved in the kitchen duties. “I leave for office at 9.30 in the morning and come back around 6pm, so there isn’t so much time to relax.”The house always had a washing machine to take care of the laundry “but the idea of getting a dish washer came after Mukul Bhaiya and Anita Bhabhi got one for themselves,” she says, referring to a couple who couldn’t stop gushing about how easy their life had become after getting the admirable appliance.Following a brief discussion with her husband, Ms Singh ordered the machine online “and the company’s people helped us install it... they came in mask.”The new machine seems the most ostentatious object in Ms Singh’s kitchen. A simple two-burner gas range reigns over the counter. “Lakshman Rekha” chalk is drawn around an aata jar to keep off the ants. The microwave is in the corner and the spices and lentils are stocked behind wooden closets.“Even the pressure cooker cleans up very well... the only thing I have to wash in the sink is the kadahi and the tawa,” she says.Dishwashing machines are novel to Indian homes — during the harshest days of the lockdown, some of the more popular online videos were of Hindi film stars trying their hand at washing the dishes in the sink.Ms Singh confides that some of her friends also got the machine “in dekha-dekhi (got inspired) but they use it rarely, as if too much handling might spoil it... just like during the early days of the washing machines (for clothes), when we would use it only on Sundays!” Native of a UP village, Ms Singh reveals that nobody in her circle of immediate relatives has ever used a dishwasher.And now she playfully poses with the machine, making sure that her face is not visible “because of shyness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-life-with-a-kitchen-novelty/story-Ym1yNycsUB8MWx5dVo0FYK.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Heart surgeries down by 89.5% at AIIMS during lockdown||There was a drop of 89.5% in the number of cardiac surgeries that were performed between April and July at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, according to data shared by a doctor during one of the National Grand Rounds, where doctors from across the country learn about issues in management of patients with Covid-19 in a virtual interactive session.The data shows 411 cardiac surgeries were performed between April and July in 2019 as compared to just 43 in 2020. The hospital had shut its outpatient clinics in March during the lockdown and only the emergency surgeries were being performed.However, there was a drop in the number of emergency cardiac surgeries as well. According to data, 35 such surgeries were performed in 2020 as compared to 58 done in the same period last year. This amounts to a drop of 39.6%.“Diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases are comorbidities that lead to poorer outcomes as far as Covid-19 is concerned,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS.Dr Mukesh Goel, senior consultant of cardio-thoracic and vascular surgery at Indraprastha Apollo hospital said, “During and after the lockdown, all hospitals saw a decline in the number of patients coming in for emergency procedures mainly because of two reasons – one, the fear of getting Covid-19 kept them away from hospitals and two, those from outside Delhi weren’t able to travel. Because of delays in seeking treatment, I have had patients with heart attacks coming in so late that they needed complicated surgeries to repair the damage.”Cardio-vascular disease such as heart attacks and strokes are the biggest killers in India with 28.1% of all deaths being attributed to it in 2016, according to a state-level burden of disease study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/heart-surgeries-down-by-89-5-at-aiims-during-lockdown/story-UumU7MpTf224mJuX45lGfJ.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||1,500 centres to be set up to provide equipment to Haryana farmers||The Haryana government will set up 1, 500 Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), which will provide crop residue management equipment to farmers. Additional chief secretary (ACS), agriculture and farmers’ welfare, Sanjeev Kaushal said a target to establish 820 CHCs had been set earlier. However, keeping in view the demand from farmers, 680 more such centres will be set up. He said preference will be given to small and marginal farmers to ensure that they are able to access agricultural machinery easily and participate in the statewide campaign against stubble burning. Allocations will be done on priority basis in red and yellow/orange zones, identified by the department on the basis of incidences of crop residue burning last year. Last year also, the state government had established 1,685 CHCs against the target of 1,300 CHCs. Kaushal said last year the state government had achieved more than 95% of the target set by the Central government for distribution of crop residue management equipment under the scheme ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanisation for In-Situ Management of Crop’. This year, the state government has decided to provide financial assistance, to the tune of ₹155 crore, to all 11,311 individual farmers who have applied for agricultural implements under the scheme. The agriculture department would provide 454 balers, 5,820 super seeders, 5,418 zero till seed drills, 2,918 choppers/mulchers, 260 happy seeders, 389 straw management systems, 64 rotary slashers/shrub masters, 454 reversible mould ploughs and 288 reapers to the beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1-500-centres-to-be-set-up-to-provide-equipment-to-haryana-farmers/story-dW7VeCd7d8GTY1ifFltsFN.html

He also slammed the government for not procuring paddy from the farmers, who he stated, have been waiting in the mandis for the past several days. Praises Badals for snapping ties with BJPThe INLD leader also praised the Shiromani Akali Dal leadership for snapping their ties with the National Democratic Alliance in the interest of farmers. He said that SAD’s decision is in favour of farmers and proved that former Punjab chief minsiter Parkash Singh Badal was the tallest farm leader in the country after late Chhotu Ram, Late Devi Lal and Chaudhary Charan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-brought-these-laws-amid-pandemic-to-avoid-protests-abhay/story-tgmKgTz3zLGibARwiQHgeL.html

The Chautalas have been elevated to power due to the support of the farming community and now it is ridiculous that they are still supporting the BJP government,” he added.“If the Badal family can snap their two-decade-old ties with the BJP, what is stopping Dushyant and his grandfather Ranjit Chautala to come out of the BJP government, which is running with their support. This is the time for them to prove their pro-farmer stand, otherwise the farming community will never accept them,” he added.The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) meanwhile seems divided on the laws. While Dushyant is backing the laws, Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag and Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam have extended their support to the agitating farmers. On Sunday, the JJP’s Rohtak unit had taken out a tractor march in support of the three laws. The party’s Rohtak unit chief Balwan Suhag said these laws will prove beneficial to the farmers and the minimum support price (MSP) system will not end.When contacted, Ranjit Chautala said he is currently in home quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19 and denied to comment on the farm bill issue.JJP supremo Ajay Singh Chautala said the BJP-JJP alliance will continue in future and his party has a different stand from the Shiromani Akali Dal. “These three laws are helpful for farmers and the few protesting farmers’ are being backed by a party. The farmers’ produce will be purchased at minimum support price (MSP),” he added.Black flags shown to agri ministerThe farmers showed black flags to Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal and Sonepat MP Ramesh Kaushik during their visits to Chhichhrana and Madina villages in Baroda constituency on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/clamour-for-dushyant-ranjit-chautala-s-resignations-grow-louder/story-N6lJFhak79ufllhC8MDINJ.html

29-09-2020||City||Glut in Haryana mandis as arhtiyas, mill owners refuse to cooperate in paddy procurement||Even as the Haryana government announced to advance paddy procurement by four days, there is no relief for farmers as arhtiyas and rice-mill owners have refused to cooperate in the procurement process. It has been learnt that the rice-millers and ahrtias are opposing the government’s decision to get the procurement agencies to directly procure the paddy from mandi and transport it to the godowns to bring transparency. The government had announced to start procurement of Parmal varieties in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and Ambala from September 27 but so far, the process has not started.As per information, members of the Haryana rice millers and dealers association held a meeting on Sunday evening at Kurukshetra and decided not to cooperate in the procurement.A senior official of the Haryana state agriculture marketing board said, “Since the rice millers are not allowing procurement agencies to store paddy in their godown, the latter are not procuring the paddy. Even the commission agents are saying that the procurement agencies will have to lift the paddy soon after procurement as they need space for their farmers.”The officer said that now the procurement agencies are exploring other options for storage till the issue with rice-millers is sorted out. Farmers irkedThe delay has cost the farmers heavily as they have been forced to wait in mandis. “We have been waiting in mandis for the past one week and now the arhtiyas and government officials are refusing to procure the paddy,” said Kuldeep Singh, a farmer who was waiting at Pipli grain market of Kurukshetra.A few agitated farmers also locked the market committee office in Kurukshetra to air their anger.Farmers also alleged that they got faulty messages from the government. “I had registered for 250 quintals but I got a message informing me that only one quintal of paddy is to be brought. I raised the issue with mandi officials, but they didn’t care,” said Praveen Kumar, a farmer of Nilokheri of Karnal.Talking to Hindustan Times, Jewel Singla, chairman of the Haryana Rice Millers and Dealers Association, said they are demanding the government to increase the milling charges from Rs 10 to Rs 100 per quintal, and reduce the returns for rice from Rs 67 per quintal to Rs 64. They also want that they should allowed to purchase paddy from farmers of nearby districts and other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/glut-in-haryana-mandis-as-arhtiyas-mill-owners-refuse-to-cooperate-in-procurement/story-to0lpmnYkV6yTXQT4u4iRM.html
29-09-2020||City||Paddy procurement begins early: Farmers, arhtiyas in Ambala allege absence of arrangements in mandis||A day after the Haryana government announced paddy procurement, a few days earlier than usual, farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) of Ambala are still unclear on where to begin.The ready crop is laying in the mandis in huge quantities with no clarity on when it will be purchased, leaving the farmers in a fray whether to stay or to leave.Farmers at the Ambala City mandi have alleged that they have been fooled by the government, who have not expressed any intention on buying the crop yet.Gurvinder, a farmer from Mohra village, said the government wants to buy the crop that has a moisture content of less than 17%. “This condition can’t be fulfilled as mandis are full with very little procurement. We want our old system back that had the involvement of commission agents. Otherwise, the mandi system will collapse.” Gurvinder, who is yet to harvest his ready crop, said if he didn’t sell it now, his crop would rot.Crop rates, labour rates undisclosedAn office bearer of a commission agents’ body alleged that they had not been given any bardana bags by the government yet. He added that the crop rates, labour rates and other prices were yet to be told to them.To check the procurement process, Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) leader Chitra Sarwara visited Ghasitpur mandi and found that the whole mandi was full of paddy with no space left. “My visit apprised me of the fact that there is confusion between the commission agents and shellers. Government wants the farmer to sell it directly to the shellers, but they are waiting to purchase it from agents. The harried lot are the farmers, who have been waiting for almost a week at the mandi without any facility even for drinking water,” she said. “Farmers told me that they have grown around 200 quintals and they have received a message to sell only 1 quintal. They fear that if their ready crop in the mandi is not sold on time, their remaining crop will rote or worse, rain could destroy both the crops,” Chitra told the Hindustan Times.On receiving a call from this correspondent, HAFED Ambala district manager Vikas Deswal said he was busy in a video conference, and later failed to respond to calls or messages.In a statement, district food supply controller (DFSC) Anil Kumar said out of 10,719 metric tonne crop that had arrived at the mandis, 1,929 metric tonne had been bought by the agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paddy-procurement-begins-early-farmers-arhtiyas-in-ambala-allege-absence-of-arrangements-in-mandis/story-k4LCTlnAmpmyJ3APoWXlTI.html

Of these, 12 have already received the first dosage of the drug. After King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital too, started its clinical trial of the vaccine on Monday. Four male volunteers below 40 years of age were given the first dosage in the morning at the hospital. They were kept for around four hours for observation and discharged from the hospital in the evening. They will be administered the second vaccine after a month. “So far, we have selected 20 volunteers, including three women. None of them are related to our institute. They underwent RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and antibody tests as per the guidelines. To avoid any health complications, we have selected young volunteers,” said an official, who is a part of the clinical trial at the hospital.On Friday, three male volunteers have been administered the first dosage of the vaccine at KEM Hospital, while on Monday five participants were given the drug. In addition to this, 15 more volunteers have been selected by the hospital. “We are flooded with queries from citizens [who wish to volunteer] since Saturday. We have given waiting numbers to each of them. Everyday, we will call two-three people for medical check-ups,” said an official from KEM Hospital.Each of the two hospitals will have to conduct the trial on 100 participants. They are expected to finish the selection process by the middle of October. The vaccine induces a strong immune response. It provokes a T-cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with Covid-19) response within 14 days of vaccination and an antibody response within 28 days.In the second week of September, both the hospitals had to halt the trial after a participant developed an adverse reaction in the United Kingdom. Later, the Drug Control General of India (DCGI) gave the permission to run the second and third phases of the trial. However, both the civic hospitals had to get the final approval from their ethics committees before starting with the screening of the volunteers.Meanwhile, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume –partnered with and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/43-volunteers-selected-for-oxford-university-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-in-mumbai/story-y3hKxsxLR32ZNRI6QGqOOI.html

Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said active cases are on a “decline” in 17 of the state’s 35 districts, including Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Pune Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Dhule, Beed, Nagpur and Bhandara. “Our testing average has gone up in September to 90,000 tests daily. In August, it was 60,000. Usually on weekends due to manpower crunch or other factors, tests are fewer,” said Awate. The number of active cases dropped to 265,033 on Monday from over 300,000. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) contributed nearly 35% of the state’s Covid total on Monday. Navi Mumbai reported 392 new cases and five deaths, while Thane city reported 304 new cases and 12 deaths. Thane (rural) saw 236 new cases. Kalyan Dombivli reported 293 new cases. Mira-Bhayander and Panvel city saw 218 and 200 new cases respectively. Vasai-Virar saw 140 new cases. Pune city reported 799 new cases and six fatalities, while Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 505 new cases and five deaths. Pune (rural) had 606 new cases and eight deaths. Nagpur city saw 578 new cases and one death. Nagpur (rural) reported 200 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-less-than-12-000-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-a-first-for-this-month/story-UQNOL5v0wPaVZWosQpnv2L.html

As per their feedback, around 400 people need a group home. But not all of them need it immediately or at one time. Immediate need for a group in the city is for around 70 people,” said Rametra.Bhupinder Kaur Sidhu, a mother of an adult with mental illness, in a letter to the UT adviser, highlighted the limitation of the proposed group home: “Out of nine rooms, one room will have to be for the residential staff. The remaining eight rooms can accommodate a maximum of 16 residents.”MHA interventionThe administration last year had decided that Cheshire Home will be used as a halfway home for mentally ill persons, and an affidavit was also submitted in the Supreme Court to that effect. The administration had finally made a move to implement the decision in August this year.ALSO READ: NGO objects to UT admn decision to convert Cheshire HomeThe parents and residents had written to the Union ministry of home affairs calling out the delay in creation of a group home. On August 24, MHA officials had then written to the UT administration seeking a report on the issue at the earliest.The decision to set up a group home, rather than a halfway home, at the facility in Sector 21 had followed. The halfway home will instead come up in the Disability Assessment Rehabilitation and Triage (DART) building in Sector 32.Rametra said, “Administration should draft a basic framework, which will incorporate issues like need assessment, paying and non-paying categories, selection procedure, etc.”On ‘encroachers’The September 23 press statement of the administration had described the current residents of the Home as “encroachers”, but the minutes of the meeting held on July 11, 2019, clearly stated, “At present, 17 disabled persons are residing in this home. In the year 2017, the said NGO (Cheshire Home Society) abandoned the Cheshire Home and inmates living therein. Thereafter, the inmates have continued to stay in this building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/group-home-for-mentally-ill-in-chandigarh-with-just-8-rooms-cheshire-home-can-t-meet-city-s-needs/story-OfgpQmkSkKx6pLFEGGorKL.html

As per the data released by municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma, around 1.4 lakh families were checked for low oxygen levels, Covid-19 symptoms and comorbidities. The drive was launched across the state for the early detection and isolation of patients. TMC began the survey on September 18 with over 500 teams deputed across the city. “The teams are reaching every home and checking all members of the family. Until now, around 4.23 lakh people have been checked under the initiative,” said a TMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-lakh-thane-residents-checked-for-covid-19-symptoms-under-my-family-my-responsibility-initiative/story-WpfJhUPtPqVczMVnGBVEbP.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||Restaurants in Maharashtra likely to reopen from first week of October||Restaurants in the state are likely to begin their operations from the first week of October as the state government has assured hoteliers during their meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday of receiving the requisite permissions. The state has prepared a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) draft for the restaurants, bars, hotels and eateries in consultation with various associations representing these establishments. The draft is expected to be finalised in the next few days.The SOP has been mandated by the tourism department of the state government has made it mandatory restaurants to screen customers and make them wear masks while on the premises. The hotels have been asked to avail a separate entry and exit, sanitise restrooms regularly, make sanitizers available, encourage digital payments and replace cloth napkins with paper napkins. The restaurants have been directed to maintain the distance of one metre between two tables. Apart from regular disinfecting the furniture, utensils and cutlery, the management has also been asked to maintain the warmth of food. They have also been directed to encourage pre-booking to avoid crowding and proper training of the staff for personal hygiene, sanitation, respiratory etiquettes and social distancing. Valsa R Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department, said that they have been allowed to reopen restaurants from the first week of October. “The SOP is yet to be finalised,” she said. The state government is expected to extend the ongoing lockdown by another month, though certain restrictions are expected to be lifted under Mission Begin Again. The restaurants are expected to be asked to maintain a distance of 6 feet between two tables and follow personal hygiene protocols. Hoteliers have opposed the idea of imposing a cap on the capacity to operate at. “The decision will be taken once the SOP is finalised mutually. We are not against opening up activities, but in the wake of the rising number of cases, we are treading very cautiously. The restrictions have been imposed in the public interest despite huge losses of revenue to the state exchequer. It will be the responsibility of the restaurant and hotel operators to ensure safety of the customers and staff members in the wake of the pandemic,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has been quoted in a statement issued by his office. The Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) called it a huge relief to the restaurant sector. “The whole sector is in deep crisis as the takeaway business is not at all profitable. We know that the next six months will be very difficult but then we needed to start somewhere,” said AHAR president Shivanand Shetty. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, the former president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), echoed the sentiment. He said that social distancing and other norms will impact the whole business. “We have no choice but to adhere to the norms. This reopening will generate some revenue so we can pay the staff as well as keep the business moving, “said Kohli. There are around 4 lakh hotels, restaurants and bars in Maharashtra.Kohli said at national level, the hotel and restaurant industry has suffered losses of about Rs1.90 lakh crore in the past six months of lockdown. Dilip Datwani, former president of Hotels and Restaurants Association, said that though the SOP has not been finalised, the outlets are expected to operate at 50-60% of their capacity. “Operating the restaurants at 30% is not viable and it was clarified to the government. We have been allowed to operate at 50 to 60% capacity, depending on the size of the restaurants. Blocking the alternate tables will serve the purpose of maintaining distancing of one metre. We have trained our staff members on hygiene protocols and social distancing and see no problem in following the protocol strictly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/restaurants-in-maharashtra-likely-to-reopen-from-first-week-of-october/story-omBV3P5BMWm35qncgLuzcP.html
29-09-2020||City||Maharashtra government mulling 24x7 offices, local trains for all by mid-October, says Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray||On a day the city crossed the grim mark of two lakh Covid-19 cases, Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray told HT the state government was looking at resuming suburban train services by mid-October, a demand made by commuters for a while. Thackeray also said the government was talking to associations of business community to stagger office timings to ease congestion in public transport and was thinking about allowing 24x7 offices in commercial establishments. There has been a surge in Covid cases in September. When is the situation likely to improve? We are opening up slowly and if you see, along with the cases, there is a rise in the number of people on streets and officegoers. Soon, we can see restaurants and other commercial places opening up – the decision on it is yet to be taken. We had expected this surge and since May we have started building these jumbo facilities. As long as we have enough health machinery like beds, oxygen supply and ventilators, we can slowly start opening up. The situation totally depends on citizens and the precautions they take. Just like how it is the government’s responsibility to provide beds and medical facilities, it is important for citizens to realise that when we step out, we are not only risking ourselves, but our family too. So only step out if need be, which is applicable even today when things are opening up, and follow the basic discipline of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Mumbai has crossed 10 lakh Covid tests, but experts say daily tests need to be scaled up to check the spread of Covid-19. Why it is not happening? There is a three-point strategy for Covid testing. Firstly, we have liberalised testing since July. We were one of those few cities in the world to liberalise testing back then and so the testing numbers will keep rising. Second, we are conducting door-to-door surveys across the state under ‘My family, My responsibility’ scheme, where we are trying to build health profiles of citizens and check for Covid symptoms. Third, our local wards are already conducting door-to-door surveys. There are some societies that resist testing or check-ups due to fear of isolation or stigma. That is something we need to work on and get rid of. In Mumbai, several people have started commuting for work, but they have to travel in crowded buses or other means of transport that are not adequate. When will we start the local trains? I think the number of people from essential services being allowed on the local trains has been increased. We need to increase the frequency of local trains and we are working on that with the railway authorities. As soon as we have more frequency, more crowds can be allowed, otherwise any mode of transport will be crowded. By mid-October, it is likely that we will start local trains as we are looking at a couple of more things opening up, for which we will have to start other modes of transport as well. Opening up has been slow because we don’t want to shut down anything that we have opened up already. The approach towards relaxations has been like this for the past three months. What are the major hurdles while implementing staggered timings for offices? BMC and railways held several discussions involving private and public offices… In a city like Mumbai, where we have different districts for businesses, banks and commercial establishments, it is very difficult to have staggered timings as a blanket rule. We are discussing it with different offices, complexes and corporate areas where you can try to stagger the timings. Finally, we want to reach an arrangement where offices are functioning 24x7. Not just in Covid times, but post that also, we would really be able to manage the traffic better if we have flexible working hours. Currently, this plan of having offices 24x7 is an internal discussion, but once we start discussing it with offices, keeping timings flexible will come up as an option. Post-Covid, we would have to give shops and establishment some more time to do their business and get back on track. We will have to give them that flexibility. When can we expect more relaxations in the city? What is the plan to revive the economy, considering Covid is going to stay for a longer time? Very soon actually, the last round of relaxations was around the beginning of September. If you see the pattern in all our relaxations, it will be done gradually. Just like how the state went into a lockdown gradually. It was not a sudden movement. Likewise, when we are coming out of it, we are absorbing the surge for 15 days and then planning to give more relaxations. Probably in the first week of October, the chief minister will be taking a call on what would open next. The question of economy and unemployment is global. As we start moving out of Covid, we are looking at a couple of sectors. Firstly, the real estate sector has been given the stamp duty relaxation that has started churning the real estate, as people have started to invest. Public works is another sector we are looking at, since the beginning of the pandemic. Tourism and hospitality are other sectors which can act as a sponge for employment because people would now also want to step out and travel, considering the exhaustion of constantly being at home for the past several months. The fourth sector is industries. Every 15 days, the CM is chairing a meeting where we are looking at going further into the ease of doing business and the nitty-gritties. The discussions surround the implications of ease of doing business, its repercussions, ways to balance the industries and the labour and how to keep the investment going in times of a global economy crisis. Covid fatalities have gone up in the MMR and there are instances of patients struggling to find hospital beds in rural Maharashtra as well. How does the state plan to improve this? There are only a couple of textbook methods that we follow. Covid is such an unpredictable disease. Firstly, we have to indulge in early testing and detection through our state-wide programme. While we increase our bed capacities with well-equipped jumbo facilities, we also need to decentralise our helplines, similar to how we did in Mumbai. This is very crucial. We have set up a task force and mini-task force in every district to make regular visits to hospitals and jumbo facilities to have a basic check on the line of treatment. Apart from this, a long-term plan to set up a 5,000-bed hospital for infectious diseases is already in the pipeline and will cater to Mumbai as well as the MMR. What is the topmost priority of the state to bring down Covid cases? Do a health profile of everyone and spread awareness in terms of self-reliance of their own protection. You have to ensure that everyone knows how to wear a mask and follows social distancing guidelines. As we open up under Mission Begin Again, we will have to start taking responsibility for ourselves. We also need to get rid of the stigma around Covid. Another major issue that we need to work on globally is mental health of people. Considering the stress about job losses and exhaustion in these trying times, which has generated a lot of anxiety among people about the future, mental health care is an area we need to prioritise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-mulling-24x7-offices-local-trains-for-all-by-mid-october-says-mumbai-suburban-guardian-minister-aaditya-thackeray/story-WzUtl3bDPc80MtOyXF0pxN.html

29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Amid pandemic, cases of vector-borne diseases in Chandigarh witness major decline||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Chandigarh has witnessed a sharp dip in the number of vector-borne diseases as compared to previous years, government data suggests.While experts believe a few months’ data cannot depict the whole picture, the UT health department has said that the dip was due to timely action, as well as emphasis on preventive measures taken amid the pandemic.This year, so far, only 13 cases of dengue and six cases of malaria have been reported. Last year, the numbers were significantly higher at 286 cases of dengue and 22 cases of malaria. No case of chikungunya has been reported in the last two years.‘Restriction, increased awareness main reasons’Director, health and family welfare, Dr G Dewan, said, “Oiling of stagnant water, extensive sanitation and fumigation were carried out on a much larger scale. These routine exercises were not affected by the Covid situation in the city. It may also be due to the restrictions and increased awareness of the citizens towards hygiene.”However, Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said that restrictions and fewer outdoor activities could not be a major reason behind the dip.“Most people get infected while they are at home and outdoor activities like the closure of schools and offices do not play a major role if proper conditions are maintained in those premises. However, for a proper picture to emerge, we need to wait and watch as cases are still being reported. The cycle for vector-borne diseases is on and more cases will come to the fore,” said Dr Kumar.Most cases see a peak after every three years and the process is cyclic, he added.Over the last five years, the city has seen a consistent decline in the number of vector-borne diseases being reported. The data presented in the Lok Sabha stated that Chandigarh recorded 1,125 cases of dengue in 2017 and only 301 in 2018. The number dipped slightly to 286 in 2019, and then majorly this year to just 6 cases.‘Underreporting could be another reason’“One reason could be that most people who had symptoms did not come forward due to the fear of Covid-19 testing and mandatory isolation that follows,” an expert from PGIMER said. Health authorities, however, said the likelihood of this happening was unlikely because vector-borne diseases caused high-grade fever, while Covid-19 patients had low-grade fever. Therefore, “underreporting” could not be the major reason, they said.Stressing on the role of hygiene, Dr RS Bedi, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Chandigarh chapter, said the pandemic had taught a lesson that a clean environment, sound civic system, improved public health, sanitation and garbage disposal, which came by default with closed schools, colleges, market places, offices and eateries, along with social distancing, could decrease the infectious disease load.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-pandemic-cases-of-vector-borne-diseases-in-chandigarh-witness-major-decline/story-GXcbLKekkaw9WUbIWypKoO.html

29-09-2020||City||NHM workers in Gurugram may stage protest over contract issue||Gurugram: Nearly 750 contractual healthcare workers with the National Health Mission (NHM) in Gurugram district — comprising doctors, auxiliary midwife nurses, emergency medical technicians, and ambulance drivers, among others — have declined to get their employment contracts renewed and are planning to protest against the two new clauses in the contract. Members of NHM Karmachari Sangh alleged that the two specific clauses, which have been added to the contract this year, would reduce job security for the health workers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They said that they would have to either strike work or stage a sit-in in the coming days if the clauses are not withdrawn. The contractual workers on Monday wrote to the district chief medical officer, informing him about their decision that no NHM worker in the district “will submit his contract affidavit for renewal”. Hari Raj, general secretary, NHM Karmachari Sangh (Haryana) and district president (Gurugram), said that contractual NHM workers make up a third of the health department’s staff in Gurugram district. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have been working day and night on the frontline. Medical technicians, ambulance drivers and midwives, all are included in this group. The state’s insistence on these clauses sends the wrong message. The new terms allow appointing health authorities, such as civil surgeons, to terminate any employee with no advance notice and no compensation. This was not the case earlier.”The Monday’s letter, authored by the district president of the NHM Karmachari Sangh, comes on the heels of a union meeting held in Gurugram on September 25. The letter states, “You are hereby notified that during our meeting on September 25, it has been decided that no NHM worker in the district will submit his contract affidavit for renewal.” The specific clauses (numbered 9 and 10) in the ‘Letter of Contract’ affidavit, which NHM workers are expected to sign and submit by the end of the month in order to renew their employment, remove the provision of a month-long notice period in case of termination of employment. The affidavit (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times) also states that this may be done “without making payment of remuneration in advance”.Rehan Raza, state president of the NHM workers union, said, “This is not just a Gurugram matter. All 13,500 NHM workers in Haryana will be affected by this decision. We have already written to the state government on September 20 explaining our demands. The Karmachari Sangh state committee will be meeting later this week. If the clauses are not rescinded, we will have no option but to protest, either through a strike or sit-in.” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, declined to provide a comment, saying this was a state matter and did not concern his office. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (health), Haryana, also declined to provide a comment for this story. Prabjot Singh, mission director, NHM Haryana, also did not respond to requests for comment.However, an official in the post of deputy director, NHM Haryana, seeking anonymity, said, “These clauses have been included to ensure better performance on the job by the contractual workers. A large proportion of contract NHM workers in Haryana have been objecting to these clauses. We have decided on a course of action if they do not comply, but I am not at liberty to disclose it yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhm-workers-in-gurugram-may-stage-protest-over-contract-issue/story-CZ26rmYAbjtiN0BMrgcsmK.html
29-09-2020||Gurugram||93 primary schools in Gurugram to be turned into English-medium ones||In a move aimed at improving the standard of education, the state government has started the process of developing Government Model Sanskriti Primary Schools in the district. Model Sanskriti Schools are English-medium government schools that charge a nominal monthly fee of ₹200. Across the district, 93 primary schools are being upgraded to these model schools with the first batch of English-medium classes slated to start in 2021. Out of the 93 schools in the district, 72 are in Gurugram city. A number of such schools were formally inaugurated last week and more are expected to be upgraded in due course. Last month, state education minister Kanwar Pal had said that over 1,000 schools across the state would be developed as these model schools. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari said that 72 Model Sanskriti Schools will become operational in the city. “These 72 schools include those that are being upgraded and others that need to meet certain infrastructure requirement before being declared as model schools the next year. Starting this week, we have already started the process of renaming the schools and ensuring that necessary arrangements are made in line with the quality of education that the state intends to impart through these schools,” said Kumari. She said that admissions to these schools would take place next year. “These are English-medium schools and the aim is at providing quality education, especially to children of those parents who hesitate to take admissions in government schools due to the fact that English is not a medium of instruction,” said Kumari. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, who holds the charge of the Government Model Sanskriti Primary School in Sector 4/7 that was inaugurated on Saturday, said that the state government had announced plans of setting up 1,000 Sanskriti model schools in Haryana. “The primary school under our watch has been declared as a Model Sanskriti School. Earlier, it was a simple primary school. These are English-medium schools with a monthly fee of ₹200 and a one-time admission fee of ₹500. The aim is to improve the standard of education in this district. After some years, these schools might get affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE),” said Sharma. A spokesperson from Government Primary School, Sukhrali, that was inaugurated last week, said that the school would be working towards fulfilling the requirements that need to be met before the session starts next year. “The state government is focusing on inclusive education by developing such model schools. Our school will also be taking admissions as part of the upgraded model from next year. Teaching will be done in line with the guidelines issued for model schools,” stated the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/93-primary-schools-in-gurugram-to-be-turned-into-english-medium-ones/story-ssRq0wYybTZSPLXDCYvseP.html
29-09-2020||City||Mohali DC orders FIRs against agents bringing paddy from other states||Taking a strict stance on the illegal influx of paddy from neighbouring states in the district mandis of Mohali, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has directed the mandi officials to take legal action against arhtiyas (commission agents) violating the Punjab Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act.While reviewing the paddy procurement scenario, it was brought to the notice of the DC that mandis adjoining the Haryana border often faced a glut due to an unprecedented arrival of paddy from other states via local commission agents. This, in turn, hampered the procurement process.THe DC was informed that the local civil administration would make arrangements for estimated arrivals of produce from villages, but those arrangements tended to fall short due to illegal sale of paddy from neighbouring states.Taking strict note of the transgression, DC Dayalan directed the police officials to establish special interstate border check-points so that “other state paddy” was unable to come in the district. He further issued directions to register FIRs and suspend licences of errant arhtiyas. Sub-divisional magistrates have been directed to maintain a constant vigil to ensure compliance.Influx of other state paddy is prevalent in Lalru and Dera Bassi. On DC’s orders, check-points will be established primarily at Jharmari, Baltana, Barwara and other points as suggested by local SDMs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-dc-orders-firs-against-agents-bringing-paddy-from-other-states/story-QeJtlgna0CmjkOUskdWq3N.html
29-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Two women injured after portion of road caves in; civic agency orders inquiry||Ghaziabad: Two women were injured when they fell into a pit created by a portion of the road in Rajendra Nagar caving-in, on Sunday morning. The incident on Sunday took place in Sector 3m where the two women, both aged around 40-45 years and residents of the nearby Pasonda area, were collecting dry wood from the roadside and loading them in to a rickshaw.The matter has prompted the Ghaziabad municipal corporation to issue orders for a survey of the area in Rajendra Nagar where the incident took place. According to the civic agency’s officials, the cave-in took place probably due to water leakage. The portion has been barricaded, officials added.“The spot where they were standing caved-in and both fell in. The pit created as a result of the cave-in was about 7-8 feet deep and soon locals rushed for their help. One of the women suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital for first aid. Both had come to collect dry wood from the green belt area,” said Himanshu Sharma, a local resident. “As soon as I got information, I reached the spot and informed the corporation officials. Later, they barricaded the area. The woman, however, did not suffer any major injuries and was discharged from the hospital,” Sharma added.MS Tanwar, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner, said he has taken cognisance of the incident and directed officers to survey the area. “It seems that the roadside portion that caved-in was due to some water leakage. I have asked the general manager of the water works department to survey the surrounding area and ensure that there is no such issue there. The repair work will also be ensured at the earliest and we are also taking up road repair works on 25 different roads of the city. Our officials reached the spot and took the women to a nearby hospital for first aid,” he added. The residents, however, raised concerns over the dilapidated condition of city roads. “It is necessary that the entire incident be probed and reasons behind it be found out. Further, the city roads are lying in a dilapidated condition ever since the lockdown and bad patches of the road often lead to accidents. The corporation should fix the responsibility of the respective engineer of the area and should rope in mobile road repair teams, so that the dilapidated patches can be repaired immediately,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of the apartment owners’ federation. “The work for repair of the 25 different roads will start within the next 15 days and tenders have been issued under phase 1 of the work. We have also requested residents to inform their respective zonal in-charges in case they come across broken patches. We will try to put the other roads in phase 2 of the road repair work, for which tenders will be floated in the second half of October,” Tanwar added.Under phase 1 of the road repair works, the corporation has issued tenders for 25 different roads which have become dilapidated and need immediate repairs. The roads are identified in residential areas of Vasundhara sectors 6, 4A, 16 and 18, Dabur Chowk to Kaushambi, Kavi Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Diamond flyover, Shalimar Garden Extension 1 and Vijay Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-two-women-injured-after-portion-of-road-caves-in-civic-agency-orders-inquiry/story-0Un5MWvho7VHNtM3mlTFSO.html

According to her, her husband had left home around 5.30pm on Saturday saying that he was going to the Noida City Centre to buy some household items. The family lives in a high-rise in Sector 77.“However, he did not return. Around 10pm on Saturday, I got a call from his phone and the caller said my husband had been abducted. The caller said they wanted money in order to release my husband,” said the woman in her complaint to the police.She alleged that later she received a call from a different phone number. A man and a woman could be heard talking, and they demanded a ransom of ₹10 lakh for my husband’s release or else they would harm him, she said.Officers said the victim’s wife did not contact the police immediately as she was scared for her husband. However, when she could not arrange the money, the family approached the Sector 49 police station where a case of kidnapping for ransom (Section 364a of IPC) was registered.“Based on instructions from the commissioner, three teams were formed immediately—the Noida zone surveillance team, a crime branch team and one from Sector 49 police station. Within a few hours of the complaint, we traced the suspects, using the location of the phone from which the ransom calls were made,” said additional DCP, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police said the victim had left home in his Honda city car. After tracing the location of the phone to a hotel in Sector 41, they found the car parked nearby, officers added. “We found three men inside the victim’s car. One of them was apprehended while the other two managed to flee. The apprehended suspect was identified as Deepak Kumar (28), who is from Haryana and worked at the hotel. Based on his directions, the victim was traced to one of the rooms in the hotel,” said Singh.The police said that the victim had several injury marks on his body when they found him. Two persons, including a woman, who had held the victim hostage, were arrested from the spot, the police said.These were identified as 51-year-old Sunita Gujjar, a resident of Noida’s Sector 51, and 32-year-old Rakesh Kumar, who is also from Haryana. The police said Rakesh is the owner of the hotel where the victim was allegedly being held hostage.The police said that their investigation later revealed that the victim was allegedly abducted when he had left home to visit a “massage parlour” that he had found online. His wife was not aware about the planned visit, officers added.“The victim had looked for a massage parlour online, and found the contact number for one in Noida. He came in touch with a man in this regard and the latter asked him to meet at the City Centre on Saturday. However, when the victim reached there, he was asked to follow the man to the hotel where he was instead kept hostage,” a police officer, on condition of anonymity, said.According to a press statement by the police, the victim had allegedly been lured by the woman and her associates before they asked him to meet. Police said this allegedly was the modus operandi of the gang, which has been involved in multiple extortion cases. “We have found the involvement of the gang in at least two to three cases of extortion so far. The gang has been active for the past four or five years, and a search is on for their other associates. According to our initial investigation, no other women, apart from Sunita, seem to be a part of the operation,” said Singh.According to sources, Sunita is associated with the women’s wing of a political party, though police officers said that this is claim has not been verified yet.The police said that some electronic devices and a few documents incriminating the suspects in the operation were allegedly seized during the probe, apart from the victim’s car.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.The police team which rescued the victim was rewarded a prize of ₹5 lakh from Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi.Police said the victim was rescued the victim within a few hours of receiving the complaint. Teams had been deployed at border areas, as part of which search operations, and suspicious vehicles were checked. Nearly a dozen police personnel in civil clothes had been involved in the raid and surveillance in Sector 41 hotel, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/kidnapped-government-scientist-rescued-in-noida-three-arrested/story-c4Lb6KpzJifXbJbKPLSsQP.html

We immediately reported the incident to the police,” said Srivastava. He further said that there are some “anti-social elements” who want to create tension in the society through vandalism and hooliganism for their “own vested interests”. “The matter is mostly internal, but we had visited the spot and are keeping an eye on the situation,” said Azaad Singh Tomar, station house officer, Sector 39 police station. The police have not received any formal complaints so far.Srivastava added that the destroyed partition leaves the residents more vulnerable to the entry of outsiders through phase 2.

The complainant is Vikas Mandal, a resident of Delhi. “Several of us had purchased this land through a property dealer, Jagdish Yadav. We had erected boundary walls and foundations on the property.

29-09-2020||City||Jewar airport: Zurich International to sign concession agreement in second week of October||GREATER NOIDA: Zurich Airport International AG, the concessionaire selected for developing the international airport at Jewar, and the special purpose vehicle (SPV) Yamuna International Airport Private Limited are set to sign a concession agreement in the second week of October, officials from the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) said on Monday. According to the officials, the signing of concession agreement holds importance as Zurich Airport International cannot start work at the airport site without it. “The concession agreement with the Switzerland company Zurich AG will be signed in the second week of October. The company officials were waiting for the removal of ban imposed on international flights in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. International flights are likely to resume operations from October 1. Therefore, the agreement will be signed before October 15 for sure, and date will be finalised once the flight tickets for Zurich top officials are booked,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, NIAL, a nodal agency to monitor the airport project.On May 19 this year, Zurich International had got requisite security clearance from the Union ministry of home affairs, paving way for singing of concession agreement. The agreement was supposed to be signed by July 2 as per the earlier schedule. But on June 10, the Uttar Pradesh government postponed the agreement signing date to August 17 in view of the pandemic. On August 14, Zurich International was given time till October 15 for agreement signing in view of restrictions on air travel.“We have informed the UP government that the agreement will be signed in the second week of October and the necessary process is being completed in advance. The agreement will be signed in the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority’s sector Omega-1 office,” said Singh.The SPV was formed in January this year for the development and the operations of the Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar. It has directors from the UP civil aviation department, NIAL and Zurich International.“Once the agreement is signed, Zurich will start work at the site in the next six months as it needs time to mobilize the workforce and also rope in required agencies,” said Singh.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has acquired 1,334 hectares of land under phase 1 out of the total 5,000 hectares required for the airport project. In November last year, Zurich Airport International AG, the owner of Switzerland’s biggest airport, had emerged as the top bidder to design, build and develop a new airport in Jewar along the 165-kilometre Yamuna expressway. To be spread over 5,000 hectares, once completed, it will be the biggest airport in India with eight runways and will cater to 70 million passengers a year by 2040-50. The first phase will be completed in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jewar-airport-zurich-international-to-sign-concession-agreement-in-second-week-of-october/story-JGoFawovxd5A9aZoE5C6dM.html
29-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: FIR against patient’s relatives for assaulting staff at women’s hospital||The Ghaziabad police on Monday said they have booked more than 35 unidentified persons, including relatives of a patient, for allegedly assaulting the staff at the district women’s hospital on September 19.The hospital authorities submitted a complaint to the Kotwali police station on September 26 regarding the incident.“A patient who was to deliver her second child was admitted to our hospital. The woman was anaemic and their were chances of severe bleeding and other related complications during her delivery. On the basis of her condition, we told her family on September 19 that she needs to be shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi for better treatment. After this, we called our ambulance but her family members objected to the referral. Our doctors tried to explain to them the woman’s condition, but they got agitated and called up about 30-35 of their known persons,” said Dr Sangita Goel, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital.“Later, the patient’s family members assaulted our staff nurses and the guards and home guards deployed at the hospital. One of our staff nurses’ hand was hurt, while one guard suffered injuries to his head that need six stitches. One of the attackers had even snatched a stick from the home guard and assaulted our staff,” she added.Based on the complaint, an FIR under Indian Penal Code sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 332 (intent to prevent or deter person or any other public servant from discharging his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) was registered by the police on Saturday . The police are yet to identify the relatives of the patient who is a Nandgram resident.Dr Geol said that there was a delay in giving a complaint to the police as the former CMS of the hospital, who was deployed at the hospital during the incident, was transferred to Lucknow in the meantime.The entire incident took place at the ground floor of the hospital, which shares campus with the MMG district hospital, and later the attackers fled the spot taking the patient with them in their own vehicle, the hospital authorities said.The police said they are investigating the matter. “We are investigating the case to identify all the suspects. Once they are identified, strict action will be taken against them,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). Earlier on April 1, the staff nurses of the MMG district hospital had alleged that five patients in isolation ward had misbehaved with them and denied taking treatment.

29-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Moderate Covid-19 cases occupy most beds; ICU bed availability low in pvt hospitals||Ghaziabad: The occupancy of L2 beds in government and private facilities in Ghaziabad, is the highest in all coronavirus (Covid-19) disease categories of hospitals in the district. According to official records, as of September 27, at least 53 of the 700 L1 category beds in the district were occupied, while 66 of 400 were occupied in L3 category hospitals. However, the occupancy position in L2 category hospitals, which include private hospitals, is still on the higher side. As of September 27, 627 of the 931 beds, across government and private Covid-19 L2 hospitals combined were occupied by patients in the district, said district health officials.“The occupancy is still high, at around 67%, in our L2 category hospitals which have a combined strength of 931 beds, out of which 755 are in the private sector and 176 are in the government sector. The reason for this is because more coronavirus patients these days have moderate symptoms and hence are being admitted to L2 category hospitals. The 11 private hospitals in the district providing paid Covid-19 treatment are also categorised under the L2 category, according to government directions,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.Officials of private hospitals, however, said that their bed occupancy position dropped slightly in the fourth week of September but the strength of ICU beds continues to be fully occupied. The district has overall 168 number of ICU beds – 37 in government sector and rest in 11 private hospitals offering paid Covid treatment. “The occupancy of L2 beds during mid-September at our hospital was almost full but it has slightly come down to about 77%, which is still high as more patients are seeking admission. On the other hand, the ICU beds are all occupied,” said Dr Sangita Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital at Nehru Nagar. Other private hospitals also reported that ICU bed occupancy is still high, with almost full occupancy at present. “The Covid-19 bed occupancy has slightly come down by 15-20% overall during the past one week or so. However, ICU bed occupancy is still almost full. Above all, the severity of cases is also high,” said Dr Mahesh Chaudhary, director (operations), Navin Hospital at Vaishali. Monthly tally almost double from AugustIn the first 27 days of September, as many as 5302 coronavirus (Covid-19) cases were reported in the district. This is a significant increase (a rise of 46.75%) from the 2,824 new Covid-19 cases recorded in the first 27 days of August. Officials, however, have attributed increase in testing in the district to the steep rise in cases – during the first 27 days of September, the district took up 1,00,891 tests while the same was 81,648 in the first 27 days of August, which is a rise of about 19%.“During the first fortnight of September, we had about 3,000 fresh cases, which led to high occupancy of Covid beds in government as well as private sector facilities in the district. However, after September 15, there was a decline seen in terms of new coronavirus cases,” the CMO addedFrom September 15 to 27, about 2,300-odd Covid-19 cases were recorded in the district. According to official records, the district has so far permitted 3,738 asymptomatic patients in home isolation and 3,048 of these were discharged till September 27, while 690 are still under active home quarantine. About 209 of those discharged had been referred to L2 or L3 facilities when their health status showed deterioration, officials added. According to the state control room records of September 28, the Ghaziabad district overall had 13,828 Covid-19 cases with 77 deaths, 1,945 active patients and 11,806 patients discharged, so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/most-covid-patients-in-gzb-hospitals-those-with-mild-symptoms-data-shows-icu-beds-availability-low-in-pvt-hospitals/story-lYYomhF1ilrSsi5E0EYtJP.html

29-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: NCB opposes Rhea’s bail plea, says it can investigate drug case||Replying to the bail application of actor Rhea Chakraborty before the Bombay high court (HC), the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has maintained that it has the jurisdiction to investigate the case against her and several others, including her brother Showik.Arguing Rhea’s bail plea, her counsel, Satish Maneshinde, had submitted that the drug-related case against the 28-year-old actor should also have been entrusted to the CBI, in terms of the Supreme Court order of August 19, 2020.Maneshinde claimed that on August 19 the apex court allowed CBI to investigate the case registered at Patna on the basis of complaint lodged by the father of deceased actor, Sushant Singh Rajput. In the same order, Supreme Court has also directed that all cases relating to the death of Rajput should be transferred for investigation to CBI, and since the drug trail being probed by the NCB was also linked to Rajput’s death, the case should also have been transferred to CBI.The reply filed by NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede stated that there is no such order passed by the apex court. The agency has maintained that the Supreme Court has directed the CBI to take over investigation, if any new case was registered “on the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death” and the direction “was not with respect to the present case” registered under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.Relying on the purported recovery of contraband material from one of the alleged suppliers, Anuj Keshwani, NCB has claimed that the case involves commercial quantity of drugs and not the small quantities, as claimed by Rhea, Showik and some other accused arrested by the agency after WhatsApp chats revealed sale and purchase of contraband material, primarily for consumption of Rajput.NCB has reiterated it’s stand that that Rhea was “an active member of the drug syndicate connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers.” In this regard the reply to her bail plea states that the “Applicant (Rhea) has in her statement (recorded by NCB) revealed about her involvement in procurement of drugs and financing of illicit drug dealings.”“The present applicant is prominent member of supply chain of drugs and majorly she is handling finance also,” states that affidavit. “The present applicant used to manage, finance for drug procurement along with Sushant Singh Rajput,” NCB has said while opposing Rhea’s bail plea. NCB to scrutinise, review electronic evidence gathered from actors The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), investigating the drug angle into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, is now reviewing and scrutinising the electronic evidence it has gathered from all the 20 accused arrested in the case till now. NCB has also taken mobile phones of actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, Deepika’s manager Karishma Prakash, Sushant Singh Rajput’s former business manager Shruti Modi and talent manager Jaya Saha. “We will follow the procedure of law. Their mobile phones will be returned to them through the court after we gather data,” said deputy director general of NCB Mutha Ashok Jain. No fresh summons has been issued to anyone in the case for inquiry, added Jain. NCB, on Monday released, a statement with respect to the allegation of humiliation and torment made by advocate Satish Maneshinde who represents accused Kshitij Ravi Prasad who arrested NCB unit on September 26. NCB official in their release said, “It is very unambiguously stated that the allegation is mischievous and completely untrue. NCB Mumbai unit arrested Prasad in the alleged drug case (16/20) related to the Sudhar Singh Rajput’s death, after some incriminating evidence were recovered from him, and found his involvement in offence under NDPS act and placed him under arrest following due process of law.” “Prasad’s lawyer and his mother were informed, and he was even also allowed to meet his father and his wife in Mumbai zonal unit office. Prasad was not cooperating with the investigation, this fact was brought to the notice of court and NCB demanded his custody on September 27 when he was produced in the court through video conferencing after medical check up,” stated NCB’s release “Prasad was remanded in the NCB custody till October 3 after listening the argument from both sides. The court has observed that no physical ill treatment has been given to Prasad. The NCB reiterates that the allegations are baseless and devoid of any truth,” added NCB’s press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ssr-death-ncb-opposes-rhea-s-bail-plea-says-it-can-investigate-drug-case/story-8SaxPXSQ9RZGDjQ8Zbn4hO.html
29-09-2020||Mumbai||200K cases in Mumbai; trains, eateries unlock on cards||More coronavirus disease (Covid-19) locks look set to be removed with restaurants across Maharashtra likely to reopen in the first week of October, although with a host of safeguards. The government is also considering resuming suburban train services for all by the middle of next month. The developments, ironically, happened on a day when Mumbai crossed the 200,000 Covid-19 cases mark, with the addition of 2,055 infections taking the count to 200,901.The state government on Monday assured hoteliers of granting requisite permissions, during a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. A standard operation procedure (SOP) is expected to be finalised in the next few days. Valsa R Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department, said they have been allowed to reopen restaurants from the first week of October. “The SOP is yet to be finalised,” she said.Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday told HT the state government was looking at resuming suburban train services by mid-October, a demand made by commuters for a while. Thackeray also said the government was talking to associations of the business community to stagger office timings to ease congestion in public transport and was thinking about allowing 24x7 offices in commercial establishments.All this comes after September witnessed a dramatic surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, with 2,000-2,300 cases being reported daily through the month, against the earlier 1,200 to 1,500 cases.The state, meanwhile, reported 11,921 cases on Monday, taking the count to 1,351,153, and 180 deaths, pushing the toll to 35,751.There were 26,784 active cases in Mumbai, as of Monday. According to figures up till Sunday, September saw a 105% increase in Covid-19 cases, from the corresponding period in August, and a 98% increase in comparison to the same number of days in May. A total of 51,899 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city between September 1 and September 27.Civic health officials said that the high daily caseload would continue in the coming days, owing to the upcoming season of festivals.Experts believe the number of Covid-19 cases will drastically drop by December or January, especially if Mumbai continues to increase its testing capacity, and timely isolate more patients and high-risk contacts.Until Saturday, Mumbai had conducted 10.82 lakh Covid-19 tests, at a positivity rate of 18.15%.Positivity rate is calculated as the per cent of people who have tested positive in comparison to the total number of tests done. Mumbai has been conducting up to 15,000 tests a day. This figure is lower on some days and ranges between 9,000 and 13,000 tests. Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said, “There is no one reason why September has been the worst month. But the more we test now, and if we continue with this aggressive testing even in October, then come December and January, the numbers will drop, because we will be able to isolate patients and curb the spread.”Civic health officials and experts have also attributed the increase in the number of cases in September to reverse migration, as labourers are now returning to the city for work; to ‘herd’ testing, which means as businesses, shops, offices, or eateries are opening up, employers and owners are opting to get their employees tested periodically before returning to work; increased interaction of the unorganised workforce such as house helps, drivers, street vendors, or hawkers, with the community, and instances of local transmission arising from such interaction, as well as from the festival season. The increase in cases has also been attributed to scaled-up testing in Mumbai.According to experts, the surge is also partly due to lack of Covid-19 etiquette among Mumbaiites; failure to maintain social distancing, to wear masks, to wash hands frequently, to avoid crowds or poorly ventilated spaces; and an overall complacency about taking precautions.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the public health department in the civic body, said last week, “With unlock plans and the city opening up, this trend is expected. We are testing more. But this is not only attributed to increase in testing, but also to increased interaction in the community in general, such as house helps returning to work, people beginning to buy groceries and vegetables on a daily basis, as opposed to the behaviour in March and April.”Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, comprising areas of Dadar, Shivaji Park, Mahim and Dharavi, said. “A trend is very evident where employers of businesses want to test their employees before they return to work. So at a time, one business, or shop, or organisation gets anywhere between 10 to 50 people tested. Moreover, as house helps and drivers are returning to work, their employers, too, test them regularly.”Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “This trend was expected, as transport opens up, and people commute within the city and to satellite cities. With unlocking plans, interaction is going to increase.”Dr Pandit said, “Just at the onset of September, we had one festival, that gave scope for more interaction and for people to meet each other, venture out for shopping. Around the same time, BMC increased their testing capacity, and now they are testing almost 15,000 daily. In a way, they cast a wider net to catch more cases, and that is a good thing.”However, experts have pointed out that the way forward is for Mumbaiites to show greater responsibility. Pointing out that for every tested person, there are 20 people who are also positive, but who have not tested and who do not have symptoms, Dr Joshi said, “In terms of lack of cooperation from citizens, the month of September has been very disappointing. Mumbaiiites have not shown any discipline in terms of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding crowds and avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and Covid hygiene. Mumbaiites need to wake up and observer stricter discipline.”As Mumbaiites are allowed to venture out for work, shopping is allowed, visiting public places such as beaches or promenades is allowed, a sense of normalcy is settling in. According to Dr Pandit, this lack of discipline is also attributed to some amount of complacency setting in due to unlock plans. “The pandemic has reached a stage where it is no longer the government, which is responsible for absolutely everything. It is the people’s responsibility that is more than that. We must observe appropriate behaviour and habits. Wear masks, maintain social distancing, plan travel so as to avoid crowds, test on time and isolate on time. On the contrary, in March, April and May, lockdown mandated stricter discipline.”The civic body has until Saturday fined 14,207 citizens for not wearing masks and collected ₹52.76 lakh from them. Of this, fines worth ₹19 lakh were collected from 9,218 defaulters between September 13 and 26 alone.“If you do not maintain social distancing, and do not wear masks, the chances of your proximity to an asymptomatic carrier are going to increase. Social distancing works, we have seen that, even in other countries. This is the only thing that can be applied in the long term”, said Dr Om Shrivastav, who is a city-based consultant for infectious diseases. As per BMC’s Covid war room data, 68% of detected Covid patients are asymptomatic, 27% are symptomatic and 5% are critical.Experts also believeD that the government needs to further scale up Mumbai’s testing capacity to at least double the number of daily tests being done at present. While Dr Joshi said, considering Mumbai’s population, the city needs to conduct at least 30,000 to 50,000 tests a day. Dr Om Shrivastav said, “Mumbai should be doing over 1.5 lakh tests per day.”According to Dr Pandit, it is also important to stick to the basics from the administrative point of view, testing in high number, isolating positive patients, contact tracing, and quarantining high risk contacts.Dr Joshi said, “We are aiming to bring down case fatality rate (CFR) to less than 1%, going forward. In many parts of Maharashtra we have been successful in doing so.” In Mumbai too, CFR has dropped from 5.7% to 4.5%. HT reported on September 21 that in the past 31 days, the city has recorded CFR of 2.2% (1,115 deaths and 51,617 cases), which has helped bring down Mumbai’s overall CFR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/200k-cases-in-mumbai-trains-eateries-unlock-on-cards/story-VMKSOPYJ32HsuQxw3Zkn3L.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Active Covid-19 cases in Delhi below 30k, but number of daily deaths remains a concern||Delhi saw the number of active Covid cases drop to below 30,000 for the third day in a row on Monday.This has happened after ten days, according to the daily health bulletins released by the Delhi government. There were 27,123 active cases as on Sunday, fewer than the highest 28,329 active cases reported during the surge in June. The maximum peak in active cases during the current surge was 32,250, recorded on September 18, data shows. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The number of deaths, however, has seen a steady rise over the last seven days. On an average, almost 37 deaths has been reported daily during the last seven days as compared to almost 35 the week before and 24 daily deaths a day a fortnight ago. The higher number of fatalities due to Covid-19 reported during the week, has led to an increase in the seven-day case fatality ratio (CFR) – fraction of deaths among those who tested positive for the infection – to over 1% for three days in a row. It was as low as 0.68% in mid-September as per the data. “We should not look at single day fatalities because the patients do not die the same day they are diagnosed with the infection, people who have been infected before die over a week or ten days. That is why we look at the ten-day average case fatality ratio. And, there will be a decline in the number of deaths also as the cases have declined,” health minister Satyendar Jain had said during a media interaction on Sunday.

29-09-2020||Delhi||Two pull woman down from bike, flee with gold chain in Delhi||A 50-year-old woman was dragged off a two-wheeler, and thrown on to a busy intersection even as vehicles zipped past her, by snatchers who violently tugged off her gold chain and drove away on their motorbike --- another incident that highlights the menace of street crime in the national capital.The woman, who works in a hospital, was left with a fracture in one arm, injuries to her head and knees, and may lose the use of her left ear because of the fall, said her husband, who was riding the motorcycle on which she was riding pillion at the time of the incident near Kashmere Gate on Friday night.Pramila Singh continues to be in hospital at Sushruta Trauma Centre in Civil Lines, and doctors say her condition is now stable. “But doctors have told us that she may have suffered permanent damage to her left ear,” Surender Singh said.The two motorbike-borne attackers are yet to be identified, police said. The couple live with their two sons in the MCD flats in North Delhi’s Jahangirpuri. Pramila Singh is a Grade IV health worker at the Girdhar Lal Maternity Hospital in Kamla Market, and her husband is a supervisor with the Delhi Jal Board. The crime occurred at around 8.45pm on Friday, when Surender was taking wife to the hospital for night duty. “We were on Ring Road, and close to Kashmere Gate ISBT, two men on a motorcycle pulled over close to us. The pillion rider violently tugged at my wife’s neck to snatch her gold chain,” said Surender. The violent jerks as his wife tried to fend off the attackers made Surender lose balance. Pramila, who was sitting with her legs to one side, fell on the road. “The snatchers managed to pull the chain off. I saw the pillion rider snatcher turn back and glance at us. He was masked, wearing a handkerchief,” Surender said.He added that his wife had a close shave as other passing vehicles swerved to avoid her, some barely avoiding running her over as she lay bleeding in the middle of the road.A motorist eventually stopped to offer the couple a ride to Sushruta Trauma Centre. Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (North), said a case of theft and ‘assault in attempt to commit theft of property’ has been registered at the Kashmere Gate police station. “We are checking CCTV footage for the suspects, but are yet to make a breakthrough,” the DCP said.On average, nearly 20 incidents of snatching and five robberies were reported every day in the capital till August 15 this year. Despite relatively empty streets during the lockdown, there was a 6% increase in snatching incidents this year compared to the corresponding period last year --- 4,257 till August 15 as compared to 4,010 in the same period in 2019. Robberies have, however, dipped by over 18% -- 1,086 cases till August 15 as compared to 1,333 in the same period last year.Vikram Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, said that snatching gold chains has become a lucrative crime because of the involvement of jewellers who buy the stolen property from them and go on to melt the jewellery, thus making it untraceable. “A few successful gold snatching a month earns these snatchers more than what an MNC executive makes. The police need to go after such jewellers if they intend to control this menace,” said Singh. He said that the pandemic has caused a lot of unemployment which is making the snatchers desperate to target people even at crowded and busy streets. “They also understand that the police is fatigued due to additional Covid duties. They know that the street patrolling is relaxed now as compared to earlier,” said the former UP Police chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-pull-woman-down-from-bike-flee-with-gold-chain-in-delhi/story-s8XO8Yp3iCGKmx6uPRDn9O.html
29-09-2020||Chandigarh||Rules go up in smoke as farm fires rage in Punjab||Farmers in Punjab, particularly in the Majha region --- comprising Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran districts --- have started burning the paddy residue early this year to prepare the fields for sowing vegetables. Agriculture department officials said potato and peas are sown in a significant portion of cultivable land in these regions. The farmers here prefer to cultivate the Pusa basmati-1,509 and some other hybrid varieties of paddy that ripen fast and thus are harvested early. Compared to 159 farm fires reported in the state till September 28 last year, as many as 520 incidents, most of them from Majha, have been witnessed during the corresponding period this time. Of the total 407 incidents that took place in the Majha region, 358 were in Amritsar, the state’s worst-hit district in terms of farm fires. Jagmohan Singh of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakunda) said the farmers have no option but to burn the paddy residue. “Since the government has not announced any incentive for straw management, the farmers are left with no option but to burn it. If the government is serious about stopping farm fires, it should announce Rs 200 per quintal funds for handling of straw,” Singh said.An agriculture department official said, “Actually, the farmers find burning of stubble the easiest method of disposing it even though it is a health hazard. Since the agriculture income is going down, they try to utilise the gap between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing by cultivating vegetables.” The government has deputed 8,000 nodal officers in paddy growing villages, with 23,500 machines being given to farmers for in-situ management of paddy straw. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has appealed to the farmers to shun the practice of burning straw on several occasions. At Devidas Pura village of Amritsar district where farmers were spotted burning the paddy straw, the HT team was asked to leave the place promptly. Some farmers said, “We are already facing harassment at the hands of government officials for burning the stubble. We cannot afford any method of managing the straw other than burning it.” But in some fields, labourers were seen lifting the straw with bailer machines and using tractor-trailers to transport it to the nearby sugar mills. Kulwant Singh, a farmer from Phoolke village near Batala in Gurdaspur district, said, “The farmers know the side-effects of burning stubble, but they still do it. In view of their precarious financial condition and increasing cost of cultivation, they cannot afford any other method of managing the residue.” “Nearly 80 per cent farmers have a land holding of 2 to 5 acres. The government asks us to buy a happy seeder machines to prevent stubble burning. This machine can be operated with a new model of tractor only. It costs around 11 lakh to buy such a tractor. How many of the farmers can afford to buy these machines?” he asks. Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Thatha village of Gurdaspur, said, “Without the government’s support, managing the residue with eco-friendly methods is not possible. As far as the use of bailer machines are concerned, a sizeable quantity of grain goes waste,” he added. The administration in Amritsar has imposed ₹55,000 fine on 15 farmers in the district, said deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khehra. Teams of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on Monday visited 150 villages after spotting 318 cases farm fires, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rules-go-up-in-smoke-as-farm-fires-rage-in-punjab/story-CVyyVCXO5HLjp7eP1lnqiK.html

29-09-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao doctors start pen-down strike over delayed salaries||Doctors of the north municipal corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital, a Covid-19 designated facility, are on a pen-down strike for three hours every day since the past week over the long delay in the payment of salaries. According to the hospital’s Residents Doctors Association (RDA), they were last paid on June 15 after they moved court over delayed wages. The doctors have warned that if they are not paid their dues by this month, they may have to stall work or go on a full-fledged strike from next month. “We have been working through the pandemic without being paid regularly for our job. It was the 105th day that we reported to work without having been paid our dues. Despite the high court’s directions, salaries have again not been paid for three months,” said Dr Abhimanyu Sardana, president of the RDA. The doctors do not attend to non-emergency patients and make reports between 9 am and 12 pm in the day to register their protest. On Monday, a doctor on Covid duty wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) overalls stood with a placard that read “Doctors on covid duty : Unpaid Day-105”. The doctors had approached the Delhi High Court in May over the non-payment of dues, after which salaries were paid till June. Sardana said if the scenario continues, they will be forced to hold an indefinite protest. The doctors’ association had written to the hospital administration on September 23. The association on Monday also wrote to the north corporation commissioner and the political representatives on the pending dues. Nursing staff, paramedics and safai karamcharis of the north body-run Kasturba Hospital were also on a partial strike until Monday over the non-payment of dues. Teachers of both the north and east corporations had also been staging demonstrations over the past 26 days against delayed salaries. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Monday met the protesting staffers of Kasturba Hospital and requested them to withdraw the agitation, seeking two months to resolve the issue. “The protesting employees withdrew their strike after I requested them to allow me time till November 30 to resolve the issue of their salaries. I have approached the Centre to help us with funds, as the corporation is suffering from a severe financial crunch. We will request the Delhi government once again to release our funds or else we will have to file a PIL regarding non-disbursal of funds due to the civic body under the basic tax assessment (BTA) head,” said Prakash. The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to requests for a comment. Prakash alleged that during the pandemic, the Delhi government cut funds due to the corporation under the basic tax assessment head by 57%. “Every government department or municipal body has been hit badly by the pandemic. However, such a drastic cut in the BTA, which has to be given by the state government, has been done only for the municipal corporation. In case of other government departments, the BTA has been cut only by 18%-19%. We are due to get ₹425 crore from the government under BTA,” said Prakash. The mayor said that to boost its revenue, the civic body will start an awareness campaign for the amnesty scheme launched to collect pending property tax from unauthorised regularised colonies. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain submitted a proposal in the House meeting on Monday, asking Delhi government to release funds due to it. “We are due to get a total of ₹1,050 crore from the Delhi government in the current financial year. We have been unable to pay our staff because of not having any funds,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hindu-rao-doctors-start-pen-down-strike-over-delayed-salaries/story-o0g5ZGbYGxtS7MkRdLF13N.html

Both Haryana and Delhi Police have launched a manhunt. The suspect, Sandeep Dahiya, 35, was posted at the Lahori Gate police station in north Delhi, officials said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said, “Multiple teams are now on a lookout for Dahiya. We are working in coordination with the Alipur police and our counterparts in Haryana,” said DCP Alphonse. Meham deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Shamsher Singh Dahiya said the suspect, a resident of Sisana village in Sonepat, has been booked under Section 302 (murder) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. He said that the victim’s family have told the police that the accused had threatened to kill him a few days ago.Witness to Alipur shooting Dahiya had fled after the shooting in Alipur. However, now the police have found a witness who was passing through the area and suffered a shrapnel injury in his leg. Police said Satbir (who goes by his first name) was on his way to Sonepat when he was injured. However, he did not realise when a shrapnel from the three bullets that Dahiya had fired at his woman friend got lodged in his leg. On Monday, a Delhi police team met Satbir in a Sonepat hospital where he is undergoing treatment. Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said Satbir is a key witness to the Alipur firing incident.Officials said Sandeep was in a relationship with the woman for over a year. She was found injured in the car on GT Karnal Road on Sunday evening by another police sub-inspector, Jaiveer, who took her to a nearby hospital. “On the way, the woman told him that Sandeep Dahiya, had shot her following an argument. She also told him that Dahiya had strained relations with his wife. We registered a case and formed teams to search for SI Dahiya. The woman suffered bullet injuries in her right shoulder and arm. Her condition is stable and is out of danger,” Sharma said, adding that they are probing whether Dahiya used his service weapon in the crime.

29-09-2020||Education||Students in Urdu-medium schools, struggle with worksheets in Hindi, English||Delhi government schools that use Urdu as the medium of instruction have been struggling to ensure uninterrupted learning to students amid the Covid-enforced restrictions because no online study material or worksheets in the language are being provided by the state’s education department, according to several officials and students in these schools. With schools shut since March and classes shifted online, government institutions -- where a majority of the students do not have access to smart devices and the internet -- are dependent on the worksheets or study material provided by Directorate of Education (DoE) for virtual learning. These worksheets contain both notes and questions. Students can either access them on their class WhatsApp groups, or their parents can physically pick them up from the schools. DoE has been providing worksheets every day for all subjects -- in both Hindi and English -- on a daily basis to all its schools. However, there are no worksheets in which Urdu is the language of instruction. The vice-principal of an Urdu-medium school in the Walled City said: “We receive at least 2-3 worksheets per class every day from DoE, but they are either in Hindi or English. It has become a major task for us to translate those for our students in their medium of studies on a daily basis. Though our students can understand both Hindi and English, if they do not read and write in Urdu script they will lose grip over the language.”There are around 20 government schools in Delhi offering Urdu-medium education that cater to around 20,000 students. Most of these schools are in the Walled City. After receiving the worksheets from their zonal offices, the teachers at these schools divide the work among themselves. They manually translate the worksheets, click pictures of them, and then send them to the students. The schools have also formed WhatsApp groups to share the translated study material with each other. A teacher at an Urdu-medium School in Jafrabad said, “It takes a day or two to translate the worksheets and send them to the students since only Urdu-knowing teachers can do that. Many of our teachers are acquainted with the language, but can’t write in the script. That’s why the translation work takes a lot of time and due to which the worksheets reach late to our students.”When contacted, a senior official in Delhi government’s education department said: “DoE is providing worksheets only in Hindi and English because they are the most preferred mediums in our schools. The education department has given independence to the schools to modify them or introduce anything suitable for their students. The teachers of Urdu-medium schools can either translate them or explain to the students through audios or videos. Many of them are already doing this.”An official in Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “The education department will assess the situation and will provide any other support required to ensure uninterrupted learning to these students.”Students at some schools say they are getting untranslated worksheets in Hindi. Nazir, 17, a Class 12 student at a school in Old Delhi that offers both Urdu and Hindi as mediums of instruction, said: “We are receiving all the worksheets in Hindi. The school has also allowed us to use a mix of Hindi and Urdu while attempting the worksheets. It will affect my fluency in the Urdu language, and I have to appear in board exams next year.”Manzar Ali Khan, member of the Delhi Minority Commission’s advisory committee, said, “It’s very important to have worksheets and study material in Urdu language for the students enrolled in Urdu-medium schools. If the students will continue study in any other language than it will affect their learning in their medium language. The government should look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-urdu-medium-schools-a-struggle-without-worksheets/story-6dyfVO6aC9ZNIh6y0oQaTP.html

The breakthrough happened 150 metres inside the NATM section of Civil Court underground station,” said Maha-Metro Managing Director Brijesh Dixit.Maha Metro is building two metro lines - Swargate-Nigdi and Vanaz-Ramwadi - of which 43 per cent work is complete.This is one of the two TBMs being used for tunnelling the up and down line in the underground section. The other TBM has also completed 1.5 km starting Agriculture College, according to Dixit.During the breakthrough, the tunnel boring machine entered accurately at the designated location by missing just ten mm target even as the permissible limit has been 100 mm.Atul Gadgil, director, director, Maha-Metro, said, “Metro officials and staff welcomed the TBM by hoisting a flag. The TBM is used to carry out drilling work with a huge cutter. At the same time, manual work was carried out at the Metro station work where the station area got dug. When the tunnel boring machine enters this manual tunnel, it is called a tunnel breakthrough.”The metro will run underground for a six-kilometre stretch, from Agriculture College ground to Swargate on Nigdi-Swargate line.Dixit said, “It is one of the major achievements of the Pune Metro. Now, this tunnel boring will start work to dig next tunnel which will go under the Mutha river.”There is a total of five underground metro rail stations on the six-kilometre stretch. The first station is at Shivajinagar, second is at Civil court, the third station is at Phadke Houd chowk, fourth is at Mandai and the last one is at Swargate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agri-college-shivajinagar-underground-metro-track-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/story-K1IFPINkbj0tRFov3c20KL.html

The data shows limited spread of infection on the NCL Pune office campus and colony area, indicating maximum care being taken by people regarding use of masks and sanitisers, besides washing hand frequently and other safety measures.” The serological testing began on September 12 at the NCL Medical Centre and concluded on September 17. The blood samples, along with health data, were sent to CSIR-IGIB for the serological analysis. This initiative is part of a pan-India project, named ‘Phenome India - A long-term longitudinal observational cohort study of health outcomes’, initiated by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and led by Delhi-based CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. Dr Shantanu Sengupta from CSIR-IGIB is coordinating the survey study. The CSIR-NCL team comprised scientists from the biochemical sciences division and doctors from the medical centre. “This research study involved testing of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in the people working in the CSIR labs and their family members. The CSIR-NCL and CSIR-URDIP represent the western region. Blood samples were collected from those who were willing to participate. The test was voluntary and open to all CSIR staff, including pensioners up to the age of 70, students, contractual staff and their families,” said Prabhakar Ingle, media advisor at CSIR-NCL, Pune. The serology test, also known as the Covid-19 antibody test, is a blood test that can detect if a person has antibodies to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Health parameters such as temperature, height, weight, oxygen level and blood pressure are noted in addition to collecting the blood sample.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-per-cent-volunteers-at-ncl-developed-antibodies-survey/story-uhNVdYWqZsyuIph8fDPs1H.html

Poor critical care infrastructure in these areas, is being cited as one possible factor.In comparison with Pune district, which includes cantonment boards and the nagar parishads, Pune district accounts for 22% or 1,320 fatalities in the age group of 51-60 years; also 1,776 deaths in the age group of 61-70 years. These are from a total Covid-related death toll of 5,954.In comparison, Dehu cantonment accounts for 30.3% or 492 deaths in the age group of 50-59, with 33.3% deaths from the 60-69-year age group.Also, the 14 nagar parishads have reported 32.8% deaths from the age group of 50-59 years and 19.7% deaths from 60-69 age group.With respect to critical healthcare too, Dehu cantonment has no oxygenated isolation beds; and no ICU beds with or without ventilators. The 14 nagar parishads in the district have 406 oxygenated isolation beds, 92 ICU beds without ventilators and 63 with ventilators.Ayush Prasad, CEO of Zilla Parishad said, “There is a 500-bed hospital in Maval taluka which borders Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) and is just six km from Dehu road cantonment board.”“The area is densely populated and most residents have retired. I cannot say what could be the exact cause, but the health facilities are within reach for anyone who needs it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehu-cantt-nagar-parishads-see-higher-number-of-fatalities-in-51-60-age-bracket-than-rest-of-district/story-mrYnrpXwE84W5yH338CPdJ.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Caste-related crimes on the rise in UP: AAP||Delhi minister for social welfare Rajendra Pal Gautam and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday condemned the sexual assault on a 19-year-old girl at Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. Talking about the incident in which the Dalit girl was assaulted by upper caste men, Gautam said there has been a “continuous rise” in the number of crimes against Dalits and Brahmins in UP. Bharadwaj said under the Yogi Adityanath government in UP, the condition of Dalits and Brahmins has deteriorated drastically. He also said that members of Thakur community have been appointed to most of the top positions since the CM belongs to the same caste. He said two other minor girls were targeted in the same district (Hathras) on August 24 and on August 14.“Looking into the crimes that are happening in Uttar Pradesh, we have found that Scheduled Castes and Tribes, OBCs and Brahmins are constantly being targeted. This is happening because of the attitude of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The morale of the people of a particular community is high because whenever the people associated with that community commit any crime, no action is taken against them. A recent survey has shown 25% of caste-related crimes are reported from UP followed by Madhya Pradesh. Both these states are run by BJP. On the other hand, in Congress-ruled Rajasthan caste-related crimes are also increasing,” he said. Gautam said that all such crimes should be stopped and the government should be proactive in handling these cases. Referring to the gang rape of the 19-year-old girl, a senior UP police officer said, “The police have arrested all the four accused named in the FIR. And the victim is undergoing treatment at Aligarh medical college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/caste-related-crimes-on-the-rise-in-up-aap/story-o8GJU9oIkyC5GdxGvIgWwK.html
29-09-2020||Delhi||Woman found murdered in Delhi’s Mohan Garden||A 26-year-old woman was found murdered with her throat slit and multiple stab wounds in her abdomen at her in-laws’ home in outer Delhi’s Mohan Garden near Ranhola on Saturday night, police said on Monday.A case of murder was registered at the Ranhola police station and the matter is being probed from various angles, including personal enmity, robbery attempt going wrong and family dispute, officers associated with the case said.“The first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Our probe is on,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan.The woman identified by her first name Manisha was married to Pankaj (first name) four months ago. The couple lived on the ground floor of a building, the first floor of which is occupied by Pankaj’s brother and his family. Pankaj is a motor mechanic and repairs cluster buses, the police said.A senior police officer associated with the case said Manisha’s body was discovered by her husband around 10 pm, when he returned home after work. The husband told the police that he had left home for work around 9.30 am, leaving his wife alone at home.According to Pankaj, when he returned home, he found the main door bolted from inside. But it did not make him doubtful because he had asked his wife to fasten the latch from inside before going to sleep as he usually returned home late in the night, Pankaj told police.“Pankaj unbolted the door by reaching the latch through the window. He went inside and found his wife bleeding and unconscious on the floor. Items in the room were scattered on the floor,” the officer said, quoting Pankaj’s statement.Pankaj raised an alarm, informed his brother and neighbours before calling the police control room. A police team reached there and took Manisha to a nearby hospital, where she was declared brought dead.Police spoke to Pankaj’s brother and his family members. But they claimed that since the air cooler in their house was on, they did not hear Manisha’s screams. The neighbours also did not hear anything.“The murder took place between 10 am and 10 pm on Saturday, during the period when the woman’s husband was away. Prima facie, it appears that the killer is known to the woman as there was a friendly entry in the house. The suspect knew how to fasten the main door’s rear latch through the window. Nobody has been given a clean chit, so far,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-found-murdered-in-delhi-s-mohan-garden/story-4OzLhOraFzwHEQh3YjUeRM.html

His swab samples were tested in a state-run laboratory which declared him Covid-19 positive on Sunday, a day before the case was to be heard in a special court on Monday.Mahato, the former poster boy of the Maoist-backed tribal movement that grabbed national headlines between 2008 and 2011, was recently inducted into the ruling TMC party after serving a jail term of eleven years.Also read: Despotic tendencies seen prominently’: Bengal Guv targets Mamata BanerjeeWhile the NIA had earlier questioned him in connection with an eleven-year-old case of hijacking of the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani Express, the agency had also sought his custody along with four others in connection with the murder case.None of the five accused appeared before the special court saying they were under home isolation after Mahato tested positive for Covid-19.“The NIA has sought that Mahato and four others be put under house arrest. All five have been asked to appear before the court on the next hearing. The next hearing is on October 12,” said Kaushik Sinha, Mahato’s advocate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/nia-seeks-tmc-leader-mahato-s-house-arrest-in-connection-with-murder-case/story-guPHAmuS53QvGuQqHd1hVN.html

29-09-2020||World||US intelligence reports warn of extremist threat around election||US security officials are warning that violent domestic extremists pose a threat to the presidential election next month, amid what one official called a “witch’s brew” of rising political tensions, civil unrest and foreign disinformation campaigns.FBI and US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memos say threats by domestic extremists to election-related targets will likely increase in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election. Those warnings so far have largely remained internal. But New Jersey’s homeland security office took the unusual step of publicly highlighting the threat in a little-noticed report on its website last week.“You have this witch’s brew that really hasn’t happened in America’s history. And if it has, it’s been decades if not centuries,” said Jared Maples, director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, which published the threat assessment. Nationwide protests in recent months over racial justice and police brutality have been largely peaceful, but some have led to violent confrontations, including between extremist factions from left and right. The United States is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment and a contentious presidential election in a polarized political climate. President Donald Trump last week declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election to Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump has sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election because of his concerns about mail-in voting, which Democrats have encouraged during the coronavirus pandemic.Documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare and election experts say it would be nearly impossible for foreign actors to disrupt an election by mailing out fake ballots.A recent internal FBI bulletin warned that domestic extremists with varying ideologies would likely pose an increasing threat to government and election-related targets in the run-up to the election, according to a person familiar with it. The bulletin was first reported by Yahoo News. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency “routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve,” but declined to comment on the specific document. A DHS memo dated to Aug. 17 said ideologically driven extremists and other actors “could quickly mobilize” to engage in violence related to the election. The document, also first reported by Yahoo News, was confirmed to Reuters by a person familiar with it. The memo said that lone offender white supremacists and other lone offenders with “personalized ideologies” pose the greatest threat of deadly violence. A DHS spokesperson directed Reuters to early September remarks by acting Secretary Chad Wolf, in which he said that the department “has taken unprecedented actions to address all forms of violent extremism, to specifically include threats posed by lone offenders and small cells of individuals.”IN THE SPOTLIGHTTrump and his top officials have not so far publicly highlighted any threat by violent extremist groups to the election.Trump officials have pointed the finger at left-wing anarchists and anti-fascists during protests against police brutality and racism over the summer, but federal court records provide little evidence showing those arrested for violent acts had affiliations to far-left groups. Last week, the top two DHS officials acknowledged in congressional hearings, however, that white supremacists have posed the most lethal domestic threat to the United States in recent years.FBI Director Christopher Wray said during congressional hearings earlier this month that his agency was conducting investigations into violent domestic extremists, include white supremacists and anti-fascist groups. He said the largest “chunk” of investigations were into white supremacist groups.White supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-government, and related ideologies were tied to 77 percent of 454 alleged domestic extremist murders in the past decade, according to data compiled by the Anti-Defamation League, a New York City-based anti-hate advocacy organization, and presented at one of the congressional hearings last week.National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot told Reuters that Trump’s highest priority is “protecting the U.S. from all threats, both foreign and domestic” when asked if the president had addressed the election threat publicly. Maples, the New Jersey homeland director, said his agency did not issue a pre-election threat assessment in 2016, but that it was necessary this time around.“We want our allies and folks across the state to recognize that we need to be thinking about this,” he said.The New Jersey report outlines three possible scenarios for the November election: a quick election outcome, a protracted process where determining a winner takes months and a legal battle that eventually goes to the Supreme Court.Each of the scenarios could lead to extremist violence, with the possibility of deadly confrontations between protesters and targeted violence toward police officers, the assessment concludes.The agency’s report says the extremists will likely be “anarchist, anti-government, and racially motivated,” but does not say which groups pose the greater threat.The domestic extremist threat has always been present, but is getting more attention this year, according to Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, which represents state-run “fusion centers” staffed by federal, state and local public safety personnel who monitor threats and facilitate information sharing. “We have always had threats during the national election cycles from violent extremists, including terrorist organizations,” he said. “With current events, it is more in the spotlight than ever.” The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank, said in a June report that the outcome of the election could incite violence by the far-right or far-left. “If President Trump loses the election, some extremists may use violence because they believe - however incorrectly - that there was fraud or that the election of Democratic candidate Joe Biden will undermine their extremist objectives,” the report reads. “Alternatively, some on the far-left could resort to terrorism if President Trump is re-elected.” (Reporting by Ted Hesson and Mark Hosenball in Washington, Kristina Cooke in Los Angeles, Editing by Ross Colvin and Alistair Bell)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-reports-warn-of-extremist-threat-around-election/story-YgUFuGAA0TRXwC3bE4h1QN.html

29-09-2020||World||Sheikh Sabah, Kuwaiti leader who tried to heal rifts, dies at 91||Kuwait’s ruler Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, a seasoned diplomat who tried to heal rifts between feuding Gulf states and rebuilt ties with former foe Iraq, has died. He was 91.According to the constitution, the emir should be succeeded by Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, 83, a half brother who has served as interior minister and deputy chief of the national guard. Sheikh Nawaf has been acting emir since Sheikh Sabah left Kuwait for treatment in the US The energy-dependent monarchy, whose 1.4 million citizens are among the world’s wealthiest by average per capita income, is home to about 8.5% of global oil reserves, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Oil and gas account for about 40% of Kuwait’s economic output and more than 90% of export revenues.As foreign minister for more than 40 years, Sheikh Sabah sought to make Kuwait a regional power broker by mediating intra-Arab disputes, maintaining strong ties with the US and U.K., and rebuilding relations with Iraq after the fall of President Saddam Hussein, who had invaded Kuwait in August 1990. At home, he on occasion dismissed parliament, entrenching a struggle with the legislature that often led to political and economic stalemate.The death of the emir could reopen debates over the nation’s political system, according to Shafeeq Ghabra, a political science professor at Kuwait University. Democracy watchdog Freedom House categorizes Kuwait as “partly free,” citing constraints on freedom of speech and assembly while noting that it has an elected parliament that often challenges the government.‘Viable mediator’“It’s a transition, there will be changes, there could be reconciliation, there could be challenges, there could be some power vacuum,” Ghabra said. “To his credit, the emir has managed a very thoughtful foreign policy for a small country, and he was the only viable mediator in the Gulf crisis” that pits Qatar against an alliance of Arab states.Sheikh Nawaf, while a largely unknown quantity to many Kuwaitis, shares similar character traits, said Ghabra. “He’s reflective, and sometimes when you get someone like that, he’s not extremely opinionated. It allows for others to come around and find common ground.”The Gulf standoff was the defining cause of Sheikh Sabah’s last few years in power. He sought to resolve the conflict among Gulf Cooperation Council states triggered when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain slapped an embargo on Qatar over its ties to Iran and alleged funding of terrorism. Qatar remains under boycott, but Kuwait has maintained relations with both sides of the dispute, while keeping open a channel of communication with Iran.At home, the charismatic Sheikh Sabah was a tactical ruler and largely revered by his own people. Still, he maintained a strong hold on power and fended off opposition-led street protests in the wake of the Arab Spring revolts demanding an overhaul of Kuwait’s democracy. He instead undertook only minor modifications while dissolving parliament multiple times and changing the electoral system in 2012 to limit the number of candidates voters could pick in their constituency.During his tenure, successive governments pushed to one side difficult decisions over issues including trimming expensive subsidies and introducing taxes. The executive and legislative powers have often failed to see eye-to-eye on the implementation of key economic reforms. Political dysfunction led to a revolving door at the critical oil ministry, with ministers rarely lasting long in office.Budget deficitsUnder successive governments during Sheikh Sabah’s rule, Kuwait’s economy stagnated, dependent almost entirely on swings in energy prices as diversification efforts never moved past the blueprint phase. The sharp decline in oil prices after 2014, combined with a lavish welfare system, left the country running persistently large budget deficits. Kuwait has forecast its biggest-ever shortfall in the current fiscal year, predicted to reach 40% of gross domestic product, compounded by lower oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.Sheikh Sabah was born in Kuwait on June 16, 1929, before the country became a wealthy oil exporter. He was the fourth son of a former emir, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who ruled from 1921 to 1950, and was educated by Kuwaiti schools and private tutors. He named New York among his favorite places, frequented Oman on fishing trips and was an avid fan of FC Barcelona.In 1962, he became minister for guidance and information, a year before being appointed foreign minister, a post he held until he became prime minister in 2003. In the 1970s and ’80s, he was information minister, in addition to foreign minister and deputy prime minister from 1978.Sheikh Sabah was named emir in 2006. Even before that, he had assumed the role of de-facto ruler when other leading family members were too ill or frail to do the job. He took the leadership mantle after Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, who was emir for nine days, was voted out of office by parliament on the grounds that he was too ill to rule.Sheikh Sabah was a widower and is survived by three sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sheikh-sabah-kuwaiti-leader-who-tried-to-heal-rifts-dies-at-91/story-HBMOBOvsgSzll96rN9IFjL.html
29-09-2020||World||Boris Johnson apologises for getting his own Covid-19 rules wrong||Boris Johnson apologised after wrongly explaining his own government’s coronavirus restrictions, in a gaffe that will fuel growing criticism of his response to the pandemic.“Apologies, I misspoke today,” the UK Prime Minister said on Twitter. It was the third time in three hours that government spokespeople had failed to be clear on the new rules that are being brought in at midnight Tuesday to combat the disease in northeast England.Earlier skills minister Gillian Keegan had simply admitted she did not know the answer during a radio interview, while Johnson’s spokesman James Slack told reporters on a call that the details would be set out later.When the premier himself was asked whether people in the north east could socialize with other households, he suggested they could, in groups of no more than six.“In the northeast or other areas where extra tight measures have been brought in, you should follow the guidance of local authorities, but it’s six in a home, or six in hospitality but as I understand it not six outside, that’s the situation there,” Johnson said.Later he tweeted: “Apologies, I misspoke today. In the North East, new rules mean you cannot meet people from different households in social settings indoors, including in pubs, restaurants and your home. You should also avoid socializing with other households outside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-apologises-for-getting-his-own-covid-19-rules-wrong/story-ynHtR7OLYdWGdpVbjKunMK.html
29-09-2020||World||Why the coronavirus death rate still eludes scientists||Global deaths from Covid-19 have reached 1 million, but experts are still struggling to figure out a crucial metric in the pandemic: the fatality rate - the percentage of people infected with the pathogen who die.Here is a look at issues surrounding better understanding the Covid-19 death rate.How is a death rate calculated? A true mortality rate would compare deaths against the total number of infections, a denominator that remains unknown because the full scope of asymptomatic cases is difficult to measure. Many people who become infected simply do not experience symptoms.Scientists have said the total number of infections is exponentially higher than the current number of confirmed cases, now at 33 million globally. Many experts believe the coronavirus likely kills 0.5% to 1% of people infected, making it a very dangerous virus globally until a vaccine is identified.Researchers have begun to break down that risk by age group, as evidence mounts that younger people and children are far less likely to experience severe disease.“The death rate for people below age 20 is probably one in 10,000. Over the age of 85 it is around one in 6,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.What is a “case fatality rate”?There has been an apparent decline in death rates when measured against the number of new infections confirmed by coronavirus testing. In places like the United States, that “case fatality rate” has fallen dramatically from 6.6% in April to just over 2% in August, according to Reuters statistics.But experts said that the decline has largely been driven by more widespread testing compared with the early days of the pandemic, detecting more people who have mild illness or no symptoms. Improvements in treating the severely ill and protecting some of the highest-risk groups, are also credited with improving survival.“We are much more aware of potential complications and how to recognize and treat them,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security in Baltimore. “If you are a patient who gets Covid-19 in 2020, you would much rather get it now than in March.”  What does that mean for individuals, and governments?That highlights the need for continued vigilance, as some countries begin to experience a second wave of infections.For example, researchers in France estimate that country’s case fatality rate fell by 46% by the end of July compared with the end of May, driven by an increase in testing, improved medical care and a greater proportion of infections occurring in younger people, who are less likely to experience severe disease.             “Now, we are seeing a fresh rise in hospitalizations and ICU (intensive care unit) registrations, which means this discrepancy is about to end,” said Mircea Sofonea, a researcher with Montpellier University in France. “We will have to understand why.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-the-coronavirus-death-rate-still-eludes-scientists/story-0AtanKfgIkGln6HFYyZnSI.html
29-09-2020||World||Afghan peace negotiator urges new era in relations with Pakistan||Abdullah Abdullah, the visiting chief of Afghanistan’s peace negotiating team, told Pakistan on Tuesday that the time has come for the neighbouring countries to shun the suspicion, “stale rhetoric” and tired conspiracy theories that have dogged past relations.In a speech at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, the chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation said the two countries need better prospects as both have paid a high price by facing various terror groups that are still acting as spoilers. “We need to cooperate with other like-minded countries against such elements,” he noted. “We do not want a terrorist footprint in our country or to allow any entity to pose a threat to any other nation.”“We are facing series of threats and challenges that include various shades of terrorism, extremism and intolerance, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.“The time is now for both our nations to make a strategic detour, define a new vision, address outstanding issues as well as our shared interests, realise that peace and stability in Afghanistan, or any country in our South and Central Asian geography for that matter, can have far-reaching constructive consequences and ripple effects, by setting course on a new path towards neighbourliness and greater regional economic integration.”“This is my first visit to Pakistan after 12 years. I and my accompanying delegation want to take this opportunity to thank the civilian and military leadership, the civil society, including Pakistan’s vibrant intellectual community, but particularly all citizens of Pakistan from all walks of life for their warm welcome and hospitality.”He said that Pakistan played a critical role in facilitating this talks, and has even a more important role to play hereon to support the process through a successful end and standing with the people and government of Afghanistan in building a peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood.He said that there is a need to constantly remind ourselves that Afghanistan today is not the country of 1996 or 2001. It is a young, diverse, connected nation, eager to freely decide its own future form of government corresponding to its unity and diversity. This transformed nation also want to preserve its core accomplishments including the rights and liberties of all men and women of all communities and groups in Afghanistan. “We expect the intra-Afghan process to reach an agreement on rules and procedure followed by an agenda. Meanwhile, we call on all sides to agree to seriously reduce violence and protect civilians from further harm as we aim for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.”The council led by Abdullah represents the Afghan government in historic peace negotiations with the Taliban which began in Qatar on September 12. Those talks represent the most serious effort yet at ending decades of war in Afghanistan that followed the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled its Taliban government, which was then hosting al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden who planned the September 11 terror attacks. The terrorist leader was later located in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad and killed by US marines in a raid in 2011.The Afghan-Taliban talks come after a deal signed in February between the US and the Taliban. That aims to allow the US to withdraw from Afghanistan and end the longest military engagement in American history.Many Taliban leaders have lived in Pakistan since the 1980s. In those years, they were part of the Afghan mujahedeen, allies of the US in ending the 10-year occupation of the country by the Soviet Union.Pakistan has denied giving sanctuary to Taliban members following their ouster in 2001. However, both Washington and Kabul routinely accuse Islamabad of giving them a safe haven, citing the Taliban’s long ties with Pakistan’s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-negotiator-urges-new-era-in-relations-with-pakistan/story-paoUg3W4tVnfFwwHi8jIgM.html
29-09-2020||World||Joe Biden’s tax plan forecast to raise $3 trillion over 10 years||Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s tax plan would raise $3 trillion over 10 years. Biden looks more likely than President Donald Trump to pick up spare electors. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi is making backup plans for a contested election.That’s the amount that Biden’s tax plan would raise over the next decade, although it would even out to only about $2.65 trillion after accounting for economic effects from higher levies on companies and wages, according to new a analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation.The bottom 20% of earners would see their after-tax income increase 10.8%, partially due to an increase in the child tax credit. The top 1% of earners would see their incomes decrease 9.9% as a result of higher levies on income, capital gains and additional payroll taxes.Trump’s campaign has run ads saying that Biden’s tax plan would crush the middle class, but the data show that the bottom 80% of taxpayers would all see increases to their income in 2021 under the Democrat’s policies.Over a decade, those individuals would see slight decreases because of indirect effects of higher taxes on businesses. -- Laura DavisonBiden Looks More Likely Than Trump to Pick Up Spare ElectorsBoth Biden and Trump hope to pick up a spare elector in Maine or Nebraska that could decide the presidency. But, for now, Biden has the edge.The two states break up their electors by congressional district, which gives Trump an opportunity in rural Maine, where he won an elector in 2016, and Biden a shot in Omaha, where Obama won an elector in 2008.A New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday showed 48% of likely voters in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District backed Biden and 41% supported Trump, with 11% undecided.Biden is also ahead by 4 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls in Maine’s Second District.Six out of seven scenarios presented by the Trump campaign earlier this month had Trump winning at least one elector in Maine, including two in which it provided the winning margin. None showed him losing in Nebraska.The poll of 420 likely voters in Nebraska’s Second District was conducted Sept. 25-27. It had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 5.3 percentage points.Pelosi Makes Plans for Electoral College TieIn case this election hasn’t been strange enough already, Pelosi is making public plans in case of an Electoral College tie.There are plausible, though still unlikely, scenarios in battleground states in which Biden and Trump tie at 269-269, both failing to reach the 270 electors needed to win outright.If that happens, the presidential race is thrown to the House in January. But there’s a twist: Each state only gets one vote. And while Democrats have the majority in the House right now, Republicans control 26 state delegations.In a letter to Democratic colleagues, Pelosi urged them to support the House Majority political action committee to try to win a handful of races that could tip more state delegations in their favor.“Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats,” Pelosi wrote in the letter. “It’s sad that we have to plan this way, but it’s what we must do to ensure the election isn’t stolen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-tax-plan-forecast-to-raise-3-trillion-over-10-years/story-GjwpPpB41XjhQn7KeAiS9O.html
29-09-2020||World||China says it doesn’t recognise ‘illegal’ UT Ladakh, denies it’s building military bases near LAC||China on Tuesday said it does not recognise the “illegally” constituted Ladakh union territory, adding it was opposed to India building military infrastructure in the border areas.The Chinese foreign ministry said neither India nor China should engage in activities in the border region that could complicate the situation, brushing aside its own infrastructure-building by saying it was on their side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Beijing also denied reports that it had built new military bases near LAC, saying they were driven by “ulterior motives”.Responding to a question on India building a high-altitude road network in Ladakh, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: “China has not recognised Ladakh union territory illegally set up by the Indian side. We are opposed to conducting infrastructure development for military purposes in the border area.”India’s strengthening of infrastructure in the region comes amid the worst border tension with China in decades in eastern Ladakh, where border troops from the two countries are locked in a face-off since May.“Based on the two sides’ consensus, no side should engage in the border areas in any activities that might complicate the situation to avoid undermining two sides’ efforts to ease the situation,” Wang added.China had responded strongly in August, 2019, after New Delhi had stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and bifurcated the state as two separate union territories of J&K and Ladakh.“China has always opposed India’s inclusion of Chinese territory in India’s administrative jurisdiction in the western part of the Sino-Indian border. This position is firm, consistent and has never changed,” the foreign ministry had said in a statement at the time.“In recent days, the Indian side has continued to undermine China’s territorial sovereignty by unilaterally amending its domestic laws. This practice is unacceptable and will not produce any effect,” the 2019 statement had said.When Wang was asked on Tuesday to comment on China’s advanced infrastructure in the region, he initially denied that Beijing was building new military facilities in the region.“First, some institutions once released the so-called information on new military bases or facilities China has built on its side. Such reports are completely false. They are driven by ulterior motives,” Wang said.Then he went on to add that Beijing follows all border agreements signed with India. “Second, China consistently and strictly abides by the agreements signed with the Indian side. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability along the border with India; at the same time, we firmly safeguard our sovereignty, territorial integrity and security.“For a long time, (the) Chinese side have been conducting activities on the Chinese side of the LAC and they have always complied with relevant agreements.”The spokesperson added: “We hope the Indian side to work for the same purpose, together with China to achieve the cooling of temperature on the ground and to prevent adding complex factors to the two sides’ concerted efforts to ease the situation.”Wang was also asked to comment on the quadrilateral, or Quad, meeting of officials from India, Australia, and the US in Japan next week.External affairs minister S Jaishankar will hold talks with his counterparts from the US, Japan and Australia in Tokyo on October 6 for the Quad meeting. They will discuss their common regional concerns, such as China’s increasingly assertive actions, in the first face-to-face ministerial meetings Japan will host since the coronavirus pandemic began, the Associated Press news agency reported.Wang warned that no “exclusive clique” should be formed, indicating that Beijing was closely following the development and progress of the Quad.“Peace, development and global cooperation is the overriding trend of today’s world. Multilateral and plurilateral cooperation should all be open, inclusive and transparent. No one should seek an exclusive clique,” he said.“Efforts should be made to enhance regional countries mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting a third party or harming third party’s interests.”“We hope the relevant county will proceed from the interests of regional countries and do more things conducive to regional peace, stability and development instead of the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-doesn-t-recognise-illegal-ut-ladakh-denies-it-s-building-military-bases-near-lac/story-F8YXQ1IPEbosZwJynEKzhI.html

29-09-2020||World||Afghan peace negotiator urges new era in ties with Pakistan||The chief of Afghanistan’s peace negotiating team said Tuesday on a visit to Pakistan that the time has come for the two neighboring countries to shun the suspicion, “stale rhetoric” and tired conspiracy theories that have dogged past relations.Abdullah Abdullah is in Pakistan on a bridge-building mission meant to mend deep-rooted mistrust between the two countries. It was his first visit in 12 years.Abdullah told the Institute of Strategic Studies in the federal capital of Islamabad that the two neighbors are on the threshold of a new relationship characterized by “mutual respect, sincere cooperation and shared prosperity.”“I am a firm believer that after many troubling years, we now need to go beyond the usual stale rhetoric and shadowy conspiracy theories that have held us back,” Abdullah said. “We cannot afford to pursue business as usual. We need fresh approaches and our people demand it. It is more urgent than ever to look to our region as one region. ”His statements come ahead of meetings later Tuesday with Pakistan’s powerful army chief and prime minister. His visit also comes at a crucial time in Afghanistan’s troubled history as a government-appointed negotiation team is in the Gulf state of Qatar brokering an end to war with its Taliban foes.Even before coming to power in 2018, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has advocated for a political end to Afghanistan’s war and has been a strong critic of Washington’s so-called war on terror saying it has left tens of thousands of Pakistanis and Afghans dead.But many in Afghanistan have been critical of the support the Taliban received in Pakistan following the collapse of their rule in 2001 with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan argues its relationship with the Taliban was what gave it leverage to press the religious militia into negotiations.Still, Afghans are deeply suspicious of Pakistan and government officials fear Pakistan’s continued involvement in their country as a means to counter its hostile neighbor India’s influence in Afghanistan. Pakistan and India have gone to war three times and both Pakistan and India accuse each other of using Afghan territory to undermine stability in the region.Pakistan has come under international criticism for its support for some militant groups and opposition to others. While Pakistan’s military and politicians say that policy has been relegated to the past, Islamabad’s neighbors remain suspicious.“We do not want a terrorist footprint in our country or to allow any entity to pose a threat to any other nation,” Abdullah said Tuesday. “The current intra-Afghan talks offer the best hope to put the war behind and using patience, dialogue and compromise to agree to unite the country. ”Abdullah and the United States, which brokered the peace deal with the Taliban to start negotiations with the government, have been pressing for talks to be accompanied by a reduction in violence.The Taliban have refused.“We call on all sides to agree to seriously reduce violence and protect civilians from further harm as we aim for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire,” Abdullah said.Still the violence continues and on Tuesday in Afghanistan’s central Day Kundi province a roadside bomb killed at least 14 civilians, including five children, as they travelled from one district to another, said Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian.“Peace is not only an Islamic tenet and duty, but it is also that unique historical opportunity that should not be squandered,” said Abdullah. “Now that the ice has been broken, we all have a role and a responsibility to help it move toward fruition and prevent a relapse.”_______Associated Press writer Tameem Akhgar in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-negotiator-urges-new-era-in-ties-with-pakistan/story-8EVKpgpysI1rQY4NXdCPFM.html

29-09-2020||World||No drug test, no handshakes at opening presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden||There will be no drug tests before the first of the presidential debates on Tuesday, as US President Donald Trump has been demanding. There will be no handshakes either, most probably, when Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden come face-to-face for the first time.“Joe Biden just announced that he will not agree to a drug test,” Trump tweeted on Monday amid huge outrage following a New York Times report that said the US president paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and nothing at all in 10 of the last 15 years. “Gee, I wonder why?” he added.Trump and his allies have sought to portray that Biden is mentally and physically unfit for the US presidency, and that he has been performing better on the campaign trail because of some performance-enhancing drug.“He’s almost - no. I have no comment,” Biden said on Sunday at a press meet, playfully dismissing a question about Trump’s demand for a drug test. His campaign was more straightforward, though. “Vice-President Biden intends to deliver his debate answers in words,” a Biden spokesperson told Politico. “If the president thinks his best case is made in urine, he can have at it.”Chris Wallace, a popular Fox News anchor who will moderate the first debate, is almost certainly not going to touch any of that. The Commission on Presidential Debate, which was established in 1987 to conduct debates for presidential and vice-presidential nominees, has said Wallace has picked six broad topics for Tuesday’s debate, split into 15-minute segments: the Trump and Biden records, the Supreme Court, Covid-19, the economy, race and violence in US cities, and the integrity of the election.Presidential debates are crucial for voters tuning into the elections at this stage, including many who are undecided on who to vote for.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-drug-test-no-handshakes-at-opening-presidential-debate-between-donald-trump-and-joe-biden/story-NsEO04SE3A9hbQ5MFlkcHO.html

He was 82.“A distinguished cabinet minister, parliamentarian and soldier, Jaswant Singh will be remembered for his service to the Indian Republic and his lasting contributions to the US-India partnership,” the South and Central Asia Bureau of the US State Department said in a tweet.“Our deepest condolences to his family and the people he served,” it said.Strobe Talbott, a former American diplomat, described Singh as an extraordinary and wise man.“Extraordinary man, wise and principled servant for his country and the world, brave soldier, honorable statesman, diplomat of finesse and effectiveness, author of wide scope, proud, loved, and loving husband and father, and friend,” Talbott said in a tweet.Talbott, who served as the Deputy Secretary of State from 1994 to 2001, was the lead negotiator for the US with Singh after Washington imposed sanctions on India following the 1998 nuclear tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-condoles-death-of-jaswant-singh-hails-his-role-for-strengthening-of-indo-us-partnership/story-1wUGCS7p0gV06vn86TRdCM.html
29-09-2020||World||Joe Biden set to carve own brand of tough-on-China policy if elected||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is preparing to face tough questions in Tuesday’s debate on how he would approach China if he wins the White House in November.His team is privately acknowledging that they expect the issue to be a focus during the first debate in Cleveland, Ohio, according to a person familiar with their planning. Over the past week, Biden advisers have honed in on questions about the world’s second largest economy – anticipating attacks from President Donald Trump on the former vice president’s record of dealing with Beijing.If he beats Trump, Biden will need to decide whether to scrap, keep or escalate the billions in tariffs levied against Chinese imports, and whether to stick to or renegotiate the partial trade deal Trump signed in January.He’d have to determine if his administration continues the sanctions imposed on Chinese officials for their crackdown on human rights in Hong Kong and the western region of Xinjiang and possibly expand those sanctions further.Biden would also inherit a litany of restrictions to cut off Chinese technology companies’ access to American intellectual property and a patchwork of relationships across the region that could help, or complicate, tensions with China.PrioritiesBiden’s campaign advisers say they would prioritize domestic issues like investing in research and development and US manufacturing to compete with Beijing from a position of strength -- and deal with international matters like trade later. But the multifaceted rivalry with China will be difficult to ignore, and senior policy advisers including longtime Biden hand Jake Sullivan and former deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken have already publicly conceded as much.“China poses a growing challenge. It’s arguably the biggest challenge we face from another nation-state,” Blinken said last week at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “I don’t think the question is who’s tough or who’s weak on China. The question is who has the most effective strategy to protect and advance our security, our prosperity, our values.”On the campaign trail to date, Biden has offered little detail on how he’d deal with China’s economic ascent -- perhaps to maintain maximum flexibility should he win the election. In some instances, he may have a hard time undoing existing policy. Both parties in Congress have overwhelmingly been in favor of tougher actions against Beijing on tech, human rights and trade.Trump has touted his record on China frequently, boasting he’s the toughest president and the first to take on the Asian giant. The president’s campaign has produced multiple TV ads focusing on Biden’s past comments that China’s rise was good for the US.By comparison, Biden’s ads have criticized Trump for downplaying the threat of the virus as it spread in China and for policies that allowed the Chinese nation to grow stronger.Here’s a look at some of the key economic and trade issues related to China that’ll confront Biden if he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20 and what we have gleaned from his statements so far:Phase OneThe deal forged earlier this year has fallen short in one of Trump’s crucial selling points: China’s commitment to buy an extra $200 billion of American goods and services over two years. According to Bloomberg Economics, China so far has only purchased about half of what would be needed to stay on track to reach the annual target.Full-year data for the trade flows will be public in February 2021 -- shortly after Biden would take office – and analysts expect those numbers to disappoint as well.Biden has attacked Trump for praising the deal and prioritizing it over holding Beijing accountable for the coronavirus spread earlier this year. But his campaign hasn’t said whether he’d keep or nix the deal.Biden would have to decide if he’d build on the agreement in a second phase or renegotiate the terms of the existing deal.Asked about a potential phase-two agreement in a Biden administration, Blinken listed subsidies and cyber theft as some of the areas where Trump’s deal underperformed and said “we would have to come back and actually engage on the systemic issues that continue to pose a real problem when it comes to our commercial relationship with China.”TariffsBiden could face some pushback if he unwinds the tariffs, which have bipartisan support in Congress as well. So far, he hasn’t committed one way or the other.He says he’ll immediately review all of Trump’s trade actions and called the president’s approach to tariffs “short-sighted and destructive.”“I will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy—a plan—to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness,” Biden said in response to a questionnaire from the United Steelworkers union.There’s widespread belief among China watchers that Biden will not remove existing tariffs -- at least not in the short-term.“He’s going to be way more cautious on removing tariffs than people expect, because that’s money. That’s money coming in,” said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore. “After they’ve been in place for a certain amount of time, the tariff revenue is baked into the budget, and you’d need to find an offset to account for that.”Still, what to do on tariffs wouldn’t necessarily have to be a binary choice. Biden could decide to lower the duty rate for certain products or increase the amount of exclusions for industries that have been hurting.Technology RaceBiden said he’d heavily invest in American R&D to counter China’s technological innovation and acknowledged that certain Chinese companies pose a national security risk to the US.As president, he would have to decide whether to continue the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign against Chinese tech firms and inhibiting American companies from supplying them.Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, says “there’s a lot of uncertainty about the tactics” but the strategy of pushing back on Chinese technology will probably remain.One thing the business community is hoping for: more adherence to the rule of law when it comes to actions on national security grounds, says Steven Okun, senior adviser for consulting firm McLarty Associates. Under the Trump administration, the definition of national security has expanded to capture areas like competition and human rights.The Trump administration this month cited national security when it announced a ban on China’s WeChat and TikTok from U.S. app stores. A federal judge this week temporarily blocked the White House’s ban on TikTok, but the Commerce Department vowed to defend the underlying executive order from legal challenges. Separately -- to avoid a ban --Tiktok parent ByteDance is negotiating with Oracle Corp. and the U.S. government to take a stake in the Chinese company.Blinken noted the Biden team would hone in on commercial cyber espionage after Beijing fell back on a 2015 agreement between Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that laid out “very clear demands and specific consequences if China did not seize espionage against U.S. businesses.”But “trying to fully decouple from China, as some have suggested, I think is unrealistic and ultimately counterproductive,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-set-to-carve-own-brand-of-tough-on-china-policy-if-elected/story-QeD6DtMorFKP6DtcsDQgrJ.html

They have asked residents to use alternative numbers while they work to correct the issue, allegedly caused by a technical failure in Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing services.As Microsoft was earlier quoted as saying that a “subset of customers in the Azure Public and Azure Government clouds may encounter errors,” it is believed to have caused the 911 outages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-departments-across-us-report-911-outage-some-restored/story-tyXQXAsVZPK4LkzS7752EJ.html
29-09-2020||World||Mexico ups Covid-19 ‘estimate’ to 89,612 deaths||Mexico upped its “estimated” Covid-19 deaths to 89,612 on Monday, and boosted estimates of its total number of cases to 870,699, almost 137,000 more than it previously recognized.Even with the new estimated death toll, Mexico is still in fourth place world wide behind India, which has 95,542 deaths. But in the case of infections, the new estimates would boost Mexico from eighth place in total cases, to fifth place, behind Russia with about 1.15 million cases.Mexico has about 76,600 test-confirmed deaths and 733,717 test-confirmed cases. But officials acknowledge those are significant undercounts, because the country does so little testing: only about 1.6 million tests have been done so far.In a nation of almost 130 million, that means that only about one in 80 Mexicans has ever had a test. About 40% of all tests are positive, because only people with significant symptoms are tested.Mexico had previously published “estimated” figures based on tests still awaiting results, which sometimes takes weeks.But the new estimates released Monday by the Health Department are higher because they were calculated by adding two new groups: those who never were tested but had symptoms, and those who had tests which could not be analyzed because the samples were not handled properly. The new figures also include a proportion of pending results.Officials revealed Sunday that almost 96,000 test swabs — equal to about 5% of all tests in Mexico — had to be thrown out because they never reached a lab, arrived too late or were not preserved in the right conditions to be tested.The new estimates are likely to revive debate about Mexico’s death toll, because to date the Mexican government has avoided adjusting its death toll upward to account for people who died at home or weren’t tested.Some parts of the country like Mexico City have begun conducting their own recalculations, finding “excess deaths” likely caused by coronavirus were at least double official figures.The issue is a significant one in Mexico, because President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has frequently compared Mexico’s death rates to those of other countries in a bid to convince the public that his administration isn’t doing a bad job at handling the pandemic.But those appear to be unsound comparisons, because many other countries have attempted to adjust official figures to account for spikes in deaths that coincide with virus outbreaks.Mexico’s top coronavirus official said Sunday that definitive data on the country’s death toll from Covid-19 won’t be available for “a couple of years.”“When will the final statistics on deaths from Covid-19 be ready? Certainly, a couple of years after the first year of the pandemic,” Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said, adding that work would be left to the country’s statistics institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-ups-covid-19-estimate-to-89-612-deaths/story-F4wQiLYBWs9uf7f2FpAHgN.html
29-09-2020||World||Worldwide death toll from coronavirus eclipses 1 million||The worldwide death toll from the coronavirus eclipsed 1 million on Tuesday, nine months into a crisis that has devastated the global economy, tested world leaders’ resolve, pitted science against politics and forced multitudes to change the way they live, learn and work.“It’s not just a number. It’s human beings. It’s people we love,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of medical history at the University of Michigan who has advised government officials on containing pandemics and lost his 84-year-old mother to Covid-19 in February.“It’s our brothers, our sisters. It’s people we know,” he added. “And if you don’t have that human factor right in your face, it’s very easy to make it abstract.”The bleak milestone, recorded by Johns Hopkins University, is greater than the population of Jerusalem or Austin, Texas. It is 2 1/2 times the sea of humanity that was at Woodstock in 1969. It is more than four times the number killed in the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean.Even then, the figure is almost certainly a vast undercount because of inadequate or inconsistent testing and reporting and suspected concealment by some countries.And the number continues to mount. Nearly 5,000 deaths are reported each day on average. Parts of Europe are getting hit by a second wave, and experts fear the same fate may await the US, which accounts for about 205,000 deaths, or 1 out of 5 worldwide. That is far more than any other country, despite America’s wealth and medical resources.“I can understand why ... numbers are losing their power to shock, but I still think it’s really important that we understand how big these numbers really are,” said Mark Honigsbaum, author of “The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris.”The global toll includes people like Joginder Chaudhary, who was his parents’ greatest pride, raised with the little they earned farming a half-acre plot in central India to become the first doctor from their village.After the virus killed the 27-year-old Chaudhary in late July, his mother wept inconsolably. With her son gone, Premlata Chaudhary said, how could she go on living? Three weeks later, on Aug. 18, the virus took her life, too. All told, it has killed more than 95,000 in India.“This pandemic has ruined my family,” said the young doctor’s father, Rajendra Chaudhary. “All our aspirations, our dreams, everything is finished.”When the virus overwhelmed cemeteries in the Italian province of Bergamo last spring, the Rev. Mario Carminati opened his church to the dead, lining up 80 coffins in the center aisle. After an army convoy carted them to a crematory, another 80 arrived. Then 80 more.Eventually the crisis receded and the world’s attention moved on. But the pandemic’s grasp endures. In August, Carminati buried his 34-year-old nephew.“This thing should make us all reflect. The problem is that we think we’re all immortal,” the priest said.The virus first appeared in late 2019 in patients hospitalized in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first death was reported on Jan. 11. By the time authorities locked down the city nearly two weeks later, millions of travelers had come and gone. China’s government has come in for criticism that it did not do enough to alert other countries to the threat.Government leaders in countries like Germany, South Korea and New Zealand worked effectively to contain it. Others, like U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed the severity of the threat and the guidance of scientists, even as hospitals filled with gravely ill patients.Brazil has recorded the second most deaths after the US, with about 142,000. India is third and Mexico fourth, with more than 76,000.The virus has forced trade-offs between safety and economic well-being. The choices made have left millions of people vulnerable, especially the poor, minorities and the elderly.With so many of the deaths beyond view in hospital wards and clustered on society’s margins, the milestone recalls the grim pronouncement often attributed to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin: One death is a tragedy, millions of deaths are a statistic.The pandemic’s toll of 1 million dead in such a limited time rivals some of the gravest threats to public health, past and present.It exceeds annual deaths from AIDS, which last year killed about 690,000 people worldwide. The virus’s toll is approaching the 1.5 million global deaths each year from tuberculosis, which regularly kills more people than any other infectious disease.But “COVID’s grip on humanity is incomparably greater than the grip of other causes of death,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. He noted the unemployment, poverty and despair caused by the pandemic, and deaths from myriad other illnesses that have gone untreated.For all its lethality, the virus has claimed far fewer lives than the so-called Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 40 million to 50 million worldwide in two years, just over a century ago.That pandemic came before scientists had microscopes powerful enough to identify the enemy or antibiotics that could treat the bacterial pneumonia that killed most of the victims. It also ran a far different course. In the US, for example, the Spanish flu killed about 675,000. But most of those deaths did not come until a second wave hit over the winter of 1918-19.Up to now, the disease has left only a faint footprint on Africa, well shy of early modeling that predicted thousands more deaths.But cases have recently surged in countries like Britain, Spain, Russia and Israel. In the United States, the return of students to college campuses has sparked new outbreaks. With approval and distribution of a vaccine still probably months away and winter approaching in the Northern Hemisphere, the toll will continue to climb.“We’re only at the beginning of this. We’re going to see many more weeks ahead of this pandemic than we’ve had behind us,” Gostin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worldwide-death-toll-from-coronavirus-eclipses-1-million/story-ZUN6epmRoOIQ3A0X0qNNAL.html
29-09-2020||World||Canada at risk of another lockdown as coronavirus cases surge||Canada’s two largest provinces have warned they may have to lock down parts of the economy again after a spike in Covid-19 cases.Quebec, which has had more virus deaths than 40 US states, is an epicenter of the problem. The province has about 5,000 active cases, a 71% jump from the beginning of August, and is on the verge of closing bars and restaurants again in its two biggest cities, Montreal and Quebec City. Hospitalizations went up 26% in six days.Ontario, the largest province with 14.7 million people, reported 700 new cases Monday, the most ever in a day, though it’s also testing far more people than it was in spring. A group of hospitals called on Premier Doug Ford’s government to revert to stricter “stage two” measures in Toronto and Ottawa, which would mean restricting or closing indoor businesses such as gyms, movie theaters and restaurants.“It’s up to each of us. Together our collective actions will decide if we face a wave or a tsunami,” Ford said Monday at a news conference during which he pleaded for residents to follow rules and get the flu vaccine -- but did not move the province back to stage two.It’s a reversal of fortune for a country that avoided the summertime spike that hit the US As the pandemic got worse in Sun Belt states, a largely compliant Canadian population hunkered down and wore masks.Provincial governments, which set the rules for most companies, allowed the vast majority of businesses to open up again, sometimes with capacity limits and new sanitation rules. In Toronto, the financial capital, many restrictions were lifted on July 31.As Labor Day neared, virus cases started to rise again. They flared in British Columbia, praised for its early handling of the crisis. Nationally, active cases have more than doubled since Sept. 1, to 12,759. Almost 95% are in the four largest provinces, with the greatest problems in big cities.Six months of restrictions left some Canadians just as restless as their counterparts in the rest of the world. Across the country, the spike in new cases is being driven by social gatherings among people in their 20s and 30s, fed up with social distancing and hoping to take advantage of the last weeks of warm weather.“What we’ll tell people is: Stay home. We’re going to ask for a considerable social sacrifice,” Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube said in an interview on Radio Canada late Sunday. “There’s going to be difficult decisions for bars and restaurants” he added, as Quebec City and Montreal are about to be declared a “red zone,” the highest level in the province’s alert system.The greater concern is that Covid-19’s toehold is becoming a foothold just as the country begins its rapid slide through autumn to winter, said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. This coronavirus survives and stays in the air longer in cold, dry weather, he said -- people’s mucous membranes are less effective at filtering it out and infection rates are much higher indoors. Despite a run on fire pits and patio heaters, most policy makers are not expecting Canadians to dine outside in sub-zero temperatures.Lower MortalityOne bright spot in the situation is the relatively low mortality rate in Canada. With the tragic exception of elder care facilities in Ontario and Quebec, where death rates soared early on, Canada’s fatality rate, per capita, is less than half that of the U.S. since the pandemic began -- roughly 25 people per 100,000 population versus 63 in the U.S.As treatments have improved, along with better protection for the elderly and, crucially, greater testing -- and therefore identification -- of cases in younger people, so have the mortality numbers.But while a lower fatality rate is good news, it doesn’t protect hospitals from being overwhelmed by a surge in cases, especially during flu season. And there are significant health consequences with the virus, Furness said.“If we focus just on the death rate, eventually everyone is going to say this is no big deal,” Furness said. “We should reframe our understanding of Covid as vascular disease that causes widespread brain damage in the population.”For policy makers and politicians, protecting the hospitals, which already have enormous backlogs of delayed surgeries, and keeping the schools open are key. But the rising numbers threaten disruption on all fronts.“If politicians do not have the political fortitude to reintroduce some restrictions, then our risk of sliding into something much worse -- like the U.K. or Spain -- that’s still on the table,” said Furness. Canada needs to implement rapid testing across the country, tighten definitions on “non-essential” travel and hold the line on 14-day quarantine periods for those who have been out of the country, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-at-risk-of-another-lockdown-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-FoG72mw5HPAoGGjt2YRVXK.html
29-09-2020||World||Fires lash California wine country, fueled by wind, heat||Another round of wildfires is ripping through Northern California, forcing evacuations and casting thick smoke over the region as hot weather and high winds leave the state perilously dry.A blaze in the wine country north of San Francisco more than quadrupled in size overnight to 11,000 acres, tearing through a region devastated by fires just three years ago. The fire, along with a second one in Shasta County, came even after PG&E Corp. cut power to about 195,000 people in an attempt to keep its electric lines from sparking blazes.PG&E shares dropped the most in three months Monday, though the company said in an internal memo that there are no indications its equipment was involved in the fires.Across California, more than 36,000 square miles -- an area about the size of the entire state of Indiana -- is under threat from critical fire conditions, affecting about 5.8 million people, the U.S. Storm Prediction Center said. And blazes are spreading fast, fanned by dry winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, with gusts as high as 60 mph.Governor Gavin Newsom urged people to heed evacuation orders and leave immediately when authorities sound the alarm.“So many of the people that have lost their lives were just cautious in terms of taking seriously those orders,” Newsom said in a media briefing. “We really, really cannot say it enough. Please heed local law enforcement. Please listen to them when they raise that alarm bell.”California has been battered for weeks by rounds of extreme weather that state officials say have been fueled by climate change. Last month, a record-breaking heat wave triggered the state’s first rotating power outages since the 2001 energy crisis -- and was followed just three weeks later by another one. More than 8,000 wildfires have burned a record 3.7 million acres this year, choking cities with smoke, killing at least 26 people and destroying more than 7,000 structures.On Monday, more than 18,000 firefighters were battling 27 major blazes across the state.Shares of PG&E -- which went bankrupt last year after its equipment ignited catastrophic fires -- fell 5.5% Monday. The company told its employees that it has no information indicating that its equipment was involved in the start of either the Glass Fire in Napa County or the Zogg Fire in Shasta County, according to the memo obtained by Bloomberg News.The causes of the blazes remain under investigation.The Napa County fire broke out early Sunday and was raging uncontrollably northeast of Santa Rosa, triggering thousands of evacuations. The area was devastated in 2017 by the Tubbs Fire, which was among the most destructive in California history.About 180 miles north, the Zogg Fire in Shasta County has already burned 7,000 acres, prompting more evacuations. Butte County, meanwhile, issued an immediate evacuation order for some communities on Sunday due to the ongoing North Complex Fire.Nearly half the state is under an air quality alert. Smoke from the new blazes is already reaching Bay Area cities that have been choked for weeks by bad air from blazes across the region.While winds are forecast to ebb in Northern California late Monday, potentially giving firefighters a break, the heat will continue. High temperatures in Sacramento are expected to hit 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) on Monday and rise to 101 degrees by Wednesday. Los Angeles may hit 101 on Wednesday. Newsom warned that strong offshore winds could develop overnight in Southern California and said state officials are dispatching firefighters there in case blazes break out.Utilities across the US West are increasingly cutting power ahead of wind storms to reduce the chances of their live wires igniting blazes. In Southern California, investigators are looking at a power line owned by Edison International’s Southern California Edison as part of their probe into a fire that’s burning in the mountains near Los Angeles.PG&E began shutting off power on Sunday to parts of 16 counties. The move affected about 65,000 homes and businesses, or about 195,000 people based on the size of the average California household. The company issued an “all clear” for crews to start inspecting lines on Monday, and said it expects to restore power to “the large majority” of customers by the end of the day.The outages were considerably smaller in scope than previous ones. Earlier this month, PG&E cut power to about 172,000 homes and businesses -- or about 516,000 people -- as high winds raked California. PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in July after settling wildfire claims for $25.5 billion.California’s peak wildfire season traditionally runs from September through November. It has grown longer and less predictable in recent years, with blazes coming as late as December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fires-lash-california-wine-country-fueled-by-wind-heat/story-jLwB7zr7vf3I1yvXOcJAhI.html
29-09-2020||World||Warning signs flash ahead of Covid’s second US winter; more deaths expected||Public health officials in the US could take heart at the end of the summer. Even as the new coronavirus continued to spread, fewer people were winding up in the hospital because of Covid-19, and fewer were dying.Now, as the seasons turn, there are signs suggesting there will be more deaths and serious illness ahead.Data collected by the Covid Tracking Project shows that the number of people hospitalized has plateaued at about 30,000 in the past week, after a decline from nearly 60,000 that began in late July. Deaths, meanwhile, averaged about 750 over the seven days through Sunday, higher than the roughly 600 deaths a day in the first week of July.Scientists had hoped that a warm-weather reprieve could soften an expected re-emergence of the coronavirus in the colder months. Instead, the contagion continued to spread across the country after Memorial Day, with early-summer outbreaks in Sun Belt states followed by the recent surge of new infections in the Upper Midwest and on college campuses nationwide.Any indication hospitals are attending to more coronavirus patients is likely to reignite concerns that the health-care system could be overwhelmed by new cases as the weather cools and more activities, including school and holiday socializing, move indoors.History and science suggest the second winter with coronavirus is likely to be worse than the first. The pathogen is more entrenched and most respiratory viruses circulate primarily in the winter months.“We haven’t had exposure to Covid throughout an entire winter, when more people are indoors and close together for prolonged periods,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. “We are certainly concerned that Covid could spread even more readily in the winter than it has so far.”More TestingThe Trump administration has pointed to the increasing availability of coronavirus tests as the reason the number of new cases in the US remains high. Diagnostics manufacturers are now shipping more than 1.2 million tests nationwide each day, up from 600,000 at the start of May, according to AdvaMed, a trade group for the medical-technology industry.Increased testing has also made it possible to catch coronavirus cases earlier. That, combined with improved hospital care and medicines like Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, allowed more patients to survive their infections this summer.However, a week-long plateau in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are an early warning that things could be about to get worse. Along with the resumption of school, more states are easing curbs on restaurants and bars, giving the virus more chances to find vulnerable people to infect. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis lifted capacity limits on restaurants and other businesses.“It’s not complicated to explain. All of that opening up, so many people taking off their masks, gathering together in bars and parties, going back to the old normal,” Schaffner said. “We should not be surprised that we are seeing an increase in Covid again. Covid loves that environment.”States that had been doing well, including New York, which was wracked early on by the virus, are seeing a new surge. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said there were 868 new cases in the state on Sept. 27, an 18% increase from two weeks earlier. A higher percentage of those getting tested are now coming back positive, suggesting the amount of virus in the community is on the rise.Cases in KidsSimilar increases are happening among the nation’s children, as more than 56 million returned to school this month. More than a quarter of a million children were infected with coronavirus from March through Sept. 19, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While those hardest hit were more likely to have other conditions, about three of every four who were hospitalized, needed intensive care or died had no other health concerns, the CDC said.The number of cases among children has increased dramatically since the start of September, when many went back to school in person at least part time.Coronavirus cases in those 19 and younger have increased three-fold since May, according to the CDC, suggesting they may play an increasingly important role in community transmission even if their individual risk of serious illness is low.“School studies suggest that in-person learning can be safe in communities with low SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but might increase transmission risk in communities where transmission is already high,” the agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warning-signs-flash-ahead-of-covid-s-second-us-winter-more-deaths-expected/story-H9oDI2qhycJnl9g8k2I5qM.html
29-09-2020||World||Donald Trump tax moves stir questions about potential legal exposure||Deductions for haircuts, consulting fee write-offs, a family estate that is treated as a business property and an aggressive refund claim could open President Donald Trump to legal risks once he’s out of office.An analysis published by the New York Times based on more than two decades of Trump’s tax returns the news organization obtained show that Trump took aggressive tax positions and that the IRS is challenging a $72.9 million refund claimed a decade ago in an audit that has yet to be resolved.If the Internal Revenue Service ultimately prevails, Trump could be liable for millions of dollars in penalties. He potentially could be subject to criminal prosecution if the IRS mounted a case that he knowingly violated the law, though that would be very difficult to do, according to tax professionals.“Any taxpayer that would have these issues before the IRS should be rightfully concerned,” said Joseph Opich, a tax partner at law firm Paul Hastings. “The law places strict liability on the taxpayer. You are responsible for what goes on your return. There is no defense for ‘my accountant did it’.”The revelations about Trump’s tax returns and finances unfolded just two days before the first debate between the president and Democratic nominee Joe Biden and 36 days before the election. Trump, who has struggled with persistently low public approval ratings throughout his presidency, trails Biden in every recent national poll.Trump has called the New York Times reporting “fake news” but hasn’t offered a rebuttal on the substance. In a tweet Monday he said he was “entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits.”Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s re-election campaign, said in an interview on Fox News on Monday that “the president has paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes” and the Times story is “not accurate.”He didn’t say which parts of the story are wrong, and he didn’t specify whether Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in income taxes. Trump’s conglomeration of businesses, the Trump Organization, has likely paid tens of millions of dollars in payroll taxes over the years.Several things in the Times’ reporting would be “ripe for review” by the Internal Revenue Service, Robert McKenzie, a partner at law firm Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr LLP, said. Paying consulting fees to employees to generate business deductions, as Trump allegedly did with his daughter Ivanka Trump, is likely to run afoul of tax rules, he said.Plus, he said the IRS is closely watching so-called conservation easement deals, like the one Trump did with his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, New York. That generated a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction for Trump. The location also created other tax savings because Trump reportedly treated it an investment property for tax purposes while public statements on the Trump Organization website say it was used as a family retreat.Trump may be able to turn to some case law to defend his $70,000 worth of write-offs for hair styling for his signature look, McKenzie said. A 1994 case, Hess v. Commissioner, found that an exotic dancer could write-off the cost of exceptionally large breast implants, typically a non-deductible personal cost, because they were helpful for her job but too big to be comfortable in everyday life.“Trump, because he’s an entertainer, may survive that,” he said.Civil penalties generally start around 20% for negligence, but can be as high as 75% of any underpayment, plus interest if civil fraud is involved.Criminal penalties can be as high as $100,000 fines and up to five years of prison time. But criminal tax violations are harder for the government to prosecute because they require willful and knowing violations of the law“For jail time, you’d have to show intent, that he deliberately defrauded the government,” Michael Sullivan, a former IRS auditor, said.” They’d need to have memos in the files or email showing that. The reality is I don’t know if you can show that.”The U.S. Constitution is silent about whether a sitting president can face criminal charges, but the Department of Justice has a long-standing policy to not indict the Oval Office holder on the grounds that the individual would be unable to perform official duties.Statute of LimitationsThe IRS can generally go back three years to investigate tax returns, but there are a number of exceptions to the typical federal three-year statute of limitations that could give the agency more leeway to investigate.The IRS has six years to audit if the taxpayer leaves off more than 25% of their income from their tax return or they omitted at least $5,000 of foreign income. If the tax return is fraudulent or the taxpayer doesn’t report a gift of at least $100,000 from a foreigner, then the IRS has no time limit.Because of the open audit for 2010 detailed in the Times reporting and because the $72.9 million refund that year was connected to tax losses and profits in several other years, it’s possible that the IRS could still audit all the years tied to the large refund. In all likelihood, it’s possible many of the issues are already under review by the IRS in the ongoing audit.Trump has said he has been continuously under audit for years and that’s why he hasn’t followed the tradition of presidential candidates making their tax returns public. There is no prohibition on Trump releasing his tax forms while the IRS is still examining them.Trump is also subject to an annual audit specifically designed for presidents and vice-presidents. Those audits are the center of the lawsuit between the House Ways and Means Committee and the Treasury Department.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who is leading the lawsuit for the president’s tax documents and memos about the presidential audits, said the findings show the need for the courts to decide his case in his favor.Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said if his party wins a Senate majority in November, increasing funding for the IRS to crack down on wealthy tax cheats will be a top priority for him.Separately, a New York prosecutor has been engaged in a lengthy legal battle to obtain Trump’s records, but the case is still being fought in an appeals court and is unlikely to be resolved until after the Nov. 3 presidential election.Frank Agostino, founder and president of Agostino & Associates P.C., said the Times’s findings raise questions about the complexity of the tax code and the responsibility of tax preparers that will be discussed for years to come.“If the Trump children can receive the family fortune without the payment of gift taxes, what does it say about personal responsibility?,” he said. “Does our voluntary compliance self-assessment system work for the very wealthy taxpayer looking to take advantage of every loophole available? Is there a patriotic duty to pay ‘your fair share?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tax-moves-stir-questions-about-potential-legal-exposure/story-HdqwAPxTRSzQ9UeVII6JvN.html
29-09-2020||World||Donald Trump labeled Black voters ‘deterrence’ in 2016: Report||Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign reportedly sought to deter millions of African Americans from voting by targeting them with misleading advertisements on Facebook, according to an investigation broadcast Monday by Channel 4 News in London.The investigation revealed that Trump’s 2016 digital team used data to separate voters into eight different “audiences” and target them with tailored advertisements. About 3.5 million Black voters were categorized as “Deterrence” -- or voters who were not likely to vote for Trump and could potentially be deterred from voting at all.Channel 4 alleged that the Trump campaign attempted to dissuade Black voters from backing Democrat Hillary Clinton by targeting them with advertisements that misstated her record on racial issues.The Trump campaign dismissed the Channel 4 story. “This is fake news,” said Communications Director Tim Murtaugh. “President Trump has built a relationship of trust with African American voters,” said Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh.The news comes as Facebook already faces backlash for widespread misinformation and misleading advertisements on its platform.Trump is faring badly with Black voters again in 2020, with single-digit support.The cache of data on almost 200 million American voters obtained by Channel 4 showed that African Americans were disproportionately included in the “deterrence” category in 16 key battleground states, some of which Trump won by a small margin.In Georgia, Black voters make up 32% of the population but accounted for 61% of the “deterrence” category. In North Carolina, Black voters made up 46% of that category, even though they are 22% of the state’s population, and in Wisconsin, where they constitute 5.4% of the population, 17% were labeled as “deterrence.”More than half of the voters in the “deterrence” category were people of color, the investigation found.In October 2016, Trump’s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations aimed at depressing Clinton’s vote total. The ads highlighted her 1996 comments about young Black men being “super predators.”The campaign also targeted African American voters through Facebook “dark posts”-- nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls.(Adds Trump campaign comment in in fourth paragraph; 2016 ads in 10th, 11th)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-labeled-black-voters-deterrence-in-2016-report/story-14sajcVFPDoshGmrommCMI.html
29-09-2020||World||‘It’s like God has no sympathy’: California residents face fire anguish again||Northern California’s wine country was on fire again Monday as strong winds fanned flames in the already scorched region, destroying homes and prompting overnight evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people.Residents of the Oakmont Gardens senior living facility in Santa Rosa boarded brightly lit city buses in the darkness overnight, some wearing bathrobes and using walkers. They wore masks to protect against the coronavirus as orange flames marked the dark sky.The fire threat forced Adventist Health St. Helena hospital to suspend care and transfer all patients elsewhere.The fires that began Sunday in the famed Napa-Sonoma wine country about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of San Francisco came as the region nears the third anniversary of deadly wildfires that erupted in 2017, including one that killed 22 people. Just a month ago, many of those same residents were evacuated from the path of a lightning-sparked fire that became the fourth-largest in state history.“Our firefighters have not had much of a break, and these residents have not had much of a break,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.Sonoma County Supervisor Susan Gorin evacuated her home in the Oakmont community of Santa Rosa about 1 a.m. She is rebuilding a home damaged in the 2017 fires. Gorin told the San Francisco Chronicle that she is numb, and the situation feels surreal.“It’s like God has no sympathy, no empathy for Sonoma County,” she said.More than 53,000 people in Sonoma and Napa counties have been evacuated in the latest inferno, one of 27 major fire clusters burning across the state, said Berlant. Many more have been warned that they might have to flee, even though officials expect winds to ease into Tuesday.The Glass Fire broke out before 4 a.m. Sunday and merged with two other fires to scorch 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) as of early Monday. Officials did not have an estimate on the number of homes destroyed or burned, but the blaze engulfed the Chateau Boswell Winery in St. Helena and at least one five-star resort.Logan Hertel of Santa Rosa used a garden hose to fight flames at a neighbor’s house in the Skyhawk neighborhood until firefighters could relieve him.“Seems like they got enough on their hands already. So I wanted to step in and put out the fire,” Hertel said.Dominic Wiggens, who lives in the same neighborhood, evacuated but returned later Monday. His home was still standing, but many others were gone. “It’s so sad,” he said.Pacific Gas & Electric was inspecting its equipment as it sought to restore power to more than 100,000 customers who had it turned off in advance of gusty winds and in areas with active fire zones. The utility’s equipment has caused previous disasters, including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills.Evacuations were also ordered in Shasta County as the Zogg Fire spread over 23 square miles (59 square kilometers). Residences are widely scattered in the forested area in the far northern part of the state. The region was torched just two years ago by the deadly Carr Fire — infamously remembered for producing a huge tornado-like fire whirl.The causes of the new fires were under investigation.Mark Ghilarducci, director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said 2020 has been challenging.“The silver lining to it is that people who live in California become more prepared, they’re more aware, they know these events take place and we’re seeing a citizenry that does get it and is working hard to be prepared,” he said.Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.The latest fires erupted as a giant ridge of high pressure settled over the West, producing powerful gusts blowing from the interior toward the coast while slashing humidity levels and raising temperatures.So far in this year’s historic fire season, more than 8,100 California wildfires have killed 26 people, scorched 5,780 square miles (14,970 square kilometers), and destroyed more than 7,000 buildings.Most of the losses occurred after a frenzy of dry lightning strikes in mid-August ignited a massive outbreak of fires.Fire worries were developing Monday across Southern California, although it was unclear how strong the predicted Santa Ana winds would become. Heat and extreme dryness were also expected to create problems.Conditions were also hot, dry and windy in parts of Arizona, where the Sears Fire in Tonto National Forest north of Phoenix has grown to more than 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) since it erupted Friday. Authorities reported zero containment.___Associated Press reporters John Antczak in Los Angeles, Juliet Williams in San Francisco and Haven Daley in Santa Rosa, California contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-like-god-has-no-sympathy-california-residents-face-fire-anguish-again/story-t6Rzf4dM1aKM2uPb2lAg8I.html

29-09-2020||World||New adviser giving Trump bad information on coronavirus, top US officials say||Two senior US public health experts have raised concerns that White House adviser Scott Atlas is providing misleading or incorrect information on the coronavirus pandemic to President Donald Trump, according to media reports on Monday.The top US infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Monday he was concerned that information given by Atlas - a late addition to the White House coronavirus task force - was “really taken either out of context or actually incorrect.”The comments from Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, came hours after a news report quoted Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sharing similar concerns.“Everything he says is false,” Redfield was quoted as saying during a Friday telephone call while on a plane from Atlanta to Washington, NBC reported. Redfield later told NBC that he was speaking about Atlas.Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases, has faced scrutiny for downplaying the importance of face masks and his reported views on “herd immunity,” an approach that holds that once enough individuals have been infected and become immune, others are less likely to be infected.The White House insists it is not pursuing such a strategy, although Trump has mentioned it himself, and repeated on Monday his view that the United States was “rounding the corner” on the pandemic.Atlas’ views on handling the pandemic have been denounced by his peers at Stanford University’s medical school and other health experts.Atlas on Monday defended his advice to the president. “Everything I have said is directly from the data and the science,” he said in a statement released by the White House.In a statement, the CDC said comments about Atlas overheard by NBC were just one side of a “private discussion regarding a number of points he has made publicly about Covid-19.”The agency said Redfield differed with Atlas on mask wearing, youth Covid-19 infections and herd immunity status, but agreed with him on many other issues.White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said Trump’s advisers sometimes disagreed, and that the president made policy decisions based on all the information he received.The White House had no immediate comment when asked if Redfield’s position was in jeopardy.“When the president loses confidence in somebody, you will know it,” said one senior administration official.‘NOWHERE NEAR THE END’The United States, which has not had a coordinated federal-led response to the virus, has recorded more than 7.1 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 205,000 deaths, both the highest in the world. Health experts fear a second wave of infections as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors.Both Fauci and Redfield were conspicuously absent from a White House Rose Garden event on Monday where Trump hailed plans to ship 150 million rapid tests to US states before asking Atlas to speak.At the event, Atlas acknowledged that increased social mingling and testing were causing a rise in Covid-19 cases in parts of the country, but predicted changes when a vaccine was finalized and rolled out.“Fear is not the issue here,” he said. “We really have a handle on what’s going on.”In the phone call, Redfield also said the threat from the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, contradicting the more upbeat assessments by Trump and Atlas.“We’re nowhere near the end,” Redfield said.Trump earlier this month dismissed congressional testimony by Redfield about when a vaccine could be broadly rolled out, saying the CDC director was “confused.” He previously blasted Redfield for saying face coverings could be as effective as a vaccine.“If every one of us did it, this pandemic would be over in eight to 12 weeks,” Redfield told NBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-adviser-giving-trump-bad-information-on-coronavirus-top-us-officials-say/story-LRNX9DCxrIXMrxQhCgM6ZO.html
29-09-2020||World||Covid-19: States to get 150 million tests to re-open economies, schools, says Trump||US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) said that 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests will be distributed to states across the country in the coming weeks.Speaking at a press briefing, Trump said, “In the old days when we just started this you remember we’d go out and we’d have to find these massive laboratories with tremendously expensive equipment. Now we’re down to something, that you’ll see, is really from a different planet.”“We’re announcing our plan to distribute 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests in the coming weeks,” he said.He also said that 100 million will support efforts to “reopen economies as quickly as possible, including testing for high-risk communities and educators”.Further, 50 million test kits will be given to the vulnerable communities, such as the elderly in nursing homes and hospice care agencies, and one million test kits will go to historically black colleges and tribal nation colleges, Trump added.According to a report by The Hill, the Abbott tests, which are cheaper and faster than lab tests, return results in about 15 minutes and are already widely used in nursing homes under a program set up by the Trump administration.Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence said during the press conference that more cases of coronavirus will be registered due to the “historic advance in testing”.“With cases in positivity rising in ten states in the Midwest and the near west and with this historic advance in testing that’s being distributed 150 [million] strong around the country, President, the American people should anticipate that cases will rise in the days ahead,” he said.According to the latest data by the Johns Hopkins University, as many as 7,139,734 people in the US have tested positive of Covid-19 and 204,967 deaths have been reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-states-to-get-150-million-tests-to-re-open-economies-schools-says-trump/story-5kPdfpA6WKDH9nBREP7ELP.html
29-09-2020||World||China holds simultaneous military drills in four seas, again||China began five military exercises simultaneously along different parts of its coast on Monday, the second time in two months it will have such concurrent drills against a backdrop of rising regional tension.Two of the exercises are being held near the Paracel Islands in the disputed South China Sea, one in the East China Sea, and one in further north in the Bohai Sea, the Maritime Safety Administration said in notices on its website.In the southern part of the Yellow Sea, drills including live-fire exercises will be held from Monday to Wednesday, it said in another notice.All ships are prohibited from entering the area, it said.In a bid to train a combat-ready military force, China holds military drills periodically, but rarely do multiple exercises happen at the same time.Last month, China announced four separate exercises, from the Bohai Sea to the East and Yellow Seas and down to the disputed South China Sea, in what Chinese military experts said was a rare arrangement of drills.The United States sent spy planes into a no-fly zone over Chinese live-fire military drills last month. In response, China lodged “stern representations” with the United States.China and the United States have recently been at loggerheads over a range of issues from Taiwan to the coronavirus pandemic to trade and human rights.China has also held frequent military activities near Chinese-claimed Taiwan and has taken the usual step of declaring that such drills are directed at Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-holds-simultaneous-military-drills-in-four-seas-again/story-06GhfXbkF2dn71yrZZuPIM.html
29-09-2020||India||China reiterates it does not recognise ‘illegal’ Ladakh UT||Beijing China on Tuesday said it does not recognise the “illegally” constituted Ladakh Union territory, adding that it was opposed to India building military infrastructure in the border areas.The Chinese foreign ministry said neither India nor China should engage in activities in the border region that could complicate the situation, brushing aside its own infrastructure-building by saying it was on its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Beijing also denied reports that said it had “built new military bases on or facilities along the LAC are completely false descriptions driven by ulterior motivesword/s missing”.Responding to a question on India building a high-altitude road network in Ladakh, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: “China has not recognised Ladakh union territory illegally set up by the Indian side. We are opposed to conducting infrastructure development for military purposes in the border area.”India’s strengthening of its infrastructure in the region comes amid the worst border tension with China in decades in eastern Ladakh, where border troops from the two countries have been locked in a faceoff since May.“Based on the two sides’ consensus, no side should engage in the border areas in any activities that might complicate the situation to avoid undermining two sides’ efforts to ease the situation,” Wang added.In August 2019, India divested the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of the special status it was granted under Article 370 of the Constitution, and decided to bifurcate it into Union territories -- J &K and Ladakh. China had responded strongly then.India has strongly maintained that Ladakh is an internal matter and rejected China’s comments. “China has always opposed India’s inclusion of Chinese territory in India’s administrative jurisdiction in the western part of the Sino-Indian border. This position is firm, consistent and has never changed,” the foreign ministry had said in a statement.“In recent days, the Indian side has continued to undermine China’s territorial sovereignty by unilaterally amending its domestic laws. This practice is unacceptable and will not produce any effect,” the 2019 statement added.When Wang was asked on Tuesday to comment on China’s advanced infrastructure in the region, he first denied that Beijing was building new military facilities in the region.“First some institutions once released the so-called information on new military bases or facilities China has built on its side. Such reports are completely false. They are driven by ulterior motives,” Wang said.Then he went on to add that Beijing follows all border agreements signed with India.“Second, China consistently and strictly abide by the agreements signed with the Indian side. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability along the border with India; at the same time, we firmly safeguard our sovereignty, territorial integrity and security”.“For a long time, (the) Chinese side have been conducting activities on the Chinese side of the LAC and they have always complied with relevant agreements.”The spokesperson added: “We hope the Indian side to work for the same purpose, together with China to achieve the cooling of temperature on the ground and to prevent adding complex factors to the two sides’ concerted efforts to ease the situation.”Wang was also asked to comment on the meeting of foreign ministers from India, Australia, and the US in Japan next week under the informal Quad security forum .Wang warned that no “exclusive clique” should be formed, indicating that Beijing was closely following the development and progress of the Quad.“Peace, development and global cooperation is the overriding trend of today’s world. Multilateral and plurilateral cooperation should all be open, inclusive and transparent. No one should seek an exclusive clique,” he said.“Efforts should be made to enhance regional countries’ mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting a third party or harming a third party’s interests.”“We hope the relevant country will proceed from the interests of regional countries and do more things conducive to regional peace, stability and development instead of the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-reiterates-it-does-not-recognise-illegal-ladakh-ut/story-OV33KBjX2AyJrxLE1mEt2O.html
29-09-2020||India||‘Male victimisation’: IPS officer seen beating wife on suspension order||Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday suspended senior IPS officer Purushottam Sharma whose video beating his wife went viral on social media on Sunday, following which he was shifted from the post of director of Public Prosecution, Madhya Pradesh on Monday, as per a government’s order. The suspension order came from the home department after the 1986 batch IPS officer, having a special director general rank in police department, submitted his reply to a show-cause notice served on him on Monday evening by the department of Home. Home department’s suspension order stated, “Purushottam Sharma (1986), the then director, Public Prosecution directorate, is hereby suspended with immediate effect prima facie in view of his conduct found in violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 and his reply to a show cause notice issued in regard with viral videos in social media on September 27, being found unsatisfactory and inadequate. During the period of suspension his headquarters will be police headquarters, Bhopal.” However, Sharma termed the suspension order as unfortunate and one-sided. He said, “The state government took the decision (to suspend me) without looking into my reply. I submitted the reply at 5.30 pm today to additional chief secretary, Home Rajesh Rajora and just within one hour the decision was taken to suspend me. In fact, my case is not a case of woman victimisation but a male victimisation. I will fight it out.” The show cause notice served on the police officer by department of Home on Monday stated, “Two video clips went viral in social media on September 27 and 28 in which prima facie there appears to be unethical conduct and domestic violence with your wife by you. Hence, your act makes you liable for disciplinary action under rule 10 of All India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules- 1969. Hence, please present your clarification. Why disciplinary action be not taken against you for the misconduct as reflected in the viral videos.” The police officer was asked by the department to submit his clarification within stipulated time to avoid facing a one-sided action. In a less than five-minute video clip, Sharma is purportedly seen pushing, hitting and pinning down his wife. In another video, he is seen in the house of a woman and is soon followed by his wife, leading to a heated exchange of words between the couple and Sharma leaving the house in a huff. The woman in the second video, who is a TV news anchor, lodged a complaint with Shahpura police station in Bhopal on Monday night against the police officer’s wife and son for allegedly defaming her by shooting the video, making it viral on social media and levelling baseless allegations. The woman said that Sharma was like her father and he visited her just for a cup of tea. On Tuesday, a police team of Mahila police station in Bhopal visited the police officer’s wife but the latter refused to lodge an FIR in connection with the alleged domestic violence, said a police officer who didn’t want to be named. Meanwhile, a letter appeared on social media purportedly written by the police officer’s daughter who stood by her father and blamed her mother for causing troubles to him. Despite efforts, Sharma’s wife and son couldn’t be reached for their comments. They didn’t respond to phone calls and text messages. Earlier, on Monday, the police officer’s son wrote to home minister Narottam Mishra, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and director general of police Vivek Johri demanding action against his father based on the videos, as per government officials. The home minister Narottam Mishra said, “I am yet to receive a letter. I will look into it once I get it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/male-victimisation-ips-officer-seen-beating-wife-after-suspension-order/story-M8PaQ5TNsDSSgnuogWhZzI.html
29-09-2020||India||Foreign ministers of India, Bangladesh meet; review bilateral ties||India and Bangladesh on Tuesday created a high-level mechanism to monitor development projects funded by New Delhi even as Dhaka sought removal of non-tariff barriers and greater trade facilitation to enhance the export of its products. Bangladesh’s long-standing demand for early resolution of the sharing of waters of the Teesta river and agreements on sharing of all common rivers also figured in the virtual meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Bangladeshi counterpart AK Abdul Momen. Momen also expressed the hope that India, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council during 2021-22, would play a “more meaningful role for a lasting solution to the Rohingya crisis, including their early repatriation to Myanmar in a safe and sustainable manner”, according to a statement from Bangladesh’s foreign ministry. The two sides decided to form a “high level monitoring committee” headed by the secretary of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division and the Indian envoy in Dhaka to regularly review the implementation of projects under three lines of credit (LoC) agreements, a joint statement said. Momen raised non-tariff barriers and lack of trade facilitation that he said were impeding the flow of Bangladeshi goods to India, particularly the northeastern states. The Bangladeshi side asked India to address issues related to accreditation, certification, standardisation, port restrictions and developing port infrastructure to enable further exports. Momen also requested Jaishankar to look into export of essential commodities, such as onions, by India since it impacts the domestic market of Bangladesh. India’s recent ban on onion exports had a huge impact on prices in Bangladesh, and New Delhi subsequently allowed the movement of onion supplies already contracted for by Bangladeshi importers. Tuesday’s JCC meeting was part of efforts by the two sides to set ties, hit by a string of irritants since last year, on an even keel. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had visited Dhaka in August, when he delivered a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina. The two ministers also agreed more steps can be taken to enhance trade and investment between India and Bangladesh, the top two economies in South Asia, such as removal of all types of barriers. The Bangladeshi side appreciated India’s decision for duty-free access of Bangladeshi products to the Indian market under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) pact, due to which Bangladeshi exports crossed the $1-billion mark in 2018-19 though the balance of trade remains in India’s favour. However, the sharing of waters of the Teesta river, held up by objections from the West Bengal government, continues to be an issue that Dhaka wants New Delhi to address speedily. Jaishankar noted the two sides share 54 rivers and said: “We remain committed to Teesta water-sharing and, in the meanwhile, are equally committed to move forward on other seven rivers on which data has been already shared with [the Bangladeshi] side”. The two sides agreed to consider convening the ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), which has not met since 2010. Jaishankar thanked Bangladesh for supporting India in its election to the UN Security Council, and the joint statement said the two ministers “reiterated the importance of the safe, speedy and sustainable return to Myanmar of the forcibly displaced persons from the Rakhine state of Myanmar, currently being sheltered by Bangladesh”. Momen emphasised that “unless the problem is resolved quickly, there are possibilities of pockets of radicalism disrupting economic growth, peace and stability in the region and requested India’s leverage to address the crisis”, the joint statement added. Both sides also agreed to expedite work on energy projects such as the Friendship Pipeline and Maitree Super Thermal Power Project and Momen said tripartite power and energy cooperation with Nepal and Bhutan was also discussed. The two sides also discussed defence cooperation, including training and exchanges, and called for the early implementation of a defence line of credit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-ministers-of-india-bangladesh-meet-review-bilateral-ties/story-JUFsyvJyt677jloiIuciKK.html
29-09-2020||India||BJD to launch month-long coronavirus awareness drive from October 2||Amid rising cases in several parts of Odisha, including the capital city of Bhubaneswar, the Biju Janata Dal will launch a month-long Covid-19 awareness drive from October 2, asking each party MLA to distribute masks at panchayat level and sensitise people about guidelines and testing.In a letter to state-level office bearers and organisational heads, party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik noted that the pandemic has brought the state to a peculiar situation but urged party members to work to battle the pandemic in their constituencies.“Each life is precious and has to be saved. We have saved over 2 lakh lives in the state through several Covid hospitals and tested around 30 lakh people. Each BJD member has to work as a dedicated worker in their constituencies to battle the pandemic,” he wrote, praising the work of party members for arranging plasma for the Covid-19 patients and helping families in cremating the loved ones who fell to the disease.Patnaik’s missive to the partymen came even as the Covid cases continue to surge in the state, taking the tally to 2.15 lakh. Despite the government imposing heavy penalties on those not wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, there have been numerous violations across the state. The surge of cases have stressed the state’s health infrastructure.While Khurda, Cuttack and Puri continue to be hot spots accounting for more than 30 per cent of total daily count, the infection is spreading fast in coastal, central and western Odisha districts of Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Angul and Kendrapara.With more than 33,000 active cases, Odisha now has more active cases than Delhi, Bengal and Gujarat that has triggered allegations over shortage of ICU beds and ventilator beds in Covid hospitals.BJD MLA Umakanta Samantray, who recently tested positive, too complained that hospitals in the State don’t have sufficient ICU beds compared to the number of patients.“We need to increase the number of ICU beds in both government and private hospitals. The number of Covid hospitals is also not enough and need to be increased,” he said.Meanwhile, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary on Tuesday claimed that the Covid-19 graph in Bhubaneswar will remain flat in October and a number of new cases is likely to come down by October-end.“Bhubaneswar is presently witnessing over 300 new Covid-19 cases against the daily load of 500 cases per day earlier. We had projected the active cases to be at 5,000 by September 15 in Bhubaneswar. At present, the Covid-19 graph is plateauing in Bhubaneswar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-to-launch-month-long-coronavirus-awareness-drive-from-october-2/story-Wnyacvba2TYqbddcR7afNK.html
29-09-2020||India||Andhra CM’s 3-capital plan creates troubles for Vijayawada airport expansion||The decision of the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh to create three capitals for the state with the administrative capital being shifted from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam has created hurdles for expansion of the Gannavaram airport near Vijayawada.Hundreds of farmers, who had given away around 1229 acres of land to the state government in 2016 under land pooling scheme (LPS) for the expansion of the airport by the Airport Authority of India, are now refusing to move out unless the government pays them a huge compensation.During the Telugu Desam Party’s reign, these farmers, belonging to Ajjampudi, Allapuram, Atkuru, Buddhavaram, Chinavutapalli, Kesrapalli and Gannavaram were allotted residential and commercial plots of the size 1,000 square yards and 200 sq yards respectively in the capital region of Amaravati in lieu of the lands they had surrendered to the government for the airport expansion. They signed an agreement with the then AP Capital Region Development Authority to that effect and were allotted plots in different localities of Amaravati in 2018, as per the master plan.However, with the Jagan Mohan Reddy government dumping the Amaravati capital city project and deciding to go in for the three- capital plan, the farmers of Gannavaram airport region are left in the lurch. A farmer from Buddhavaram village, who did not want to be named, said the farmers were allotted plots in Amaravati only on paper, but had not been given possession of the sites, as the development of Amaravati was still in progress.“Now that the present government has abandoned the capital plan at Amaravati, our plots have no value there. We want our lands back or be paid compensation as per the law,” he said.Those who surrendered lands to the state government also include high profile people like former Union minister and senior BJP leader U V Krishnam Raju and popular Telugu film producer C Ashwini Dutt, who had bought agriculture lands and developed farm houses and orchards.On Monday, Ashwini Dutt filed a petition in the state high court seeking a direction to the state government to pay compensation of Rs 210 crore towards 39.15 acres of land he had surrendered to the government at Kesrapalli village for the Gannavaram airport expansion.He said his land was located in a prime commercial area around the airport and the registration value of the land is around Rs 1.25 crore to Rs 1.50 crore per acre. He demanded that the government pay four times the value of the land as compensation before taking possession of the land for the airport.“As per the clause in the agreement signed with the APCRDA, we have the right to claim compensation and damages if the APCRDA breaches the agreement. Now that APCRDA has been abolished and construction of the capital city is abandoned, there is no hope for development of Amaravati, where we were allotted plots. So, we are constrained to invoke the clause and seek damages,” Dutt said in his petition.Meanwhile, Krishnam Raju also filed a similar petition in the high court seeking adequate monetary compensation for his 31 acres of land at Kesrapalli, which he had surrendered to the government for airport expansion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-s-3-capital-plan-creates-troubles-for-vijayawada-airport-expansion/story-8ovFC0UqbCHGs0mavkTstJ.html
29-09-2020||India||Covid-19 infection rate rising in India but scope for more, ICMR survey shows||Coronavirus infection rates among adults in India have risen sharply, a survey showed on Tuesday, although a large percentage of the population has not yet been exposed, suggesting there is scope for cases to rise much further.In the serological survey conducted in August and September, blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. If a person tests positive for the antibodies, it means they were infected with the virus at some point. Blood samples collected from more than 29,000 adults between Aug. 17 and Sept. 22 showed that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased to 7.1% compared to 0.73% in a previous survey between May 11 and June 4, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Balram Bhargava, told a press briefing.“However, a large percentage of the population is still unexposed and the susceptibility of a considerable section of people getting infected exists,” he added.The second survey was conducted in the same 700 villages and wards from 70 districts in 21 states as the first. Results from the second survey also showed urban slum and non-slum areas had a higher infection prevalence than rural areas.“The new (survey) shows lockdown and containment measures as well as behaviour change at population level checked spread of SARS-CoV-2,” Bhargava said.India on Tuesday reported 70,589 new infections in the last 24 hours, taking its total to 6.15 million cases. The country leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported. The vice-president of India, M. Venkaiah Naidu, said in a tweet late on Tuesday that he had tested positive and has been advised to home quarantine as he remains asymptomatic. In the past, several other federal ministers have also tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-infection-rate-rising-in-india-but-scope-for-more-icmr-survey-shows/story-6zjFTt2aBcI6ooMIrjUuyJ.html

Once lauded for its effective pandemic control measures, the state is facing a huge challenge after cases spiked in September-- the state’s test positivity rate is 13.94 per cent while the national average is below 8 per cent. Though cases surged and recovery thinned, the mortality rate is low in the state when compared to other states. “The situation is serious. All parties pledged their support to the government. All strikes and protests have been deferred and there will be a strict ban on big gatherings,” the CM said adding if the present trend continued cases may peak by the middle of October. He said a new guideline will be issued in a couple of days and another lockdown was not feasible. Now, in terms of active cases, the state is in the fifth spot and the strain is visible on the harried health machinery and ICU facilities are almost full in major hospitals. Covid-19 cases peaked in the state when neighbouring states showed a downward trend. The Indian Medical Association’s Kerala chapter has asked the state government to declare a medical emergency as the situation has turned serious. “The crisis in the state will deteriorate if stringent steps are not taken. With high population density and a large number of elderly people, the situation will be really alarming. A health emergency must be declared to create awareness among the people,” the IMA said in its letter to the chief minister. The IMA also said the state has a relatively low-testing rate and it should be increased considerably. Many medical experts said the state will have to increase RT-PCR tests instead of antigen tests. But the CM said there is no plan to impose a medical emergency. In view of the rising cases, opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front had stopped its ongoing stir against Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel who was interrogated by the National Investigation Agency and Enforcement Directorate in connection with the gold smuggling case. Earlier, state health minister K K Shailaja had blamed opposition parties for the recent surge in cases. The state had witnessed violent protests in the last two weeks. But the BJP said it will go ahead with its symbolic protests. “Left trade unions are leading farmers’ agitation against the Union government in various parts of the country and in Kerala they want all to keep away from a stir. It is a double standard,” said party state president K Surendran. On Tuesday, the state has reported 7354 new cases taking the total to 1,87,276 cases. 1,24,688 people have recovered and active cases currently stand at 61,791. With 22 deaths, the toll has gone up to 720.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-in-kerala-but-curbs-to-be-enforced-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-amid-covid-19-spike/story-35mjxwobAYu7qa99DC1uTL.html
29-09-2020||India||Khadi Commission seeks payment for Rs 39 crore linen after railways cancels||The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has written to the railway ministry seeking payment for orders worth Rs 39.25 crore for the supply of linen after the national carrier cancelled the orders. The Khadi body said non-payment for the linen orders, which were designed especially with Indian Railways’ logo, would lead to an “irreparable loss”.This comes in the backdrop of the national carrier’s decision to end supply of linen, including bedsheets and pillow covers, to passengers travelling in air-conditioned coaches in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid disease.KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena, in a letter written to Railway Board CEO VK Yadav on September 15, said that Khadi India had received orders worth Rs 39.25 crore from the Railways to provide linen to railways across several zones for production of polyvastra bedsheet, pillow covers, towels and other textile products printed with the name of respective railway zones with their logo and manufacturing date that are ready for delivery. HT has reviewed the letter.“It was brought to my notice that in a few cases, material was delivered to the consignee but R-Note was not issued. In some cases, the material is ready for delivery but the Railways have extended the delivery period to the next financial year. Surprisingly, in some cases, material is ready for delivery but Railways have cancelled the order as these Khadi items have been manufactured especially for the Railways with their logo and manufacturing date. KVIC is left with no other option of marketing the same to any other party. If such huge orders worth Rs 39.25 crore are cancelled or refused to honor, our Khadi artisans and institutions will suffer irreparable loss,” the letter said.The KVIC urged the national carrier to consider the “efforts and struggles of spinners, weavers and other artisans associated with the work... you are requested to issue necessary directions to honour all previous orders and accept the supplies.”As per current norms, the Indian Railways procures various khadi items like bedsheets, pillow covers and hand towels for passengers from the KVIC on a single tender basis. Railways ministry officials say the requirement of linen dipped since only a limited number of special passenger trains are plying and their stock was already available with the national carrier and hence railways was advised not to procure these items.“Indian Railways has always been on the forefront on supporting the cause of Khadi and artisans. Covid global pandemic has thrown up hitherto unexpected and unforeseen challenges to all of us especially for national life lines like Railways. Stopping of distribution of linen in trains is one of the means to prevent the spread of virus during train journeys. A decision in this regard was taken in public health interest only. Railways respects the Institution of KVIC and artisans and best possible solution would be worked out in mutual consultation with KVIC only,” a railway ministry spokesperson said in response to HT’s query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khadi-commission-seeks-payment-for-rs-39-crore-linen-after-railways-cancels/story-skd1ZPNbssmjUKNVLdBtSI.html

According to a BSF release, the recovered arms include 28 AK series assault rifles, a 5.56 mm AK 74 rifle, one carbine, 28 magazines, 7894 ammunition and two ‘khukhri’ daggers. “Reliable information was received by the BSF about an attempt being made by anti-national elements to smuggle arms and ammunition into Indian territory through Mizoram,” said the release. “The source who brought this information was questioned in detail and it was found that the information seemed reliable. It was learnt that they were bringing in AK series rifles along with lot of ammunition for some insurgent group,” it added. Accordingly an operation was planned under the supervision of Kuldeep Singh, DIG-BSF based at Aizawl and second in command SK Pillai with a team of personnel from the 90th battalion of BSF based in Mamit district. “It was seen in the late hours that two pickup vehicles were approaching from West Phaileng, on the Mizoram side, which was stopped and the BSF personnel took control of the vehicles and disarmed its 3 occupants,” the release said. The occupants were identified as Lalhuapzuapa (56), Liansanga (46) and Vanlalruata (25), all residents of Aizawl. On checking the vehicles, it was found that they had cavities in which the arms and ammunition were being carried. Besides the arms and ammunition, the BSF team also recovered Rs 39,020 from the 3 people, who were later handed over to the Mamit district police. “This is one of the biggest seizures of arms and ammunition in northeast in the past many years. The alert BSF troops were able to foil the designs of anti-national elements to supply arms and ammunition and create disturbance in Mizoram,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-recovers-huge-cache-of-arms-from-mizoram-bangladesh-border-3-held/story-lChq8ASK2MR4fIC91X8bBN.html

The German carrier cited “unexpected rejection” of its flight schedule by the Indian government.“Due to the Indian government’s rejection, Lufthansa will now have to cancel all planned flights between Germany and India between 30 September and 20 October. An updated Lufthansa flight schedule is available for customers,” the airlines said in a statement.On March 23, India suspended all scheduled international passenger flights due to the lockdown imposed to curb Covid-19 spread. However, under an “air bubble” arrangement with 13 countries including Germany, Centre has permitted special flights to function.“There are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa,” Aviation regulator DGCA said in a statement on Tuesday.India and Germany had formalised an air bubble in July this year.“As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” DGCA added.Stating that India has not yet accepted Germany’s invitation to talk, Lufthansa urged Centre to work together with the German government in order to “establish a temporary travel agreement between both countries”. “Such an agreement is necessary to address the urgent need of tens of thousands of Indians and foreign nationals for travel to and from India and would also help balance the interests of both countries’ airlines,” it said.“This appeal follows the unexpected rejection of Lufthansa’s planned flight schedule for October by Indian authorities. Lufthansa had applied for the continuation of special flights it was granted to operate until the end of September,” the statement further read. “October flight schedule would essentially have been an extension of the already limited number of flights between India and Germany that Lufthansa has been reintroducing to the Indian market since June,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lufthansa-cancels-all-planned-flights-to-india-from-germany-till-october-20/story-caOpDsidNpAACHts4tlV1I.html
29-09-2020||India||China on their radar, India, Japan, US, Australia to hold Quad meet on Oct 6||Foreign ministers of the Quad, the informal security forum comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia, are expected to hold a much-awaited meeting in Tokyo on October 6 with the objective of tightening strategic cooperation and advance the goal of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. The meeting is expected to be followed by consultations at senior officials’ level in November.The meeting will discuss collaboration among Quad countries in counter-terrorism, cyber and maritime security, development finance, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, according to South Block officials. The ministers are also expected to discuss practical collaborations in developing advanced technologies including 5G and 5G-plus telecom standards as well as securing the sea lanes of communications in the Indo-Pacific.While Beijing is expected to take aim at the four partners for seeking to target China at the meeting, there has been a sea change since the ministers met informally on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on September 26, 2019. Quad is expected to take steps towards an institutionalized dialogue at the meeting, where Chinese actions since the rise of global pandemic from Wuhan will come under a magnifying glass.The Quad ministerial comes at a time when the Donald Trump administration has made a U-turn on US policy towards China, which was guided by the rapprochement policy tailored by Henry Kissinger 50 years ago under the Republican administration of Richard Nixon. The tough, new US policy towards Communist China was defined by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in his Nixon Library address on July 24.The Indian relationship with China has taken a 180-degree turn since the Chennai summit on October 11-12, 2019, after the People’s Liberation Army’s aggression in eastern Ladakh in May. The armies of the two countries are still locked in a staring match in Ladakh with both sides losing soldiers in the June 15 Galwan Valley flare-up and firing in the air in the first week of September after the Indian Army pre-empted the PLA south of Pangong Tso. This is not all.Australia’s relationship with China, its largest trading partner, has nosedived with Beijing imposing an 80% tariff on barley, launching an anti-dumping investigation of Australian wine, blocking Australian beef, arresting an Australian journalist and banning two academics from visiting China.The situation with Japan is no different, with Chinese warmongering over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea forcing Tokyo to increase its defence budget to a record. Tokyo is also upset over new security laws in Hong Kong and pressure put on democratic Taiwan by Beijing.In short, all the four Quad partners have their own reasons for being upset with China’s aggressive posture under paramount leader Xi Jinping under the mask of the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The Chinese posture in the Indo-Pacific and the threat it poses to the democratic world will be discussed at the Tokyo ministerial, with all Quadl partners sharing their experiences.Given that all the Quad partners have a military supply and logistics sharing agreement with each other, the foreign ministers will also take a decision on a four-nation naval exercise under the rubric of Malabar in the Arabian Sea to signal their commitment for free and open navigation in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-us-australia-to-hold-quad-meet-on-oct-6-china-on-their-radar/story-LhL2r3vuaTl3ndBQ0vT6LP.html

29-09-2020||India||‘No war, no peace in Ladakh,’ says IAF chief RKS Bhadauria||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Tuesday said the security scenario along the country’s northern borders was at “an uneasy, no war-no peace status” and the Indian military was prepared for any eventuality, amid heightened military tensions with China in the sensitive Ladakh sector where both armies have made arrangements for a long haul. Speaking at a conference on ‘Energising Indian Aerospace Industry: Challenges in the New Environment’, the IAF chief said, “Air power will be a crucial enabler for our victory in any future conflict. It is really critical for any future conflict. It is imperative that the IAF obtains and maintains technological edge over our adversaries.” He said the air force had swiftly responded to the developments in eastern Ladakh and was prepared to counter any misadventure by the adversary. The conference was organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies along with the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Key military talks on September 21 over the dispute at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China remained inconclusive, with Indian negotiators firmly demanding comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante as the only approach towards de-escalation, and China asking India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction. The two sides, however, made some headway. According to a joint statement issued on September 22 in New Delhi and Beijing, they agreed to stop sending more troops to the front line, and to hold a seventh round of commander-level talks “as soon as possible, take practical measures to properly solve problems on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area”. The IAF is operating its newly-inducted Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert. Bhadauria said the recent induction of several platforms including the Rafales, C-17s, Chinooks and Apaches had provided the IAF with “substantial tactical and strategic capability enhancement.” The IAF’s current fleet of five Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. The air force formally inducted the planes at the Ambala air base on September 10 though they landed at their home base on July 29. At the induction, Bhadauria made it clear that the warplanes were mission-ready and the ceremony marked their “full operational induction” into the air force. The Rafale jets are part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the “Golden Arrows.” “The IAF is always mission-ready and can strike its place of choosing when it so desires anywhere, anytime,” said military affairs expert Air Marshal PS Ahluwalia (retd). The IAF has been projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the Ladakh sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne for demanding night-time missions from forward airbases.The IAF chief said the raising of two squadrons of the Tejas light combat aircraft and the integration of indigenous weapons on the Su-30 in reduced time frame were the most promising developments on the indigenisation front and the march towards self-reliance in the defence sector. Talking about providing impetus to the Make in India initiative, he said the new Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020, released on Monday, addressed a number of issues “with bold and far reaching reforms”. He said to provide stimulus to the aerospace industry, IAF had committed to the purchase of 83 LCA Mk1 fighter jets and 106 HTT-40 trainer aircraft. “We strongly support the indigenous development of the fifth-generation fighter aircraft --- the advanced multirole combat aircraft (AMCA) --- and have a demand of at least six squadrons, and Avro replacement is planned under Make in India. This in itself amounts to more than 350 aircraft in next two decades. There cannot be a better time to indigenise,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-war-no-peace-in-ladakh-says-iaf-chief-rks-bhadauria/story-zvetDKIXdWGKGXkPEoyk3I.html

The other members of the governing council will be appointed soon, the person cited above said.Kapur will head the premier film school at a time when, like many other colleges and universities, it is also grappling with the challenges posed by Covid-19.The FTII had earlier declared the results of the entrance test and is planning the future course. Online classes and training courses have been continuing.“Wherever it is difficult for students to attend classes, the institute has been putting up the material on the website,” said the person cited above.Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said “Kapur, who has a vast experience, will add more value to the Institute. I am sure everybody will welcome his appointment”.“Shekhar Kapur, as a reputed film maker of international stature, is without doubt an excellent choice. FTII welcomes him as its Chairman. It’s come a full circle from Dev Anand who started his career working at Prabhat Studio within the campus of FTII today, to his nephew Shekhar Kapur as Chairman of FTII,” said Bhupendra Kainthola, Director, FTII.The previous FTII chief was BP Singh known for his role as the lead actor in tele-serial CID. Singh was recently appointed by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) to its general assembly.The Film and Television Institute of India was set up by the Centre in 1960 in the premises of the erstwhile Prabhat Studios in Pune.

29-09-2020||India||On Amnesty row, BJP leader quotes ex-PM Manmohan Singh to defend govt||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday refuted allegations by Amnesty International that it had to wind up its operations in India because of a witch hunt by the government and said the organisation was receiving funds from abroad in contravention of the Indian laws.Amnesty International, in a statement, said that the freezing of its bank accounts by the Indian government, which it is learnt was done earlier this month, has brought its work to a juddering halt. BJP’s national spokesperson Rajyavardhan Rathore said Amnesty International had set up four companies, and showed money received in their account as FDI.The Enforcement Directorate started investigation after it learnt that money was being funnelled into the company’s accounts without any information or permission.“The Reserve Bank of India told all banks that Amnesty should be put in the category for prior reference. Before receiving money from outside India they would need to be in the prior permission category. There has been shifty money transfer to the companies and there is suspected flow of money into the trust of the amnesty international,” Rathore said.He said Amnesty International, which has alleged that it was targeted by the government for working on issues of human rights, has not clarified why money was coming into the bank accounts from abroad. The BJP spokesperson also said that the organisation’s credentials were also questioned by the UPA government. He said questions about the organisation were raised thrice in Parliament during the UPA regime and each time the then ministers referred to their “questionable” working style. “In 2009 during the UPA regime their licence was rejected for receiving foreign funds and the operation was suspended,” Rathore said. He said any organisation can work in India, but they cannot be allowed to circumvent the laws.“On July 31, 2004, the then MoS Home Shiprakash Jaiswal said accusations (about suppression of human rights) are made periodically by Amnesty international based in London. On 22 October 2008, in reply to a question about concerns on suppression of human rights, Shakeel Ahmed, MoS, Home, said the methods used by such organisations to gather information have been questioned. It is not the policy of India to react to such reports. On December 16, 2007, Ahmed again said methods used by such organisations to gather information have been often questioned, particularly as they are not free from bias,” Rathore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-amnesty-row-minister-quotes-ex-pm-manmohan-singh-to-defend-centre/story-cmU6dQGGzs3JumxZf7vDML.html

Our defence forces are prepared for any eventuality as you are aware,” the Chief of Air Staff said.The IAF is looking at inducting around 450 aircraft and helicopters in the next two decades, besides upgrading at least 200-300 planes during this period, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said.He also said the recent induction of Rafale fighter jets along with previous acquisitions of C-17 Globemaster aircraft as well as Chinook and Apache helicopters have provided the IAF with substantial tactical and strategic capability enhancement.Also read | ‘Indian forces prepared for any eventuality’: IAF chief on Ladakh standoff“Air power will be a crucial enabler in our victory in any future conflict. It is therefore imperative that IAF obtains and maintains technological edge over our adversaries,” he said at the conference on energising the Indian aerospace industry.Five French-made multirole Rafale fighter jets were inducted into the IAF on September 10. The fleet has been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh in the last couple of weeks.The IAF has already deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control.The IAF has also been carrying out night time combat air patrols over the eastern Ladakh region in an apparent message to China that it was ready to deal with any eventualities in the mountainous region. The IAF Chief said the raising of two squadrons of light combat aircraft Tejas and integration of some indigenous weapons on the Su-30 MKI combat jets in a very reduced time frame have been the “most promising” development, reflecting the country’s capabilities to develop indigenous military hardware.The Chief of Air Staff also strongly backed indigenous development of a fifth generation aircraft.“We strongly support indigenous development of a fifth generation aircraft. We need to have a single point agenda to have a fifth generation aircraft with sixth generation technology,” said Bhadauria, while congratulating all the stakeholders in development of the light combat aircraft Tejas.He also complimented the Defence Research and Development Organisation for its airborne early warning and control system Netra, calling it a pathbreaking achievement.Bhadauria also asked the DRDOs and defence public sector undertakings to include the private sector in key projects and treat them as their own.“Overall, we are looking at 450 aircraft orders. It will include the helicopter fleet,” Bhadauria said.“There cannot be a better time to energise the aerospace sector and there cannot be a better opportunity...IAF is ready to be an engine of growth for the aerospace industry, you have to be ready to provide the requirement and get on board with confidence and determination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-scenario-in-eastern-ladakh-at-uneasy-no-war-no-peace-status-iaf-chief/story-lmbKoHIUKFgurnF9MDz1gP.html

Wonder who advises their President?” she asked.Sonia Gandhi on Monday advised the Congress-ruled states to explore the possibilities to pass laws in their respective states under Article 254(2) of the constitution, which allows the state legislatures to pass a law, “to negate the anti-agriculture central laws encroaching upon state’s jurisdiction under the constitution”.“This would enable the states to bypass the unacceptable anti-farmers’ provisions in the three draconian agricultural laws including the abolition of MSP and disruption of APMCs in Congress-ruled states. This would also alleviate the farmers from the grave injustice done by the Modi Government and BJP,” a Congress statement had said.Article 254(2) of the constitution provides that where a law made by a state legislature with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the concurrent list “contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter”, then, the law so made by the legislature “shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that state”.The parliament passed three farm bills - The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 - during the monsoon session of parliament.Congress and several other opposition parties have opposed the provisions of the bills.President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to the three farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sitharaman-slams-sonia-gandhi-s-advice-to-party-ruled-states-on-farm-bills-cites-congress-manifesto/story-fD1zKdCr2KII4E6JSOBxVL.html

29-09-2020||India||Should have shown grace, ignored Kangana’s PoK comment, HC to Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut should have shown grace and restraint when he responded to tweets from actor Kangana Ranaut, the Bombay High Court observed on Tuesday. The actor had compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and made objectionable comments against the Mumbai Police.In his affidavit, Raut, admitting that the expletives in the interview to the TV channel were directed at the petitioner (Kangana Ranaut), said that it was not due to any malice towards her but were prompted after she cast aspersions about the state not being safe. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla while hearing the response of Bhagyawant Late, designated officer of the BMC who was impleaded in the case after the petition of the actor was amended, was informed by senior counsel Anil Sakhare that the actor’s allegations of malice against him were baseless. While responding to the allegations made by the actor against him, Sakhare submitted that Late’s subordinates had visited the Pali Hill bungalow at around 1 pm much before her tweet which was made at around 5 pm. Hence, the allegation that the detection was prompted due to her tweet was not valid. Sakhare further submitted that as per previous judgments making allegations of malice were easy but proving them was the responsibility of the accuser. However, at no place in the petition or affidavits submitted by the actor had she proved the malice on his part. In light of the submissions, Sakhare sought dismissal of the petition. “In the said interview I have only referred to the petitioner as “dishonest” because the petitioner had made a statement saying that Mumbai is like ‘Pak Occupied Kashmir’,” stated Raut in his affidavit. “I responded because the petitioner had insulted Mumbai and Maharashtra,” said Raut. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “You are a leader, a parliamentarian. You should have been cautious while making statements. Even we don’t agree with what the petitioner has said. Is this the way to address?” When Raut’s advocate submitted that his outburst was due to the provocation by the actor, the court said, “We are all Maharashtrians and we are all proud to be Maharashtrians. We have to show grace. You have to ignore such things. Is this an example you set for others by asking ‘Kanoon kya hai’?” Thereafter, senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf, who along with advocate Rizwan Siddiquee for the actor, responded saying that the case was very much in the jurisdiction of the court even though senior advocate Aspi Chinoy for the BMC on Monday had said that the actor had a remedy in a suit for claims and the court should not entertain the petition. After hearing all submissions, the court directed all parties to submit their written notes within a week and posted the matter for further hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-to-show-grace-court-to-sanjay-raut-on-kangana-ranaut-remark/story-gap7Dj4oB11fuJ4EohRsLN.html

The division bench of the high court comprising chief justice Akil Kureshi and justice Shubhashish Talapatra asked the Tripura government to submit the report before the next hearing which would take place on October 5. The central team which consisted of senior doctors visited various parts of the state over a period of ten days till September 18. On September 11, the court directed the state government to submit an affidavit within a week’s time providing information with regards to the infrastructure available in the state-run G B Pant Hospital situated in Agartala. This step was taken after a series of allegations regarding the health services provided to Covid-19 infected patients were doing the rounds. Taking suo-motu cognisance of media reports on the condition of infected patients and their relatives in the hospital, the division bench observed that time has come when court needs to make inquiries from the government on matters related to the handling of Covid-19 crisis and health care facilities in Tripura. Advocate general Arun Kanti Bhowmik informed the court that the state government would submit an affidavit on ‘action taken’ before the stipulated time.Meanwhile, Tripura on Tuesday reported 432 Covid-19 cases and three more related-deaths which pushed the overall tally to 25,353, a health department official said. The total cases include 5,877 active cases, 19,180 recoveries and 273 deaths, the official added.

29-09-2020||India||Maharashtra govt will last full term, no mid-term polls: Sanjay Raut||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its five-year term, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday while ruling out possibility of mid-term elections in the state.Raut told reporters that people of the state do not want polls now.His comment came a day after Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said that “there will be no option if no combination works out”, while replying to a query on possibility of mid-term polls in the state.“Nobody wants mid-term polls. But one also cannot figure out a solution to instability. Hence, something may happen one fine morning. All will try to see nothing happens But if no combination works out, then there will be no option,” Patil had told reporters, adding that no party wanted polls now.Addressing media persons here, Raut sarcastically said the Election Commission, which announces poll schedule, might have given Patil “some responsibility” and the latter might be having more information in this regard.“But I take Chandrakant Patil’s comments positively.He said people of Maharashtra don’t want polls. I am also saying there should be no elections. Hence, the Thackeray government will run for five years and there will be no elections,” Raut said.To a question about former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey joining the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) after taking voluntary retirement last week, Raut said one has the right to join politics after resigning from service.“We had no personal enmity with Pandey saheb, who was Bihar DGP. We were against the statements made against Mumbai Police while he was on the post. You don’t insult the Mumbai Police,” Raut said.Pandey came under attack from leaders of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadai government after he sought a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death at a time when the Mumbai Police was investigating the matter.“Now, the CBI is here (investing the matter). The entire country is waiting to see what the CBI does in this case. I think Pandey too should wait for some time,” the Sena chief spokesperson said.He also asked news channels “which raised questions over Mumbai Polices probe” to now ask questions to the CBI.The central agency has been probing the actors death for over a month now.“Channels questioned us. They should now ask questions to the CBI, Pandey, Nitish Kumar,” he said, alleging the charges were part of a conspiracy to defame the Shiv Sena.The CBI on Monday said it had not reached any conclusion in the death of Rajput and that all aspects are under investigation.Asked whether the MVA government will not implement new farm laws, Raut said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is holding discussions on the issue with the NCP and Congress.“It is being discussed at the government’s level. Let the government talk about it,” the Rajya Sabha member said and added the Sena had opposed the bills in Parliament during the monsoon session.Raut, whose meeting with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis caused flutter last Saturday, said he will again meet the former chief minister to finalise the schedule for the latter’s interview (to Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’).He also said no discussion was held between himself and Fadnavis on upcoming Bihar Assembly elections during that meeting.“However, I expressed joy that a Maharashtra leader got charge of Bihar polls,” Raut recalled.He said Sena workers from Bihar wanted to contest the Assembly polls in the eastern state and added he will hold discussions with CM Thackeray, who heads the party, on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-will-last-full-term-no-mid-term-polls-sanjay-raut/story-LJ5rhc9dH7uHDYT0lML76I.html

On September 8, the NCB had arrested Rhea Chakraborty for allegedly procuring drugs for Sushant. Chakraborty was arrested along with several others.The anti-drug agency further said that all the people arrested in the case are interlinked to each other and there were regular links and purchasing of drugs.“Want to point out that this is a drug syndicate and that they are all interlinked. All persons arrested till now, are connected with each other and it is a syndicate. There were regular links and purchasing,” NCB said in the court.Drug deal is not restricted to Sushant, the NCB told Bombay High Court. “This is not a case related to Sushant Singh Rajput. He may have been one of the consumers but the entire transaction and deal is not restricted to him,” the NCB further said. The NCB has so far also questioned actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh in the drugs probe.On June 14, the 34-year-old actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his residence in Mumbai’s Bandra. Apart from NCB, the case is also being investigated by two other central agencies -- Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-probe-not-connected-to-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-arrested-persons-interlinked-to-each-other-ncb-tells-bombay-high-court-during-rhea-showik-s-bail-plea-hearing/story-eVpIPOzbtrI2SMY0gGYQtL.html

As per the latest findings, 7.1% of the adult population showed evidence of past exposure to coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the ICMR said on Tuesday.The survey also showed that urban slum and urban non-slum areas have a higher prevalence of Covid-19 as against to the rural areas of the country. The risk in urban slums was twice than that in non-slum areas and four times the risk in rural settings, According to the findings.“One in 15 individuals aged more than 10 years were estimated to be exposed” to the viral disease till August month, Balram Bhargava, Director General of ICMR said in a briefing.Click here for full Coverage of Covid-19Sero survey is done by analysing blood samples of selected individuals for antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It determines if a person has already been infected and recovered, considering a majority of patients do not exhibit symptoms and not everyone is getting tested for the viral infection.The sero survey also aims to determine how the disease prevalence has changed since the first sero survey in May, when the nationwide lockdown was in force, to now, post-lockdown with fewer restrictions on public movement.Like the previous survey, this survey was also designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or above from 21 states, wherein the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population (zero, low: 0.1-4.7, medium: 4.8-10 and high: >10).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-1-of-adult-population-showed-evidence-of-past-exposure-to-covid-19-icmr/story-b933dyE1gQNsbcdqgQQuPO.html

The counting of votes will be held on November 10. Bypolls will be held in seven assembly seats - Naugawan Sadat, Bulandshahr, Tundla, Bangermau, Ghatampur, Deoria and Malhani. The Election Commission decided not to hold a bypoll on the Suar assembly seat in Rampur district that fell vacant after Allahabad High Court on December 16, 2019, set aside the election of Samajwadi Party MLA Abdullah Azam on charge of submitting wrong documents to contest election. An Election Commission officer said the matter related to the Suar assembly seat was pending in court. The commission decided to announce the bypoll on Suar seat later. Principal secretary, state assembly, Pradeep Dubey also referred to the law department opinion for debarring Abdullah Azam from contesting the assembly election for submitting a fake birth certificate. Senior principal secretary, Election Commission of India, Sumit Mukherjee, in a press statement, said taking into consideration various factors like local festivals, weather conditions, movement of forces and pandemic, the commission has announced the schedule for the bypoll. In view of the spread of Covid-19, the commission on August 21 issued broad guidelines, which will be followed strictly during the conduct of the election, he said. The model code of conduct shall come into force with immediate effect in the districts in which the election is scheduled.

The five seats - Naugawan Sadat, Ghatampur, Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani - fell vacant with the death of the sitting MLAs - Chetan Chauhan, Kamal Rani Varun, Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejai Singh and Prasanath Yadav, respectively.

29-09-2020||India||Fact-check, don’t leak letters in media: Andhra top cop to Chandrababu Naidu||Andhra Pradesh director general of police Gautam Sawang on Tuesday kicked up a controversy by writing a letter to Telugu Desam Party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu asking him to refrain from writing open letters without verifying facts.Sawang was reacting to a letter written to him by the TDP chief in connection with the attack on S Ramachandra, brother of judge S Ramakrishna at B Kothakota town in Chittoor district on Sunday evening. Naidu had alleged that the attack was planned and sponsored by the ruling YSR Congress Party in order to stifle the dissenting voice of Ramakrishna.The DGP said investigations had proved that the allegations levelled by Naidu against YSRCP were far from the truth.“It is unfortunate that such allegations are levelled without verifying the facts and further going on to generalise and attribute the same to ‘deteriorating law and order situation’ in the state,” he said.“I request you to kindly refrain from posting letters addressed to me in the media since the contents might have unverified and wrong information, which may needlessly arouse suspicion in the minds of the people at large and cast aspersions on the innocent,” Sawang said.He said if the TDP chief had any grounds or reason for suspicion about the involvement of any individual, he could write to the police department in a sealed cover and help the police in discharging their lawful duties in maintaining and enforcing the rule of law.On the Chittoor incident, the DGP said Ramachandra suffered minor injuries on his nose during a clash with Prathap Reddy over a petty issue. “Investigations revealed that Prathap Reddy is a staunch follower of the TDP. So, the allegation levelled by Naidu that it was a sponsored attack by YSRCP leaders is false,” he said.TDP official spokesman Kommareddy Pattabhiram found fault with the DGP for writing back to Naidu making counter-allegations against the latter, instead of taking action against the accused in the Chittoor incident.He said Naidu had written to the DGP only to say that this attack was made just a day after the judge addressed a Dalita Mahasabha in Vijayawada, raising doubts over the political intentions of the attackers. “So, it is the responsibility of the DGP to verify the charges made by the TDP chief, instead, he chose to write back to him giving a clean chit to the YSRCP and asking Naidu not to write such letters,” Pattabhiram said.The TDP leader appealed to the DGP not to mortgage the self-respect of the police force before the YSRCP, led-by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fact-check-don-t-leak-letters-in-media-andhra-top-cop-to-chandrababu-naidu/story-ajt4WtFXiS3LR2G3rnZkDO.html

The external affairs ministry was reacting to a report in Hindustan Times, which cited China’s foreign ministry as saying that Beijing abides by the LAC proposed by premier Zhou Enlai to prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in a letter dated November 7, 1959 – the first time in decades the Chinese clearly outlined its position on the notional boundary by reiterating a position that India has consistently rejected since it was first made 61 years ago. “India has never accepted the so-called unilaterally defined 1959 Line of Actual Control (LAC). This position has been consistent and well known, including to the Chinese side,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. Also Read: ‘Indian forces prepared for any eventuality’: IAF chief on Ladakh standoffSrivastava pointed out that under several bilateral agreements – including the 1993 Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC, the 1996 Agreement on Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) in the military field, the 2005 Protocol on Implementation of CBMs, and the 2005 Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for Settlement of the India-China Boundary Question – India and China have “committed to clarification and confirmation of the LAC to reach a common understanding of the alignment of the LAC”. He added, “Therefore, the insistence now of the Chinese side that there is only one LAC is contrary to the solemn commitments made by China in these agreements.” The external affairs ministry also blamed the Chinese side for lack of progress in the process for clarifying and confirming the boundary for almost two decades. “In fact, the two sides had engaged in an exercise to clarify and confirm the LAC up to 2003, but this process could not proceed further as the Chinese side did not show a willingness to pursue it,” Srivastava said. Also Read: Post Ladakh, PLA no longer a bogey for Indian Army | AnalysisThe Indian side also pointed to an apparent dichotomy in the position adopted by the Chinese side – insisting on abiding by the LAC of 1959 while stating in recent discussions on the ongoing border standoff that the issue should be resolved on the basis of the existing agreements. “In the last few months, the Chinese side has repeatedly affirmed that the current situation in the border areas should be resolved in accordance with the agreements signed between the two countries,” Srivastava said. He pointed out that even in the agreement reached between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during their talks on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on September 10, the Chinese side “has reiterated its commitment to abide by all the existing agreements”. The external affairs ministry said the Indian side has “always respected and abided by the LAC”, and defence minister Rajnath Singh had stated in Parliament recently that “it is the Chinese side which by its attempts to transgress the LAC in various parts of the Western Sector, has tried to unilaterally alter the status quo”. Srivastava said: “We therefore expect that the Chinese side will sincerely and faithfully abide by all agreements and understandings in their entirety and refrain from advancing an untenable unilateral interpretation of the LAC.” Since early May, India and China have been engaged in a standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC that has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low. Both sides have mobilised more than 50,000 troops each in the region and are now preparing to dig in for the harsh winter. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed on June 15 in a brutal clash in Galwan Valley, which also resulted in unspecified Chinese casualties. Troops of both sides have also fired warning shots on several occasions since late August, the first time arms have been used along the LAC since 1975. Several rounds of talks between the corps commanders and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs have been unable to end the impasse in the disengagement process, though the military commanders agreed at their last meeting that both sides wouldn’t deploy any more troops to the frontline. The WMCC is set to hold another meeting soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-accepted-the-unilaterally-defined-1959-lac-india-reacts-to-china-s-stand/story-CtCw1j5j42fZCkFkrxSkEP.html
29-09-2020||India||Stubble burning: Environment ministers of Delhi, 4 other states to meet on Oct 1||The Environment Ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will meet on October 1 to discuss and tackle the problem of stubble-burning which causes pollution every year, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on Tuesday.The virtual meeting will also be attended by the environment secretaries of Delhi and the four neighbouring states along with the members of the pollution control boards and corporations like the NDMC and the DDA, he said. The Union environment minister told a press conference here that meeting will review the work done by the states in the last two years to handle the issue of crop residue burning. “At the onset of winter in Delhi, which is October 15 onwards, stubble burning commences and causes pollution throughout the winter season,” he said. “This is not just confined to Delhi, but an air shade which extends to the NCR cities, places in Haryana, UP, Punjab and Rajasthan. Everyone bears the brunt of this air shade. So with the cooperation of all these five states we started tackling this issue in 2016,” he added.“For this cause, a virtual meeting of the environment ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will be held on October 1. Besides the environment ministers, the meeting will be attended by state environment secretaries, pollution control board members and municipal corporations, DDA and NDMC,” Javadekar told the media. ““In 2016, the PM launched the National Air Quality Index (NAQI). We believe that acceptance of a problem is the beginning of its solution. So, this is a significant meeting. I am confident everyone will participate in the meeting,” he said. Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their crop residue on fire to quickly clear off their fields after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter season.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue and the farmers there burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it. The farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The minister also told the press conference that the meeting will review the action taken by states in the last two years. “First, we will review the short term plan, medium and long term plans made in 2016. CPCB’s 50 teams visit spots and assess the situations October 15 onwards every year. The meeting will review their work in the last two years. A review of the work done by the states will also be done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stubble-burning-environment-ministers-of-delhi-4-other-states-to-meet-on-oct-1/story-udjxNiz7UYHfX71ACVUlpN.html
29-09-2020||India||‘Source of black money blocked’: PM shreds Opposition on farm law protests||They are insulting farmers by setting fire to the very equipment he worships, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, launching a full-blooded defence of the farm laws and hitting out at the opposition a day after members of the Punjab unit of Youth Congress set a tractor on fire at Rajpath near the India Gate lawns in the heart of Delhi. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are continuing to protest the new laws, fearing deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful corporate agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. The reforms have cost the Bharatiya Janata Party one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which has quit the ruling alliance.PM Modi accused the opposition of being against the independence of farmers, noting that it has become a habit of these people to oppose everything that is happening for the country. It is the only way they can practise their politics, said the PM.Also Watch l ‘They are not with farmers, youth or jawans’: PM Modi’s attack at opposition “A few days ago with the new laws, the country has freed its farmers from many shackles. Now the farmer can sell his produce to anyone, anywhere. But today, even when the central government is giving the farmers their rights, these people have come down to protest and are opposing the independence of the farmer. These people are now humiliating the farmers by setting fire to the goods and equipment that the farmer worships,” said the PM while launching six mega projects in Uttarakhand through video conferencing. The government’s new farm laws have become contentious for two reasons: one, they do not guarantee acquisition of farm produce at the minimum support price (at least, not in letter); and two, the manner in which they were pushed through, by a dubious voice vote, ignoring calls for parliamentary oversight, even voting.The Opposition parties are protesting, the PM said, as “another means for earning black money has been blocked”, by implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission - with farmers getting the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops and doing away with middlemen. “A party whose four generations of a family ruled the country, today wants to prove their selfishness by climbing on the shoulders of others, opposing all initiatives related to the national interest,” he said. PM Modi said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has seen a boom in Digital India campaign, “with even the poor using Jan Dhan bank accounts, using RuPay card and making digital transactions”. “When our government started this work, these people were opposing it and have always opposed the opening of the bank account of the poor of the country,” he said Spotlighting another instance, the PM raised the issue of protests by Opposition parties against Good and Services Tax and against the central government’s initiatives like One Rank One Pension scheme. “Since the implementation of One Rank-One Pension, the government has given about Rs 11,000 crore as arrears to ex-servicemen. Here in Uttarakhand, more than one lakh ex-servicemen have benefited from this. But these people (opposition parties) were always against the introduction of One Rank One Pension,” said Modi. The PM said that the Opposition parties even protested against introduction of Rafale Jets into the Indian Air Force, which has been done to strengthen the security forces. “Four years ago, our jawans carried out the surgical strikes and destroyed the bases of terror. But instead of praising the courage of our security personnel, the Opposition was asking for evidence of surgical strikes. It has become a habit of these people to oppose everything that is happening for the country. The only way of politics they know now is opposition,” added the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/source-of-black-money-blocked-pm-shreds-opposition-on-farm-law-protests/story-GvM4TEmGVAsgAnsrGhYKnN.html

Dalit leader and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad led a protest at the Safdarjung Hospital demanding death sentence for the accused. “I appeal to all members of the Dalit community to take to the streets and demand the death penalty for the guilty. The government should not test our patience. We would not rest until the culprits are hanged.” He said the state government “is equally responsible for the death of our sister”.Hathras police superintendent Vikrant Vir said the woman’s family informed them that she died around 3 am. “The [woman] was referred to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi but could not be saved. [She] breathed her last on Tuesday morning... [Her] post mortem is to be conducted in Delhi before her body will be brought back to Hathras maybe later in the day [Tuesday] for cremation,” said Vir. He said the woman suffered spinal injuries, but denied reports that her tongue was slit.Also Read: Caste-related crimes on the rise in UP: AAPVir said the in-charge of Hathras’s Kotwali police station has been removed for alleged inaction in the case. He added that the four accused had been arrested and will also be booked for murder.Vir said they first arrested 20-year-old Sandip the day the woman was raped. He added that three more men, Ramu, Lavkush, and Ravi, were later arrested when the woman named them in her statement before a magistrate on September 22. Vir said the men tried to strangulate her when she tried to resist their attempts to rape her.Vir said the 19-year-old was found badly injured after she went missing on September 14.Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar said the accused have also been booked under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the woman’s family has been given Rs 10 lakh compensation.He added a fast-track court would be set up to hear the case to punish the culprits at the earliest.The case has drawn parallels with the gang rape of a 23-year-old student in Delhi, who was attacked on a moving bus and left to die on a roadside in 2012. Anger over the Delhi case triggered countrywide protests and prompted the government to pass a tougher law against sexual violence with a provision for the death penalty for rape. Four men convicted of the 23-year-old’s rape and murder were hanged in March.The Hathras woman was shifted to the Delhi hospital from Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital on Monday when her condition showed no signs of improvement. She was admitted to the Aligarh hospital in a critical condition on September 14 and was on ventilator support.Priyanka Gandhi said law and order in Uttar Pradesh has deteriorated to a great extent and no semblance of safety exists for women. “The criminals are committing crimes openly,” she tweeted, calling for severe punishment for the rapist-killers. “@myogiadityanath [chief minister Yogi Adityanath] you are accountable for the safety of women in UP [Uttar Pradesh],” she tweeted....यूपी में कानून व्यवस्था हद से ज्यादा बिगड़ चुकी है। महिलाओं की सुरक्षा का नाम-ओ-निशान नहीं है।अपराधी खुले आम अपराध कर रहे हैं। इस बच्ची के क़ातिलों को कड़ी से कड़ी सजा मिलनी चाहिए। @myogiadityanath उप्र की महिलाओं की सुरक्षा के प्रति आप जवाबदेह हैं। 2/2“A Dalit girl who was a victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she kept struggling between life and death in hospitals.” Priyanka Gandhi said incidents of rape in Hathras, Shahjahanpur, and Gorakhpur had shaken the state.Kejriwal demanded that the guilty be tried and hanged at the earliest. “The death of Hathras victim is shameful for the entire society, country as well as for all the governments. It is highly sad that so many daughters are being sexually assaulted and we have not been able to protect them...” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati demanded stringent punishment for the accused and said they should be tried in a fast-track court. “The news of the death of Dalit victim after gangrape in Hathras...is very saddening. The government should provide all possible help to the victim’s family and ensure fast punishment to the culprits by prosecuting them in a fast track court....”Bhim Army chief and Dalit leader Chandrashekar Azad on Sunday night evaded the police to visit the woman’s family at the Aligarh hospital to express “solidarity” with them. He said the rape highlighted the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.“Policemen who have been negligent in this case should be duly punished and the woman’s family members should be immediately provided security as they are feeling insecure and should be shifted to a safe spot,” he said. Azad demanded financial assistance of Rs. 1 crore for the woman’s family.Vir said a police force was deployed at the woman’s house when she was admitted to the Aligarh hospital where her condition deteriorated.In a video message, National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma said the commission had sought an action taken report from Uttar Pradesh Police on the matter and was told the four accused had been arrested. She said the commission has promised the woman’s family all possible assistance. “An NCW member is going to meet the brother of the victim and we will help the family in whatever way we can.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-woman-who-was-gang-raped-2-weeks-ago-dies-at-delhi-hospital/story-xKm0OZB7Yrx4eZHoCNi2oK.html
29-09-2020||India||India provides Dornier to Maldives, will help monitor movement of Chinese vessels||India on Tuesday provided a Dornier maritime surveillance aircraft to the Maldives National Defence Force (MDNF) that is expected to boost efforts to keep a closer eye on the movement of Chinese vessels in regional waters, people familiar with developments said. The Dornier aircraft will operate under the command and control of MNDF while running csosts will be borne by India. It will assist in ongoing joint surveillance activities by India and the Maldives of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Indian Ocean archipelago. Seven MDNF personnel, including pilots, air observers and engineers are being trained to operate the Dornier by the Indian Navy. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the aircraft was provided by the Indian Navy in line with and inter-governmental agreement. Also Read: India, Maldives launch cargo ferry service connecting Tuticorin and Cochin with Male“The aircraft will also help in monitoring the activities of Chinese vessels in regional waters. The surveillance of the EEZ includes the tracking of all adversarial movements, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and drug and human trafficking,” said one of the people cited above. “In light of the Mahibadhoo and Laamu attacks by suspected terrorists, the Dornier aircraft will also be useful in the counter-terrorism sphere. The isolated and dispersed nature of islands and resorts can be safeguarded only by a technologically capable fixed wing aircraft,” the person said. The person was referring to attacks at the harbour of Mahibadhoo Island in the central Maldives on April 15 in which four speedboats, a sea ambulance and two dinghies were set on fire. Also Read: India provides soft loan of $250 mn to the MaldivesThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks but Maldivian police described the incident as arson and said it could have been the work of extremists or drug traffickers retaliating against special operations conducted since September 2019. The Indian high commission in Male tweeted: “As per Govt-to-Govt Agreement & discussions started in 2016, the Dornier arrives! It will engage in humanitarian relief efforts & joint-EEZ surveillance under command & control of #MNDF; It proudly dons #MNDF colours & crest, and will involve Maldivian pilots in its operations”.

The requirement of the aircraft was first raised during previous Maldivian president Abdulla Yameen’s visit to India in 2016. “While it could not get implemented earlier, the present government of President Ibrahim Solih has been able to implement it. Maldivian pilots, observers and technical personnel are being trained to operate the Dornier aircraft since June 2017,” said an official who declined to be named. The current government of the Maldives has been successful in getting more such training programmes organised by India, the official said. During a recent EEZ surveillance operation, multiple large fishing trawlers were found illegally fishing in Maldivian waters, the official added. The India government has been regularly sharing information with the government of the Maldives on the movement of drug traffickers headed for the archipelago based on reconnaissance flights by Dornier aircraft. The Dornier will also complement medical evacuation operations currently being conducted by MNDF helicopters. More than 250 Maldivian lives have been saved during such medical evacuation flights. The Maldives is an archipelago of nearly 1,200 islands grouped into 19 dispersed atolls that cover an area of nearly 90,000 km. The country’s EEZ covers nearly one million kilometres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-provides-dornier-to-maldives-will-help-monitor-movement-of-chinese-vessels/story-SN6oSVtpZENvJ6pmxYlMXO.html
29-09-2020||India||Year after tragedy, Goa govt pledges to seal open cast stone quarries||One year after four students drowned in an open stone quarry pit, the Goa government has pledged before the National Green Tribunal that it will ensure that the quarries are filled up with fly ash and remediated inert waste to prevent a recurrence. The decision comes after a meeting of a special committee set up by the National Green Tribunal, tasked with finding a solution to the recurring problem of open stone quarries posing a threat to wandering children as well as wildlife which get trapped. “There are induction furnace units as well as sponge iron units in the State of Goa which generates slag and fly ash. It is proposed to utilize the slag, fly ash, inert, compost and tree and garden cuttings for restoration of the quarries to its original state. The last one meter will comprise of soil/compost followed by plantation through Goa State Biodiversity Board or Forest Department,” the Goa government said in its submissions before the NGT. The Goa government is hoping to solve two problems at once as state and local bodies also face issues in trying to dispose of remediated as well as organic waste and fly ash from factories. An earlier proposal by the Goa government to fill the pits with municipal solid waste earned the ire of the National Green Tribunal. “A preposterous suggestion has been made for filling up the mined out pits with solid waste in consultation with a Norwegian company. We therefore,have no hesitation in rejecting the report as unacceptable. If the proposal is to be accepted, it would amount to giving license for commission of a criminal offence apart from it being in violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016,” the NGT had noted. “The report clearly demonstrates insensitivity on the part of the State of Goa in dealing with such a serious question where lives have reportedly been lost,” the NGT further observed.On September 18 last year, four students went for a swim in the quarry that was filled with rainwater and drowned. The four were part of a group of 40 boarders from a hostel who were taken for a trek at Tuem village in North Goa. Laterite quarries used to cut out stone used to build houses are large pits that are filled with water during the rains and end up being traps not just unsuspecting humans but also animals who fall into the pits.Even before the deaths, the NGT had asked the Goa government “to take further remedial actions including framing of appropriate guidelines and manual of Standard Operating Procedure for the quarries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-after-tragedy-govt-govt-pledges-to-seal-open-cast-stone-quarries/story-d2BSNbmBsljDfSA6Bud2rI.html

I, therefore, wish to remind the CM what does the Constitution says,” Dhankhar said and went on to quote Article 167, which deals with the duties of the Chief Minister with respect to the furnishing of information to the Governor.“I have asked for number of information in writing, including various subjects, but no response has been received yet,” he added.The Governor said his multiple requests had been ignored “against public interest, ignored to hide, ignored so that people will not know the real picture.”Dhankhar said he had earlier written to the Director-General of Police (DGP) too over the alarming decline in law and order situation in state, it is becoming a “safe haven” for crime, illegal bomb-making and corruption.He further raised the issue of police department being used against the Opposition in the state.He also raised the issue of Abdul Mannan, Leader of Opposition (LoP) writing to Banerjee after he was intimidated and threatened by a “junior police officer with consequences”.“The CM did not reply to that letter, therefore, he then wrote to me. Then I invited him, if this could happen by a junior police officer to the LoP.

While bypolls to 54 Assembly constituencies will take place on November 3, those for the Lok Sabha seat and two Assembly constituencies will be conducted on November 7.Here is all you need to know:* The Lok Sabha seat for which bypolls will take place is Bihar’s Valmiki Nagar. Two Assembly constituencies in Manipur will go to polls on the same day as Valmiki Nagar.* The Valmiki Nagar seat fell vacant in February after the death of incumbent Lok Sabha MP Baidyanath Prasad Mahato of the JD(U).* Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of seats--28--among the 54 Assembly constituencies for which polling will be held on November 3. Next is Gujarat (eight), Uttar Pradesh (seven); Jharkhand, Karnataka, Nagaland, Odisha (two each) and one each from Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Haryana.* The bypolls in Madhya Pradesh were necessitated after at least two dozen Congress MLAs followed their leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in March. This led to the collapse of the state’s Congress government and paved way for the BJP to return to power.* Bypoll schedule for 54 Assembly constituencies--Date of notification: October 9, Last date of nominations: October 16, Scrutiny of nominations: October 17, Last date of candidature withdrawal: October 19, Polling day: November 3, Date of counting: November 10* Bypoll  schedule for Lok Sabha seat and two Assembly constituencies--Date of notification: October 13, Last date of nominations: October 20, Scrutiny of nominations: October 21, Last date of candidature withdrawal: October 23, Polling day: November 7, Date of counting: November 10* Initially, bypolls were required for seven other Assembly constituencies.

29-09-2020||India||In UP’s last budget before polls, funds for development will be a major challenge||As the Uttar Pradesh government begins the process of preparing the budget for 2021-2022, a major challenge of providing funds for development schemes and other important public works stares the authorities in the face. Adding to the challenge will be the new schemes and populist announcements that chief minister Adityanath may like to make in his government’s last annual budget before the state goes to polls early in 2022. “Yes, the state’s budget for 2021-2022 will be a major challenge. The UP government will have to be realistic about the size of the budget this time in view of resource constraints. It should also mark its priorities as this will be the last budget before the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor of economics, Lucknow University. Adityanath may also opt for presenting a supplementary budget or a mini-poll budget later to make populist announcements as was done by his predecessor Akhilesh Yadav a few months before the 2017 polls. Yadav presented a second supplementary demands for 2016-2017 along with a vote on account for the first five months of 2017-2018 in the state legislature on December 21, 2016. As working on proposals of nearly 90-odd departments is bound to take time, the state finance department has asked the administrative departments to send their proposals by November 30 while issuing broad guidelines well in advance for preparation of the state’s budget. “Administrative departments should send their proposals to the finance department latest by November 30, 2020,” said additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal in his letter dated September 25, to all the ACSs/principal secretaries/secretaries and heads of department while reminding the departments about the procedure and responsibilities for preparation of the annual budget. Will the state government decide to convene a winter session of the state legislature later in 2020 or hold budget session early next year to get the budget for 2021-2022 passed? This is the million dollar question doing the rounds in the corridors of power here as the state government has not presented any supplementary budget this year, obviously in view of adverse impact the Covid-19 has had on the state’s economy. The state legislature’s brief monsoon session ended here on August 22. So, the state legislature will have to meet before February 22, 2021 in view of constitutional provisions that require that there is no gap of more than six months between its two sittings. Besides asking the departments for estimates about salaries, dearness allowance and other allowances based on total filled up posts, instead of sanctioned posts, the finance department has said no proposals should be included in the state budget directly for buying new vehicles. If needed, vehicles may be hired on contract basis with prior approval of the state government and all the schemes not useful now should be scrapped, said the finance department’s letter. It further said wasteful expenditure should be curtailed and priority should be given to work out budget estimates for externally-aided projects, centrally-sponsored schemes and resource-linked projects. As a separate booklet is prepared to list new items of expenditure included in the budget document, the finance department has said instead of proposing creation of new posts, the departments should send proposals about available alternatives. It further said no proposals should be sent about construction of housing buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-up-s-last-budget-before-polls-funds-for-development-will-be-a-major-challenge/story-73sz17gh5cGnXxhqQbg64J.html
29-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Serum Institute to produce additional 100 million vaccine doses||Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public–private global health partnership that aims to increase access to immunisation in poor countries, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would accelerate the manufacture and delivery of up to 100 million doses of safe and effective coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for India and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as part of the Gavi COVAX AMC, a mechanism within the COVAX Facility, the Pune-based firm announced on Tuesday. COVAX Facility seeks to pool in resources to accelerate the development of the most promising of the Coviod-19 candidates and plans to make it equitably accessible to all the participating countries, irrespective of their financial muscle.The initiative brings the total number of vaccine doses to be covered by the partnership to an aggregate of up to 200 million doses, following the initial agreement for up to 100 million doses, which were announced in August.Also read: India’s daily Covid-19 case count drops to 70,589; recoveries increase to over 82%Besides other tie-ups, SII also has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Preparations are in progress to conduct phase 3 trials of the candidate vaccine in India.The collaboration will provide upfront capital to SII to help increase manufacturing capacity. Once a vaccine gains regulatory approval and the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) prequalification, doses can be distributed to LMICs as early as by the first half of next year.“The collaboration further bolsters our fight against Covid-19! Through the avid support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we will manufacture and deliver up to an additional 100 million doses of immunogenic and safe-proven future Covid-19 vaccines to India and low-and middle-income countries in 2021,” said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer (CEO), SII, in a statement.“At this stage, it is important for governments, global health and financial institutions in the public and private sector to come together in ensuring that no one is left behind in the road to recovery. This association is in line with our efforts to see that the future vaccines reach the remotest part of the world providing full immunisation coverage in a bid to contain the spread of the pandemic,” he added. The funding will help accelerate the manufacturing by SII for candidate vaccines licenced from AstraZeneca and Novavax, which will be available for procurement if they are successful in attaining full licensure and the WHO’s prequalification.The vaccines will have a ceiling price of $3 per dose. The price point is enabled by investments made by partners such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Gates Foundation and SII. “This is vaccine manufacturing for the Global South, by the Global South, helping us to ensure no country is left behind when it comes to access to a Covid-19 vaccine,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO, f Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “The momentum behind our effort to ensure global, equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines is really building…” he added.The Gavi COVAX AMC, which is seeking at least $2 billion in initial seed funding, will meet at least part of the cost of procurement for the vaccine doses. The Gavi board has agreed upon the final list of 92 countries that will be supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC.Under the new collaboration, AstraZeneca’s candidate vaccine, if successful, will be available to 61 Gavi-eligible countries. Novavax’s candidate, if successful, will be available to all 92 countries supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC. These countries align with SII’s licencing agreements with its two partners. Gavi, SII, and the Gates Foundation’s collaboration supports the efforts of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator’s vaccines pillar, also known as COVAX, co-led by Gavi, CEPI and the WHO, to accelerate the development of vaccines for the viral outbreak and ensure rapid, global access to them.Decisions around investment in manufacturing are taken in close collaboration among these three lead organisations of the COVAX pillar. So far, 73 higher-income economies have committed to join the programme, in addition to the 92 low-and middle-income economies that are eligible for the support.“The Gates foundation will provide at-risk funding of a further $150 million to Gavi, bringing the total funding provided through this collaboration to $300 million. This will be used to support the SII to manufacture potential vaccine candidates, and for future procurement of vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries via Gavi’s COVAX AMC,” according to a statement issued by SII. “The deal is additional to a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between AstraZeneca and Gavi, which was announced in June that will commit an additional 300 million doses of AstraZeneca’s candidate vaccine to the wider COVAX Facility, to be supplied upon licensure or the WHO’s prequalification. These two deals can help assure access to early doses for the most vulnerable on a truly global scale,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-serum-institute-to-produce-additional-100-million-vaccine-doses/story-L9R2zw4Nf08ENQj2gzLbSI.html

Two assembly constituencies in Manipur will also go to polls along with the parliamentary constituency of Valmiki Nagar in Bihar on November 3. The results of the elections will be declared by November 12 at the latest, with counting taking place on November 10.

Also Read: Election Commission decides not to announce by-polls in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu after receiving inputs from chief secretaries and electoral officersElections to seven assembly constituencies across Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, however, have been deferred as the term of the House in the above-mentioned states is due to lapse in either May or June next year. People familiar with the matter had earlier told Hindustan Times that it did not make sense to hold the elections in Kerala, where there are only two vacancies, as the assembly in the state is due to be re-elected before June 2021. “In the midst of this pandemic and considering the devastation caused due to the floods, it would be unnecessarily expensive to hold the by-polls,” one person familiar with the matter had said, adding that a representation to defer the polls had been sent to the Commission in August. The Commission will now hold polls for Chhattisgarh (1), Gujarat (8), Haryana (1), Jharkhand (2), Karnataka (2) , Manipur (2), Nagaland (2), Odisha (2), Madhya Pradesh (28) Telangana (1) and Uttar Pradesh (7) assembly constituencies.

The by-polls are crucial to the BJP government’s survival in the state as it enjoys a wafer-thin majority in the 230-member state assembly. The BJP needs to win nine out of the 28 seats. It currently has 107 seats.

Addressing a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of Victims of Terrorism on Monday, Vijay Thakur Singh, secretary (East) in the external affairs ministry, said the world community shouldn’t lose sight of the right of the victims of terrorism to get justice for crimes committed against them. The virtual meeting was organised by the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Spain, co-chairs of the group, and the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT). Also Read: India opposes Pakistan’s move to hold election in Gilgit-Baltistan“I would like to highlight that, for example, the victims of 2008 Mumbai terror attack and 2016 Pathankot terror attack are yet to get justice. This is due to the unwillingness and non-cooperative attitude of a particular country,” she said. Though Singh didn’t name the country whose stance was hampering efforts to bring the perpetrators of the two attacks to justice, it was clear she was referring to Pakistan. Indian authorities have blamed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed for the two attacks. “It is important that we must work towards redressing deficiencies in the international efforts to ensure that perpetrators of terrorism are brought to justice,” Singh said. She further said: “While terrorists can never succeed in achieving their nefarious objectives, they leave behind a trail of death and destruction. Even amidst the ongoing pandemic, terrorism continues to pose a critical threat to international peace and security.” Also Read: At UNHRC, India takes on Pak over rights’ violationsTerrorists, she pointed out, have stepped up the use of ICT for propaganda and issuing threats, further exacerbating the stress on victims of terror. The world community needs to discuss collective ways to address the critical needs of the victims of terrorism, she added. The adoption of two UN General Assembly resolutions—one establishing August 21 as the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, and another on Enhancement of International Cooperation to Assist Victims of Terrorism—and the first UN Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism in 2021 will help address the problem of terrorism and helping its victims, Singh noted. “A dedicated voluntary fund to support victims of terrorism would strengthen United Nation’s capacity building and technical assistance to requesting member states, in assisting and supporting victims of terrorism,” she said. Terrorism not only violates the rights of victims but also deeply affects a range of rights of the families of victims and society, and women and children are particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses by terrorists, she said. Measures to address the needs of victims of terrorism should factor in the sensitivities of these vulnerable sections, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/victims-of-terror-attacks-yet-to-get-justice-due-to-pakistan-s-non-cooperative-attitude-india/story-rZPcWDyC1JFh0h8G1WtzgI.html
29-09-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh unveils elephant adoption scheme in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve||The Madhya Pradesh forest department has launched a scheme for wildlife lovers to adopt old and retired elephants which gave joyrides for at least five decades in Bandhavgarh Tiger reserve.The elephants can be adopted for a day, week, month or a year. In a first of its kind initiative by the state’s forest department, 74-year-old Gautam and 69-year-old Toofan- two elephants in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve - are being given for adoption to wildlife lovers with 13 other ‘domesticated’ elephants, said a forest official on Tuesday. The initiative has been taken to reconnect tourists and wildlife lovers with the elephants, which are popular among people for joy rides during sightseeing, while generating funds for their maintenance which has been hit hard due to the lockdown and Covid-19 pandemic in the state, said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF), wildlife. Kumar said the wildlife conservators can adopt an elephant for Rs 500 for a day to Rs 1.50 lakh for a year to bear medical and food expenses on them. “The wildlife lovers, who opt for monthly and yearly adoption plans, will get a chance to participate in elephant rejuvenation programme camp held annually in September at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. In the camp, which is a kind of holiday for elephants, people can feed the animals and spend time with them for better understanding about the elephants,” he said. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve field director Vincet Raheem said, “Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve is the worst affected due to the intrusion of at least 35 wild elephants from Chhattisgarh. The visitors are concerned about the presence of wild elephants for more than a year but this adoption programme will enhance the connection with 15 special elephants and reduce their concern. This is more of public awareness for the animals especially in view of the presence of wild elephants in the area.” Special training programmes are also being conducted in the reserve area for forest guards, guides and villagers on how to deal with wild elephants and how to pacify the animals without hurting them, said the official. “The training programme will conclude in presence of experts before opening of the tiger reserve for tourists on October 1,” said Raheem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-unveils-elephant-adoption-scheme-in-bandhavgarh-tiger-reserve/story-9cgUVxypuhjHBwuHj3W18I.html

Read full statement||India on Tuesday lodged strong protest against the Pakistan government, stating that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India. Pakistan, India said, has ‘no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied it’. India issued a statement responding to the announcement of elections ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ legislative assembly scheduled for November 15. Here is the full text of Ministry of External Affairs on India’s reaction:We have seen reports regarding announcement of elections to the so-called “Gilgit-Baltistan” Legislative Assembly to be held on November 15, 2020. The Government of India has conveyed its strong protest to the Government of Pakistan and reiterated that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of so-called Gilgit and Baltistan are an integral part of India by virtue of its accession in 1947. The Government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it.The Government of India has also completely rejected the recent actions such as the so-called “Gilgit-Baltistan (Elections and Caretaker Government) Amendment Order 2020” and continued attempts by the Pakistan establishment to bring material changes in areas under its illegal and forcible occupation. Action such as these can neither hide the illegal occupation of parts of Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan occupied territories for the past seven decades. These are cosmetic exercises intended to camouflage its illegal occupation. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-protests-pak-s-move-to-hold-elections-in-gilgit-pakistan-read-full-statement/story-AQ2orvZN8if2ZCqQn3kzgI.html

Therefore, non-stop flow and clean water in the river is very much needed. If the old steps were repeated then the condition would have stayed the same.” PM Modi said the government went ahead with new thinking and new approach. “We did not restrict it to just cleaning up Ganga, but made it the country’s largest river conservation project,” he added.The Prime Minister said that currently under Namami Gange Mission, projects worth Rs 30,000 crores are either completed or are underway.Here is what PM Modi said in his address:- Jal Jeevan Mission has given an opportunity to the people of the village. Opportunity - to free our village from water problems.Opportunity - to make our village full of water.- Major reforms have been made related to the farmers, workers and health of the country. With these reforms, the workers of the country will be empowered, the youth of the country will be empowered, the women of the country will be empowered, the farmers of the country will be empowered. But today the country is seeing how some people are protesting only for protest.- Today, even when the central government is giving the farmers their rights, these people came down on protest. These people want that the farmers of the country could not sell their produce in the open market. These people are now insulting the farmers by setting fire to the goods and equipment that the farmer worships. - In this period, the country has seen how the Digital India campaign, Jan Dhan bank accounts have helped people. When our government started this work, these people were opposing them. These people have always opposed this, if the bank account of the poor of the country is opened, they should also do digital transactions.- For years these people kept saying that they would implement MSP, but did not. Our own government did the work of implementing MSP as per the wish of Swaminathan Commission.- Today these people are also spreading confusion over MSP. There will also be MSP in the country and the farmer will also have the freedom to sell crops anywhere in the country. But some people are unable to tolerate this freedom.- These people are neither with the farmer nor with the youth nor with the brave soldiers. Our government gave the benefit of One Rank One Pension to the soldiers, then they also opposed it. - At the initiative of India, when the whole world was celebrating International Yoga Day, these people sitting in India were opposing it. Even when the tallest statue of Sardar Patel was being unveiled, these people were opposing it. Till date, no major leader has gone to the Statue of Unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-black-money-msp-here-s-what-pm-modi-said-at-namami-gange-mission-project-launch/story-Q21wJc2Q4qd6020sud0q2I.html

According to the commission, chief secretaries and chief electoral officers from these four states have expressed to the EC about difficulties in conduct of elections and issues related to it. The polls were to be held in Assam’s Rangapara and Sibsagar, Kerala’s Kuttanad and Chavara, Tamil Nadu’s Tiruvottiyur and Gudiyattam, and West Bengal’s Falakata. “The Commission has decided not to announce the conduct of elections at this stage in the above seven vacancies in legislative assemblies of the state of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.” EC’s statement said. As for vacancies in other states, the statement stated that “the commission will decide after taking necessary inputs from the states concerned”. People familiar with the matter had earlier told Hindustan Times that it does not make sense to hold the elections in Kerala, where there are only two vacancies, as the assembly in the state is due to be re-elected before June 2021.One assembly seat each in Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka and West Bengal; five assembly seats in Manipur and eight each in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are also vacant.In July, the EC had deferred the by-elections to one Lok Sabha and seven assembly seats beyond the six month period due to the onset of monsoon and possibilities of floods and the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-decides-not-to-announce-by-polls-in-assam-west-bengal-kerala-and-tamil-nadu-after-receiving-inputs-from-chief-secretaries-and-electoral-officers/story-A48VJdP9Bn0r7uSKcoZqfJ.html
29-09-2020||India||Election Commission likely to announce bypoll dates today||The Election Commission of India (ECI) will on Tuesday take a call on byelections to one Lok Sabha and 64 assembly constituencies. On Friday, while announcing the schedule of the Bihar Assembly polls, chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora had said the poll body would hold a meeting on September 29 regarding the bypolls and make an announcement in the evening.Earlier this month, the ECI, in a statement, had said the Bihar Assembly polls and the 65 bypolls would be conducted around the same time. However, on Friday, Arora said the ECI had received representations from some states, especially southern states, to defer the polling exercise in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. The Lok Sabha seat to which bypoll is to be held is Valmiki Nagar in Bihar. The 64 Assembly seats, meanwhile, include 27 from Madhya Pradesh which were vacated after Congress MLAs followed their leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), resulting in the collapse of the state’s Congress government and return to power of the BJP.The Bihar Assembly polls will take place in three phases--October 28, November 3 and November 7 with counting of votes on November 10--as announced by the commission on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-likely-to-announce-bypoll-dates-today/story-9QIH1gT0LmWBxJmeaZ7DMK.html
29-09-2020||India||Prosecutors must file own report for more seeking time to file charge sheet: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court has said that prosecutors are not postmen and must apply their mind and submit an independent report whenever investigation officers seek extension of time for filing a charge sheet to deprive the accused of default bail.“He (the prosecutor) is not a mere postman or a forwarding agency,” said the bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar. The bench added that if the prosecutor agrees with reasons cited by the investigation agency, he would prepare his own independent report to assist the special court to decide whether the time period needs to be extended beyond 90 days and to a maximum of 180 days.“If he is not convinced, he has the freedom to disagree with the reasons cited by the investigation agency and it is within his power even to refuse to submit a report,” said the bench. The essence is that the prosecutor must be convinced that the investigation is progressing and the investigation officer is unable to complete it within the prescribed time for justifiable reasons, the bench added.The bench was hearing a petition filed by one Shaikh Moin Shaikh Mehmood, who was booked by Ramtirth police in Handed district for robbery. Subsequently, provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), 1999 were added in the case. Shaikh was arrested on June 2, 2020.On August 31, 2020, the 90-day period for filing the charge sheet was over. On September 2, the investigating officers filed an application for extension of the period by another 90 days, as provided for in section 21(2)(b) of the MCOCA. Eight days later, the accused filed for default bail on the ground of failure of the investigation agency to file charge sheet in time stipulated under Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.Shaikh had moved HC after the special MCOCA court rejected his bail plea and granted extension for filing charge sheet, as prayed by the investigation officer.The HC allowed his petition after noticing that the prosecutor had merely countersigned the investigation officer’s application for extension.The court reiterated that the right to default bail accrues to the accused the moment the period prescribed under section 167(2) lapses and the court cannot extinguish the right. “The law has to prevail and the prosecution cannot avail of such subterfuges to frustrate or destroy the legal right of the accused,” said the bench granting bail to Shaikh.It added that the report of the prosecutor seeking extension must record his satisfaction about progress in investigation and valid reasons because of which the investigation could not be completed in time. But it noticed that prosecutors are unaware of these legal requirements and therefore directed that a copy of the judgment be sent for perusal of the chief secretary, director general of police and the director of prosecution, so that the prosecutors can be enlightened on the settled legal position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prosecutors-must-file-own-report-for-more-seeking-time-to-file-charge-sheet-bombay-hc/story-D1fuNHDnYtTU4ydQjKyTyN.html

Rajan Pandey was shot at by three men in Manjagadh police station area of Gopalganj district, in what police suspect to be a case of personal enmity. Police said the incident took place when Pandey was on his way to a coaching institute. Three motorcycle borne miscreants intercepted him and fired at him from point blank range. Pandey has been referred to Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) from the Gopalganj district hospital in a critical condition. Gopalganj’s Superintendent of Police (SP) Manoj Tiwary said thatPandey revealed the names of three assailants - Rajendra Yadav, Rajkumar Singh and Nanhe Singh - who attacked him. According to the police, Rajan is attached with a coaching institute and is also a teacher. The SP said raids are on to nab the accused. “Personal enmity was the reason behind the attack,” the SP told HT. Five journalists have been killed in separate incidents in Bihar in the last couple of years. In May 2016, Siwan bureau chief of Hindi daily Hindustan, Rajdeo Ranjan, was killed in a busy market place. In November, the same year, two journalists - Dharmendra Singh of Dainik Bhaskar in Sasaram and Ramchandra Yadav, who worked with the Dainik Jagran in Darbhanga, were killed on the same day. In January 2017, Brajesh Kumar, a journalist working with a Hindi daily, was shot dead in Samastipur while Pradeep Mandal, of a national Hindi daily was gunned down in Madhubani in July 2019. In Vaishali on Tuesday, two criminals on a motorcycle gunned down a contractor Bijendra Rai at Mathurapur under Bidupur police station area. The reason behind the incident is said to be a land dispute with a close relative. SDPO Raghav Dayal said Rai was attacked when he was returning to his home in Terasiya village from Haipur market. He succumbed to his injury on the way to Sadar hospital from Bidupur primary health centre. In Samastipur, another contractor identified as Rinku Choudhary was gunned down near Kashipur Girl’s high school falling under Town police station.

The ministers will also discuss regional issues and “collectively affirm the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”.

India, Australia and France held their inaugural senior officials’ trilateral dialogue, with the focus on building convergences in the Indo-Pacific, on September 9, the same day that India and Japan signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), a pact for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces. Ahead of the second ministerial meeting of the Quad, senior officials of the four countries held consultations on September 25 on collective efforts to advance a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. The officials also exchanged views on ongoing and proposed practical cooperation in connectivity and infrastructure development and security matters, including counter-terrorism, cyber and maritime security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-to-visit-japan-during-oct-6-7-for-quad-meeting/story-zZJ6Sj7yEx4FEz6ymdEmPP.html

He also launched the logo of Jal Jeevan Mission, via video conferencing.The projects include construction of a 68 MLD sewage treatment plant (STP), up-gradation of the existing 27 MLD plant at Jagjeetpur in Haridwar and construction of an 18 MLD STP at Sarai in Haridwar. The inauguration of 68 MLD Jagjeetpur project also marks the completion of the first sewerage project taken up on hybrid annuity mode of public-private partnership (PPP) mode.“In the past decades, huge initiatives were taken up to clean river Ganga but those initiatives had neither public participation nor farsightedness. As a result, water of river Ganga was never cleaned,” PM Modi said.PM Modi said in Prayagraj Kumbh, the serenity of Ganga was experienced by devotees from all over the world and now during Haridwar Kumbh, the whole world is going to experience the bathing of the pure Ganga. “Today, we are all seeing the results of this all-round work of the government. Today, work on projects worth 30 thousand crores under Namami Gange project is going on or has been completed. The government moved forward in four directions simultaneously. First, started laying a trap of sewage treatment plants to prevent the dirty water falling into the Ganges. Second, building sewage treatment plants that can meet the needs of the next 10-15 years. Third, working towards making 100 big cities and 5,000 villages situated on the banks of river Ganga open defecation free. Fourth, to put pollution in the river Ganga and its tributaries,” he said.The PM said had the old methods been adopted, the situation would have been equally bad today. “We have not limited the Namami Ganga Mission to the cleanliness of Ganga, but have made it the largest and comprehensive river conservation program in the country,” he said.PM Modi said from its origins in Uttarakhand to confluence point in West Bengal, Ganga has enriched the lives of nearly half of the country’s population, adding that the cleanliness of the river is necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-inaugurates-6-mega-projects-in-uttarakhand-says-all-round-work-of-govt-making-ganga-clean/story-rxZdTFmn68Rkt2nP7zJL0H.html
29-09-2020||India||On new farm laws, Rahul Gandhi holds ‘Kisaan Ki Baat’ with farmers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday interacted with farmers from across the country on Centre’s three contentious farm laws. The farmers told Gandhi that the laws were ‘black laws’, saying they were being ‘exploited.’The interaction, which took place virtually, was called ‘Kisaan Ki Baat.’ Ten farmers from states like Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Maharashtra and Delhi participated in it.Gandhi’s first question to farmers was how will the laws harm them. Replying to this, Dhirendra Kumar from Bihar said, “These laws are totally black laws. Poor and farmers are being exploited, Farmers are being forced to commit suicide.”The former Congress president then asked why farmers were apprehensive Minimum Support Price (MSP) will be withdrawn. Calling it nothing but ‘jumlebaji,’ Sunil Singh from Punjab said the government was cheating farmers.What’s worst thing about these laws, Gandhi next questioned farmers to which Rakesh Jakhar from Haryana said the laws have been framed to finish off the farmers.“I’m more scared of these laws than coronavirus. I’m scared my land will not be in the name of my next generation,” Gajanan Kashinath from Maharashtra said.“The first big fight I fought was on land acquisition,” Gandhi said, referring to his arrest in Bhatta Parsaul in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida in 2011. He further said the media attacked him but he was able to face it.Gandhi ended the interaction by saying there was no difference between the three farm laws and demonetisation and Goods and Service Tax (GST). The bills, he said, were like a ‘stab in the heart.’ He further said he was absolutely clear that protests against farm laws were needed, adding that once again, farmers’ voice will take India to a new freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-new-farm-laws-rahul-gandhi-holds-kisaan-ki-baat-with-farmers/story-HRKdvEJEXUK6YBzjHSMw7J.html

The force said in a statement that this was an “attempt by anti-national elements to smuggle arms and ammunition into the Indian territory”.The BSF said that they got the tip-off about the infiltration attempt from a source and accordingly launched an operation.“DIG BSF Aizwal Kuldeep Singh and SK Pillai, 2I/C alongwith team of personnel from 90 Bn BSF based in Mamit district laid ambush on the route that was being taken by the anti-national elements. It was learnt that they were bringing in AK series rifles along with a lot of ammunition for some insurgent group,” the BSF statement said.Late on Monday night, the BSF troops intercepted two vehicles trying to cross into the Indian territory. The vehicles were spotted in West Phaileng in Mamit district which borders Bangladesh.It further said that there were three people in these vehicles who were disarmed and apprehended. The BSF said that it recovered 28 AK series rifles, one Insas rifle and one 0.3 inch carbine.These arms and ammunition were hidden in the cavities in the vehicles, it added.The three apprehended people were also carrying cash worth Rs 39,020, the BSF said. They were later handed over to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-smuggle-arms-into-india-bsf-intercepts-2-vehicles-in-mizoram/story-WjuWngqXKPNt49UtgFTDgN.html
29-09-2020||India||‘How long do you propose to continue?’ Supreme Court asks Jammu and Kashmir administration on Iltija Mufti’s plea challenging her mother’s detention||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the central government whether it proposes to continue the preventive detention of former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti.A bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked the Centre to inform the top court about its proposal with regard to Mufti.“You should address us on two issues ; One, what is the maximum period for which a person can be detained and two, what is your proposal and how long do you propose to continue the detention,” justice Kaul told Centre’s second senior-most law officer, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Mufti’s daughter, Iltija challenging her mother’s detention under Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA).Mufti has been under detention since August 5, 2019, when the Centre nullified Article 370 and placed the Kashmir valley in a state of lockdown. Her detention in 2019 was under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which empowers an executive magistrate to order a person to execute bonds “for keeping the peace”.She had been in custody for six months and her detention was set to expire in February 2020 when a new detention order was issued on February 5 under the PSA which allows the administration to detain a person without trial for a maximum period of 1 year in case of persons acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and for two years in case of persons acting prejudicially to the security of the country. Iltija alleged that the continued detention was because of the refusal by Mufti to sign a general bond affirming that in case of release, she will not make any comment, deliver any speech or attend any public assembly related to the recent events in Jammu and Kashmir.The case had first come up for hearing on February 26 when the top court had issued notice to the Centre and union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. When the case came up for hearing today, Tushar Mehta told the court that Mufti has been detained on the ground that her conduct could lead to public order issues. He also informed the court that the Centre has filed a counter affidavit in the matter. The court adjourned the matter for October 15 after Iltija sought permission to file an amended petition. The Centre was given liberty to file its response to the amended plea.Iltija has submitted that the detention of Mufti is a based upon dossier prepared by the Superintendent of Police, Srinagar which itself was replete personal remarks against Mufti and in bad taste. The dossier, she alleged, was abound with vulgar descriptions about Mufti like “Daddy’s girl” and “Kota Rani”, the latter a medieval queen who rose to power through scheming and poisoning of opponents. It contained unwarranted remarks about the marital status of Mufti and described her as “hard headed” and possessing a “scheming mind”.It was Iltija’s case that the detention of Mufti was based only on the grounds contained in the dossier and those grounds have no tendency to disturb public order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-long-do-you-propose-to-continue-supreme-court-asks-jammu-and-kashmir-administration-on-iltija-mufti-s-plea-challenging-her-mother-s-detention/story-3TF434wdWCgtP6pcDtozRL.html
29-09-2020||India||Suspected thief dies of bullet injury in police custody in MP, two cops booked||Two policemen were suspended and booked for culpable homicide while the district superintendent of police (SP) was shifted on Monday after a protest by residents of Narayanpur village in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh over the death in custody of a 38-year-old man on Sunday night. Villagers alleged that the deceased - a suspect in a theft case - received bullet injuries from the service revolver of a police inspector that caused his death.However, police claimed that Rajpati Kushwaha, the deceased who was a resident of Narayanpur village and detained for interrogation in a theft case, shot himself with a police officer’s service revolver. The suspended cops include Singhpur police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and constable Ashish Kumar, said Rewa zone inspector general of police (IGP) Umesh Joga. The transfer of the SP of Satna district Riyaz Iqbal was announced by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Bhopal. He also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh to next to the kin of the deceased.“Superintendent of police of Satna district Riyaz Iqbal has been shifted from Satna. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered. If any police personnel is found guilty in the inquiry the state government will not spare him and take strict action against him,” Chouhan told reporters. Later, an FIR was lodged against the two cops for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. “An FIR has been registered against the police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and constable Ashish Kumar under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 348 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Singhpur police station,” Joga said.Earlier, a large number of residents of Narayanpur village in Satna district, 486 kilometres north east of Bhopal, led by local MLA Siddharth Kushwaha of the Congress staged a protest at the police station demanding criminal case for murder against the police personnel and their arrest. They also demanded transfer of the SP. Police caned the protesters to control the situation. The deceased’s daughter Shivani Kushwaha, 18, said, “My father was being harassed by police for a long time. He can’t kill himself because he was a brave person and told us that he would come back from the police station as he didn’t commit any crime.” “Police are lying. He was killed by police,” Kushwaha said. “The agitated mob tried to gherao the police station and also pelted stones on the police station. Police used tear gas and resorted to use of force to control the mob,” said the IG. Joga said Rajpati was interrogated over the theft of a rifle and jewelry.“A few days ago, someone stole jewelry and a licensed rifle from the house of the former sarpanch of Narayapur village. The former sarpanch in his written complaint expressed his doubt about involvement of Rajpati and two others in the crime. Police had interrogated Rajpati once last week. On Sunday, he was called again for interrogation to the police station.” “SP Riyaz Iqbal informed me that during interrogation, Rajpati snatched the revolver of police station in-charge Vikram Pathak and shot himself in the middle of his forehead. He was taken to a private hospital from where he was referred to Sanjay Gandhi Medical College, Rewa where he succumbed to bullet injury,” said Joga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspected-thief-dies-of-bullet-injury-in-police-custody-in-mp-two-cops-booked/story-pqkKSxgVjDb11w4bRKEb7M.html
29-09-2020||India||India’s Feluda Covid-19 test cheaper, faster alternative to RT-PCR, say scientists||More accurate than a rapid antigen test and almost as quick, India’s CRISPR ‘Feluda’ Covid-19 test that changes colour on detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be a cheaper, faster and simpler alternative to an RT-PCR diagnosis, say scientists.Named after Satyajit Ray’s famed detective, the Feluda test, which is priced at Rs 500 and can deliver a result in 45 minutes, is able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses even if genetic variations between them are minute.The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Feluda test, developed by the New Delhi-based CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and the TATA Group, received regulatory approvals last week from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for commercial launch.It meets high quality benchmarks with 96 per cent sensitivity and 98 per cent specificity for detecting the novel coronavirus, Debojyoti Chakraborty, a senior scientist at CSIR-IGIB and part of the team that developed the test, told PTI.Sensitivity is defined as the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with the disease, while specificity is the ability of the assay to accurately identify those without the disease.Similar to a pregnancy strip test, Feluda changes colour if the virus is detected and doesn’t need expensive machines for detection. “The CRISPR technology uses a highly specific CAS9 protein to find and bind to the target Covid signature. This is then coupled with paper-strip chemistry to elicit a visual readout on a paper strip,” Chakraborty explained.The test can help the country, with the world’s second highest cases of Covid-19 at 61.45 lakh cases, ramp up testing of the disease quickly and economically, the researchers behind the test said in a statement.Virologist Upasana Ray noted that the CRISPR based Covid-19 detection system is a cheaper option to RT-PCR tests, which cost over Rs 1,600. RAT and Feluda are in the same price bracket. FELUDA, an acronym for the FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay, uses an indigenously developed, cutting-edge CRISPR technology for detection of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the scientists said.CRISPR is a gene editing technology and is used in correcting genetic defects and treating and preventing the spread of diseases.The technology can detect specific sequences of DNA within a gene, and uses an enzyme functioning as molecular scissors to snip it.According to Ray, Feluda is capable of detecting even low quantities of the genetic material of the novel coronavirus, based on very minute differences in their RNA – the genetic material of a virus “Feluda is an alternative to the quantitative RT-PCR tests and is highly specific. It is capable of detecting low copy number nucleic acids (less viral RNA quantity) as well as single nucleotide variations,” Ray, a senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata, told PTI.She explained that the tests are so specific that they can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infections from other coronaviruses such as the one that caused the 2002-03 SARS pandemic.“It can distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV sequences which differ by a single nucleotide. Unlike RT-PCR which requires expensive machines, Feluda is simple and can be used in laboratories as well as outside with a quicker turnaround time,” she added. In May, the US granted emergency-use approval for the world’s first CRISPR-based test for Covid-19, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University.The CRISPR Feluda test is the world’s first diagnostic test to deploy a specially adapted Cas9 protein, derived from Francisella novicida bacteria, to successfully detect the virus that causes COVID-19, the researchers said. Other CRISPR tests, like the one developed in the US, use CAS12 and CAS13 proteins to detect SARS-CoV-2. Compared with a rapid antigen test, which interprets results in 30 minutes, Ray said the Feluda test would take slightly longer, up to 45 minutes, but is more accurate and specific.Rapid antigen tests detect the viral proteins or parts thereof whereas CRISPR detects nucleic acids, or RNA in case of Covid-19, Ray said.Chakaraborty noted that RT-PCR takes about 1.5 hours, trained manpower and a dedicated and expensive RT-PCR machine which is not widely available.“Feluda gives similar sensitivity and specificity as RT-PCR but is inexpensive, requires a basic widely available PCR machine and doesn’t require extensive trained manpower. The chemistry and biology is of course different,” Chakraborty added.“This marks a significant achievement for the Indian scientific community, moving from R&D to a high-accuracy, scalable and reliable test in less than 100 days. The Tata CRISPR test achieves accuracy levels of traditional RT-PCR tests, with quicker turnaround time, less expensive equipment, and better ease of use,” the researchers said in their statement. They described CRISPR as a futuristic technology that can also be configured for the detection of other pathogens.“Current R&D is towards making Feluda more point of care, simpler and more deployable to meet the testing needs of the country and enable return to workplaces, schools, etc,” Chakraborty added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-feluda-covid-19-test-cheaper-faster-alternative-to-rt-pcr-say-scientists/story-j1NF1WY5hMu9AZbAWqvMyN.html
29-09-2020||India||Bombay high court to hear Rhea Chakraborty’s bail plea today; NCB opposes saying she is ‘prominent member of drug syndicate’||The Bombay high court will take up the bail applications filed by Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty on Tuesday. Both of them have been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drug case linked to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Chakraborty’s earlier application for bail was rejected by a special court and she was remanded to 14-day judicial custody. That custody was later extended till October 6.While arguing in the court, Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde said that the investigation of offence lodged under the NDPS ought to have transferred to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the as per Supreme Court’s order.He said that the central government has empowered CBI to investigate Rajput’s death so the NCB has no jurisdiction.Replying to the bail application, the NCB said that it has the jurisdiction to investigate the case against her and several others, including her brother Showik.The agency further said that the Supreme Court has directed the CBI to take over investigation, if any new case was registered “on the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death” and the direction “was not with respect to the present case” registered under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.NCB reiterated it’s stand that Rhea was “an active member of the drug syndicate connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers.” In this regard the reply to her bail plea states that the “Applicant (Rhea) has in her statement (recorded by NCB) revealed about her involvement in procurement of drugs and financing of illicit drug dealings.”“The present applicant is prominent member of supply chain of drugs and majorly she is handling finance also,” states that affidavit. “The present applicant used to manage, finance for drug procurement along with Sushant Singh Rajput,” NCB has said while opposing Rhea’s bail plea.Chakraborty, 28, was arrested by the federal agency on September 9. According to the NCB, Rhea and Showik financed and arranged drugs for Rajput at his instructions.The NCB started its investigation after receiving official communication from Enforcement Directorate (ED), in which there were various chats related to drug consumption, procurement, usage and transportation in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Chakraborty has said that she is innocent, falsely implicated in the case, and was coerced into making “self-incriminatory” confessions by the NCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-to-hear-rhea-chakraborty-s-bail-plea-today-ncb-opposes-saying-she-is-prominent-member-of-drug-syndicate/story-XRMGUrsQxeANzDUhBvTmyO.html
29-09-2020||India||Covid hospitals in Bengal to conduct rapid antigen tests on all patients in SARI wards||The West Bengal government has directed Covid hospitals in the state to conduct Rapid Antigen Tests on all patients who show up with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). This would help in the early detection of Covid-19 positive cases and start the treatment, which in turn would help to bring down the death rate further, officials said. “Rapid Antigen Testing to be arranged at SARI wards so that Covid positive patients can be identified immediately and treated for Covid-19 without delay,” said an order issued by the Bengal government to all Covid hospitals on Monday. The state government in a door-to-door survey has identified around 8,700 SARI cases and around 4.5 lakh cases of Influenza-like Illness.In mid-June there were 4,337 cases of SARI and 1.9 lakh cases of Influenza-like Illness. SARI involves the history of a fever higher than 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 F) and cough for over 10 days. Severe forms of SARI – including severe pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock – can lead to death in Covid-19 patients. Even though the Mamata Banerjee administration has been able to bring down the death rate from more than 13% in May which was the highest among all states, to around 1.9% on September 28, it is still higher than the national average. At present India’s case fatality rate or death rate is around 1.5%. The Centre is working towards bringing the national death rate down to 1% or below. “In a meeting held in August, the state government was advised by the Centre to ensure that at least in 80% of the fresh Covid-19 cases and all close contacts need to be traced and tested within three days,” said a health department official. A few states, including West Bengal, were also asked by the Centre to conduct at least 140 tests per million per day in all districts while targeting a positivity rate of less than 5%. At present Bengal has a positivity rate of 7.9%. West Bengal has so far reported 2,50,580 Covid-19 cases and 4,837 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-hospitals-in-bengal-to-conduct-rapid-antigen-tests-on-all-patients-in-sari-wards/story-ksxA39Bxbdrqf8ffSutuNP.html

29-09-2020||India||Sardar Sarovar Dam’s sudden water release flooded parts of Gujarat, suggests analysis||An analysis by the South Asia Network of Rivers, Dams and People (SANDRP) has suggested that severe flooding in Gujarat’s Bharuch, Narmada and Vadodara districts from August 29 to September 2 had occurred because of sudden release of massive quantities of water from the Sardar Sarovar Dam (SSD).This has led critics and supporters of the dam writing counter arguments on online portals on the role of SSD in causing floods in Gujarat in early September.SANDRP, which has analysed the SSD’s water release data, said that no water was released from the dam spillway until August 28, despite information from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) that there has been exceptionally heavy rainfall in the Narmada basin’s upstream since August 25 and earlier. Also read: One more dies in Assam floods, over 3 lakh people affected in 13 districts“What we saw this time is a worrying trend. SSD couldn’t ration its water release based on information of extreme rainfall in the Narmada catchment area. There was large scale devastation primarily because of sudden water release by the dam. Hundreds of people had to be shifted from Bharuch and Vadodara districts during the flooding.I fear that more such dam generated floods will affect the region in the future,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, SANDRP, and an engineer, who was earlier associated with the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA). The analysis suggests that though no water was released by the dam after extremely heavy rains started in the Narmada valley districts, the dam started releasing up to 10 lakh cusecs from the night of August 29.“Three days later, on September 1, they closed most of the spillway gates, which reduced releases from spillway to less than a tenth of the earlier figure. From August 29 to September 1, massive quantities were released, up to 30, 000 cumecs through spillways, and almost nothing before or after. It created massive flood disasters all along the downstream from Gaudeshwar to Chandod to Bharuch,” Thakkar said. SANDRP, in its analysis published on their website, said the SSD authorities might have ignored both Central Water Commission’s (CWC) warnings and IMD’s rainfall forecast.The first heavy spell of rainfall in the Narmada basin had occurred between August 16 and 18, followed by more precipitation on August 21 and 22.However, an exceptionally heavy spell of rainfall was recorded from August 26 onwards. On August 27, Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Narsinghpur had recorded 152.6 millimetres (mm); Raisen (110.5 mm); Hoshangabad (81.8 mm); and the following day Betul recorded (142.4 mm); Harda ( 111.1 mm); and Hoshangabad (191.1 mm).On August 28, the CWC in its flood forecast had also warned that the SSD was expected to receive increased flows due to very heavy rainfall in the past three days leading to a rise in the water level of Narmada, Mahi, Sabarmati and rivers flowing in the westward direction in Gujarat. CWC had tweeted on September 1 that “heavy inflows are still continuing at Indirasagar, Omkareshwar and SSD. Releases from SSD gave rise to severe flooding situation at Garudeshwar in Narmada and Bharuch districts.”SSD is one of the largest water resources projects in the country that covers four major states such as Maharashtra, MP, Gujarat and Rajasthan.“At the outset, let me make it clear that SANDRP is quite known for its anti-dam stand in general and anti-SSD in particular,” said MB Joshi, chief general manager (technical & coordination), Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited.The 1,163-kilometre (km) stretch of river Narmada -- from its source at Amarkantak to SSD – had recorded heavy rainfall from August 20 to September 1. Around 14,660 million cubic metres of water were received at Indira Sagar as against its live storage capacity of 9,745 million cubic metres. Indira Sagar is the largest dam in the Narmada river basin, according to SSD authorities. SSD had to negotiate huge releases of water from the upstream major dams such as Omkareshwar and Indira Sagar because of heavy rainfall. “Keeping in view the safety of the dam as well as the people in Bharuch city and about 30 villages on the banks of Narmada, the reservoir was operated in a scientific way following the established principles of flood routing in major dams,” the SSD said. The SSD authorities cited that SANDRP’s report is factually incorrect because no water was released by the barrage until August 29. The River Bed Power House (RBPH) operation was started from midnight on August 25 and it gradually gained momentum. “Efficacy of SSD in flood control is evident from the fact that despite continuous heavy inflow of over 10 lakh cusecs of water received for about 62 hours -- between 6 pm on August 30 to 11 pm on September 1 -- spillway release of more than 10 lakh cusecs could be restricted after 21 hours,” and “inflow at Sardar Sarovar went up to as high as 12.06 lakh cusec on August 31. However, the maximum spillway discharge released was 10.74 lakh cusec after considering the fact that any release from the dam further gets added due to flow from tributaries joining in the downstream,” the SSD authorities said.Four retired Gujarat government officials, including two chief engineers and a secretary of the Gujarat government, responded to SANDRP’s analysis in the Counterview portal. “Some well-known activists, who are anti-dam in general and anti-Sardar Sarovar in particular, have been still attempting to curse the SSD and its project authorities by making false allegations of having created ‘avoidable flood disaster’. Instead of allowing the public in the downstream areas to share their experience of having a great sigh of relief this year amid very heavy rainfall in the Narmada basin, factually incorrect information is being deliberately disseminated,” they argued against SANDRP’s assertions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sardar-sarovar-dam-s-sudden-water-release-flooded-parts-of-gujarat-suggests-analysis/story-2jenBfEwRF2Kvlkc835VjJ.html

29-09-2020||India||In farm bill protest, Cong finds a new inspiration: Arun Jaitley||On the farm bill issue—their biggest protest in the second term of the Narendra Modi government—the Congress party has discovered an unusual inspiration: Arun Jaitley. The late union minister has been mentioned twice by the Congress at two crucial junctures of their protests: when it asked its state governments to explore legislative options against the farm bills and after the Opposition’s demand for a division (voting) was rejected in the Rajya Sabha. Also read: After CWC, key Congress poll panel set for rejigA day before the monsoon session ended on September 23, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad invoked Jaitley’s remarks on division to attack the government. Azad’s attack came two days after the Opposition’s fervid appeal for a division on the farm bills in the Rajya Sabha was not approved by Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh. “I want to quote what Arun Jaitley had said in 2016. He said, ‘That the Government becomes illegitimate if the Speaker refuses the division of vote.’ He termed it as illegitimate,” said Azad. He was referring to the government’s plea in the Supreme Court against a Uttarakhand High Court order. Azad reminded the House that there too, the core issue was denial of division in the floor despite the Opposition asking for it. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, a close friend of Jaitley, was in the chair. He quickly reminded Azad that Jaitley had also spoken about tyranny of minority when Opposition parties regularly halted government business in the Upper House. “Arun Jaitleyji is no more. He has also said that it is the tyranny of minority,” said Naidu. On Monday, when the Congress upped its ante against the farm bill and sought legal actions, they again referred to Jaitley. They asked the states to take cue of what Jaitley had said in the context of the controversial land acquisition law that the NDA government tried to amend to make it more farmer-friendly as well as beneficial to the industries. As the UPA-era law made it extremely difficult for industries to acquire land, Jaitley had pointed out that the Indian Constitution has a provision under which states can make their own laws on Concurrent List of Business to override any union law. Party insiders said that during a brainstorming meeting on the farm bills, Congress’ top legal brain Abhishek Singhvi had referred to Jaitley’s argument to advise the Congress-ruled states to make their own farm laws. Both Singhvi and Jaitley had referred to Article 254(2) in The Constitution Of India that said, “Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State: Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.” Singhvi, however, also cautioned his party colleagues that the President of India might not give his assent to the state laws on this issue as the farm bill has taken a political turn and led to massive protests both by NDA’s political opponents as well as farmer bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-farm-bill-protest-cong-finds-a-new-inspiration-arun-jaitley/story-sQNm1sP5uqOiA0muMtQluN.html
29-09-2020||India||Post Ladakh, PLA no longer a bogey for Indian Army | Analysis||On the eve of the 2004 general elections, a meeting of China Study Group (CSG) was held to review the status of border roads along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with the then Vice Chief of Army Staff briefing the apex group on strategic roads. At this meeting the then Home Secretary asked the Army general why we were not building strategic north-to-south roads and questioned the delays in doing so. The answer was that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could use these roads to come into India. The Home Secretary shot back that at this rate India should also stop building roads in Delhi.Sixteen years later, the Indian Army has finally shrugged off the bogey of the PLA and is staring down at the Chinese at Ladakh with the sole objective of restoring status quo ante at all friction points along the line of actual control. The change in the mindset of the Indian Army came after the June 15 Galwan flare-up where Col Santosh Babu and his men engaged in hand to hand combat with their adversaries, who are projected as Shaolin Temple warriors by the Chinese state media.Serving Indian Army officers say that once the Prime Minister of India went to Ladakh to boost the morale and the Indian public gathered to honour the fallen — in contrast to the PLA’s hush-hush burial of its dead— the mood changed. Despite the raging pandemic that has origins in Wuhan, the honour bestowed on fallen Indian troops including a brave Junior Commissioned Officer of the elite special frontier force in August 29-30 operation on south Pangong Tso has boosted the morale of Indian forces.ALSO WATCH | Ladakh | Tanks, combat vehicles: Indian Army ready to counter China amid tension While both armies are now stocking up for the polar winter on Ladakh heights, the PLA with its troops largely made of conscripts who were sent to Aksai Chin as part of an annual exercise must be asking questions of their military commanders. The conscripts are sole children of their parents in China, who join the army for a limited period to ensure State funding of their college education. The idea of spending their winters in Ladakh’s rarefied heights will surely test not only their endurance but also their commitment to PLA as the exercise has the potential to take the turn for the worse at any given moment.Although the situation is tense on the border, India’s national security planners say that the grossly mis-calculated aggression ordered by Commander in Chief Xi Jinping in Ladakh has finally removed the Chinese bogey from Indian backs. In the past two decades, China had become Lord Voldemort or he whose name shall not be taken in Indian diplomatic, military and intelligence circles. Former Indian defence minister George Fernandes had to face the brunt for merely telling the truth that China was a threat. This has now changed with the Modi government not mincing words on China and seriously examining the penetration of Beijing into the Indian system. India is using software mining to identify parent companies and their country of origin from the details of front companies investing in India. This is a sea change from the 2000s when Chinese workers were given business visas in thousands to come to India. And when mandarins in the Ministry of External Affairs believed that the Tibet issue was like “flogging a dead horse” and had lost its relevance.While predicting the military or diplomatic outcome of the LAC exercise is more difficult than reading tea leaves, the PLA aggression this summer in Ladakh, South China Sea, Taiwan and Senkaku Islands has revealed China’s true colours to the world. It has revealed the weakness of European powers and the pusillanimity of the so called Tiger powers of South East Asia in taking on China due to their economic dependency on that country. It has shown that if you have money to throw around then not even a single Muslim power will question you on concentration camps for Sunni Uighurs in Xinjiang even as they rant over the treatment of Rohingyas by Myanmar. It has shown while the world will happily chant “om mani padme hum”, it will maintain dead silence over the overt and planned Sinicization of Tibet.In the run up to the 100th year of founding of Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its paramount leader Xi Jinping has bared China’s strategic ambitions to become the sole global power under the mask of coronavirus pandemic. The world has taken note of this. How it reacts is not difficult to predict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-ladakh-pla-no-longer-a-bogey-for-indian-army/story-2NVkdELLl9pbkoUOryJvyL.html

The petitioners, from other districts, have filed the case seeking removal of the mosque from there, claiming it was built after razing a temple by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. “Residents of Braj area (with Mathura as epicenter) are living in peace with no issue being raised related to Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah mosque. Few outsiders have come and filed a court case, damaging the fabric of harmony here,” said Mahesh Pathak, president of ABTPM which has its headquarters in Haridwar and is the apex body of priests. “Things in Mathura are different from Ayodhya, where Lord Rama was living in a makeshift arrangement in the open. We have an elaborate arrangement here in Mathura, where a grand temple is constructed at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi,” said Pathak. He also said there had been an agreement in 1968 paving the way both for the temple and the mosque. Pathak questioned the timing of filing the court case “after the matter related to the Ram temple in Ayodhya got settled.” The plaintiffs are from Delhi, Lucknow, Basti and Siddharth Nagar and the next date fixed by the court is September 30. However, Gopeshwar Chaturvedi of Sri Krishna Janm Sewa Sansthan finds no wrong with the filing of the suit in the court. The sansthan has been impleaded in the case as defendant number 4 in the suit filed on behalf of Bhagwan Sri Krishna Virajman through next friend Ranjana Agnihotri from Lucknow. “The Shahi Eidgah Mosque is a symbol of atrocities that Hindus faced. It was built after razing a temple. The Muslim brothers should willingly hand over the land to Sri Krishna Janambhoomi. Mosques and temples can be many but ‘janmabhoomi’ cannot be more than one,” said Chaturvedi. “We will place our version in court,” he said. The case has been filed in court of civil judge (senior division), Mathura for cancellation of the judgment and decree dated July 20, 1973 and judgment and decree dated November 7, 1974 passed in civil suit no. 43 of 1967 by the civil judge of Mathura. The plaintiffs have also sought a declaration that the land measuring 13.37 acres be vested in deity Lord Sri Krishna Virajman.The suit also claims that UP Central Waqf Board, committee of management and trust of Shahi Masjid Idgah be directed to remove encroachment upon the land and hand over “vacant” possession to Sri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/purohit-mahasabha-condemns-suit-in-mathura-court-on-krishna-janambhoomi-issue/story-CpeTjJJ2K0FT7p1W3JyR4O.html

Also, it is linked to efficient reporting of cases and deaths in the long run, as some states that were lagging earlier in terms of reporting cases are now catching up,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, professor of epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.

29-09-2020||India||SC to hear plea against detention of Mehbooba Mufti 7 months after it was last heard||The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday a Habeas Corpus plea challenging the detention of former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti under the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA).The plea filed by Mufti’s daughter Iltija will be heard by a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy more than 7 months after it was last heard on February 26 when the top court had issued notice to the central government and union territory of Jammu & Kashmir. The court had, on February 26, ordered the case to be posted for further hearing on March 18 but it was never listed after Covid-19 pandemic broke out and the apex court started functioning through video conference.Iltija submitted that the detention of Mufti is based on vague and slanderous ground demonstrating personal and political bias against her. It was contended that the detention order of February 5 against Mufti was founded upon a dossier prepared by the Superintendent of Police, Srinagar which itself was replete personal remarks against Mufti and in bad taste. “The detention order is wholly based on the dossier which is slanderous, libelous and clearly demonstrative of the political and personal bias against the detenu (Mehbooba Mufti)”, the Habeas Corpus petition stated.The term Habeas Corpus literally translates to “produce the body” and it is a plea seeking directions to be issued to the government to produce a detained person before the court and to release such person if the detention is found to be illegal. Mufti has been under detention since August 5, 2019 when the Central government nullified Article 370 and placed the Kashmir valley in a state of lockdown. Her detention in 2019 was under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers an executive magistrate to order a person to execute bonds “for keeping the peace”.She had been in custody for six months and her detention was set to expire in February 2020 when a new detention order was issued on February 5 under the PSA which allows the administration to detain a personwithout trial for a maximum period of two years.The continued detention it was alleged by Iltija was because of the refusal by Mufti to sign a general bond affirming that in case of release, she will not make any comment, deliver any speech or attend any public assembly related to the recent events in Jammu & Kashmir. Iltija stated that the dossier, which was the basis for Mufti’s detention, was abound with vulgar descriptions about Mufti like “Daddy’s girl” and “Kota Rani”, the latter a medieval queen who rose to power through scheming and poisoning of opponents.The dossier, it was claimed, also contained unwarranted remarks about the marital status of Mufti and described her as “hard headed” and possessing a “scheming mind”.It was Iltija’s case that the detention of Mufti was based only on the grounds contained in the dossier and those grounds have no tendency to disturb public order.The detention order referred to opinions expressed by Mufti in the past as the basis for detention though there is not even the minutest suggestion that Mufti involved in any violent activity ever, the plea stated.Further, the detention order mentioned 12 statements made by Mufti though it did not mention any adverse impact of such statements on law and order.“Moreover the utterances were not even considered worthy of registering an FIR”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-against-detention-of-mehbooba-mufti-7-months-after-it-was-last-heard/story-qhO0CW06hMJcVYIYOCQueL.html
29-09-2020||India||After CWC, key Congress poll panel set for rejig||Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to revamp a panel that finalises party candidates for assembly and Lok Sabha elections, days after carrying out a major organisational reshuffle that saw the exit of many veteran general secretaries, people familiar with the development said. The central election committee (CEC), an important panel that selects party candidates for an election after being shortlisted at various levels, is currently headed by Sonia Gandhi. Its members are former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, senior leaders AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal, Mohsina Kidwai, Girija Vyas, Janaradan Dwivedi, M Veerappa Moily and Oscar Fernandes. Also Read: Bihar polls: Congress on road to revival or destined to suffer?A Congress leader aware of the proposed changes said the revamp will see the exit of some members and the induction of former Union minister Jitendra Singh, former party general secretary Mohan Prakash and ex-deputy chief minister of Karnataka G Parameshwara in the panel. Singh and Prakash are both considered close to Rahul Gandhi. He further said Fernandes and Vyas have been unwell for some time and their exit appeared certain. The leader added that the chances of the CEC being reconstituted before the Bihar elections are bright, given that the panel will select the party candidates for the assembly polls. Sonia Gandhi had, on September 11, reconstituted the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and her team of office bearers, and formed a special panel to help her in day-to-day functioning. Also Read: Congress states look to bypass new farm lawsShe also set up a new central election authority (CEA) that will conduct the organisational polls to elect a new party president and the CWC, the party’s highest decision-making body. The changes came days after 23 leaders, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Prithviraj Chavan and Jitin Prasada, wrote to her seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation and internal elections from top to bottom. The Congress president had accommodated some of the dissenters to send a message that there won’t be any reprisal or consequences for writing the letter that she had described as “hurtful”. The changes were also in line with a resolution passed in the August 24 CWC meeting that had requested Sonia Gandhi to continue as the interim Congress president till a new full-time chief is elected and also authorised her to carry out the necessary organisational changes to deal with the challenges faced by the party. Among the general secretaries dropped were Ghulam Nabi Azad (Haryana), also one of the key dissenters, Motillal Vora (Administration), Ambika Soni (Jammu and Kashmir), Mallikarjun Kharge (Maharashtra) and Luizinho Falerio (Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya). In-charges Asha Kumari (Punjab and Chandigarh), Gaurav Gogoi (West Bengal, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Sikkim and Manipur), Ram Chandra Khuntia (Telangana) and Anugrah Narayan Singh (Uttarakhand) were also axed. The new general secretaries included Tariq Anwar (Kerala and Lakshadweep), Randeep Singh Surjewala (Karnataka) and Jitendra Singh (Assam). The new in-charges are Pawan Kumar Bansal (Administration), Rajeev Shukla (Himachal Pradesh), Dinesh Gundu Rao (Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa), Manickam Tagore (Telangana), HK Patil (Maharashtra), Devendra Yadav (Uttarakhand), Vivek Bansal (Haryana), Manish Chatrath (Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya), Bhakta Charan Das (Mizoram and Manipur), Kuljit Singh Nagra (Sikkim, Nagaland and Tripura) and Jitin Prasada (West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands). Sonia Gandhi had asked for a special committee to help her in organisational and operational matters till the next session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), to be held within six months. The committee comprises AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala. The five-member CEA will be headed by Madhusudan Mistry and the members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely, another letter writer. After restructuring the party at the national level, Sonia Gandhi will now shift her focus to states, especially those going to polls in next two years. While several state unit chiefs have overstayed their tenure, many are on the radar for their non-performance. Sonia Gandhi had earlier named Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the party chief in West Bengal, which will be going to polls in April-May next year. Along with West Bengal, assembly elections will be held in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. In 2022, state elections are due in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Apart from various committees, departments and cells at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) level, the mega team of 56 secretaries will also see a major restructuring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-cwc-key-congress-poll-panel-set-for-rejig/story-A8qovolsuElX2EqmIPRBcJ.html

Under a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU) signed between the two, the QCI has been mandated to develop and operate a certification scheme, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). DGCA has already come out with the minimum standards for manufacturing RPAS under a civil aviation requirement.In June, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had issued draft rules for making and using drones in the country, which stated that an authorised manufacturer or importer can sell its devices only to an individual or entity approved by DGCA. Also Read: Eye on China, India goes for Heron tech upgrade, missile-firing Guardian dronesThe draft had said DGCA will have the powers to inspect an Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) manufacturing or maintenance facility before granting authorisation under these rules. DGCA mentioned that only Nano class drones, which weigh less than 250 grams, will be allowed to operate in India, adding that only a “qualified remote pilot” will be permitted to operate heavier drones.The document on the certification of the scheme was made public by DGCA on September 24. It read, “All manufacturers, whose various RPAS models have been provisionally accepted by DGCA are also advised to approach Quality Council of India for certification of their respective provisionally accepted RPAS models. No new application for provisional acceptance of RPAS model will be accepted by DGCA henceforth.”Set up in 1997, QCI is a joint body of the government and Indian industry, represented by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aviation-regulator-ropes-in-qci-for-drone-certification/story-ij1stIROZE6yda8MwWClZO.html

The Kolkata Metro, which is the city’s lifeline, restarted it operations from September 14, more than five months after its services were suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Special trains were operated on September 13 for NEET candidates and guardians only. The services were, however, available only from Monday to Saturday. “Metro Railway is going to resume its services on Sunday from October 4. On Sundays the services would be available from 10:10 am to 7:30 pm,” a Kolkata Metro spokesperson said. As the puja season nears and the shopping spree has started metro services would be available only on the north-south section and not on the east-west corridor. The north-south corridor connects or passes close by some of the major shopping destinations of the city. While the festive season has already started from September 17 with the Viswakarma Puja and Mahalayala, the Durga Puja is scheduled from October 22. Major shopping centres in the city remain open on Sundays starting from one month before the Puja. The north south section is considered to be the city’s lifeline. After resuming its services, the north south corridor is carrying around 50,000 passengers every day. On Monday while the north-south metro carried 55,228 passengers, the east-west corridor carried only around 163 passengers. With passenger count increasing, the Kolkata Metro had already increased the number of trains from September 28 taking the total number of trains from 110 to 116 that runs every day in the north-south corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-metro-to-resume-operations-on-sundays-ahead-of-durga-puja/story-c41ufNtpSaB0nBlwzws3BJ.html

29-09-2020||India||Parts of east and west coast in India likely to record above normal rains in 3 months||The north-east monsoon, which is approaching the southern states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and parts of Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana, is likely to be below normal this year.However, there is likely to be above normal rainfall all along the eastern coast, including West Bengal, Odisha, and even parts of the western coast, including the entire Konkan region over the next three months, according to a statement by several meteorological organisations.South Asian Climate Outlook Forum in its statement released on Monday said below-normal rainfall is likely between the October and December monsoon season over the southern parts of the south Asia, including some parts of extreme south-eastern India, most parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, which receive good amount of rainfall during their period.Below-normal rainfall is also likely during the next three months over the north-western and northern parts of South Asia, including some areas along the Himalayan foothills, the statement said. Also Read: High wind speed improves Delhi’s air quality marginallyThe consensus statement of various meteorological organisations, including World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), UK Met Office, India Meteorological Department (IMD), has cautioned that above normal rainfall is likely over the land areas around northern and central Bay of Bengal and most parts of north peninsular India.Cool El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions, which were prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean in the beginning of the year, have turned into weak La Niña conditions by the end of August. Latest forecasts indicate that weak La Niña conditions are likely to continue during the October to December season. La Nina is associated with normal to above-normal monsoon rainfall but below-normal precipitation during south India between October and December.“Impact of La Nina during the post monsoon season is just the opposite of what it is during monsoon season. La Nina during the monsoon season is associated with above average rainfall. But during the post monsoon season if a cyclone develops over the Bay of Bengal, the impact can be very different and severe due to La Nina. So, we have to wait and watch,” DS Pai, a senior scientist at IMD in Pune, had said in August when WMO had announced that there is a 60% chance of a weak La Niña event developing between September and November.Also Read: Monsoon to begin withdrawal todayThe south-west monsoon is expected to withdraw from Rajasthan and Punjab and some parts of Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) during the next two-three days. Dry weather will continue over most parts of northwest India. “All conditions of monsoon withdrawal from western parts of northwest India are now met. There has been no rainfall in Amritsar and Jaisalmer. Rainfall is reducing in other parts of Rajasthan as well. Anticyclone wind pattern is properly established and wind direction has changed to north-westerly. Temperatures in north-west India are likely to begin reducing from next week. There is a significant reduction in moisture as well,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.The monsoon season will officially end on Wednesday (September 30) with an excess of around 9% of rainfall. Rainfall was 30%, 16% and 7% excess over southern peninsula, central India, eastern and north-eastern India, respectively, until September 27.There was a 15% deficiency of rainfall over north-western parts of the country during the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parts-of-east-and-west-coast-in-india-likely-to-record-above-normal-rains-in-3-months/story-s4HPe1Inak14ppB9h95NUI.html

29-09-2020||India||As protests by farmers grow, BJD to form panel to study new farm laws||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said Monday that the Biju Janata Dal would form a committee of MLAs, MPs and leading farmer leaders to study the provisions of the new farm laws. Addressing party MLAs, Patnaik said apart from studying the provisions of the Bill, his party will be fighting for implementation of MS Swaminathan committee recommendation on Minimum Support Price of foodgrains.“The party will form a Committee of MLAs, MPs and leading farmer’s leaders to study the provisions. I would like to assure the farmers that their welfare will be paramount in any of our interventions,” Patnaik said in his speech via video conference.The Bills have now been notified after the President gave his assent.The National Commission on Farmers, chaired by Prof. M. S. Swaminathan between December 2004 and October 2006 had suggested the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) to fix MSP at least 50 per cent more than the weighted average cost of production.Though it has supported many Bills including the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill last year, Biju Janata Dal surprised many when it opposed the two farm bills -- the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Felicitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 -- in the Upper House of Parliament.The party demanded that the Bills be sent to Select committee as the concerns of the small and marginal farmers on MSP have not been addressed properly. BJD MP Amar Patnaik said at a time when the small and marginal farmers are not getting MSP, the twin Bills seems to be a move towards dilution of the MSP.Incidentally, the Naveen Patnaik government is bringing in two Bills in the monsoon session of theh assembly that are replica of the two Farm Bills brought in by the Centre barring minor differences.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims at registration of farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity by way of land, soil management, seeds, saplings, fingerlings, inputs, feed and fodder, technology and other such services. The Bill would cover sale and purchase of 50 varieties of plant produce and 5 of animal produce.BJD leaders said the party’s latest move on the Farm Bills came as nationwide protests seem to be growing against the new legislations. “The farmers are our biggest support base and the 2019 election proved that majority of them stood by us. It would electrorally detrimental to support the Bill that has nothing concrete on MSP,” said a BJD leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-protests-by-farmers-grow-bjd-to-form-panel-to-study-new-farm-laws/story-845sl4isj7dDBkGQNrhQDN.html

Covishield, the vaccine being developed by Oxford University, is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials. The trials began on Monday at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The vaccine will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). India’s indigenous vaccine developers Bharat Biotech International is at the second-phase human trial stage and Zydus Cadila is in the process to receive approvals for conducting third-phase clinical trials.• The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has selected 43 volunteers so far for the clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine produced by the Oxford University. Of these, 12 have already received the first dosage of the drug.• Monoclonal antibodies that stop the coronavirus from spreading in the body are among promising strategies for averting severe illness from Covid-19 before vaccines arrive, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.• China is injecting thousands of its people with Covid-19 vaccine shots, which are still under trial and hence their efficacy unproven, reports said. Those who are getting these vaccine shots are also made to sign a “nondisclosure agreement”, according to which they can’t talk about it to the news media.• In anticipation of a possible vaccine for Covid-19, Gurugram health department will be conducting a thorough assessment of the available ‘cold chain’ infrastructure in the coming weeks, officials confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/latest-covid-19-vaccine-development-covishield-undergoes-phase-3-trial-bmc-selects-43-volunteers/story-BwrHE8vFiqVLcH7X1xZ9GI.html

29-09-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear plea on Mehbooba Mufti’s detention||The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday a plea seeking the release of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who has been under detention since August 5 last year, when the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state, reported news agency ANI. The habeas corpus petition, filed by Mufti’s daughter Iltija, earlier this month challenges her mother’s detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA). The former CM is currently lodged in her Gupkar home, which has been turned into a sub-jail, where she was shifted on April 27.Iltija submitted that the detention of Mufti is based on vague and slanderous ground demonstrating personal and political bias against her. It was contended that the detention order of February 5 against Mufti was founded upon a dossier prepared by the Superintendent of Police, Srinagar which itself was replete personal remarks against Mufti and in bad taste. “The detention order is wholly based on the dossier which is slanderous, libelous and clearly demonstrative of the political and personal bias against the detenu (Mehbooba Mufti)”, the Habeas Corpus petition stated.The term Habeas Corpus literally translates to “produce the body” and it is a plea seeking directions to be issued to the government to produce a detained person before the court and to release such person if the detention is found to be illegal. Mufti has been under detention since August 5, 2019 when the Central government nullified Article 370 and placed the Kashmir valley in a state of lockdown.She had been in custody for six months and her detention was set to expire in February 2020 when a new detention order was issued on February 5 under the PSA which allows the administration to detain a person without trial for a maximum period of two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-mehbooba-mufti-s-detention/story-8ymIfWp6MoYUN8v4NnpjiK.html
29-09-2020||India||China takes 1959 line on perception of LAC||China has said it abides by the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in a letter dated November 7, 1959 — the first time in decades that it has clearly spelled out its stand on the notional Sino-India boundary by reiterating a position that New Delhi has consistently rejected since it was first made 61 years ago.Beijing’s position, in an exclusive statement to HT amid the ongoing border friction in eastern Ladakh, is a reiteration of the long-existing differences on the boundary question and a sign that the ongoing military standoff is unlikely to be resolved soon.Also read: Eye on China, India goes for Heron tech upgrade, missile-firing Guardian dronesIn the statement in Mandarin, the Chinese foreign ministry, while blaming the Indian Army for the ongoing tension since May and for the June 15 clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan valley, said the clash was an “unfortunate” event.“Firstly, China-India border LAC is very clear, that is the LAC on November 7, 1959. China announced it in the 1950s, and the international community including India are also clear about it,” the ministry said on Friday.  “However, ever since this year, the Indian Army has continued to arrive and illegally cross the border, unilaterally expanding the scope of actual control. This is the source of tension on the border issues. The key to disengagement between the two armies is India’s withdrawal of all illegal cross-border personnel and equipment,” it added.It’s the first time in recent years that Beijing has said in unequivocal terms that it still goes by the 1959 LAC. It did, however, make a passing reference during the 2017 Doklam crisis, when the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying spoke of the “1959 LAC” while blaming Indian troops for a scuffle with Chinese soldiers near Pangong lake in Ladakh in August that year.Also read| Brahmos, Akash and Nirbhay: India rolls out its missiles to counter Chinese threatIndia has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas. The Indian ministry of external affairs did not respond to requests for a comment on the fresh Chinese statement. The November 7, 1959 date mentioned in the Beijing statement was in reference to a letter written by Zhou to Nehru – the two leaders under whom the two countries experienced the best and the worst of bilateral diplomatic ties. “In order to maintain effectively the status quo of the border between the two countries, to ensure the tranquillity of the border regions and to create a favourable atmosphere for a friendly settlement of the boundary question, the Chinese government proposes that the armed forces of China and India each withdraw 20km at once from the so-called McMahon Line in the east, and from the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west,” Zhou wrote. Also read: How Chinese propaganda is using the 1962 war to shape public opinionA year later, during his high-profile visit to New Delhi in 1960, Zhou had used the phrase “LAC” during a press conference. “There exists between the two counties a line of actual control up to which each side exercises administrative jurisdiction,” he said as part of a six-point proposal to maintain peace at the border. Zhou went on to say that both sides should keep to the “…line of actual control and should not put forward territorial claims as pre-conditions, but individual adjustments may be made”.In 1962, when India and China fought a war between October and November, Nehru rejected the definition. “There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call ‘line of actual control,” he said. The Chinese Premier responded to Nehru, defining the LAC – again as per November 7, 1959.The LAC was “basically still the line of actual control as existed between the Chinese and Indian sides on 7 November 1959: To put it concretely, in the eastern sector it coincides in the main with the so- called McMahon Line, and in the western and middle sectors it coincides in the main with the traditional customary line which has consistently been pointed out by China”, Zhou said in reply to Nehru.The phrase LAC was used in the 1993 Sino-India “Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the India-China Border Areas.” At New Delhi’s insistence the expression wasn’t qualified in terms of whether it was the 1959 one.Former Indian ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale said the “…significance (of the statement) is that they are telling India that the LAC is the line of November 7, 1959, as explained by Zhou Enlai to Nehru in his letter. That’s it. They are going by that.” Bambawale added: “We have never accepted it. There were several pockets of disagreements and the largest number of pockets (of disagreements) were in Ladakh. Obviously, we did not accept the offer.” He added that New Delhi has conveyed this to Beijing in “no uncertain terms”.A leading China-hand, Bambawale had also served as ambassador in Bhutan, the only other country, other than India, with which Beijing has a land-territorial dispute. Bambawale said following the Chinese understanding of the LAC, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is attempting to hold on to the ground positions right up to it as per the 1959 LAC.It is clear that the current aggression at the border shown by the Chinese since May is to attempt to control territories up to where Beijing defines its LAC.Officials in diplomatic circles, who asked not to be named, told HT that India had pointed out its disagreements with the 1959 LAC even during meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China Border Affairs established in 2012 as a mechanism to consult and coordinate the management of India-China border areas.Little is known about the differences in perceptions on the LAC in the western sector, the most troublesome. Maps have only been exchanged for the middle sector until now.One of the officials above told HT that the LAC clarification process for the western sector broke down “an hour into the meeting” in 2002. Since then, the entire process – which was then an Expert Group headed by a director general in MEA and deputy director general in the Chinese foreign ministry -- has been stalled. “The western section was drawn by Indian surveyor (WH) Johnson, who privately assigned more than 30,000 square kilometres of land in the Aksai Chin region of China to British India. This is the historical origin of the territorial dispute between China and India in the western section,” Wang Dehua, a South Asia expert at Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said.“China hopes India will give more concessions in the western sector while Beijing could give more concessions (to India) in the eastern sector,” Wang added.The Chinese foreign ministry statement blamed New Delhi for the tension, saying: “…the right and wrong of the Galwan Valley conflict is very clear. We didn’t want to see what had happened. We hope the media doesn’t hype this unfortunate event”. The ministry did not respond to the question on the number casualties that PLA suffered during the brutal hand-to-hand clash with Indian army soldiers on June 15.The ministry’s statement referred to the recent foreign ministers’ and military talks held between India and China.“Since the bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of China and India in Moscow on September 10, the two sides have actively engaged in dialogue and consultation based on the five-point declaration,” it said.Referring to commander-level talks, it said “constructive measures to stabilise the border situation were taken. We hope the two sides walk in the same direction and push the frontline troops to disengage as soon as possible”. Asked to comment on reports arguing Beijing is escalating tension with neighbours to divert attention from a badly hit economy, the ministry said though hit by the pandemic, the economy is reviving.“Due to Covid-19, China’s economy has been affected but it has regained growth and has contributed to the recovery of the global economy, the statement added.On relations with neighbours, the ministry said: “The relationship between China and its neighbouring countries is generally good. China has always insisted on resolving differences between neighbouring countries through friendly consultations.”Sameer Patil, a fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the statement indicated that China was clearly adopting a maximalist position that disregarded all the developments that have taken place since 1959, including the bilateral boundary talks, mechanisms and agreements on peace and tranquillity on the LAC. “When the Special Representatives mechanism was set up, this wasn’t their position. Even though this matter [China’s stance on the LAC of 1959] may have been known, it was not reiterated when important bilateral mechanisms and arrangements for handling the border dispute were set up,” he said. “This reflects China’s obdurate attitude towards the border dispute. Reiterating this maximalist position amid the five-month-long standoff shows China has no intention of going in for an early solution to the problem,” Patil added.(With inputs from Rezaul H Laskar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-takes-1959-line-on-perception-of-lac/story-ciMDJjOeTLuvyvsNy7gJXI.html

No one was injured in the incident.Police said the incident took place around 7.30am when a group of 20-25 men arrived at Rajpath in different vehicles and a truck, on which the tractor was laden.Also read: Punjab set to move SC on farm laws as stir intensifiesWitnesses and passersby told the police that the men pushed the tractor out of the truck and set it on fire as it turned over.“According to people who were present there, the men chanted slogans like Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and Bhagat Singh Amar Rahein in support of the farmers’ agitation and were also carrying effigies, which they hung onto the street light poles. They then went live on social media and clicked group pictures with the burning tractor,” said a police officer.Soon after, a police patrol vehicle arrived at the scene. “Seeing the police, the men who had set the tractor on fire fled. Backup was called and other police vehicles in the area were alerted. Later, the fire was doused and five of the men arrested. The charred remains of the tractor was removed from the road,” said the police officer.A video of the group setting the tractor on fire was widely circulated on social media. Some policemen who had reached the spot were also seen standing near the tractor that was on fire.Police said all arrested men are from Punjab. They were identified as Manjot Singh, 36, Sahib, 28, and Sumit Pal, 28, from Mohali, Raman Deep Singh Sindhu, 28, from Mansa and Rahul Kumar, 28, from Ludhiana. “We had pooled in money to get the tractor. This was a symbolic protest to send a loud and clear message to the government at the Centre that they should talk to farmers,” said Brinder Singh Dhillon, president of the Punjab Youth Congress. “They (Centre) have not just trampled upon the federal structure, but these three legislations will also destroy the farmers of my state,” he added Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said his men had reached the spot in time and the fire was contained before the tractor was completely gutted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-protesters-set-tractor-on-fire-near-india-gate-five-arrested/story-aNokwhcVPBdCpCegZCfaEI.html
29-09-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Probing all angles, says CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday said that it has not ruled out any angles in its probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, and all aspects are still being investigated. “The Central Bureau of Investigation is conducting professional investigation related to death of Shri Sushant Singh Rajput in which all aspects are being looked at and no aspect has been ruled out as of date,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said, days after Rajput’s family expressed displeasure over the pace of the probe. Last week, Rajput’s lawyer said that the central agency’s investigation was drifting in a different direction, with more focus on drug-related offences rather than the actor’s death, suspected to be a suicide onset of the police probe. “All attention is being diverted towards the drugs case. Today, we are helpless as we don’t know which direction the case is going in. Till today, CBI has not done a press briefing on what they have found out,” Vikas Singh, Rajput’s lawyer said. The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. Rajput’s father, KK Singh, lodged a complaint with Patna police against Rhea Chakraborty, her parents and her brother, Showik, on June 25. The case was later transferred to CBI. The case is also being investigated by two other central agencies -- Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). While ED is looking into allegations of money laundering, NCB is probing a drug link in the case. NCB arrested Rhea Chakraborty on September 8 for allegedly procuring drugs for Rajput. Earlier this month, CBI issued another statement saying that the reports regarding the probe, attributed to its officers, were speculative.“Certain media reports attributed to CBI investigation are speculative and not based on facts. It is reiterated that as a matter of policy, CBI does not share details of ongoing investigation,” the agency had said on September 3. “CBI spokesperson or any team member has not shared any details of investigation with media. The details being reported and attributed to CBI are not credible,” it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-probing-all-angles-says-cbi/story-oy9fUPeUuOUIAH08I7PucI.html
29-09-2020||India||Want to take up projects where I get to play diverse characters: Supriya Karnik||Actor Supriya Karnik believes that hard work matters most but its luck that makes all the difference. “As far as the industry is concerned you need 99% luck and 1% of hard work, but then that much of hard work is no less than streak of good luck. And both have to connect and so on — it’s like ‘sabhi grahon ka milna’ (matching of stars),” she said during her recent visit to Lucknow. Known for films like ‘Taal’, ‘Mujhse Shaadi Karogi’ and ‘Welcome,’ Supriya wishes to do more versatile roles in coming years. “My negative characters were well accepted by the audience also when I shifted to comedy that too went down well with my fans. This made me believe that I can fit in different roles and now I just want take up projects where I get to play diverse characters to prove my versatility as an actor,” she said. Supriya will be next seen playing Indira Gandhi in the film ‘Main Mulayam’. “I don’t follow politics but I have been mesmerised by two female politicians — Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher. When director Suvendu Raj Ghosh asked me to play Indiraji I was like…really…are you sure? I doubt that I had any resemblance with her but he was confident. So, I read about her and watched videos to study her mannerisms.” The actor candidly accepts that currently there is much shortage of work. “The fact is that there is hardly any work. In fact, there is no work at all! My two Marathi films are stuck. In 25 years, I have done 170 projects including TV, films and South Indian film. And, as actor, I’m open for TV, films, theatre and OTT as well.” The digital boom she says won’t hurt cinema. “First it was radio, then TV, video players, CD, DVD and now OTT. Currently, OTT is the new buzz and but cinema will surely make a comeback and that to in a bigger and better avatar,” she said. Supriya was on her first visit to Lucknow. “My scenes were shot in Mumbai. Though the film is set in Uttar Pradesh, unfortunately I couldn’t come here earlier and now when I’m it’s coronakaal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/want-to-take-up-projects-where-i-get-to-play-diverse-characters-supriya-karnik/story-Ea1TGKAkrnR2C5wnpzGC8O.html

The film includes five different horror stories and each story will have well-known face. We are in pre-production stage and plan to go on floor in October. This is a web-film and we are in talks with various OTT platforms,” he says. Mohd. Chand ventured into film production last year. “Basically I’m into a real-estate and food-related business. But like many Indians I love Hindi films since childhood. It was due to my food business I was associated with shootings happening in Uttar Pradesh. Then I met film maker and actor Man Singh while he was shooting ‘Acid’ in Lucknow. I joined the project as one of the producers. The film was based on an acid survivor and released in January.” With the same team he was about to start a joint-production ‘Vebbie’ when the lockdown happened. “We finally shot the film in the unlock phase in Manali and Mohali-Chandigarh. The entire team was first quarantined for 14 days then we shot for nearly a month and currently the film is in post-production. Being a suspense thriller, the film explores the dark side of the web world.” It stars Man Singh, Pradeep Nagar, Eiden Rose, Sahil Brown and Qadir Khan. Talking about his solo project, Mohd Chand said, “The film will be shot in Mumbai but I also plan to shoot a project in Lucknow soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-also-plan-to-shoot-a-project-in-lucknow-soon-mohd-chand/story-skD5m4OgIoLNdSq2WpidjJ.html
29-09-2020||India||Sterling Biotech promoters ‘fugitive economic offenders’||A Delhi court on Monday declared the Sandesara brothers, Nitin and Chetan Sandesara, the latter’s wife Dipti and close associate Hitesh Kumar Patel fugitive economic offenders, allowing government agencies to confiscate their properties in India and abroad to recover the money they are alleged to have swindled. The Sandesara brothers, promoters of the Gujarat-based pharmaceutical company Sterling Biotech Ltd, who fled India sometime in 2017, are accused of swindling several banks to the tune of Rs14,500 crore by taking loans and laundering the money in other countries. The fraud is considered to be one of the biggest banking scams in recent times; it involves an amount larger than that owed by former liquor baron Vijay Mallya and diamond trader Nirav Modi. Before the Sandesaras and Patel, only Mallya and Modi, both of whom are in the UK, had been declared fugitive economic offenders.People familiar with the location of the Sandesaras said that they were last seen in Nigeria, but intelligence agencies have suggested that they could be in the United States, the United Kingdom or the United Arab Emirates. Additional sessions judge at the Patiala House Courts Dharmender Rana, while declaring Sandesaras and HItesh Patel fugitives under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act 2018, said: “I have no hesitation in observing that this court is satisfied that the ED {Enforcement Directorate} has successfully pleaded and proved that the respondents herein are fugitive economic offenders”. “The conduct of the respondents (Sandesaras), unambiguously, establishes on record that they have left India to avoid criminal prosecution and they are deliberately avoiding to return back to India to face the instant prosecution,” the judge said in the order. Appearing for the ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju and special public prosecutor Nitesh Rana argued that the Sandesaras had fled India and were evading criminal prosecution. They said they had chosen deliberately not to return to India to face trial and were shifting their base from one country to another to escape the law. Rana informed the court that “provisional arrest requests were sent to the UAE but the same has also failed to yield any results. Based on intelligence inputs, Sandesaras are presumably in Nigeria, the UK, USA or UAE”. The brothers are being probed by multiple agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Income Tax Department. In June 2019, the ED attached moveable and immovable properties worth Rs9,778 crores belonging to the Sandesaras, including four oil rigs and oil fields in Nigeria, and several ships apart from a Gulfstream aircraft and flat in London. Reacting to the order, the Sandesaras’s lawyer Hemant Shah said: “We are perusing the order. We will avail the remedies available in the law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sterling-biotech-promoters-fugitive-economic-offenders/story-ijXXsr6IXTdxQU6bo9m4XI.html
29-09-2020||India||Online learning leaves poor, young women in India behind | Opinion||Kiran, a 17-year-old girl, who lives in a slum in Delhi, has heard of Google but knows little else. “Yes, Yes… I think I have heard of Google once. But I have never used it. I don’t know more about it. I don’t know how to use it,” she said. Through the pandemic, schools and colleges have been holding online classes. This has formalised the digital divide, which also exacerbates the knowledge divide in India. The dearth of electronic devices among low-income families in India is an important and a binding constraint, a fact that has been pointed out in several reports. Providing electronic devices can help, in part, breach the classed barriers to online education. But what it cannot do, and what has received almost no attention, is overcome the gendered barriers to electronic education.Young women’s use of electronic devices in India is prevented not just by financial constraints but also by barriers of social norms and technological illiteracy. A recent Harvard study on women’s barriers to mobile phone usage in India found that India’s gender gaps in technology access is exceptional and much larger than countries with similar levels of development. Mobile phones are important as most people in India, especially those in low-income groups, access the internet through these devices. During fieldwork for a PhD at Cambridge, I interviewed young women who live in slums and low-income neighbourhoods in Delhi. I found that their access to electronic devices such as mobile phones was curtailed even when their brothers and the households owned such devices. According to a Harvard study, 71% of men in India own mobile phones. Only 38% of women, however, have access to the device.First, young women are not allowed to use mobiles because of the fear that they may interact with boys. Like Kirti who isn’t allowed to use the phone at home. “I’m not allowed [to use the phone]. You know, there are some girls who speak on the phone with boys, so that’s not okay with my parents,” she said.A study on Bengaluru slums assessed the acceptability of mobile text messages for promoting mental health amongst women in India. They found that male family members of nearly half the participants “called back to check who was sending messages, even though the consent of the parents had been sought earlier.” Other ethnographic studies in India have shown how people associate women’s use of mobile phones with a rise in divorce rate; elopement; and making women “sluts”.Second, the interviews revealed that not having computer classes at school and not having experience with computers or mobile phones at home, young women faced a severe technological literacy barrier to accessing the internet. Fatima did not own a phone but had used her friend’s phone to watch YouTube videos during a training they took together. Yet, she seemed unfamiliar with other aspects of internet use. I asked her if she had created a Facebook account, using her friend’s phone as she did to watch YouTube videos. She said she couldn’t as she did not have a phone of her own. She believed that only one Facebook account could be created on one phone. Shamta had even undergone training in computers. But in spite of the training, she did not know how to use the internet. “No, I wasn’t allowed to create any email or Facebook account. I don’t know how to use the internet. I’ve learnt computer hardware and software. I know how to work on Excel, Word etc but not the internet,” she explained.The Harvard study also showed that women are more likely to cite technical illiteracy and lack of confidence than men in using electronic devices. They found that “women lag behind men with relative gaps growing with task sophistication: while the relative gap is between 15–20% for making and receiving calls, the gender gap jumps to 51% for a feature as simple as SMS and remains above 60% for other more complex activities such as social media”.Education is a crucial pathway for empowerment of young women. Poor, young women have been left behind by the digital revolution, but with education moving online, they are now being further disempowered. If the gendered nature of access to online learning is not paid attention soon, poor girls will be doubly disadvantaged, both because of their class and their gender. India closed the gap in gender equality in education recently. If India is to not undermine over months what it so painstakingly achieved through targeted efforts over decades, it has to act now. (The author is at the University of Cambridge where her doctoral dissertation was on young women, from low-income families, in non-traditionally female jobs in India.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-learning-leaves-poor-young-women-in-india-behind-opinion/story-KBqPXnE0lFpk1fia7XkNtJ.html
29-09-2020||India||Can’t defer exams, says UPSC||With just days remaining for the October 4 Civil Services Preliminary Examination to be taken by nearly 600,000 candidates across India, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) told the Supreme Court on Monday that delaying the test further was “impossible”. The Commission, the top government recruitment body, was responding to a plea by 20 civil services aspirants who want a postponement of the examination because of the Covid-19 pandemic and floods in some states.“I have gone through the petition filed before the Court and I find that it is completely impossible to consider shifting the examination,” UPSC counsel Naresh Kaushik told a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar. “The examination was to be conducted on May 31, but could not be conducted due to the pandemic. Any further deferment will scuttle the appointment process.”The UPSC came out with a revised examination schedule on June 5, fixing the date for the preliminary examination on October 4. “Four months time was given to all states to prepare for the offline examination to be conducted across many cities. By now, all machinery has been put in place,” Kaushik said.The bench, also comprising justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, said, “You file an affidavit putting out all logistical arrangements that have been made. We will hear the matter on Wednesday.”The 20 petitioners before the Court belonged to different parts of the country and claim that participating in an examination in the prevailing circumstances poses a risk to their safety and health. Their petition stated that unlike engineering or medical entrance examination where non-conduct of examination will disturb the entire academic year’s curriculum, the Civil Services Preliminary Examination was simply a recruitment test. The petitioners claimed that in some states, active Covid-19 cases were large and in some states, cases were few. Holding an exam in such a scenario would be discriminatory against students facing curbs. Along with the petitioners, an application was moved by the father of a serving assistant commandant with one of the central paramilitary forces who is performing duty at a Covid-19 quarantine centre while at the same time preparing for the exam. The application urged the court to defer the exam as the petitioner’s son was faced with “a peculiar position of difficulty” owing to his special and increased workload because of the pandemic. “It is purely a recruitment examination and weighing the pros and cons of conducting the exam in the backdrop of the pandemic situation...appears that such a massive movement in these times is beyond all logic and respect for human lives,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-defer-exams-says-upsc/story-QyXVQ2wWCb5O3A7r2eVt5I.html

The ceremony was witnessed by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff General MM Naravane and other senior army officials through virtual platforms while chief minister of Uttarakhand Trivendra Singh Rawat, IMA Commandant Lt Gen JS Negi and other officials were present in person at IMA, stated a release issued by IMA. “The underpasses would be constructed by the PWD at an estimated cost of Rs 45 crore in two years. Once built the two underpasses would integrate the north, central and south campuses of the academy and the Gentleman Cadets (GC)s and the IMA staff will then not have to cross the NH-72 passing near the establishment to access various facilities of IMA,” the release read. The project for the two underpasses was first conceived in 1978 to facilitate easy movement of the GCs and the staff in the Academy. At present with the NH-72 passing through the academy, they have to cross it to go to other facilities across the road. Also, the flow of traffic is interrupted during their crossing. The underpasses will allow the uninterrupted flow of traffic on NH-72.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-lays-foundation-for-2-underpasses-at-indian-military-academy-in-dehradun/story-vvpi5pMfAgR7ht894VXk9H.html
29-09-2020||India||19 held in Assam police job scam; cash award for absconding retd IPS officer, BJP leader||The police in Assam have arrested 19 people in connection with a scam in recruitment of sub-inspectors in the police department and are planning to announce a cash reward for information on a retired IPS officer and a ruling BJP leader-both accused of involvement and who are on the run. “We have decided to announce a cash award for anyone providing information on the duo. We can assure that no one responsible will be spared,” DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta told journalists on Monday. The examination to recruit 587 SIs was cancelled in 154 exam centres across the state on September 20 after the question paper got leaked and was found circulating on Whatsapp. Nearly 64,000 applicants were scheduled to appear for the examination. Investigation during the past week has revealed that several people including IPS officer PK Dutta and Dibon Deka, a BJP leader, were involved in the scam to leak the paper as well as conduct a mock test for some of the applicants at a hotel in Guwahati a day ahead of the examination. “We have issued a lookout warrant for PK Dutta to ensure that he doesn’t leave the country. Assessment of the former IPS officer’s property is also being done. He has 4 hotels in Guwahati, 1600 bighas of land in Cachar district, an apartment complex in Dibrugarh and two flats in Mumbai among other properties,” said GP Singh, ADGP (law and order). “Based on this we will lodge a case with the anti-corruption department to know how he acquired these properties. We have also intimated the income tax department, enforcement directorate and department of revenue intelligence about this and asked them to probe,” he added. Singh, who is overseeing the entire investigation, informed that efforts are underway to nab both Dutta and Dibon Deka and assured that they would be arrested within the next few days. “We will be able to unearth the entire conspiracy only after both are arrested. Till now we know that Deka had arranged for the question paper for the mock test conducted at a Guwahati hotel. We need to establish the link between Deka and Dutta,” he said. As per investigation, police have been able to establish that the leaked question paper which was circulating on Whatsapp and based on which the exam was cancelled had originated from PK Dutta’s mobile phone Following cancellation of the examination, the criminal investigation department (CID) had lodged a case under sections of 409 and 120B of IPC for criminal breach of trust by public servant and criminal conspiracy and 66B of IT Act and started investigations. “We lodged a case on September 20 based on a complaint by Pradeep Kumar, chairman of state level police recruitment board (who has now voluntarily resigned),” said Surender Kumar, IGP, criminal investigation department (CID). The CID conducted raids in Guwahati-based residences hotels and of a retired IPS officer Duttta, who is stated to have played a key role in the scam and is absconding for over a week now. “We have recovered incriminating evidence related to the crime from those places including receipts of money taken from candidates, blank admission forms, Rs 5.5 lakh, a pistol and over 1 kg gold ornaments etc.,” said Kumar. Simultaneously, crime branch of Guwahati police registered another case on September 20 based on information that some people were trying to take money from candidates for the post in lieu of giving them jobs. Based on investigation till now, 9 persons have been arrested till date. Six more persons have also been arrested in Nalbari district in connection with the case. Several separate investigations are underway in some other districts as well. Meanwhile, Congress MLA and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia has demanded an inquiry by a sitting judge of Gauhati High Court to probe all aspects of the scam and find out if there was any conspiracy to allow accused Dutta and Deka to abscond. “Deka has not been convicted yet. If he is guilty, the law will take it own course and the party will also take action against him. The paper leak of the exam is not a scam but an anomaly,” BJP chief spokesperson for Assam Rupam Goswami told journalists on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-held-in-assam-police-job-scam-cash-award-for-absconding-retd-ips-officer-bjp-leader/story-jl5jXI1dOUP22C0ojlFaUN.html
29-09-2020||India||Not being risk-averse in face of Covid-19 crisis: FM Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she is not being “risk averse” in her response to coping with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 68-day lockdown imposed to slow its spread, which saw India’s economy come to a near-complete halt for part of the first quarter of 2020-21.She added that she has no option but to increase government spending. “After all, among the four engines that support the economy, three have come to a complete standstill. It is public expenditure which has to do the heavy lifting.” The government’s borrowing calendar that has already been announced indicates as much, Sitharaman said. The government has already raised its gross market borrowing target for the year to Rs12 lakh crore from the Rs7.8 lakh crore announced in the Union Budget in February. Debt market analysts expect a further increase in this to Rs13 lakh crore.Also read: Open to one more stimulus if necessary, says Nirmala SitharamanThe government’s relief package announced in May has been criticised for not having an adequate direct fiscal stimulus component and not doing enough to spur demand, but in an interview to HT, the finance minister said that she believes it does enough for both supply and demand. Still, she admitted, she has been receiving feedback from industry on the need for one more stimulus. “One more may be needed is what we are hearing from the people who interact with us, and we are trying to see what it is that we can do.” Sitharaman said, like she has several times in the past, that she is open to providing more support but declined to get into details of when this might be forthcoming. “There’s no point in me hurriedly getting something out.”She also refused to get into a guessing game on this year’s GDP. Sitharaman said that while the decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2020-21, at 23.9%, has been substantial, she does not want to conclude anything about the entire year’s number just yet. She added that she expects the second and third quarter of the financial year to be better. Most analysts expect the country’s GDP to shrink by at least 5% and as much as 10% in 2020-21. But things are getting better, the minister insisted, referring to conversations she has been having, with some industry representatives who are telling her that their sectors have reached pre-pandemic levels of production. Numbers bear out some of that. The latest value of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index was 82.3 on September 20, where 100 is the pre-pandemic level of business. The index has been steadily inching upward. “The revival is also happening in many labour intensive areas. This is also corroborated by the fact that migrant workers from many states have started going back (to their places of work),” Sitharaman said.HT reported on Monday that demand for jobs under the schemes has dipped, and surmised that this could be because some migrant workers have returned to their places of work in the cities. The minister singled out the agricultural sector (which grew 3.4% in the first quarter) as a symbol of resilience and talked up the farm reform laws passed by the government last week, even as she criticised the Opposition, and especially the Congress party, for opposing them. Responding to a question on the future of the economy, she said she is “ hopeful — that the coronavirus will recede, and the Indian entrepreneur, small big, medium, will succeed” but added that Ladakh, where the Indian and Chinese armies are in a face-off following transgressions by the latter “ is one imponderable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-being-risk-averse-in-face-of-covid-crisis-fm/story-WjeDXKW1Oz4sS6zgqRrfJJ.html
29-09-2020||India||After 400 priests of Jagannath temple test Covid-19+, Odisha says no to opening religious places||With more than 400 servitors and officials of the Jagannath temple in Puri testing positive for Covid-19, the Odisha government has told the High Court that it is not yet ready to open religious places in the state which have been shut for devotees since March.Replying to a notice issued by the Orissa High Court over a PIL, the state government said as the sanctum sanctorum of the Jagannath Temple in Puri does not have enough space, there are chances of spread of infection if the temple is allowed to open for devotees. The state government in its affidavit said 351 temple servitors and 53 officials of the Jagannath temple administration have tested positive for Covid-19. Several servitors including Premananda Dasmohapatra, member of the temple management committee recently succumbed to the disease.As more and more servitors are testing positive for Covid-19, it has led to a shortage of servitors to perform various rituals of the Lord. “A number of Suar, Mahasuar, Daitapatis and Pujapandas have been infected. Though the rituals of the temple are being done regularly, the situation may worsen if the temple is allowed to open for the public,” said a servitor. So far, a total of 9,704 people in Puri district have tested positive for Covid-19.Officials said a dedicated ambulance equipped with a ventilator will be provided for the servitors while two teams will ensure that servitors who have been infected follow the home isolation guidelines effectively. The Puri district administration will strictly enforce the Covid-19 guidelines by making masks compulsory for anyone seen within the vicinity of the temple.Temple officials said the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to cast its shadow on the Nagarjuna Besha of Lord Jagannath scheduled to be held in November this year.

The MQ-9B, manufactured by General Atomics, has a 40-hour endurance with a maximum altitude of 40,000 feet and payload or weapon carrying capacity of over 2.5 tonne, including air-to-surface missiles and laser-guided bombs. “We are in negotiations with the Trump administration, which is willing to provide India with the latest armed drone technology. In this, it is the prohibitive cost of the system that is a hurdle, not the Trump administration,” said a South Block official who requested anonymity.Also read| Brahmos, Akash and Nirbhay: India rolls out its missiles to counter Chinese threatBesides, India has asked Israel to upgrade its existing Heron medium-altitude, long-endurance surveillance drone by upgrading its communication links. Presently, due to lack of a satellite link in the Heron, two such unmanned aerial drones have to be flown in tandem with a time gap so that information is relayed back to base through the second drone in case of long-range surveillance. The upgrade involves fitting the Heron drone with a satellite package so that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) links with the satellite above and information is sent on a real-time basis. The upgrade will allow the Heron to conduct long-range surveillance without the fear of losing contact with the base or go into no contact zone. The Heron upgrade program was approved by the defence ministry last month.Also read: Indian Army ready for winter endurance test at 5,800 metres on Finger 4 of Pangong Tso against PLAThe drone revolution in the Indian military has come after it was felt that India had no answer to Chinese armed drone and surveillance drone capabilities, with the PLA deploying the unmanned devices in significant capacities in the Ladakh theatre apart from sensors and surveillance cameras that provide advance warning on moves by the adversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drone-tech-upgrades-to-boost-lac-defence/story-witXKwQMZca1zkhkkYQGAO.html

The director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, has also been a part of these consultations. Private hospitals have been given clear instructions to not use these investigational therapies routinely,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “All states have also been instructed to keep a check to avoid routine use of these therapies, and give only to those Covid-19 patients for whom it is intended. AllMS, Delhi, through its webinars that are meant to handhold peripheral hospitals in providing critical care have also been emphasizing on it,” he said.Currently, no effective treatment is available for Covid-19, but there are certain drugs and therapies that have been approved by country’s drug regulator under investigational therapy or emergency use authorization based on the limited evidence available from research taking place globally and in India.Because of the limited data availability, investigational therapies are meant to be used only in a defined subgroup of patients.Also read: India gets a national Covid-19 registry for real-time hospital dataUnder health ministry’s clinical management protocol for Covid-19, off-label use of plasma therapy has been included to be used in patients with moderate disease who are not improving (oxygen requirement is progressively increasing) despite use of steroids.Antiviral drug remdesivir has been approved for use under emergency use authorization in patients with moderate disease (those on oxygen). “Scientists and researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against COVID-19 which may be beneficial to severely sick COVID-19 infected patients, and was included as an experimental therapy in the clinical management protocol for Covid-19. Same goes for the drug remdesivir, as it had also shown promise in stopping virus replication,” said an official in the health ministry, in the know of things.“It is to be given only in patients that fall into the given category, and not open for all Covid-19 patients. There are contraindications mentioned in the protocol that must strictly considered before putting any patient on these drugs or therapies,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avoid-routine-use-of-plasma-therapy-govt-to-hospitals/story-KfvViXrxWiaPBQ1YqWtJBO.html
29-09-2020||India||Open to one more stimulus if necessary: Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expects the economy to take a turn for the better in the second and third quarters of the financial year after contracting by a record 23.9% in April-June following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease pandemic and subsequent lockdown. In an interview to R Sukumar, she said the government may offer a second stimulus package, adding: “...we are trying to see what it is that we can do.” Asked how she would describe the economy now, Sitharaman said: “My sense is people are doing their best against all odds to stand up and be ready to run.” She added a caveat in the context of the ongoing India-China military standoff in the Ladakh sector: “Of course, Ladakh is one imponderable; we will have to keep everything in that context ready.”First-quarter GDP declined 23.9%. Half the year will be over soon. Have you done any assessment on what’s likely to happen to the annual GDP?We are doing an assessment but I don’t think we have arrived at any number. Logically, Q1 and its number was influenced by the total lockdown. Post-Q1, gradually the unlocking has happened. Possibly, even by July, you had levels of capacity utilisation rising in certain industries, and today, roughly, many industries tell me they have reached pre-Covid levels. If in the second quarter, at least 50% levels have been reached, then it can’t be as bad as Q1. The revival is also happening in many labour-intensive areas. This is also corroborated by the fact that migrant workers from many states have started going back (to their places of work); on their own volition, and some industries, I am told, have also arranged to pick them up. Labour is returning.Also read: Not being risk-averse in face of Covid crisis, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman Some industries are telling me that domestic demand is increasing, no doubt, but that they are also seeing export orders increasing faster than their expectations. I’ve heard this from the steel industry, for instance. I guess, the second quarter, the third quarter, will be better.But will it still be a recessionary year?I don’t know if I should conclude that about the whole year even now. There is no denying the first quarter’s decline is substantialWhat about revenue receipts? Do you see them picking up?Yes, and the signs of it picking up are already being seen in GST (Goods and Services Tax) collections, in some other state-level revenue, but the assessment about the direct taxation is a bit mixed because it has to be taken on board that last September we announced a drastic reduction in corporate tax. The impact of that will be seen in corporate tax collections — one of the main components of our direct tax revenue. Income tax will suffer on account of the Covid lockdownThe corporate tax cut last year and many of the measures announced as part of the government’s relief package have longer gestation periods — they are not going to kick in immediately. What are your immediate plans to boost sentiment, growth, and employment?The ‘vocal for local’ campaign is, together with Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) campaign is one of the biggest ways to improve sentiment. When you direct the government’s focus towards promoting local products, ensuring policy support exists for them, ensuring incentivisation will happen for them, and create the necessary ecosystem for them.... Even if you think the result will be long-term, there will be an immediate change in sentiment, production priorities, investment priorities. There have been repeated demands for a second stimulus. You have always said you were keeping your options open. Is there any thinking as to when this might happen? When will industry need it the most?We are hearing everyone out, we are analysing every area of the economy. I am open to one more support if necessary. We are constantly exchanging a lot of thoughts with industry...They must be asking you for one immediately...One more may be needed is what we are hearing from the people who interact with us, and we are trying to see what it is that we can do. There’s no point in me hurriedly getting something out. What we have announced till now, it is not as if it has benefited one at the cost of another.One area where people have consistently asked for some kind of intervention is on the demand side. One way is to simply put more money in the hands of people through some mechanism. Have you been thinking of a demand-side intervention?My argument has always been that whatever we have done till now hasn’t segregated supply from demand. I’ve also argued that this distinction is purely for the textbooks and isn’t all that watertight. Any spend on one does have the effect of overflowing to the other. Whatever we have done so far, however people may see it as only supply side, I can see it flowing to also stimulate demand.To elaborate, in the UK, businesses were given cash to retain workers, or in the US, many Americans got a cash payment... The expectation here is that at some point of time there will be a direct cash, fiscal stimulus for businesses and individuals to boost demand.I can’t really say I’m tailor-making something now whilst I have also not closed the option of giving where necessary. The inputs are continuously coming from various sectors and also segments of society. Let’s see how it works out.One of the things India has also tried to do is to wean away businesses from China. The logic being that if we have the right kind of tax structure, the right kind of policies, the right kind of labour laws, companies would be happy to do business here...That’s actually working out. Between November and March, we met a lot of companies likely to move. We also worked out the Productivity Linked Incentive Schemes (PLIs), which has been a good success, particularly in the telecom sector — the first PLI was launched for IT and electronics. Other departments are seeing the ministry of electronics and IT being successful in getting companies to come and start businesses here. Departments are building their case up for this.Do you have a bias towards hi-tech, or strategically important sectors for PLIs?It is going to be a blend of that which will create greater employment; that which will bring in technology; that which will be good for futuristic things, renewable energy, chip manufacturing; but also things we want to focus on like API {active pharmaceutical ingredient} manufacturing (for pharmaceuticals). We have set up in six different states, specialized zones in which everything is going to be provided in terms of common infrastructure and any unit that wants to come in to manufacture APIs will be given a lot of incentives.Where do things stand with the states on GST?We will wait for the GST Council to meet. The options given were explained; detailed notes were sent; the finance and expenditure secretary sat together...How many states have reverted?Twenty; all want option 1 (of borrowing Rs.97,000 crore without the obligation of paying interest and principal) . We will go to the Council on October 5 and take it from there.Have you looked at how much fiscal headroom the states have to spend? From the point of view of coping with the pandemic, the revival...We do keep monitoring their borrowing limits. Even as we speak, not even one state has exceeded the 3% of GSDP limit available to them in a normal year. Of course, we have another six months to go for the end of the year. Over and above, we have allowed them to borrow another half a percent more unconditionally; another 1% with conditions; and another half percent contingent on certain reforms. So they can take it up to 5%. Even during the last GST Council meeting, we suggested that the last half percent could be given unconditionally if the situation warrants. So up to 4% is unconditional. Of course, this is yet to be finalized.If states haven’t exhausted the basic limit, why is there a refrain of a financial crunch from the states?They are facing challenges; there is no denying that. They are the ones fighting Covid at the ground level. And they expect the Centre to be more supportive, which is understandableAre you looking at some relaxation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act?I am not sure I have a choice (of not doing so). The borrowing calendar which we have issued is far more than what I announced in the Budget. That should send out the message that I am not really being risk-averse because I do not want to exceed my fiscal deficit. However, there is an FRBM law and I am conscious of it, but if I don’t support, don’t spend... After all, among the four engines that support the economy, three have come to a complete standstill. It is public expenditure which has to do the heavy lifting.You are not worried about the fiscal deficit...Well, if I have already issued a borrowing calendar that is far in excess of my Budget announcements...Are you looking at radical or unconventional solutions such as helicopter money, or monetising the deficit like Indonesia has?Specifically, we are not, but I am also looking at various ways in which I have to be ready to meet the challenges.You have been defence minister. Especially in the context of what’s happening in Ladakh, on the budgetary or spending side, do you see any constraints?Not at all. I have been there , albeit not for a long tenure. I do understand the needs of the defence ministry. Now that I am here and you have a PM who is conscious of India’s defence requirements, we will not let it suffer. When there is a need, we will definitely meet it.Which sectors give you the most hope?What great encouragement it is to see the agricultural and rural economy have so much life. Covid, floods, landslides, nothing could put them down. Given that even today more than 50% of the population depends on either agriculture or allied activities, that is the big spark plug for Indian revival. I think that’s where the life of the revival is. That’s where I give complete credit to the Prime Minister for pushing through the farm reforms. In the post-Covid era, with liberated farm producers you will have a bigger multiplier effect — it will immediately have a bearing on rural labour; it will immediately have a bearing on agri-processing units; it will immediately have a bearing on inflation.One demand that farmer groups and the opposition have raised in the past few days is some kind of legal standing, a guarantee for the minimum support price; writing it into the law, for instance.Government procurement will still happen. Where it has happened through an APMC (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee), it will still happen through them.MSP has been given in this country for decades. The list of items has increased to about 23. However, during the Congress rule, the emphasis has always been on rice and wheat — resulting in distortion in acreage under crop, at the cost of coarse grain, pulses, and oil seeds. Pulses, at least till 2014, we grew far less than we need — ending up importing it. After crude oil and gold, edible oil is a significant import.Between 2014 and 2016, the PM gave attention to ensuring India became self-sufficient in pulses. We were able to give MSP and bonus for pulse growers.The Congress was myopic with MSPs; we have given priority to other crops too. If MSP has been used smartly by us... MSP and its versatile use has been far more established under the government. The quantum procured through government procurement has been higher since 2014.So who are you (the Congress) asking to hard wire MSPs into the law? Did your manifesto say that?Why do you think there is so much opposition to the laws?I suspect that the Congress saw that in the Rajya Sabha we had the numbers and the laws would be passed, to the credit of the government. So even as they asked for division, they knew we had the numbers. Nothing else can justify the disruption.On a personal note, there’s been six months of Covid; it’s been a highly stressful time; there’s been a lot of economic pain. How has it been for you? Have you felt overwhelmed? Are you under pressure?Every day, there is a challenge, and Covid is not over yet. The economy’s revival is topmost in the mind of the PM. We’ve all gone through this together — not just me, all Indians are going through this.If you were to objectively look at the economy now, how would you describe it?My sense is people are doing their best against all odds to stand up and be ready to run. Very clearly, there’s a sense that “we will come out of it.” Everyone is very descriptive about the kind of struggle they are going through and I can understand that, yet they are full of hope. I’m hopeful too — that the coronavirus will recede, and the Indian entrepreneur, small, big, medium, will succeed. Of course, Ladakh is one imponderable; we will have to keep everything in that context ready.How much time do you think we have lost as an economy on account of the crisis?That’s a question I can answer if the Covid crisis has passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/open-to-one-more-stimulus-if-necessary-nirmala-sitharaman/story-WRPPfp3NwwkdkgTxraYR3H.html

I have informed Advani, Joshi and my other clients about the judgment day. Whether they will appear before the court or not will be clear on that day itself,” said lawyer KK Mishra. Mishra is representing 25 of 32 accused in the case, including Advani, Joshi and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh. During the hearing of the case, the court had permitted Advani, Joshi and several others to record their statements through video conference.Two other accused -- Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust chairman Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Shiv Sena leader Satish Pradhan -- have also expressed their inability to appear before the court on Wednesday. Former union minister Uma Bharti, another accused, announced on Monday that she was admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh after she tested positive for Covid-19. “If I get a positive nod from the AIIMS after tests, then I would like to appear in the CBI court of Lucknow the day after tomorrow,” she tweeted on Monday.Former chief minister Singh is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-demolition-case-accused-may-seek-exemption-from-appearance-in-court/story-UAHz7mMZqvKy84YtVx12UI.html
29-09-2020||India||Oppn creating row over issues not in the laws: Gajendra Shekhawat||The Congress and a clutch of other opposition parties are misleading the people about the three farm laws just as they created misgivings about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, by obfuscating the facts, Union minister of water resources Gajendra Shekhawat said in response to the criticism of the new legislation. The minister also questioned why the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chose to remain silent about the provisions of the laws when the ordinances were brought six months ago. The government says the legislation is designed to boost the interests of the farming community by widening their market access; the opposition alleges that they will instead leave farmers at the mercy of corporate entities. Edited excerpts: Why this reluctance to include minimum support price (MSP) in the laws. If this is good legislation, then why not allow the opposition to scrutinise it more?  To create a controversy about issues that are not part of the bill has become the modus operandi of the Congress and a few other opposition parties. Their criticism is without basis. They are trying to create a deterrent in the progress of the country. And there are many examples that I can give you about this, the latest being the criticism and the commotion that they created about the CAA. What was the basic idea of the CAA; it called for fast-tracking citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It did not talk about taking away the citizenship of anyone based on religion, or having to prove one’s citizenship based on hundred-year old documents. But the Congress created a controversy. Also read: Farmers, agri sector exempted from seeking permit for groundwater useSimilarly, in the case of the farm bills, they are creating a conspiracy about issues that or not even part of the bill, for example MSP. For 50 years in this country, the agricultural scenario remained unchanged; we moved from being a food-deficit country to a food -sufficient and now a surplus country, but the policy decisions that should have been in place to plan ahead were missing. India is among the top 10 agri-export nations, but no decisions were taken during the 10 years of the UPA {United Progressive Alliance} rule, which led to farmers’ distress. To address that, Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM set up the National Farmers Commission under the chairmanship of MS Swaminathan, which gave detailed reports based on extensive consultations conducted between 2004 and 2006. He talked about the problems as well as the way forward. But what did the Congress do between 2006 and 2014? There are many things that the Swaminathan commission spoke about including land and irrigation reforms, increasing farm incomes and creating alternative sources of income. Also read: Cong states look to bypass new farm lawsThe Modi government tried to holistically address all these issues. As for the issue of MSP, the government ensured that between 50- 100% of the crop production cost is given as MSP for as many as 22 notified crops. But what if we had only announced it, not make the procurement? So, there has been 42% growth in MSP that has added over a lakh a year to the income of the farmers and procurement has increased by 25 times over what was being procured during the UPA regime. Besides, MSP is an administrative order. Did you fail to convince your former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal. Even the Bharatiya KIsan Sangh (BKS) has apprehensions about MSPs not being part of the laws.  If the SAD was not convinced and had problems with the ordinances, which were brought six months ago they should have left the government then. They have been part of discussions and talks with agriculture minister during outreach to farmers’ representatives and groups where they have supported the contents of the ordinances. Now for the own political interest, they have done a U-turn. This is not following a coalition dharma. They are now opposing a decision of which they were part six months ago. To protect their political interests, the opposition is conspiring to give the farmers a bad name. As for the BKS; they are an independent organisation that works with the farmers. But they have also raised the issue of MSP over which the Congress and the other opposition parties are creating misgivings. The new water policy which is in the pipeline talks of allowing water-surplus states to trade their excess supply, how will it work?  We have formed a committee under {economist} Mihir Shah. After wide consultations, it has given a basic draft of the policy. We are discussing it, but we have requested them to clarify some more issues and once that comes, we will study it internally and then take it to the stakeholders. I think it (policy) should be ready in the first quarter of the next year. It is an important document that is going to be a guiding book for the next couple of years. What is the status of the Inter-State Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill? We already have tribunals in place. It has been observed that as per the act (Interstate Water Disputes Act) while under section 5(2), the tribunal have to give their judgment within three years, under section 5(3) any state or stakeholder can file an appeal. There is a time limit of one year for disposal of appeals, but it can be further extended with no time limit. A tribunal like the Ravi Beas Tribunal which was established as a special case and the act was amended since it was a part of the Rajiv {Gandhi} {Harchand Singh} Longowal accord {of 1985}. The act was amended to mandate the tribunal to conclude the hearing within a period of one year. And the basic requirement as per the act was that a negotiation committee will be formed that will resolve issues between states within six months. To bypass that clause, an amendment was made. That particular tribunal that was mandated to give a recommendation within a year has been working for 32 years. So we brought a bill to fix a time limit and establish a single permanent tribunal. It was unanimously passed in the Lok Sabha, but again Punjab has opposed it and the SAD has done a U-turn. They have now said that the issue of water sharing should be taken up from scratch and whatever has been done all these years needs to be revisited. Hopefully it will be discussed in the next session. Will the Jal Jeevan Mission that promises piped water to every household in India by 2024 meet its target? The Prime Minister had announced this flagship programme from the ramparts of the Red Fort. There are 18.5 crore rural households. When the Prime Minister made the announcement, only 3.53 crore had water; so far we have been able to take water to 2.60 crore households and from the date of the announcement till date, 6.60 crore households have drinking water. Even during the Corona pandemic, with the aid of the state governments, we have been able to provide between 1 to 1.25 lakh connections. Our aim is not only to provide piped water, but quality drinking water. We want to ensure that 55 litre per capita is offered and that there is an NABL {the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories} accredited lab in every district to test the quality of water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-creating-row-over-issues-not-in-the-laws-gajendra-shekhawat/story-2XsAJy1e3izH4bKMHBSdPO.html
29-09-2020||India||Farmers, agri sector exempted from seeking permit for groundwater use||The Centre has notified new guidelines for groundwater use in the country, prescribing a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on industrial and commercial users who extract it without permission, but exempting farmers and the agriculture sector, the largest users of groundwater, from the requirement of a no-objection certificate or penalties for drawing water up to a limit.An environmental compensation of Rs 1 lakh on industrial, mining and infrastructure users for extracting water illegally could be increased depending on the quantum of illegally extracted water, states the new notification issued by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) under the Jal Shakti ministry on September 24. Also read: Rules go up in smoke as farm fires rage in PunjabFor industries, the new guidelines state that a no-objection certificate shall be granted “only in such cases where local government water supply agencies are not able to supply the desired quantity of water”. All industries will be required to adopt “latest water efficient” technologies to “reduce dependence on groundwater resources”, guidelines in the fresh notification state. The revised guidelines, which will apply across India, however, state that rural drinking water schemes, armed forces, agriculture activities, and small enterprises will not require any prior permission for groundwater use. Agriculture consumes nearly 90% of all water resources in the country. According to the think-tank Niti Aayog report in 2017, groundwater accounts for 63% of all irrigation water and over 80% of the rural and urban household water supplies. Yet, the Centre’s new guidelines say that regulating water use in agriculture “will prove to be an arduous task” given that the sector is the backbone of the Indian economy. Also read| Paddy procurement begins early: Farmers, arhtiyas in Ambala allege absence of arrangements in mandisThe guidelines state that according to the country’s minor irrigation census 2013-14, 87.86% of groundwater wells are owned by marginal, small and semi-medium farmers having land holding up to four hectares. Around 9.18 % of wells are owned by medium farmers having land holding of 4-10 hectares and 2.96% of the wells are owned by big farmers having land holding more than 10 hectares. Although the new rules exempt farmers from the requirement of prior permission from the CGWA for groundwater extraction, it highlights free electricity for farmers as the main reason for over-extraction of groundwater. The guidelines advise states to “review their free/subsidised electricity policy to farmers”, “bring suitable water pricing policy and may work further towards crop rotation/diversification/other initiatives” to reduce over-dependence on groundwater. Also read: BJP plans farm outreach to counter Oppn’s driveIn December, the government launched the Atal Jal Yojana scheme to conserve groundwater in seven states facing the biggest declines in aquifer levels mainly due to over-extraction for water-intensive crops. These are Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. “Some states like Punjab have started to adopt policies to reduce agriculture’s dependence on groundwater but they are yet to be adopted by a large number of farmers,” said Ashok Desai of the Natural Resources Institute, Pune. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has come up with a new scheme of direct benefit transfer for electricity to agricultural consumers. Under the “Paani Bacho, Paise Kamao” (save water, earn money) scheme, farmers will get Rs 4 as direct benefit for each unit of electricity saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-agri-sector-exempted-from-seeking-permit-for-groundwater-use/story-bVBEAMgHFDMIXJlTkLhLEI.html
29-09-2020||India||Congress states look to bypass new farm laws||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday advised party-ruled states to explore the possibilities of passing legislation under Article 254(2) of the Constitution to negate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government’s “anti-agricultural laws” and prevent “grave injustice” from being done to farmers. The opposition party is citing the BJP government’s move in 2015, when it asked party-ruled states to bring their own laws to override the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 passed during the tenure of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to boost infrastructure development. Also read: BJP plans farm outreach to counter Oppn’s drive“Congress president has advised Congress ruled states to explore the possibilities to pass laws in their respective states under Article 254(2) of the Constitution which allows the state legislatures to pass a law to negate the anti-agriculture central laws encroaching upon state’s jurisdiction under the Constitution,” Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal said in a statement. “This would enable the states to bypass the unacceptable anti-farmers’ provisions in the three draconian Agricultural laws including the abolition of MSP and disruption of APMCs in Congress-ruled states,” he added. Also read| Farm bills: Protesters set tractor on fire near India Gate, five arrestedThe party is in power in three states, Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, and the Union territory of Puducherry. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushed three bills to deregulate agricultural trade, which were passed controversially by Parliament, overriding demands by the Opposition for greater scrutiny and voting. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the bills out of concern that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. The reforms have cost the BJP one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which has quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 seek to liberalise farm trade, enable modern supply chains, allow agribusinesses and farmers to enter into contracts, break interlocked markets and create a seamless commodities trade, currently fragmented.  The main provisions of the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 allow barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of primary agricultural commodities, bypassing notified markets under the Agricultural Produce Market Committees. The bill will enable food traders to buy farmers’ produce from any market, rather than bind them to the specific markets where they are licensed to operate. Earlier in the day, former Union minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted: “As FM Arun Jaitley got states to resort to Article 254(2) of the Constitution to override provisions of 2013 Land Acquisition law, a law he’d fully supported as LoP {leader of the opposition} in RS {Rajya Sabha}. States should now follow the same advice to undo the damage caused by the #FarmBills that have become Acts.” Many BJP-ruled states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Jharkhand had in 2015 expressed their desire to have their own laws to override the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 to enable them to move fast on infrastructure development. None of these states subsequently went ahead to draft their own laws. The Article 254(2) states: “Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State: Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.” Before coming out with the advisory, the Congress held internal consultations with leaders including Abhishek Manu Singhvi, a lawyer, to explore possible legal recourses for farm bills. Singhvi told the party to ask state governments to pass their own farm bills to negate the clauses of the Centre’s legislation. While there’s is little chance that the bills would be approved by the President, Congress strategists feel such a move by states administered by the party would send a good political signal. Singhvi also pointed to Jaitley’s legal arguments on the proposed amendments to the UPA-era land bills and said the Congress should highlight what he had said at that time to turn the tables on the NDA. Senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde said in the concurrent list. the state legislation operates to the extent that it is not in conflict with the central legislation. “The possibility exists where there is both a state and a central legislation. But when it comes to the question of prevailing, the central legislation prevails. At times, the very presence of a central legislation can negate the state’s ability to legislate. In the concurrent list, both Centre and state have competence to legislate but in the event of any ambiguity or overlap, the Centre prevails,” he added. BJP’s national spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said the APMC act and the local mandis are already within the domain of the state laws under the Constitution, and the Centre has no power to repeal them. “They will continue as it is. So, what law does Soniaji wants to pass is not clear. Secondly, MSP is declared by the Centre every year on different commodities on the recommendations of the CACP, (which has representatives from the farmer’s community) as an administrative order, Central government has already announced MSP for the current year, in parliament,” he said. He said the procurement has to be done by respective state governments through the local mandis, so the ball for procurement is already in the court of the states....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-states-look-to-bypass-new-farm-laws/story-KXBd1CrFgKqUKPAtkNvFtN.html
29-09-2020||India||BJP plans farm outreach to counter Oppn’s drive||To counter the opposition’s campaign against farm laws enacted by the central government, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is planning an outreach to farmers that will include door-to-door Atmanirbhar Kisan (Self-Reliance Farmers) campaigns in rural India, public rallies, press conferences and social media broadcasts.The initiative is aimed at what the BJP thinks is opposition propaganda based on “false and absurd” notions of the Narendra Modi government’s agricultural reforms, which it says will liberalise farm trade, enable farmers to earn more remunerative prices by selling their produce anywhere and benefit consumers by excluding middlemen.In a letter to party MPs and top leaders, a copy of which has been seen by HT, BJP’s national general secretary Arun Singh said the historic farm laws passed by Parliament had freed farmers from the clutches of middlemen. Singh said that these reforms, along with earlier measures like soil health cards, crop insurance and increases in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) would all help in doubling the income of farmers.Also read| Farm bills: Protesters set tractor on fire near India Gate, five arrested“The opposition parties are spreading false and absurd rumours about it in their ulterior political motive,” Singh said in the letter. Singh added that MSPs, government procurement and Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) will continue to exist while farmers gain wider market access.On the directions of party chief J P Nadda and in a bid to dispel the concerns of farmers, the BJP has planned the mass awareness programme on the new legislation, which will be implemented in line with health protocols imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, the letter said.  Among the activities planned are: door-to-door contact in the villages, public rallies in rural areas, seminars in every district, discussions with farming communities and agricultural bodies and also press conferences.The party is also likely to encourage people to write appreciation or felicitation letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar for introducing the legislations. In addition, the BJP has also decided to take on its adversaries on social media turf.Also read| Oppn creating row over issues not in the laws: Gajendra ShekhawatThe party has asked all its state leaders as well as its Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs to chalk out programmes in the next two weeks as part of the campaign.The three bills - the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - have become acts after President Ram Nath Kovind signed them into law.Farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the legislation, which the government says will enable them to sell their produce in any market of their choice rather than limit them to government-run mandis called APMCs. The protestors say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies.

Eminent political scientist Nilanjan Sircar said “On one level, it [outreach] is extraordinary, given the advantages BJP has, they feel the need to take this step, which means at some level, their internal matrix are showing that the protest and the opposition are causing some problems on the ground for their popularity. I think the BJP has shown that it has the ability to change the narrative quite quickly”. He, however, added that it is not easy to convince people on a subject about which they already know a lot and that too from direct experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-plans-farm-outreach-to-counter-oppn-s-drive/story-hKWSSn05PYm6UXCZ6fsa0I.html
29-09-2020||India||Punjab set to move Supreme Court on farm laws as stir intensifies||Punjab, where angry farmers are protesting against the three farm bills enacted by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will challenge the legislation in the Supreme Court, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said on Monday, accusing the federal government of trying to dismantle the farming system as it exists now.“Our lawyers are coming from Delhi tomorrow (on Tuesday). We will discuss how to proceed in the matter and then challenge the legislation in the Supreme Court,” Captain Amarinder Singh said in Khatkar Kalan, where he staged a sit-in protest against the laws. Khatkar Kalan is the village of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Monday marked the freedom fighter’s birth anniversary.Also read| Farm bills: Protesters set tractor on fire near India Gate, five arrestedThe three bills - the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - have become acts after President Ram Nath Kovind signed them into law.Farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the legislation, which the government says will enable them to sell their produce in any market of their choice rather than limit them to government-run mandis called agricultural produce marketing committees, or APMCs.

How do we run the state? BJP leaders think they will remain in power, but I want to remind them that the Akalis also thought so. People threw them out. It is a decision of the people to keep political parties in power or not,” he said. Targeting the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Congress leader said, “The Akalis are trying all tactics, but they’re not working because once you let people down, they don’t forget.” The Akali Dal has walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the centre to protest against the farm legislation.Defending farmers for holding protests against the newly enacted laws, the CM said they had the right to do so as “you are taking away their livelihood”.He accused the central government of snatching the rights of states and of trying to dismantle the minimum support price, mandi system and the public distribution system (PDS) with the farm laws.“Their motive is to demolish everything which farmers have got after a long struggle. From the green and white revolution till now, rights which farmers acquired, one by one all of them are being demolished with these farm laws,” Singh said.“MSP and mandi system will be dismantled with these farm laws and their next target is FCI {Food Corporation of India},” he said, claiming that the government also want to dismantle the public distribution system that channels subsidised foodgrains to the poor.The government has denied that either the federally fixed MSPs or the PDS will be done away with.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-set-to-move-sc-on-farm-laws-as-stir-intensifies/story-ZiQsgtKUE1581BgimpTrGK.html
29-09-2020||India||India’s fiscal federalism crisis is not the pandemic’s creation||The Centre has refused to immediately compensate the states for an expected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, which they are constitutionally entitled to, although it has committed to paying the money after the compensation cess is extended. The states have been asked to borrow (to make good either the shortfall in compensation arising from GST implementation or the overall shortfall ), but the controversy has given fiscal federalism a jolt. At the root of this crisis are three factors. The first is the structural deceleration in the Indian economy along with a fall in tax buoyancy. The pandemic’s economic shock has only made things worse. The second is a growing squeeze on states’ share in central taxes. These two factors have been compounded by an ongoing political struggle between the centralization which has been unleashed in India’s polity due to the continuously growing political capital of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the insecurity it has generated among the non-BJP state governments.Falling tax buoyancy has compounded the growth problem’s revenue impactData from Controller General of Accounts (CGA), which works under the ministry of finance, shows that tax buoyancy in India went into negative territory in 2019-20. This is a first since 1962-63. Tax buoyancy is the ratio of change in centre’s gross total revenue and change in GDP. So, a negative tax buoyancy in a period of positive GDP growth implies that taxes actually fell even though GDP was rising. Tax buoyancy has fallen sharply between 2017-18 and 2019-20. It was 0.16 in 2016-17, 0.12 in 2017-18, 0.09 in 2018-19 and -0.05 in 2019-20. The sharp fall in tax buoyancy, when read with the equally sharp fall in nominal growth -- the last few budgets have been grossly overestimating this -- has only compounded the slowdown’s revenue impact. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();This matters because over-optimistic projections of tax buoyancy and nominal growth lead to higher revenue projections, and therefore a higher revenue share for state governments. When these projections do not materialise, states face a retrospective hit in their receivables. An earlier story by this author discussed this issue in detail.The Centre has passed on a greater burden of the tax shortfall to statesIndia’s constitutional framework provides for a rules-based distribution of tax revenues between the centre and the states. The revenue sharing formula is updated every five years by the Finance Commission. The 14th Finance Commission set the share of states in central taxes at 42%. This promise has not been realised. States’ share reached a peak of 36.6% in 2018-19 and has fallen sharply since. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Why has this happened?The centre does not share cess and surcharges with states. Over time, the share of these heads has been rising in central taxes. Research by ICICI Securities PD shows that it was less than 10% in 2014-15, but has gradually increased to 15% in 2019-20. A more granular analysis shows that the centre’s tax policy works with this objective in mind.RBI’s report on state finances gives the share of states in different central taxes. In 2019-20 (Budget Estimates), states received the smallest sharer in union excise duties (14.5%) collected by the centre. Their receivable share was greater for other taxes. It was 34.5% for corporate tax, 40.3% for income tax and 34.7% for custom duties.Corporate tax collections took the biggest hit in 2019-20, thanks to the sharp reduction in tax rates announced in September last year. The government slashed corporate tax rates for domestic manufacturers from 30% to 22%, while for new manufacturing companies, the rate was reduced from 25% to 15% provided they did not claim any exemptions. This was expected to lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. The actual shortfall, according to Controller General of Accounts numbers, turned out to be Rs 2.09 lakh crore.This decision is in sharp contrast to the present tax policy, where the centre has announced a large hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel. An HT analysis had found that between April 1 and July 1, the share of central and state taxes in petrol and diesel prices in Delhi increased from 45% to 63% for diesel and 54% to 64% for petrol. Central taxes per litre were almost twice state taxes. Because the additional duty is not meant to be shared with the states, the centre will keep all the windfall revenue gains from fall in international crude prices. Tax collection data from CGA shows that union excise duties are the only tax component which shows an increase in cumulative collections up to July in the current fiscal year compared to a year ago. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();BJP’s politics has been provoking states rather than offering reconciliationAll along, one of the key constituents of the BJP’s political strategy has been to portray the Narendra Modi government as a sole harbinger of welfare benefits. This has helped the BJP in squeezing its opponents in national elections. The biggest proof of this success can be seen in the vote share premium the BJP enjoys in national elections in comparison to state elections. A recent paper by Yamini Aiyar and Neelanjan Sircar attributes this to three factors: the Modi government putting into place an administrative environment where state governments, and therefore regional parties, are not seen as critical for delivery of welfare benefits; a technology enabled welfare regime which claims to be more efficient and also leads to further centralization of welfare handouts; and the use of ground-level BJP cadre to popularize these schemes, and, by extension the Prime Minister’s popularity.The BJP’s political offensive on state governments led by other parties, when read with stylised facts on the state of fiscal federalism – states’ share in central taxes never reached the promised 42%, it has fallen sharply in the recent past, and they are now staring at the centre delaying guaranteed GST compensation payments – is bound to vitiate political trust rather than create an amicable environment for solving what is now a deep rooted crisis. This will only render the challenge of preserving India’s fiscal federalism framework, both in letter and spirit, more difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-fiscal-federalism-crisis-is-not-the-pandemic-s-creation/story-xGx0OgajpML1r80O4kvKdK.html
29-09-2020||India||Centre drops offset clause in govt-to-govt deal in new weapons buying policy||In a significant departure from India’s existing weapon-buying procedures, a new policy announced on Monday has done away with offsets in government-to-government deals and single-vendor contracts for purchasing military equipment on the grounds that this has not resulted in bringing cutting-edge technology into the country, a top official said.This overrides the offset policy that required foreign vendors to invest in the country to boost indigenous capabilities at least 30% (it could go up to 50%) of the value of all contracts worth more than ₹300 crore awarded to them.The scope of the offset policy will now be confined only to military contracts that involve competitive bidding, said director general (acquisition) Apurva Chandra during a presentation on the new Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020. The DAP-2020, cleared by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, will be effective from October 1.“No offset contract has led to transfer of technology into the country, with the scope being limited to product purchase as pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in a recent report. There will be no offsets in intergovernmental agreements, government-to-government deals and ab initio single-vendor cases,” Chandra said.This appeared to echo and address concerns raised in a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in Parliament last week that said several offset contracts built into multiple defence deals had failed to bring in high-end military technology into the country. The critical observations were part of CAG’s scrutiny of the status of a raft of offset contracts — including the September 2016 Rafale deal — between 2005 and 2018.Commenting on the ₹59,000-crore Rafale deal, the top auditor said that the plane’s maker Dassault Aviation and weapons-supplier MBDA had not confirmed the transfer of technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which was part of the offset contract. “DRDO wanted to obtain Technical Assistance for the indigenous development of engine (Kaveri) for the Light Combat Aircraft. Till date the Vendor has not confirmed the transfer of this technology,” said the report.CAG also sharply criticised foreign vendors who made several offset commitments to qualify for a contract, but were later not earnest about fulfilling their commitments. According to experts, doing away with offsets could result in savings as foreign military contractors tend to increase their prices by about 10% to cater for their offset commitments.The offset guidelines have been revised to give preference to the manufacture of complete defence products over components, the ministry said on Monday in a statement. Self-reliance push DAP-2020 has been aligned with the government’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and empowering the domestic industry through the Make in India initiative, with the ultimate aim of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub, the statement said. “The three key focus areas of DAP-2020 are Atmanirbhar Bharat, Make in India and ease of doing business. The procedure has five new chapters including leasing, acquisition from the DRDO and post-contract management,” Chandra said. It will allow the armed forces to lease military hardware for the first time — a move that could cut down on costs associated with buying weapons and systems. Leasing could be cheaper in the longer run, Chandra said.The policy underlines that field evaluation trials for weapons and systems are to be conducted with the objective of nurturing competition rather than rejecting players for minor deficiencies. It seeks to increase local manufacturing and reduce timelines for procurement of critical military equipment. It incorporates a price variation clause “for large and protracted contracts in order to avert inflated initial quotes by vendors and arriving at a realistic price of the project,” the defence ministry statement said. The policy has also introduced a new provision for acquiring weapons and systems: “Buy Global — Manufacture in India”. It stipulates that only a minimum necessary quantity of defence equipment will be bought from abroad with the rest being manufactured in India. “The new category incorporates manufacture of either the entire/part of the equipment or spares/assemblies/sub-assemblies and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for the equipment through its subsidiary in India,” the statement said.DAP-2020 should help self-reliance in the defence sector, most importantly by bringing in pragmatism into the process, said Lieutenant General Subrata Saha (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board and a former army deputy chief. “It has acknowledged realities based on experience and suitably adapted the policy. Introduction of leasing opens up new opportunity to get value with financial prudence. Increasing indigenous content in various categories and introduction of new categories for import substitution should enable greater participation by domestic industry,” Saha said.Formulating general staff qualitative requirements (GSQR) on the basis of what’s available addresses the oft-stated concern of industry of unrealistic specifications, he said. “This should bring in clear distinction between QRs for systems to be acquired and QRs for systems to be developed,” he said, adding that including post contract management in the policy was a good and long overdue step. Industry thumbs-up Industry welcomed the new policy. “DAP-2020 has created pragmatic avenues for foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to manufacture in India on their own and in collaboration with Indian industries. It completes the triad of policy, organisation and procedure towards creating a vibrant and capable domestic defence industry base and marching towards self-reliance,” said CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee.He added that for the defence sector, self-reliance was not just an economic necessity but also a strategic imperative. To leverage the strength of the Indian software industry, the DAP-2020 has introduced a new chapter that deals with acquisition of products and information and communication technology (ICT) systems to address existing voids. “Peculiar issues related to procurement of ICT-intensive equipment especially of interoperability and built-in upgradability, enhanced security requirements and change management have been included (in the DAP),” the defence ministry said. The DAP-2020 states that several categories of acquisition and the strategic partnership model will be “exclusively reserved” for Indian vendors who meet the criteria of ownership and control by resident Indian citizens with foreign direct investment not more than 49%. “This reservation will provide exclusivity in participation to domestic Indian industry,” the ministry said. According to defence ministry officials, the DAP-2020 has clearly laid down that only those firms that have over 50% Indian ownership will be eligible to take part in key Make in India purchases. As a measure to enhance indigenous content, the policy seeks to promote the use of indigenous military material and reward vendors for utilising indigenous raw material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-drops-offset-clause-in-govt-to-govt-deal-in-new-weapons-buying-policy/story-SVKKI3cbrauwzJ0nMc8GBK.html

29-09-2020||Editorials||The economy going forward||The first half of the fiscal year 2020-21 ends today. The year started under a nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25. While most lockdown restrictions have been withdrawn, especially in the second quarter, the economy is far from normal. India’s GDP suffered an annual contraction of 23.9% in the June quarter. Most private and institutional forecasts predict an annual contraction in the range of 5-10% this year. Neither the government, nor the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a projection for this year’s GDP. In an interview to this newspaper, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman refused to speculate on the annual performance of the economy while noting that the fall in the first quarter’s GDP was quite substantial.At a time when the economy continues to face a difficult challenge, the government has opened at least two avoidable political fronts which will disrupt a co-ordinated response on the economic front. The first is the GST compensation cess payment controversy with the states. The second is the political showdown on the three agriculture reform bills. It is unlikely that it will have to backtrack from its position on both these issues. There is also the question of policy interventions generating confidence and clarity. The government has banned onion exports even as it celebrates its agricultural reforms as giving unprecedented freedom to the farmers. RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting was abruptly postponed a day before it was supposed to begin; the government is yet to appoint external members to MPC.There is a consensus that a process of sequential recovery is underway in the economy and GDP growth rates will be higher than what they were in the first quarter. There are two reasons why this is not good enough. First, the challenge is to catapult GDP to pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. Most experts do not see this happening despite easing of lockdown restrictions. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index has been increasing continuously in August and September (except a slight fall in the week ending September 27). Yet, Nomura economists continue to project a contraction in every quarter of the current fiscal year. Second, with Covid-19 showing no signs of miraculously going away, both consumer and business sentiment will remain subdued. There is clearly a strong case to be made for a second stimulus, something the finance minister said she was open to in the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-economy-going-forward/story-NAgZhC2keUvpJFiVXkNY8K.html
29-09-2020||Editorials||On LAC, India must keep its guard up||China has resurrected its untenable 1959 Line of Actual Control (LAC) claim even as the two armies dig in for the winter. In invoking the 1959 LAC proposed by the then Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, Beijing is putting up a straw man. The original proposal was rejected by Jawaharlal Nehru and with reason: LAC then was just a number of scattered points which could be connected in many different ways. Invoking this gives China maximum flexibility in terms of its territorial claims. What it shows is that Beijing will negotiate with tenacity, pushing the envelope as far as it can. Delhi must recognise this does not rule out the use of further military actions. The Chinese claim came after two meetings, one between Indian and Chinese foreign ministers and another between the armies’ senior commanders. After each, the two sides issued joint statements committing themselves to disengagement. A sensible interpretation of the happenings would be to recognise them as a sign that Beijing and Delhi are moving into negotiation mode. Given that previous border standoffs have taken months, if not years, to come to a final agreement, the real sentiment these developments should arouse is one of patience.This is not to say there has not been progress. The foreign ministers’ meeting laid down five principles to go forward. The two militaries have agreed not to deploy any more forces. The two governments remain committed to disengagement. A new equilibrium is likely to emerge. LAC is likely to be different from what existed before the Galwan Valley and its latest avatar will have the threat of violence, deep distrust and harsh language as its backdrop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-lac-india-must-keep-its-guard-up/story-NIszmdnX3Wa2Wxa9Bt1LyJ.html
29-09-2020||Editorials||Crop burning: No end in sight||The harvest season has begun in northwest India, and so has stubble burning and the unending search for a permanent solution to a problem that leads to severe air pollution in the region, especially in Delhi and the National Capital Region, every winter. According to a report in this paper on Monday, stubble burning may continue this year because central subsidies on straw management machinery are not attractive enough for small farmers to switch to them. Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, saying that the Centre must look into the Indian Agricultural Research Institute’s (IARI) suggestion of converting stubble to manure using a chemical. Last year, an analysis of satellite data from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center suggested no decline in the number of crop stubble fires in 2018 compared to 2017, despite the new policy for in-situ management of crop residue. The challenge of disposing agricultural waste in India is significant. According to IARI, the net cropped area is 141.4 million hectares, and crop residues are estimated to be around 600 million tonnes every year, with generation being the highest in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Maharashtra, Punjab and Gujarat. Over the years, several policies have been proposed to address the issue, but they have been mainly in-situ technologies. The failure of these policies show that it is time to try out new multi-pronged approaches to tackle the problem: Incentivising farmers to shift away from water-guzzling paddy and diversifying cropping patterns is one. Uutilising crop residue in power plants, brick kilns and biomass gasifiers is another. A report by the Council on Energy Environment and Water suggests that increasing farmers’ accessibility to stubble managing equipment by setting up more custom hiring centres and promoting rental models may work. Last year, Punjab and Haryana provided incentives to farmers, at Rs 2,500 per acre, for managing the residue in alternative ways. But it was announced in the last week of November after much of the residue had already been cleared and was dropped this year after reports of the funds being misused at the panchayat level. For any multi-pronged approach to work, there needs to be coordination between four groups: Farmers, states, Centre and scientists. At present, there seems to a disconnect among all these groups and a lack of political will to find a solution. Mere lip-service from political leaders — the farm protests complicate the situation further this year; any policing move to control stubble burning will be seen as anti-farmer — is unlikely to take us forward..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/crop-burning-no-end-in-sight/story-AqV781FQpjwfGvW6gwANDK.html
29-09-2020||Editorials||Why herd immunity may not work||On Sunday, as India crossed six million Covid-19 cases, the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said the country is far from herd immunity. The minister cited the soon-to-be released findings of the second nationwide serological survey. The reality is that not enough Indians have built an immunological protection that could allow for going back to pre-pandemic behaviour. What is also established is that India cannot pursue a herd immunity-focussed strategy. Letting the virus run its course will overwhelm the health care system. Mumbai is believed to have faced this scenario. In Delhi, hospital beds dwindled rapidly before additional resources were mobilised.
