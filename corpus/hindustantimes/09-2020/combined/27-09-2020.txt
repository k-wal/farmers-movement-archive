Presidents and prime ministers convene in New York for the annual UN General Assembly (UNGA). This year, for the first time, they will not be coming to the Big Apple. Instead, they will be sending pre-recorded video messages. This Covid-19-driven remote UNGA denies these leaders the good feeling and theatrics of speaking from the UN’s pulpit; it further robs them of the opportunity of interacting with fellow leaders from other parts of the globe. For smaller countries, this is also an opportunity to greet the President and First Lady of the United States (US) at their traditional UN reception on the opening day of UNGA. Indeed, photographs with President of the United States and First Lady of the United States at this reception proudly adorn many a political leader’s living room across the world.Brazil has traditionally been the first speaker at UNGA, followed by the host, the US. Leaders from other countries follow and are requested to limit themselves to 15 minutes, though this is rarely observed. There is a time-signalling system of amber and red lights on the podium. UNGA sessions typically run till lunch and then from 3 pm to 6 pm. The 64th UNGA was held in 2009 with veteran Libyan diplomat Ali Abussalaam Treki elected as its president. India was one of the UNGA’s 21 vice-presidents that year. President Lula Da Silva of Brazil and President Barack Obama of the US were the first two leaders who spoke at the opening of the General Debate of the 64th UNGA on September 23. Libyan leader Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi spoke immediately after them. Dressed in traditional robes, he sported a big red pocket square and right at the beginning intentionally proceeded to cover the time signalling lights on the podium with it. His speech lasted a full 96 minutes! This took its toll on UNGA’s schedule for the day. And, the penny with this realisation dropped for me when I was approached later in the day by a UN official and requested to preside over UNGA from 6 pm onward. The official was candid. President Obama’s reception began at 6 pm and all leaders of delegations would be going for it. This made it impossible to find a presiding officer for UNGA at the leader level from among the countries serving as vice-presidents. And, the permanent representatives of these countries would be accompanying their leaders. The choice was, therefore, limited to deputy permanent representatives and they had zeroed on me as I had ambassadorial rank. It soon dawned on me that presiding over UNGA with leaders speaking was as high an honour that a diplomat could aspire to and I rushed home to change and return fresh for the task. I also persuaded my wife to come and sit in the gallery.Promptly at 6 pm, I was ushered in to take the presiding officer’s chair at UNGA. The President of Equatorial Guinea was already addressing the forum and my first task as acting president of the 64th UNGA was to thank him after he had finished. He was followed by the President of the Dominican Republic and then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Thereafter, we had the Presidents of Bolivia, Ukraine and Poland with the session being ended by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Time flew and it was already 9.15 pm when a chuffed Manjeev Puri stepped down from UNGA’s dais. Thank you Colonel Qadhafi.

The police said the victim was rushed to a private hospital in Manesar, where his condition is said to be stable. The accused person was arrested by the police late on Saturday. According to the police, the victim, who is identified by first name as Inderpal, is a resident of Naharpur Kasan. He had gone to a tempo stand in Sector 6, IMT Manesar, to purchase some essentials. The police said he ran into an acquaintance, Krishna, at the tempo stand and the two had a discussion over tea regarding some trivial matter. Nitika Gahlaut, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manesar, said, “The argument escalated into a fight and the accused man pulled out a countrymade pistol and shot at the victim. The victim suffered a gunshot wound in the upper chest area and was admitted to a private hospital, where his condition is presently stable. The accused man was arrested by the police.” The police said the countrymade gun has been confiscated from the possession of the accused man and they are checking his criminal record. A case was registered against the accused man under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code(IPC) and the Arms Act at IMT Manesar police station on Saturday. He was produced in a district court and sent to judicial custody, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-shot-at-by-an-acquaintance-in-manesar/story-2ft2ry2UTF55H7IU5KO42H.html
27-09-2020||City||Haryana: Study to assess sources of pollution in four cities to begin this winter||A study to comprehensively assess the sources of air and noise pollution in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Panipat is likely to commence this winter. The exercise, known as a source apportionment study, is expected to last at least 18 months from the date of commencement. The study is being commissioned by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board(HSPCB) under the aegis of the Centre’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).While an expression of interest (EOI) for the same was floated by the HSPCB in November last year, the outbreak of Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown resulted in the delayed evaluation of the proposals received. “We have so far received a proposal from a Delhi-based research institute for all four cities. A committee has been formed to comb through the finer details. The committee will convene on September 28 and make a decision,” said Jai Bhagwan Sharma, senior scientist, HSPCB, who is overseeing the study.While such studies have been earlier commissioned by the Delhi government, they have not yet been carried out in its satellite towns. “In Delhi, there are two official studies, which were conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). We are aiming to engage an institution of similar repute for our subject cities,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB)Officials added that the study is being undertaken pursuant to the ‘Comprehensive Action Plan for Clean Air for Cities of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Panipat in Haryana’, drafted earlier last year, and is a part of the NCAP. Gurugram and Faridabad were added to the list of initial 102 non-attainment cities covered under the NCAP in July 2019. A non-attainment city is one where the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are not followed. “Since implementation of same interventions in two cities, having different meteorology, topography and different typology of air polluting sources, is unlikely to give same results, the choice of interventions to control urban air pollution has to be city specific, drawn on the basis of scientific study (sic),” states the EOI by the HSPCB. The EOI further states, “The aim of the study is to promote and demonstrate a more rational & proactive approach to air quality management in urban areas (sic).” The study, officials explained, will be based largely on 90 days of ambient air quality monitoring conducted over the summer, monsoon and winter, to demonstrate and quantify the seasonal variations in air pollution. The daily sampling times will further be divided into three eight-hour sessions (06.00 hours to 14.00 hours, 14.00 hours to 22.00 hours, and 22.00 hours to 06.00 hours), which will capture the diurnal variation in sources and meteorology of air pollution. This study will also involve a systematic survey of vehicle population to be undertaken in the city, with an emphasis on vehicles older than 20 years. The aim is to find cost-effective solutions to curb their emissions as these represent a major portion of the city’s total vehicular population.“On completion of data collection, validation and interpretation of the assimilated information, a detailed road map will be drawn considering all possible measures for air quality improvement. These measures will be classified into short and long term with due priority to low cost measures that give maximum benefit,” the HSPCB’s EOI goes on to state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-study-to-assess-sources-of-pollution-in-four-cities-to-begin-this-winter/story-CNZ1HC8ooW6zRXvYe1jtXO.html
27-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Representatives of 38 villages meet deputy CM over takeover move||A delegation from 38 villages proposed to be included under the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) met Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Sunday and apprised him of their concerns over the move.They told him that they were satisfied with their panchayats and did not wish to be under the MCG. According to the delegation, Chautala told them to draft a resolution in this regard and submit it to him for necessary actionThe delegation comprised sarpanches, ex-sarpanches and prominent residents of these villages. Rishiraj Rana, newly appointed district president of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which Chautala co-founded, led the delegation to meet the deputy CM in Delhi. Rana said over 80 percent of land in these 38 villages was still under agriculture and the villages had a rural character. An urban local body to take this area under its control would not benefit them, he added.“The villagers are still living a rural life and they are opposed to a takeover by the MCG as this would affect their activities like dairy, agriculture and other activities,” he said.Among the 38 villages are 27 in Gurugram, seven in Sohna and the rest in Farruknagar block. These villages have around 300,000 to 400,000 people each, and the panchayats have enough funds, said Rana.The delegation also told the deputy CM that the condition of other villages taken over by the MCG was not very encouraging. “These villages had to give up their land and money to the civic agency, but the development which was promised did not come and now the residents there are not happy,” said Virender Singh ‘Beeru sarpanch’, who is head of the joint action committee of 38 villages.Singh also said that with government removing the concept of ‘Lal Dora’ in the villages, locals who are living outside its limits would be treated as unauthorized, which would become a major problem if the MCG takes over.The Lal Dora is a land in every village and city of the state, which is used for residential purposes without any revenue record.The ownership of the land depends on possession. If a person wants to sell the land, it could only be sold on mutual consent between the buyer and seller without registration. Earlier this year, the government had launched a scheme to eliminate this system.Rana said that the deputy CM patiently heard them out and asked for the resolution. “We will get the resolutions passed, and in the first week of October, a delegation will go to Chandigarh and submit the same to deputy CM for necessary action,” said Rana.Earlier this week, the joint action committee had submitted a memorandum in this regard to the district administration. The villagers also said that they have adequate health, education and other infrastructure in their villages and there was no need for intervention by another government agency.“I heard the matter raised by delegation and have asked them to pass resolutions if they don’t want MCG to take over. We will consider their demands on merit,” said Chautala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-representatives-of-38-villages-meet-deputy-cm-over-takeover-move/story-m5sdbiS8iPQoal9AWV9ghK.html
27-09-2020||Kolkata||Rahul Sinha’s removal, Mukul Roy’s induction spells out BJP’s message to Bengal unit and TMC||By dropping former Bengal unit president Rahul Sinha from the national committee and inducting two former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership has sent a strong message to its leaders as well as the ruling party in the poll-bound state, said state leaders. The reshuffle was announced by BJP president J P Nadda in Delhi on Saturday. “Sinha was dropped as part of an ongoing exercise. The national leadership wants to project new and younger leaders. The leadership was not happy with Sinha’s performance as a national secretary. Also, the fact that he could never win an election becomes crucial when the BJP has set a target to overthrow the TMC government in 2021,” a senior state BJP leader told HT on Sunday evening on condition of anonymity. “Sinha was not the only one to be dropped. More senior and prominent leaders such as Ram Madhav, Anil Jain and Muralidhar Rao were dropped as well,” the leader added. Significantly, it was not Sinha’s exit but the new inductions from the ruling TMC that seemed to bother old BJP leaders and party workers. Sinha was replaced by former TMC Lok Sabha member Anupam Hazra as national secretary and Mukul Roy, the BJP national executive member who helped the saffron camp break into the TMC’s vote bank, was made a national vice-president. Roy had resigned from the Rajya Sabha in 2017 and joined the BJP. Also read: Mukul Roy, CM Mamata’s former confidante made BJP vice president ahead of crucial Bengal pollsSinha voiced his dissent, saying, after serving the party for 40 years he had to make way for leaders from the TMC. As Sinha’s emphasis on entry of TMC leaders came under focus, Bengal BJP leaders maintained official silence to avoid controversy. “I served the party as a soldier since its birth and this is how I was rewarded. Nothing can be more unfortunate. I do not want to say anything on this reward. I will make a statement in 10 or 12 days and decide my future course of action,” Sinha said in a video message that went viral. “What Sinha did is somewhat unprecedented in our regimented structure. The leadership had plans to entrust him with an important role. But he spoke too strongly,” said another BJP leader who was in touch with two central leaders on Sunday. “There was a growing feeling among TMC workers and leaders who joined the BJP in recent years that there was no scope for them to go up the hierarchy since they do not have a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) background. This is a common perception among people in other parties. The reshuffle will counter this perception and may encourage more people from TMC to defect,” said another state BJP leader who was involved in managing the Lok Sabha poll preparations in 2019. Amid the rumblings, dissent and factionalism came out in the open on Sunday.Hazra was gheraoed by a section of BJP workers at Baruipur in the South 24 Parganas district where he went to attend a meeting of party workers on Sunday afternoon. The disgruntled workers, who defected from the TMC, demanded before Hazra that district unit president Hari Krishna Dutta, an old-timer in the BJP, be replaced. Several people were injured when the rival groups clashed after Hazra left Baruipur. In North 24 Parganas district, on the other hand, BJP workers ransacked chairs at a meeting organised by loyalists of the Basirhat unit president Tarak Ghosh. They alleged that the local unit was not organizing any movement against the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/rahul-sinha-s-removal-mukul-roy-s-induction-spells-out-bjp-s-message-to-bengal-unit-and-tmc/story-gwRMHQEK60jyeBJepQklYJ.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Development will not be at the cost of Maharashtra’s environment, says CM Uddhav Thackeray||Development in the state will not be at the cost of destroying the environment and nature, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday, while inaugurating two projects of the tourism department headed by his son and state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. The CM launched two hotels, one in Nashik and the other in Kharghar, of the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), on the occasion of World Tourism Day on Sunday. He also inaugurated Grape Park resort in Nashik near Gangapur dam, which has a boat club. Thackeray has, in the past too, stressed the need to conserve the nature and environment while approving development projects in the state. When his party was in the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) between 2014 and 2019, the Sena opposed the mega oil refinery project in Nanar, Ratnagiri. “Many a times, it happens that for development we destroy the nature and environment that we have. We want development. Definitely, we want it, but not by destroying what we have. We have shown that development can happen while conserving what we have,” the CM said. “Earlier, an issue had raged about a refinery. Where should such projects come up? Where should railway routes come up? We had a railway route, so where can we provide an alternate route?… Our cabinet has decided that we will conserve what we have and provide what is needed. If we follow this, we will have complete development. I don’t consider losing what we have and taking what we did not want as development,” the CM said. Aaditya added the state government is chalking out plans to make Maharashtra an appealing destination to tourists. He said the department was taking steps to make tourists stay longer in Mumbai and Maharashtra. “Mumbai gets two types of tourists – financial or business tourists who stay for 36 hours and tourists who come for 20-25 days. Of the 25 days, they stay in Maharashtra for three or four days and leave for Goa, Jaipur etc. Our effort is to make the tourists who come for 36 hours stay for two-three days, and those who come for three days stay for a week,” Aaditya said. The tourism minister added the department has planned to introduce more tourist spots in Mumbai, including developing Gateway of India precinct, tours at BMC headquarters, etc. He added the department was developing Alibag, Manori and Erangal. looking at Matheran and Mahabaleshwar as tourist spots for international tourists as well. “We are starting the boat club, which is of an international standard. It has various types of boats, including speed boat, banana boats, barge, etc,” Aaditya said. He later tweeted, “It was envisioned by the then Tourism Minister and now Nashik Guardian Minister @ChhaganCBhujbal ji. Glad to have launched it today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/development-will-not-be-at-the-cost-of-maharashtra-s-environment-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-OhgruoKzky6lfDdXxrewtN.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Pune man gives triple talaq to wife over phone, booked alongside family members||Pydhonie police have booked a Pune man for allegedly giving triple talaq to his wife over a phone call. The family members of the man have also been booked for dowry harassment and subjecting the woman to cruelty. According to police, the complainant Aaysha Latif Chhatriwala, 22, in her complaint has stated that she was married to Pune resident Mohsin Chhagla on May 27, 2016, in Pydhonie. Mohsin had a small footwear business earlier but now works as a delivery man with a pharmaceutical company. The complainant has alleged that before marriage, the Chhagla family had demanded ₹5 lakh as dowry from her parents, but after talks, they agreed to ₹3 lakh, which was subsequently paid to them through cash and cheque. However, a week after the wedding, her mother-in-law Sultana Chhagla and sister-in-law Zarin started taunting for giving a smaller dowry. In her complaint, Chhatriwala claimed her in-laws made her work as a maid. Due to the stress, Chhatriwala, who underwent open-heart surgery as a child, in 2017 started suffering from health issues and was asked to take treatment. She also stated that her husband assaulted her while she was pregnant in December 2016. In May 2020, Chhatriwala had come to her parent’s home in Mumbai for some medical treatment. Her husband would often call her and tell her to bring the pending ₹2 lakh dowry from her parents or else he would divorce her. On June 12, when the complainant phoned to tell him that she wanted them to live separate from his parents he pronounced talaq four times. Chhagla’s relatives tried to settle the dispute, but she refused their offer of Nikah Halala (a practice in which a woman after being divorced by talaq, marries another man, consummates the marriage, and gets divorced again to be able to remarry her former husband). However, Chhagla has refuted all the allegations, terming them false and baseless. “I admit that I said Talaq over the phone, but I was angry at the time and did it by mistake. Such talaq is not valid. I regret it and I still believe that I have not divorced her. There is no question of asking her for Halala. My wife and her parents want to take advantage of my mistake as she wishes to separate from me,” he said. On Chhatriwala’s complaint, police on Friday booked her husband and his family members under relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, and Indian Penal Code (IPC). Chhatriwala did not respond to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pune-man-gives-triple-talaq-to-wife-over-phone-booked-alongside-family-members/story-wKWubxooMub8InR6kgLT0K.html

During the interrogation, the accused confessed that he had filmed his repeated acts of sexually assault on his minor daughter. On September 24, police arrested the accused of raping his daughter. According to the survivor, on September 14, her father assaulted her when nobody was at home. He allegedly threatened to set her on fire if she revealed the incident to anyone. An officer from Andheri police station said, “Soon after the accused was arrested, we seized his mobile phone and while scanning it, we found seven video clips which he had recorded while raping his daughter. The video evidence proved that the accused repeatedly sexually assaulted her. We are now checking if he had uploaded these videos anywhere or shared them with anybody.” Vijay Belge, senior inspector from Andheri police station, said, “We have arrested the accused and he is currently in police custody. We have asked the relatives of the survivor to take custody of her for the sake of her safety.” Sources also revealed that police are planning to add section 67 (B) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in sexually explicit act, etc) of the Information Technology Act to the first information report (FIR). The survivor, in her statement, said that her mother had died in 2016 and she stayed with her father and 18-year-old brother. She further said that after her mother’s death, her father molested her multiple times. Fearful of her father, the survivor narrated the ordeal to a neighbour, who took her to the police station to register a complaint, said an officer. Police booked her father under section 376 (2) (F) (being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 (A) (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment] of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault), 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault),8 (punishment for sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-who-raped-minor-daughter-confesses-to-filming-act-on-mobile-phone/story-oSEME5pJirBrdxpuaJc36H.html

Maharashtra Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat was also present at the meeting.The meeting comes a day after Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Raut met former Fadnavis, which sparked political speculations. However, Sena insiders denied any connection between the two meetings.Speaking to reporters, the Sena Member of Parliament (MP) clarified that he met Fadnavis to plan an interview for the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’. He added that even Thackeray was aware of their meeting.“The government is functioning smoothly. There is excellent coordination between Sharad Pawar, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Uddhav Thackeray, Ajit Pawar… there will be no change in the equations,” he said.Raut said that Maharashtra politics is unlike “politics of the north” where, when there is an ideological difference, they stop speaking to each other. “There can be ideological differences but we [Fadnavis] are not enemies. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was aware of our meeting. We were not sitting in a bunker, it was an open meeting,” he added.Fadnavis also clarified that the meeting was not political. The former CM said that the BJP is not in a hurry to come to power and will not compromise to get in power. “The manner in which the government has handled the Covid crisis, there is a lot of anger due to it. We will continue to work as a strong opposition party to point out where they falter. The government will collapse due to their actions; when it happens, then we will see. I am in no haste to form the government,” he said.Raut on Sunday also welcomed the decision of the Akali Dal to break away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He added that there can be no NDA without Akali Dal and Shiv Sena, which were the “two strong pillars” of the Alliance. He said that Shiv Sena quit the NDA out of no choice. In late 2019, the party decided to join hands with the NCP and Congress to form the state government.“The two strong pillars of the NDA were the Shiv Sena and Akali Dal. Shiv Sena moved out of the NDA out of no choice. We did not wish to. Now Akali Dal also left NDA on the farmers’ issues. BJP has got some new partners in the NDA, I wish them the best. Without Shiv Sena and Akali Dal, there can be no NDA. The three parties – BJP, Sena, and Akali Dal – have stuck together for several years… whether in power or opposition. Now with new parties, it is not the NDA, but a new coalition,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-mva-government-will-complete-5-year-term-shiv-sena-mp-raut-after-meeting-bjp-s-devendra-fadnavis/story-6pj4GqCX96uL4WR3dTZieN.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||96% of JEE-Adv candidates appear for exam, find math section tough||The Joint Entrance Examination-Advanced (JEE-Adv) was conducted across the country on Sunday in two slots, and almost 96% of the 1.6 lakh registered candidates appeared for the exam this year. Most students found the paper moderate to difficult compared to last year, especially the math section.As per information shared by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, which organised the exam, JEE-Adv 2020 was held across 222 cities and 1,001 exam centres. “Paper 1 was attempted by 151,311 students and paper 2 was attempted by 150,900 registered students,” mentioned a statement released by IIT-Delhi on Sunday evening.The exam was conducted in two slots – 9am to noon and 2.30pm to 5.30pm. Most candidates said that while a large part of the question papers was from within the curriculum, the maths section was particularly difficult.“The chemistry section was easy, and the physics section was a little difficult, but most faced trouble solving the Maths section. This made the paper lengthy, and some students did not manage to complete it,” said Ayush Chheda, one of the candidates.To avoid overcrowding and to ensure implementation of other safety norms, the examination authority had asked students to report to their respective centres in a staggered manner. The same format was followed during the JEE-Main (paper 2) exam that was conducted earlier this month.HT had previously reported that only 64% of the students eligible to appear for the JEE-Advanced registered for the examination in 2020. While the top 2.5 lakh students who cleared JEE-Main were eligible for the examination this year, only 160,831 finished the registration process.The results for this exam are scheduled to be announced on October 5, following which the admissions process to 23 IITs will commence by the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/96-of-jee-adv-candidates-appear-for-exam-find-math-section-tough/story-k0wNedNPrjKIY04PdRINZO.html

27-09-2020||Mumbai||As Covid-19 cases breach the 2,000-mark in prisons across Maharashtra, lawyers to press for changes in high-power panel’s guidelines||As the number of Covid-19 cases in jails across the state has breached the 2,000-mark, advocates who have filed various petitions in the Bombay high court (HC), seeking emergency bail or parole for inmates, have said that they would be pressing for changes in the May guidelines issued by the high-power committee (HPC), pertaining to the release of inmates, including undertrials and convicts serving sentences of more than seven years. The HPC was constituted by the state to regulate and oversee the release of prisoners on a temporary basis to decongest the jails amid the outbreak. As on September 23, 2,061 inmates across and 421 jail staffers have tested positive for Covid-19 across 43 central and district prisons in Maharashtra. Advocate Satish Talekar, whose letter to the HC chief justice was converted into a public interest litigation (PIL), said that the HPC’s guidelines were issued in May, when there were only 34 Covid-19 cases in jails. However, the contagion has spread unabated and there is an urgent need for a review of the guidelines. “The HPC guidelines are contrary to the recommendations of the state government and jail authorities, as the classification of prisoners, which by itself is unconstitutional, has made it almost impossible for the courts to release the prisoners on emergency bail or parole,” said Talekar, adding that though the petitions challenging the HPC guidelines were rejected by the HC and the Supreme Court (SC), there was a need to revisit its guidelines. The first case in jails was detected from Mumbai Central Prison (Arthur Road jail) after a 45-year-old inmate, who had suffered a paralytic attack on May 2, was taken to JJ Hospital. He had developed the symptoms of the virus and had intermittent high fever since April 30. According to the hospital records, the patient was admitted at 1.55 pm on May 2 and a swab test was taken, which came positive on May 5. Following this, 182 inmates and 46 staffers of the prison were also found positive for the virus. NB Vyachal, superintendent of police at Arthur Road prison, had foreseen the problems which the contagion could cause in an extremely congested jail. In a letter written to the chief metropolitan magistrate on March 23, Vyachal had said that Arthur Road was housing 3,700 inmates as against the capacity of 800 and had called for the court to grant regular bail to undertrials in minor and moderate offences, and temporary bail to those booked in serious offences to decongest the prison. He had also pointed out in the letter that Arthur Road prison was located only 100 metres away from Kasturba Hospital, where hundreds of patients were being tested and treated for Covid-19 on a daily basis, which was violation of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) norms, mandating that a radius of 3 kilometres be declared a buffer zone from any hospital treating infected patients. The influx of inmates contracting Covid-19 at Arthur Road jail saw a slew of petitions being filed in the HC, seeking various reliefs for the inmates as well as implementing the SC directions issued on March 23 to decongest jails. The petitioners included non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals who sought the intervention of the court to ascertain the status of the inmates, post the discovery of the infection, as neither the jail authorities nor the state was forthcoming with any information. The PIL filed by NGO People’s Unity for Civil Liberty saw senior advocate Mihir Desai seeking directions to the jail authorities to give the status of inmates (infected and non-infected ones), how social distancing norms were being maintained in overcrowded jails, the precautionary measures being taken by jail authorities to safeguard the inmates and to establish contact between inmates and their lawyers and relatives. After the court directed the jail authorities to take immediate steps to safeguard the non-infected inmates, the authorities started regular thermal screening and sanitisation of the jail premises and barracks, creation of isolation bays and providing cellular and video-calling facilities to the inmates. Another bunch of petitions pertaining to undertrials and convicts were also moved before the HC, in which the issue of releasing prisoners on interim bail/parole or furlough as per the SC directions were raised. The petitions challenged the decision of the HPC. The challenges in the petition were to the May 11 and 18 decisions of the HPC to classify prisoners based on the crime and duration of the punishment they were to undergo. While undertrials and convicts booked and convicted only under the Indian Penal Code with a sentence less than seven years were considered for temporary or interim bail/parole or furlough, the HPC denied the benefit those booked or convicted under special acts such as Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositers (In Financial Establishments) Act (MPID), Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso), Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca), Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) and Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). In order to curb the contagion and to decongest the prisons, a government resolution dated May 15 empowered the district collectors to declare any private or public building premises a temporary jail. All newly-admitted prisoners (2,767) are now being confined in such 37 temporary jails in the state, said jail authorities in response to the petition. “We have opened 37 temporary centres for new admissions and to quarantine those who are tested positive. Most of the Covid-19 infected prisoners are asymptomatic and are undergoing treatment at quarantined centres. Only those who show symptoms are sent to hospitals,” additionaldirector general of prison department, Maharashtra, Sunil Ramanand, said. The prison authorities also stated in an affidavit filed before the HC that in order to curb the contagion, overcrowded prisons such as Yerawada, Mumbai, Thane, Byculla, Kalyan, Nashik Road, Aurangabad and Nagpur jails have been locked down completely. However, in June and July, reports of cases started coming in from others prisons, with Nagpur Central Prison being the worst affected. As on September 23, around 219 inmates and 62 jail staffers have been tested positive in Nagpur Central Prison, while 171 inmates and 21 staffers have tested positive at Chandrapur District Prison. The central prison at Yerawada in Pune saw 261 cases among inmates and 43 among the staff, while Aurangabad Central Prison had 52 infected inmates and 35 staffers. Another district prison at Solapur has 69 and 13 cases among its prisoners and jail staff, respectively. Advocate NN Gavankar, who had moved for parole and furlough for prisoners owing to the increasing number of cases in Kolhapur jail, criticised the HPC guidelines and said that they were absurd. “While an April 2018 government notification permits those convicted in most serious crimes such as bomb blasts to avail emergency bail or parole for attending a marriage or funeral in the family, the HPC guidelines denies them the benefit for Covid-19 outbreak. The HPC guidelines are contrary to the constitutional rights available to prisoners, as their lives are put in jeopardy due to the classification made in the guidelines,” said Gavankar. Meanwhile, despite the fact that prisons in Maharashtra could possibly be the worst-hit due to Covid-19 across the country, little seems to have been done by the state in terms of decongesting the prisons or conducting enough number of tests. This is despite the HC having asked prison authorities to conduct random testing of inmates and to scrupulously follow the guidelines issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). According to jail authorities, 14,597 inmates and 2,543 staffers have been tested for Covid-19 across prisons in Maharashtra. But the statistics released by the prisons department shows that no tests have been conducted in six of the 43 prisons across the state. Ramanand said, “I believe we are conducting sufficient testing. We have around 27,000 prisoners and have conducted more than 14,000 tests so far and the process is on.” As on September 23, prisons across Maharashtra houses 27,255 inmates against the total capacity of 23,217, said jail authorities. The number of inmates inside the prison continues to be staggering, despite prison authorities claiming that a total of 10,608 inmates have either been released on bail or parole since March 23. As per the prison manual, an inmate has to be provided a space of 3.71 square metres (five feet width). And according to jail authorities, to ensure social distancing, the capacity of the jails will have to be reduced by two-third, which means that prisons across Maharashtra can house only about 16,000 inmates. “All possible efforts for de-congestion of prisons are being taken, but still we have some central prisons which are overcrowded. However, we also have to understand that granting bail to a prisoner is decided by the court. The most important thing here to notice is that we have been able to successfully curb the Covid-related deaths in prisons. There are only six Covid-19 deaths among 36,000 prisoners. We have successfully achieved the lowest mortality rate [in the country],” said Ramanand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-covid-19-cases-breach-the-2-000-mark-in-prisons-across-maharashtra-lawyers-to-press-for-changes-in-high-power-panel-s-guidelines/story-d0pZBLWUuP1nlQB7lF80MK.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||India will get two VVIP hi-tech aircraft on October 1||India’s wait for two of its dedicated VVIP aircraft is about to get over as the specially made hi-tech aircraft is set to land in Delhi on October 1. Top airline sources said the aircraft will be handed over by Boeing after conducting test flights and teams have already flown to Boeing headquarters at Chicago to take delivery of these special aircraft. The arrival of Air India One from the United States (US), which will be used exclusively for the prime minister, president and vice-president, went through a series of delays. It will be accompanied by a team comprising Air India’s engineers and pilots and the Indian Air Force. “The test flights are expected to be completed by September 25, after which the aircraft manufacturer will hand over the two aircraft to us. The two aircraft will take off by September 30 and will land in Delhi by October 1. Both aircraft are expected to take-off with a gap of around 20 minutes on September 30,” said a highly placed source on conditions of anonymity. Air India did not comment on the development.The first delivery of these VVIP aircraft was scheduled in July but was delayed due to the ongoing pandemic. It was then scheduled to be delivered around mid- September. While one of the two aircraft was to be delivered mid-September, the second aircraft was to be delivered by September end. These aircraft deliveries were however delayed after a team from Air India that had flown to the US for taking the aircraft’s delivery made some technical suggestions. These Boeing 777 aircraft will have state-of-the-art missile defence systems called Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and Self Protection Suites (SPS). The customised aircraft will be operated by the Indian Air Force pilots while flying VVIPs. For this, Air India has trained four IAF pilots. In May this year, around 15 shortlisted senior-most Air India pilots were deputed for two years to operate these ‘special extra section flights’ which refers to these VVIP flights. As the national carrier’s pilots are well experienced to operate B777, initially they will be flying along with IAF pilots and later IAF pilots will take over the complete flying operations. In 2018, these two aircraft that were sent to the Boeing facility for the retrofitting purpose were a part of the airline’s commercial fleet.Currently, Air India operates its Boeing 747 aircraft for the VVIP travel. However, these aircraft are not exclusively used to fly dignitaries. They have been utilised for commercial purposes when they are not flying VVIPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-will-get-two-vvip-hi-tech-aircraft-on-october-1/story-oAXxVfXXmMfggfoSHLGKUP.html

Of this, fines worth ₹19 lakh were collected from 9,218 defaulters between September 13 and 26 alone.As the lockdown restrictions have been gradually lifted, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to further ramp up the surveillance to ensure citizens mandatorily wear masks while stepping out of their homes.“We have instructed ward officers to increase their surveillance and soon, we will give them a higher daily target rate to collect fines,” said ,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The highest amount (₹6.15 lakh) for the violation was collected from K West ward that covers Andheri (West), followed by R South (Dahisar), where ₹6.07 lakh was collected from 1,331 defaulters. The third highest amount was collected from C ward (Kalbadevi) where 1,169 citizens were fine ₹5.60 lakh, followed by R Central ward where ₹2.63-lakh fines were collected in 1,084 cases.People need to develop the habit of wearing a mask. Residents in slums are more responsible than those at in non-slum areas. We could control the infection spread in slums because of proper implementation of safety measures,” said Kakani.“People have been at home for almost seven months. So now with the relaxation in the lockdown, people are coming out of their homes but many aren’t following basic precautionary measures such as wearing masks. Earlier, we were fining only 10-12 people each day, but now it has increased to over 70 fines,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer, R Central ward (Borivli).In the last week of June, BMC made it mandatory to wear masks while stepping out of homes. The mask may be either three-ply or plain cloth mask which are available at chemists. Citizens can also wear homemade, washable masks which can be reused after properly washing and disinfecting them.As per the order, anybody violating the order will be punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and a fine will be imposed for each such offence by the police officer or the officers appointed by assistant commissioners of the corporation.In the first week of September, BMC decreased the fine from ₹1,000 to ₹200. The solid waste management department has been entrusted with penalising people for not wearing masks. In each ward, a team of 25 inspectors has been formed to ensure rules are followed. The vigilance is likely to increase in the coming days.“Masks help to trap the droplets that are released while talking, sneezing and coughing. It is an integral part of the mechanism to curb the spread of the infection among others. For people above 50 years with comorbidities, it is the primary safety guard against the virus,” said medical officer Dr Gulnar Khan from K West ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-corporation-collected-fines-worth-52-76-lakh-from-14k-citizens-for-not-wearing-masks-at-public-places/story-BAMQNO8WG87p6og7i31KTI.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Access hierarchy around Mumbai’s Metro stations: Walking, cycling to be prioritised||Covid-19 is radically changing the way people live, work and travel across cities. With walking and cycling gaining importance across global cities, Mumbai’s infrastructure proposals are also taking a few steps to prioritise non-motorised transport.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has created an “access hierarchy” for the upcoming metro stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). According to which, development and planning of access to metro stations will mean giving highest priority to pedestrians, cyclists, buses and shared-rickshaws followed by drop-off by private vehicles, two-wheelers and cars. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “World over, cities are giving more prominence to enabling walking and cycling infrastructure for commuters, especially during the pandemic. Our multi-modal integration plan around upcoming metro stations will also aim to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.”The plan is a part of the multi-modal integration project being undertaken by the authority for all upcoming metro stations. As per which, a minimum of 500-meter radius around every station will be exclusive for last-mile users. It will include bus-bays, parking area, seating arrangement and cycle docks.While MMRDA has already approved the plans for 30 metro stations of metro line 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), it has recently also invited proposals for planning and design of multi-modal integration around 17 stations of Metro 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadaval) and 4A (line 4 extension till Gaimukh).While first and last-mile connectivity continues to be poor in the city, the authority is taking some steps in that direction. It recently launched an e-bike initiative in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) to ease connectivity from the suburban stations of Bandra and Kurla to BKC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/access-hierarchy-around-mumbai-s-metro-stations-walking-cycling-to-be-prioritised/story-oYd8Mt8MlunlmAK3j6Ff2L.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s tribal schools make offline learning accessible to students||With a large number of tribal schools’ students in the state having no access to online education, the state government’s tribal development department has been working with school authorities to make several offline learning tools available for these students. Nearly 4.74 lakh students are studying in various tribal schools across the state. With the Covid-19 situation and the resultant lockdown, students are now in their homes, most of which are located in remote areas across the state. As schools began their new academic year online in June this year, tribal schools have a set of challenges ahead of them. “Most students studying in these schools have no access to the internet and a basic phone even. So, ensuring that their education continues was important and for this, we came up with a comprehensive plan,” said Kiran Kulkarni, former commissioner of the tribal development department. The department has recently come up with a document titled ‘Unlock Learning’ listing out all the initiatives that it took up over the last 4 months to ensure that offline learning reaches students even as schools remain shut. An important initiative that has been taken as part of the strategy is the appointment of local resource persons to facilitate learning.“To make sure that students continue learning and get the necessary help and support to do so constantly, educated students, anganwadi workers and government employees in the vicinity are appointed as resource persons voluntarily. They have a list of students in their locality and are in a position to play the role of mediators between teachers and students,” states the 54-page long document compiled by the department. Students have also been given workbooks and activity books specially designed for offline learning outside of schools. Teachers from ashram schools have been allotted 20-25 students each and have been doing home visits once every week to the homes of these students. Teachers have also been encouraged to remain sensitive to the cultural and social contexts of students. “Some homes might not have enough light and the children might be in old clothes. Teachers should be empathetic towards their need,” states the document. Wardens of tribal hostels have been asked to keep a check on students from time to time. Teachers have also shot short videos in the local context to make learning more interesting for students. Shaila Thakur, a teacher at an aided tribal school in Chikhale, Panvel said, “We go to the localities of students with teaching aids and teach them in small groups. Every day, teachers visit different localities, so once every week, every child gets personal guidance. On the remaining days, we stay in touch through phones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-tribal-schools-make-offline-learning-accessible-to-students/story-sGf2EIiFIMgZcM1fOXsw5H.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 lockdown: 62-year-old donates smartphones to Palghar zilla parishad school students||Students of the zilla parishad school in Baliwali, Palghar, visited the school after months of lockdown on Friday to collect the smartphones that were donated by a 62-year-old retired reinsurance consultant Venkatesh Chakravarty.HT had reported on September 14 about assistant teacher Pralhad Kathole’s efforts to keep students engaged during the lockdown. The report further said that since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, online classes were not an option for the students in Baliwali as only two students’ parents had smartphones in a class of 44. So, Kathole had scanned a range of currency notes and arranged them on a sheet of paper so that his pupils from Class 3 and 4 could learn basic mathematical concepts of addition and subtraction.Moved by the plight of the students, Chakravarty, donated 15 smartphones with prepaid internet connection for three months. The smartphones and the internet will be shared among the students, said Kathole.“During the lockdown, those who are privileged are continuing with online education but some sections of the society are facing huge disadvantages. We can’t just leave it to somebody else to solve the problems,” said Chakravarty, a Mulund resident.“I was impressed by Pralhad’s passion for his students’ education,” Chakravarty added. After working out the details with Kathole, he paid ₹95,000 for the devices as well as the internet connection.On Friday, students, accompanied by their parents reached the school to receive the devices as Chakravarty joined them via a video call. “I contacted science educators from Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education for mobile applications to be installed on the phone for self-learning. I feel one-on-one meeting with children is important, so I will be working in a blended mode with kids which is partly offline and partly online,” Kathole said.Located around 100km northeast of Mumbai, Baliwali is a cluster of hamlets spread across the forests in the Wada taluka of Palghar. Most students at the zilla parishad school belong to the scheduled tribe community and four girls belong to other backward classes. While most of these families live off small pieces of land, many parents migrate seasonally to work in brick kilns in nearby Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Vasai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-lockdown-62-year-old-donates-smartphones-to-palghar-zilla-parishad-school-students/story-k6LyMJXN2o4ysCRYksrS2M.html
27-09-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: No free RT-PCR testing kits for Mumbai after September 30||Come September 30, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will stop getting RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing kits for Covid-19 testing for free from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In August, ICMR informed state governments that they will no longer give RT-PCR test kits for free. This month, BMC conducted upto 15,000 Covid tests daily. Currently, 60%-80% of the daily tests conducted in Mumbai are through the RT-PCR method, while the rest are rapid antigen tests. The current stock of RT-PCR kits can suffice till October 31. The civic body has initiated the tendering process to procure new kits. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the civic health department, said, “We asked ICMR for an extension till September 30. Our stock will last till October 31. After the due process, we will procure RT-PCR kits from the market, from private and government agencies presently providing these kits to the Central government.” When asked how much will it cost BMC, Kakani said, “We are working out the cost. Proper procedure will be followed, and tenders will be floated.” The civic body is already facing a financial crunch, from losses due to lockdown and unforseen Covid relief expenditure. Earlier this month, BMC slashed ₹2,500 crore from funds for infrastructure projects and has asked its administrative departments to cut revenue expenditure by 20%. BMC is also accumulating RT-PCR kits week on week to ensure the stock lasts maximum number of days. “We will not face any shortage,” Kakani said. RT-PCR test results to detect Covid-19 are considered accurate, in comparison to antigen tests which have a higher chance of producing a false negative. So far, BMC has procured 2 lakh rapid antigen testing kits from the market, and has placed an order to procure 1 lakh more. BMC has so far conducted 10.57 lakh tests, with a positivity percentage of 18.18%. Mumbai on Sunday recorded 2,261 new Covid-19 cases, and 44 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the total number of cases to 1,98,864, and deaths to 8,794. There are 26,716 active cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-no-free-rt-pcr-testing-kits-for-mumbai-after-september-30/story-ECJMT5RfRul27qpaoT6njL.html

The party’s chief had also expressed anguish over the non-inclusion of Punjabi in the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020.In the wake of this development, the Punjab unit of the BJP held a meeting of its core group core on Sunday.Addressing reporters after the meeting, Sharma said, “The BJP has always given respect to every party associated with the NDA. But the SAD is a political party and they chose another line. Surely I felt sad as they were the oldest ally.” “But the two reasons they (Akalis) gave (for snapping ties) were very surprising,” he said.On the issue of farm bills, the Akalis alleged that the BJP was not pro-farmer. But, ever since Narendra Modi became prime minister, several decisions have been taken by the farming community, Sharma said.He cited the support of Rs 6,000 given to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sammann Nidhi scheme, supplying neem-coated urea, Kisan Bima and Fasal Bima schemes among others.Strongly defending the three farm bills, Sharma said the prime minister had assured the minimum support price system and government purchase would continue.The Punjab BJP chief said the Akali Dal also raised the issue of non-inclusion of Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir.“Under a new clause 4, which has been inserted in the new law (Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020), a provision has been made to promote the Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir,” Sharma claimed.He said the BJP is accountable to Punjab, Punjabiyat and the people of Punjab.“Therefore, the reasons they (Akalis) gave (for leaving alliance) are not sufficient,” he said.Sharma also accused the Congress and the AAP of trying to mislead the farmers.Taking on Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, the state BJP chief accused him of using the shoulder of farmers in a bid to hide his government’s failures and rampant corruption and existence of liquor and mining mafias.He lashed out at the Congress, alleging that it ruled the country for 60 years and gave false hopes to the poor and the farmers and never took any decision to raise their standard of living.Reacting to the SAD’s decision of breaking ties, BJP’s senior leader Manoranjan Kalia said it was unfortunate that they broke a long association.He said there was a generational change in the Akali Dal as several senior leaders like Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and Sewa Singh Sekhawan, who used to work with Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal, have left the SAD.“Now, the second generation has taken over and some leaders are more reactive now,” said Kalia.Another BJP leader Master Mohan Lal described the Akalis’ move of pulling out of the NDA as a “decision taken in haste”. He said the Akalis should have held a meeting with BJP’s core group.“I do not understand what were Akalis’ compulsions and why they took this decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/their-reasons-for-quitting-alliance-weren-t-sufficient-punjab-bjp-on-sad-s-exit/story-z3DAL6LSBfuggNCc4DdJsJ.html

As per sources, these works require huge funds and with the finance department releasing only Rs 1 crore, the contractor has decided to complete the work of two blocks until more funds are released.Executive engineer of the public works department (PWD), Adesh Gupta said, “We have received a sum of around Rs 1 crore from the state higher education department but we had sent a requirement of Rs 3 crore. Before that, the funds had been released in November last year. To expedite the work, the authorities need to release the pending funds. The project is worth Rs 12 crore.”The construction on the five-acre land started on November 3, 2018, and is expected to be completed by January next year. In June, the work on the construction of the new building of the third government college in the city came to a halt due to the paucity of funds.Sanjay Talwar, member of legislative assembly (MLA) said, “Funds of Rs 1 crore have been released to the contractor and the rest will be released soon. I will be going to Chandigarh next week to assure that the required funds will be released soon to the contractor by the finance department. The classes for the BA course will be conducted in the new premises from January.”The foundation stone of the building was laid at the site on January 28, 2018. On April 11, 2018, a team comprising the director, public instructions (colleges), former deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal and other officers inspected a community centre at Jamalpur to start BA part 1 and part 2 classes temporarily from there. Students of these classes were supposed to be later shifted to the new college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-govt-college-building-east-work-progressing-at-snail-s-pace/story-oCCgAO1Zih1R36kIt3vHaN.html

In the three-page letter to the CM, Dhaliwal said: “It’s quite strange that ACS/director had prepared the report on the basis of findings of a tainted officer. The fact and figures in the report are false and beyond the knowledge and meant to tarnish the image of government. The department officials have already submitted that there is no misuse of funds, and no payment was made to any ghost institution. ACS intentionally ignored these facts, while preparing the report,” Dhaliwal said in his demi-official letter to the CM.To buttress his point, Dhaliwal even submitted the financial statement and report made by deputy finance controller and auditor of the department, who on August 25 submitted that there is no mismatch in funds drawn from treasury and disbursed to colleges. Meanwhile, the three-member panel led by principal secretary (finance) KAP Sinha that was tasked with to look into the matter has reportedly submitted its report to chief secretary Vini Mahajan, which she is likely to take up the CM next week.Social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot’s role in the disbursal of funds under the said scheme is under scanner even as he has refuted all the allegations of any wrong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/post-matric-sc-scholarship-scam-mla-now-ex-bureaucrat-writes-to-cm-says-there-is-no-discrepancy/story-3bWRJDsa9J4JVWOk9ySHPJ.html

According to PMPML authorities, the total amount of dues pending with both the governing bodies is around Rs 183 crore for the period between March 23 and August 31. The PMC owes Rs 110 crore to PMPML while PCMC has dues amounting to Rs 73 crore. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, for around five months PMPML bus service was operating only for emergency service people. Now since the bus service has started for common public, the daily income of the organisation has reduced to around Rs 15 lakh which was earlier Rs 1.5 crore daily on an average. If the dues are not paid immediately then there is a fear that PMPML bus service might come to stand still soon. “As we all know that Covid-19 pandemic has affected all fields economically and it has affected our daily revenue as well over the last six months. As we come under financial deficit every year, which is paid by both the municipal corporations as per the state government order. During this Covid period, the PMPML daily revenue has drastically come down, we were shut down for almost 160 days and its total loss has gone up to Rs 183 crore. This period is from March 23 to August 31, this is all about immediate expenses which needs to be paid on immediate basis. It includes our diesel expenses, maintenance and repairing of buses which needs to be paid as early as possible,” said PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap. “We have written letters to both the municipal corporations demanding the pending dues, as it is a matter of survival for us now. They can pay the dues in phases, but they should at least start giving us financial help as early as possible. If the payments are not given on time then slowly the services will come down and we might have to stop it completely soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-shoots-letters-to-pmc-pcmc-to-recover-dues-worth-rs-183-cr/story-anSFSvFBmklytNjVPImCQO.html

Our farmers’ leaders at least now have to understand the intention, and should drop the bandh call and stop creating unnecessary confusion. There will be no scope for it (bandh),” he added.Revenue Minister R Ashoka, who was present, also said there would be no scope for the bandh from the government side and steps would be taken to ensure normal life remained unaffected.Noting that there were clear court orders regarding such bandhs, he said, all necessary arrangements have been made for government offices, hospitals, shops and establishments, taxis and bus to operate smoothly.There was no need for people to fear about bandh and they can carry on with their day-to-day activities normally, he said, warning of stern action by police against anyone enforcing the bandh forcefully or indulging in incidents like stone pelting on Monday.Despite the stiff opposition from the opposition parties, especially Congress, the Yediyurappa government was successful in getting the APMC bill and also the Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill passed in the assembly on Saturday.While the amendments to land reform act liberalises farmland ownership, the APMC bill curtails the powers of local agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) and allows private individuals to start agricultural trading, if they hold a permanent account number (PAN).The bandh is also supported by several labour organisations who are protesting against amendments to certain labour laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bandh-our-farmer-leaders-clear-about-govt-s-intentions-no-scope-for-agitation-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa/story-BGJlxOWrlSAyjJYiQDrFJL.html

27-09-2020||City||Farmers in Una village reaping benefits of crop diversification project||The Himachal government’s crop diversification promotion project, which is being implemented with the help of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has started to set the farmers of Badsala village in Una district on the path of prosperity.The farmers who were once purchasing foodgrains from the market are now selling their produce and earning a profitable income.It was in May 2017 that the facility of irrigation was provided to farmlands in Badsal from a tubewell installed under JICA’s supervision.An area of 14.37 hectares was brought under the irrigation project, constructed at a cost of about ₹46 lakh, which recorded an unprecedented increase in the yield of wheat and maize in the area.State agriculture minister Virendra Kanwar said that the first phase of the JICA-led project is going to close by December this year. In this phase, a ₹321-crore project was implemented in five districts —Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Kangra, Mandi and Una.“Farmers were given training on vegetable and cereal growing and post-harvest management techniques. Basic facilities like irrigation and road access to the fields were developed under the project,” said Kanwar.For the second phase, the proposed outlay of the project would be ₹1,104 crore. A memorandum of understanding in this regard is likely to be signed with JICA in March 2021.“Before the implementation of the project in Badsala, the average yield per hectare was 18 quintals in the kharif season. But, after introducing the irrigation facility, the yield rose to 32 quintals per hectare in the corresponding period last year,” the minister revealed.This rabi season, 41 quintal wheat was produced per hectare. Earlier, the yield would be around 15 quintals per hectare only, said Kanwar.Farmers also started growing vegetables on 2.4 hectares of land during the kharif season and 4.55-hectare area in the rabi season, he added.Under the sub-project, JICA block project manager Kulbhushan Dhiman said Badsala farmers were provided with irrigation, seeds, equipment and training.“All these measures helped in raising their income by almost five times. Earlier, a farmer used to earn ₹52,552 per hectare; which increased to ₹2,71,197 per hectare in the year 2019-20,” Dhiman informed.Farmers from the village are elated about the financial benefits of the project.Mukesh Kumar said because of the crop diversification project in the village, farmers have started growing potatoes and other vegetables and are earning huge profits. “Besides the irrigation facilities, seeds, equipment and training are also being provided to us.”Another farmer, Sodhi Ram, said the entire village has been benefited by this initiative. The training provided as part of the project has helped farmers understand the modern techniques of agriculture, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-in-una-village-reaping-benefits-of-crop-diversification-project/story-Gp2bmcXdetOhzy97mIj8jO.html

The Centre’s move is widely seen as being aimed at reassuring agitating farmers about the sanctity of the procurement system through notified market yards run by agricultural produce market committees (APMC). In a statement issued here, leaders of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee said, “This order is untimely as the crop will come to the mandis after 10 days. Secondly, the procurement arrangements have not been made yet in the mandis. This is a tactic of the BJP to create rift among the farmers. This kind of tactics and propaganda being spread in favour of the laws by the Modi government will not pacify the farmers.” A large number of women from peasant families took part in the rail rook agitation on the Amritsar-Delhi rail route at Devidas Pura village in the district. They reached there with saffron ‘dupattas’ on their heads and holding flags of the organisation. They sat there throughout the day and raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “This is a good sign for the farmer struggle that the women have decided to be a part of it,” said Sarwan Singh Pandher, state general secretary of the organisation, who is leading the agitators at Devidas Pura village. Meanwhile, a delegation of Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal on Sunday called on Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh with a memorandum seeking an all-party meeting to pave the way for adopting legislation to counter the new laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/early-procurement-a-tactic-to-appease-and-divide-us-protesting-farmers/story-JOD3KZ6iKIxXz0fvQlSVEP.html

These included Mohra, Matheri Jattan and Panjokhra, said Rajeev Sharma, BKU leader and Ambala media in-charge .in Farouli village, images of a poster is doing the rounds on social media, with a warning: “Gaon mein ghusne parr lath fera jaa sakta hai, jaise sarkaar ne Pipli mein kisano par fera tha, yaad hai na? (Those entering the village might have to face the stick, as was done with farmers in Pipli. Do you remember?).”Police resorted to a mild lathicharge on farmers at Pipli Chowk near Kurukshetra on September 10 for defying prohibitory orders as they were headed to the grain market to take part in a rally against the farm bills.However, this poster has no mention of BKU or any other union.Village sarpanch Sunil Kumar said he had seen the poster on Facebook, but was unable to confirm who had put it up.“Protests have been continuing for the last few days, so someone must have placed it overnight.

While addressing a press conference, Selja said Dushyant should wake up from his slumber and act now. “Please do not wait for the minimum support price (MSP) to be done away with. The entire farming community is looking at you and your stance on the issue. How can you sit quiet and support a government which is anti-farmer? This is an unholy alliance (between the BJP and JJP),’’ the state Congress chief said. Referring to the breaking of ties by Shiromani Akal Dal (SAD) with the NDA, Selja said it was a ‘drama’ staged by the SAD leadership. “The SAD did not say anything initially when the three farm ordinances were promulgated. However, they woke up when they saw that farmers in Punjab have taken to streets,’’ she said, adding that Dushyant should also follow in the Akali Dal’s footsteps by listening to protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sever-ties-with-nda-over-anti-farmer-bills-selja-to-dushyant/story-cgSOCWs6S5HuyCEHJD5QzM.html

Others participating in the protest are state affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, all state Congress MPs and MLAs, said party chief Sunil Jakhar on Sunday.This will be Amarinder Singh’s first protest against the farm bills. Former Uttarakhand chief minister and Congress general secretary Rawat will also be visiting Punjab for the first time since taking charge of state affairs.Elaborating on Monday’s plans, Satbir Singh Palli Jhikki, chairman of SBS Nagar district planning commission and Halqa in-charge of Banga constituency, said the CM and other leaders were expected to pay floral tributes to Bhagat Singh at his memorial at Khatkar Kalan on the occasion. Punjab cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Nawanshahr MLA Angad Singh visited the memorial on Sunday to oversee arrangements for Monday.The SBS Nagar district administration also held review meetings to discuss the CM’s itinerary.Channi said the Congress was on the verge of a long-term agitation against the Central government over the farm bills from Bhagat Singh’s village, with more plans expected to be announced by the CM to compel the Centre to withdraw its legislation. On Akali Dal snapping ties from BJP, Channi said it was an alliance for the personal benefits as SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Union cabinet minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal failed to protect the farmers’ rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-to-stage-dharna-against-farm-bills-on-bhagat-singh-s-birth-anniversary/story-ChdkQsrPek7fmhegfmWJOL.html

27-09-2020||Chandigarh||Crops not ready for harvesting in parts of Punjab as paddy procurement begins||Even though the Central government directed the Punjab and Haryana governments on Saturday to advance paddy procurement, the crop is likely to be ready for harvesting only in about 10 days.The state was instructed at the last minute on Saturday to go ahead with procurement on Sunday even though the process usually starts from October 1.Farmers who are almost done reaping the crops will start bringing in the yield by October 5, sources said.According to agriculture experts, the procurement season will gain momentum in the second week of October as some varieties, including PR 121, 122,128, 129 and 140, will be ready for harvesting by then.Agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi said at present only around 1% of advance varieties of paddy, mainly basmati, are ready for harvesting and procurement in parts of Majha in Punjab.‘Most varieties still unripe’“The main crop will start reaching the grain markets by October 5. After gathering reports from field surveys it was found that most varieties are still unripe, at the last stages of reaping. It will take over 10 days for these varieties to be ready for harvest,” Airi said.Procurement is likely to gain momentum in the second week of the October as farmers have been advised not to carry out harvesting in haste.The state government had earlier due to labour shortage advanced paddy sowing season by 10 days — from June 20 to June 10.At least 26.6 lakh metric tonne paddy yield is expected this year across the state, while paddy production is estimated at 170 lakh metric tones. In this Kharif season, the department has managed to shift 3 lakh hectare area from under water guzzling paddy cultivation to cotton and maize crops, which require minimal irrigation.Release of crash credit limit to take timePunjab food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said though the formal procurement season began from Sunday, it would take another four to five days for the Central government to release cash credit limit (CCL) for payments to the farmers.“We have already written to the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and distribution to allocate the CCL advance worth Rs 35,500 crore so that payment can be made to the farmers on time. We are hopeful of getting an advance by the time the procurement gains momentum,” Ashu added.Meanwhile, with an increase of Rs 53 this year, the Minimum support price (MSP) of paddy (common) has been revised from Rs 1,815 to Rs 1,868 per quintal, while grade-A paddy will be bought for Rs 1,888 as compared to last year’s Rs 1,835 per quintal.With no CCL, farmers question moveFarmer unions across the state, however, have questioned the Centre’s move to advance procurement.“The Centre is yet to announce the CCL for the state procuring agencies. The farmers who have brought early varieties to grain markets have to wait longer for their payments,” said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).The unions believe that the decision is aimed to quell protests launched by farmers against the Central government over farm ordinances.“The Centre wants farmers to get busy in the harvesting process to end the controversy over the ordinances. But we will continue our struggle and 31 farmer organisations will go ahead with our rail roko programme across the from October 1 onwards,” said Darshan Pal, state president, Krantikari Kisan Union.Farmer leaders said the Centre was attempting to play divide and rule politics among farmers by projecting that the MSP and mandi systems would continue.“However, it is other way round with implementation of these bills as both the mandi system and MSP will be abolished,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/crops-not-ready-in-parts-of-punjab-as-paddy-procurement-begins/story-iRf18OmnksGZZGedCm2EiL.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||‘He asked for interview, I agreed’: Devendra Fadnavis on meeting Sanjay Raut||Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday asserted that the BJP has no intention of joining hands with the Shiv Sena or to bring down the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government.Talking to reporters here, Fadnavis claimed people of the state are “unhappy” with the performance of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and it “would collapse due to its own inactions”.The senior BJP leader also said his meeting with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday, which prompted speculation in political circles, was regarding an interview for the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.The Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP last year after the Maharashtra Assembly polls over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party then joined hands with the NCP and the Congress to form MVA government in the state.“We have no intention of joining hands with the Shiv Sena or to bring down the government. When it falls on its own, we will see,” said Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the state Assembly.“My meeting with Raut had no political connotations.He asked me for an interview to ‘Saamana’, to which I agreed.But, I had put my conditions- like the interview should be unedited and I should get to put my own camera during the interview. So we met to discuss its nitty-gritties,” he said.Meanwhile, Raut, who also spoke to reporters here separately, said he and Fadnavis are not enemies and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was aware of the meeting which was pre-planned to discuss the interview schedule.However, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam criticised Raut, alleging that he was in a hurry to grab headlines.“When that happens, political careers end. This is not my ill-wish for Raut, but a reality,” the former Mumbai Congress chief told PTI.Nirupam, who has been sulking since his removal from the post of Mumbai Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year, said if the party is serious about opposing the new farm bills passed by Parliament,it should first ask the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra to spell out its stand.The Congress and the NCP say they will not allow implementation of the new laws in Maharashtra, while Chief Minister Thackeray hasn’t uttered a word on it, he said.“The Shiv Sena supported the farm bills in the Lok Sabha,while it staged a walkout from the RajyaSabha when other opposition parties were demanding a vote on it,” Nirupam said, adding that farmers in Maharashtra are confused (over the state government’s stand).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/meeting-with-sanjay-raut-had-no-political-connotation-fadnavis/story-rNClBybOerYZbpQG87BafP.html
27-09-2020||Pune||Shops selling funeral kits witness dull business||Shops selling kits for final rites (antim-kriya vidhi) continue to witness a dull business even though death rate has increased in the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic.As of Friday Pune district’s death toll was 5,535 as per the state health department. While according to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data the death toll was 3,374. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, the death toll was 1,003.Restrictions due to the pandemic situation and fear in the mind of people are the two major hurdles to the business for people as they are not able to give respected last farewells to their loved ones.“Those patients who have died due to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection are directly cremated in furnaces and relatives not allowed to handle the body. So in such cases, the final rites kits are not required. In case of non-Covid-19 deaths, people are taking kits,” said a shopkeeper on condition of anonymity. He runs a shop of Shamsan fund Committee Pune at Mandai.“These days hardly one-two people come to buy the kits in a week. Earlier, at least three to four people used to come in a week,” he said.Due to the surge in the number of deaths, the administration has increased crematorium centres to 11 from two and now pyre cremation for Covid bodies is allowed.“We have all stock piled up and there has been no shortage of any material but the rush of people remains the same as it was the pre-Covid situation,” added a shopkeeper from Shamsan fund Committee, Pune. However, in cases of burial, the carpet and wooden plank are allowed.“The rate of carpet which was 100 earlier have gone up to Rs 130 now and wood plank which was sold at Rs 300 each has now gone up to 500,” explained Rahima Iqbal Shaikh, who runs Dattu Hakim Clothes and General Store.“Other things like demand for cloth which is also used to wrap the body is also on the decline these days,” added Shaikh.For Shaikh, dealing with customers is also a challenge while maintaining social distance and all other safety norms.“We don’t allow customers to come inside the shop, even the money which we take is sanitised. We can’t keep our shop closed as we provide an essential service,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shops-selling-funeral-kits-witness-dull-business/story-V0v1y9yOGhFwpLsViGWu1H.html
27-09-2020||Pune||People overcome fear of virus; start collecting urns with ashes||Initially the fear of Sars-Cov-2 virus which cases the Covid-19 infection had gripped people’s minds so much that they did not even want to collect urns with ashes from crematoriums. However, with pandemic entering into the seventh month and awareness programmes by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have helped people overcome the fear of the spread of the virus and they have started collecting urns which have ashes of the deceased. According to Hindu rituals, ashes have to be immersed post-cremation. “We did a mass awareness drive and explained to people that after the body is cremated at a temperature of 650 to 750 degree Celsius, the virus does not exist. People took time to understand, but now people collect urn with ashes without any fear,” said Arun Jangam, body disposal officer, PMC. During March and April, the situation was so grim that people did not visit crematorium for last rites as a result of which PMC staff had to carry out cremation along with post-death rites. Inability to perform after-death rituals for departed loved ones due to curbs compounded the pain of many families during the Covid pandemic as urns containing ashes piled up in crematoriums across the city. From July, people have started visiting crematoriums while also collecting urns containing ashes of deceased who died due to Covid-19 or non-Covid reasons. Along with the fear of the virus, rumours regarding the effects of the virus made things worse for people. “Explaining to people when they are already grieving made things hard for us. Few agreed in one-time explanation while others needed it repeatedly,” added Jangam. In the cases where the complete family is suffering from a virus, the urns with ashes are kept in the lockers with the name label. “After cremation, we keep track of urns with ashes, and after it is delivered to relatives, an entry is made in the register,” added Jangam. “We are praised by the society for the work which we are doing,” added Jangam. Ashish Patil, whose grandmother died due to virus collected ashes after 14 days since the family of four was home quarantined. “It was safely kept in a locker and after my quarantine period was over, I collected it. In hard times PMC is doing a good job,” added Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/people-overcome-fear-of-virus-start-collecting-urns-with-ashes/story-5MYQcKHDxYXPCIH3ukDwFM.html
27-09-2020||Dehradun||Twin protests in Uttarakhand on Monday over farm bills and labour issues||Amid the widespread protests by farmers against the recently passed agriculture bills in the Parliament, the Opposition Congress will hold a protest march towards the governor house on Monday. The march to be led by state unit president Pritam Singh has been organised on the call of the national leadership. Singh, while lashing out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, said, “The bills passed in the Parliament by sidelining all the parliamentary procedures have just exposed the anti-farmer face of PM Modi.” “With those anti-farmer bills, PM Modi’s eyes are now on the crops grown by the farmers with their sweat and blood. He now wants to hand over them to capitalists in the country,” said Singh. He accused the government of “caging crores of farmers in the hands of a few capitalists for which the government is working”. Meanwhile, the labour unions in the state are also up in arms against the Centre and state government over the decisions pertaining to labour reforms, taken in the last few days. Many unions have planned protests on Monday, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Bhagat Singh. Dinesh Tiwari, president of state industrial development corporation of Uttarakhand limited (SIDCUL) and labour sanyukt morcha, a labour rights body in US Nagar district, said that they will hold a protest on Monday. Also Read: Over 70 hot springs identified in Uttarakhand and HP for power generation“The governments at both the Centre and the state have taken decisions against the labourers amidst the ongoing pandemic. On the pretext of ease of doing business and boosting the economy, they have taken decisions which are completely against labourers,” said Tiwari. “On Monday, members of the labour union which includes 65 other small labour unions in the state will take a pledge to protest against these anti-labour moves. We won’t sit idle, and raise our voice,” he said.Secretary, centre of Indian trade union (CITU) Uttarakhand, Lekhraj (only uses first name) too, lashed out at the BJP led governments and said, “They are working for the capitalists by strangling the labourers and marginalised class.” “We are making a strategy to soon hold a large scale state-wide protest against the government over the labour issues,” he said. Also Read: Pullout won’t help SAD in state polls: Sukhdev Singh DhindsaThe BJP however, termed the Congress’s decision to hold a protest march as a mere political gimmick. “They are just misleading the farmers and provoking them to protest. They never thought of working for the welfare of the farmers and now when our government is working for them, they can’t tolerate it and are misleading the farmers with such protests and marches,” said BJP state vice-president Devendra Bhasin. On the protests planned by labour unions on the labour reform decisions, he said, “The decisions taken by the state and Central governments in that regard is to end the exploitation of labourers which was going on for the last 70 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/twin-protests-in-uttarakhand-on-monday-over-farm-bills-and-labour-issues/story-GhexS2tJ4b4x2aZ82yj08J.html
27-09-2020||Pune||Tests go down despite rising Covid cases in Pune||Pune city has been recording rising number of Covid positive cases over the past month. Even though the tally of fresh cases is unrelenting, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not increased the number of swabs being tested each day. Pune’s positivity ratio has also gone up to 30%, which was around 23% during the first week of August. This means for every 100 people tested, 30 turn out to be positive. While experts believe that with each case, the number of contacts and infectivity rises. However, the PMC claims that it is following all ICMR protocols for testing and that due to lesser movement, fewer people come in close contact with the positive patient. According to the data from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) health department, the average positivity rate during September for the city stands at 30.58% with 5,924 average tests conducted in 24 hours for which 1,749 new positives were recorded. The city saw its highest positivity rate of 61.21% on September 7, which was a Monday and included pending test reports of Sunday, a public holiday. On that day, Pune witnessed 2,053 new positives - 1,144 through RT-PCR and 909 through rapid antigen detection kits - and 3,354 samples were collected. Compared to September, PMC conducted more tests - in the range of 6,000 to 7,000 - during the Ganesh festival. This took the August average testing to 5,643. The positivity rate stood at 23.50% for August. Experts say that with every new positive case, further contact tracing would lead to more number of cases. Dr Abhijit More, state co-convener of Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, said, “Such a high positivity rate only means that there is a high prevalence of the infection in the area. About 30% of the samples of those tested are positive. To break the chain it is necessary that every contact is tested. The civic body should increase testing through rapid antigen detection kits even though there could be false negatives, at least those who test positive must be isolated properly. Also, the civic body refuses to provide a soft copy to all the patients to give them assurance and reduce panic among patients. Otherwise, if the patients are not assured they would not help in contact tracing which is crucial in containing the spread of the virus.” Additional commissioner Shatanu Goel, said, “We are trying to utilise maximum capacity of testing. However, the maximum capacity of RT-PCR for government labs in Pune is 1,950 per day and private labs is 3,000-3,500 per day. We are also using rapid antigen detection kits for about 1,500 samples, but we cannot do too many tests due to the technical aspect of it. We are testing about -4 high risk contacts for every individual which again is subjective to if the contacts are symptomatic or asymptomatic.” The ICMR guidelines, according to Goel, state that asymptomatic contacts should be tested on 5th and 10th day only if they show symptoms. “Most of the patients are isolated at homes as more cases are being reported from societies and when we inquire them for contact tracing they only report about their family members who are tested as per the guidelines,” he said. Goel also said that there is less movement of people as most private offices are shut and people venture out only to get groceries or vegetables for only a few hours. He also added that there is no shortage of staff, but only the limited capacity of testing in various labs is restricting the number. “Pune is definitely one of the highest testing cities in the state and one of the highest in the country too, when it comes to tests per million. We are also talking to government labs including NIV, Sassoon and IISER and also private labs to increase testing capacity for the city,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tests-go-down-despite-rising-covid-cases-in-pune/story-0A2jUDlcKLcAMnzZSyfaTM.html

She was admitted to the facility on August 29 and was discharged on September 5. However, the family was not informed about the discharge, according to her mother. The parents alleged that it was the responsibility of the hospital to inform them about the release. Instead, they had met with misinformation about the discharge date of the woman.“We had spread the information and description about her. A friend of a distant family member was passing through the ghats in Pirangut when they came across her while she was along the road.

27-09-2020||Chandigarh||Pullout won’t help SAD in state polls: Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa||Pressure from farmers forced Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal to pull out of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), but the move would not help the party in the assembly elections, SAD (Democratic) chief and rebel Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa said on Sunday.“Punjab reacted strongly to the new farm bills and criticised SAD’s role in the government. Besides, when Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union ministry the Badals also did not expect it (resignation) to be accepted. The SAD chief was under pressure and had no other option,” Dhindsa said.The decision, however, would not help the party in the upcoming state assembly elections,” he added.The veteran Akali leader said he would not support any political party until the farmers’ demands were fulfilled. However, he said he would try to forge an alliance with regional parties instead of the BJP to save the federal structure.“Farmers are our priority. We will fight for their rights. The federal system has been damaged in India. I will talk to the regional parties for a political alliance instead of the BJP or Congress for more powers to states,” he added. SAD has ruined Punjab: Sangrur BJP chiefMeanwhile Sangrur BJP chief Randeep Singh Deol slammed the SAD, saying the Akalis had ruined Punjab during their 10-year rule.“Punjabi youth were known for their health but the Akalis brought drugs. The sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib took place during their regime. We will ask our senior leadership for a quick probe in old cases and investigations in other cases against the SAD,” Deol added.SAD spokesman Winnerjit Singh Khadial said that the party quit the alliance for Punjab’s interests but the BJP made anti-farmer policies. “We quit the alliance for a reason.

27-09-2020||Pune||Construction company partners booked by Pimpri-Chinchwad police for duping two of ₹60 lakh||Two separate cases were registered by Pimpri-Chinchwad police on Friday against three people of a construction company for duping people with a false promise of flats in an under-construction building in Thergaon.The cases were registered based on a court order issued by a local judge under Section 156(3) of code of criminal procedure to do so.Complaints in the respective cases were lodged by Vishal Sampat Khude (38), a resident of Venunagar in Wakad, and Sandeep Kashinath Kardile (37), a resident of Thergaon, according to police.Khude had paid ₹28,80,000 in 2016 while Kardile had paid ₹30,00,000 in 2017 to the construction company.“We have registered the case based on the court order. It appears to be a small project of six-seven flats. No other person had come forward yet. The accused are partners in the construction company,” said assistant police inspector Tanaji Bhogam of Wakad police station who is investigating the case.Two separate cases under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention) and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal code along with Section 13 of Maharashtra Ownership of Flat Act, 1963 were registered at Wakad police station against the three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/construction-company-partners-booked-by-pimpri-chinchwad-police-for-duping-two-of-60-lakh/story-K7GTG9o5Eqp82flTIDMquL.html
27-09-2020||Pune||Pune police yet to collect ₹50 crore fine from traffic violators||The Covid-19 situation has impacted the fine collection drive of Pune traffic branch as only ₹8 crore has been recovered from the total amount of ₹41.48 crore, including unpaid fines from previous years, between January and September 15 this year. The traffic branch has taken action against 12.80 lakh vehicles for different violations in 2020. The pandemic situation left the staff to shift focus from managing vehicular movement to Covid-19 related tasks. Some were also tasked with the responsibility of issuing challans for violations of coronavirus-related regulations In 2019, the traffic police had issued 27.59 lakh challans amounting to fine of ₹111 crore. However, the recovery had been around 55 per cent, traffic branch officials said. Towards the end of 2017, the traffic police had unpaid dues, including backlog, of ₹18.40 crore. A total of 673,982 violations were recorded in 2017. In 2018, of the total unpaid violations of 2017, 15,778 violations were paid for and the unpaid amount was reduced by ₹38.50 lakh. However, the unpaid dues stood at ₹15 crore from 658,204 violations. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the traffic police carried out special drives to collect unpaid dues from traffic violators through “nakabandi” (barricades) application, which helps to instantly know if a person has traffic violation cases registered against his or her vehicle. The e-traffic police track violators through traffic policemen deployed on the city roads as well as CCTV camera system which feeds live updates to a control room at the traffic department at police commissioner’s office through its 1,200 cameras. The unpaid dues are majorly from CCTV camera cases as police personnel can collect fine immediately. However, the CCTV system notifies the violators through SMS facility on their mobiles. During the tenure of the former Pune police commission K Venkatesham, the e-challan system was extensively used to collect fines. Since the CCTV cameras have been linked with the e-challan system, a rise in traffic violations was recorded. However, there has also been a pendency of fine recovery since the introduction of the system as offenders do not pay penalty despite sending SMSes and reminders, a traffic official said. In February 2019, the traffic control branch had released a list of 100 vehicles with the most pending traffic violations recorded by CCTV cameras and e-challan machines and digital system. The traffic police had stated that the details of vehicles and the owners found violating the traffic violations repeatedly and not paying fines would be uploaded on punepolice.gov.in and punetrafwatch.com websites and on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. DCP Prasad Akkanouru could not be reached for his comments. His office informed that the DCP had proceeded on training course. Additional commissioner (admin ) Sanjay Shinde when contacted replied that he would be revert with the details. According to a traffic official, recovery from local vehicle owners in an uphill task despite sending SMSes and reminders. Joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve said, “Will be able to comment only after checking the details.” Caught on the wrong side of the law Pune traffic police have been unable to recover fines as violators do not respond to SMSes and reminders, and lockdown restrictions due to coronavirus pandemic. 2020 Violators: 12.80 lakh Fine collection backlog: ₹41 crore Total fine: ₹49.48 crore Recovery: ₹8 crore 2019 Violators: 27.59 lakh Fine collection backlog: ₹50 crore Total fine: ₹111 crore Recovered: ₹61 crore 2018 Violators: 7 lakh Fine collection backlog: ₹15 crore Total fine: ₹30 crore Recovered: ₹15 crore 2017 Violators: 6.73 lakh Fine collection backlog: ₹13 crore Total fine: ₹19 crore Recovered: ₹6 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-yet-to-collect-50-crore-fine-from-traffic-violators/story-yzopbEQSgC8ipSQxi3z35O.html
27-09-2020||Pune||Four people trying to buy an educational society in Konkan duped of ₹15 lakh||A group of four men from Pune were duped of ₹15 lakh by people who offered them help with a loan of ₹10 crore.The police are looking for two people, including a woman, in the case. The two suspects allegedly made the complainant believe in 2018 that they could get the loan approved within 30-45 days for a price, according to the complainant. The dealings began in September 2018 and lasted until July 2020 when the men realised they had been duped, according to their complaint. The money transaction began in March 2019 and ended in April 2019.

27-09-2020||Kolkata||NIA arrests Al-Qaeda operative from Bengal’s Murshidabad||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) authorities have arrested Samim Ansari, a resident of West Bengal’s Jalangi village in Murshidabad district, in connection with a probe into a suspected Al-Qaeda module operating in the state, officials said on Sunday. Ansari was arrested with the help of West Bengal Police’s Special Task Force (STF) from his residence on Saturday and was produced the same day before the chief judicial magistrate, Murshidabad, for transit remand . Also read: NIA announces cash reward for info on NSCN-IM cadres involved in killing of Arunachal MLAOn September 19, NIA teams had conducted simultaneous raids at several locations in central Kerala’s Ernakulam and Bengal’s Murshidabad districts and arrested nine men allegedly associated with a Pakistan-sponsored module of Al-Qaeda. Ansari’s wife Chandtara Bibi said that her husband was innocent. “He used to work as a construction labourer in Kerala until a year and a half ago. He came back home and started selling vegetables at a local market. He had no connection with any terror outfit. He has been framed,” she said. NIA officials said Ansari would be taken to Delhi for interrogation alongside the nine others. “We have found his involvement with those arrested earlier. We have seized his mobile phone. He is being interrogated,” a senior official said.Earlier, the three men arrested in Kerala were identified as Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen while Najmus Sakib, Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun Kamal and Atitur Rehman were arrested from Murshidabad district. Ansari was a friend of Kamal’s, STF officers said. NIA authorities said they came to know about an inter-state module of Al-Qaeda operatives at various locations in India, including Bengal and Kerala. The group was planning to carry out terrorist attacks in Delhi and at vital installations in the country in a bid to kill innocent people, the agency said. NIA authorities are trying to ascertain if the arrested men were recruiting people from other districts in Bengal, especially Birbhum, where gelatin sticks stolen from stone quarries were smuggled in large quantities in recent years. NIA officials said incriminating materials such as digital devices, documents, literature, weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature on making home-made explosive devices were seized from the arrested men.

27-09-2020||Lifestyle||#Viral hula hoop dancer Eshna Kutty: Wanted to show, saree doesn’t limit your moves||Dressed in a saree and sneakers, Delhi-based hula hoop dancer Eshna Kutty recorded a video of herself dancing to the popular song Genda Phool (Delhi-6; 2009), simply out of nostalgia. Little did she know that her #SareeFlow would end up creating waves on social media, making the 24-year-old a Twitter sensation, within hours of joining fellow tweeples! This alumna of Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University is in “disbelief” over the sudden appreciation that has come her way. “I had no idea how far this video would go. It was a practise video I made, dancing to a song I love, and I absolutely wasn’t expecting it to make it to Twitter. I wasn’t on Twitter till a day ago,” says Kutty, who has more than 4k followers within a day or two of her making a Twitter account.  Joining twitter today to find you tweet this is enough motivation to not let #sareeflow fizzle out :) Thank You 🌻 https://t.co/Udm3jLD6JfThe empowerment quotient is what twitterati is loving in the #SareeFlow. “The video combines two things — a saree which is so integral to the Indian society, and hooping that is relatively alien to us,” says the flow artiste, adding, “Our generation is more free with their expression and I wanted to show that a saree, in no way, limits your moves!” And though it’s now that the youngster became viral, but “saree hooping” is something that she has been at since a long time. She has been even teaching hula hooping for five years now! “I’ve been bullied by my friends to perform at weddings in a saree... Actually, I wanted #DesiFlow instead of #SareeFlow (to trend) because I wanted it to accommodate all traditional attires, and want even men to take up this art since hula hooping is still perceived as feminine flow form,” she adds. Homebound like most of us since March, Kutty says her tryst with movement therapy is quite interesting. “I had wanted to pursue both Psychology and dance, but I wasn’t great at the latter. In a gap year that I took after college, while I was feeling my ground, I was acquainted with dance, drama and movement therapy. I pursued it and eventually found myself going back to hooping,” she says, adding that she is completely self taught. “Hooping as a flow art form is relatively new to the world, not just India. I used to watch videos on YouTube about 10 years ago, and play them in slow motion in order to decipher the movement,” she recalls.  Aww this is amazing.Thank you @Namrata_Joshi for sharing this with me.I do have danced wearing a saree n sneakers but this.A Treat to watch her graceful dance with Hoop with such aesthetics #EshnaKutty is amazing.Will have2 learn 2 hoop from her @Rachnakanwar @ndcnn #GendaPhool https://t.co/rkxW5ig5NVAmong the many prominent admirers that Kutty has gained over the last couple of days, is playback singer Rekha Bhardwaj — the original voice behind the song Sarural Genda Phool. “Rekha ma’am reached out to me on social media, and she has expressed her interest in joining my program. It’s just amazing, I’m kind of numb! My friends are elated that it has happened, but they rate my performance as a 4 on 10 for this video. To them, this is my most average video so far! They want more of my ‘real dance videos’ to make it to social media now,” she shares laughing. The hoop instructor, who has been hosting online classes for last six months, says, “I have a few endorsement opportunities lined up so I’ll be looking at those. But for now, I can really just call myself a hoop instructor! All my career hula hoops have been looked at as a child’s play; people would ask me ‘acha hooping is fine, but what do you really do?’. For the first time, I feel validated. This is what I do!” Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/viral-hula-hoop-dancer-eshna-kutty-wanted-to-show-saree-doesn-t-limit-your-moves/story-yv0BpqGDaLFcNcwpC8evgL.html

Earlier, terrorists from Pakistan had tried to intrude on the intervening night of September 14 and 15,” said a BSF spokesperson. Both the attempts were foiled. “Five heavily armed terrorists tried to enter into Indian territory at the dead of night, but were engaged by the alert BSF troops,” said the spokesperson.They had reached close to the IB taking advantage of dense growth of Sarkanda, a variety of wild grass. “The BSF personnel ordered the terrorists to stop, but they started firing at the troops. Pakistan Rangers personnel provided cover fire to these terrorists. However, the alert BSF troops started retaliatory firing at the terrorists,” he said. The terrorists retreated to the Pakistani soil following the exchange of fire.NS Jamwal, inspector-general (I-G), Jammu Frontier, BSF, said, “We foiled another possible infiltration bid of armed terrorists from the Pakistani side, who were well supported by Pakistan Rangers.”He added: “From 11.45 pm on Saturday to 12.15 am on Sunday, the jawans of 173 Battalion deployed at Mangu Chak post in Ghagwal sector observed suspicious movements between pillar number 132 and 133 in the opposite Pakistani post called Pir Bunker.

27-09-2020||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party banking on past record as it readies for UP bypolls||Samajwadi Party has intensified preparations for the forthcoming bypolls for eight UP assembly seats that are being billed as ‘mini-assembly elections’ and is banking on its impressive record in bypolls since 2017.SP had held the two seats of Malhani (Jaunpur) and Suar (Rampur) that will see elections while the remaining six-- Tundla (Firozabad), Bunaldshahr, Naugawan Sadat (Amroha), Ghatampur (Kanpur City), Bangarmau (Unnao), and Deoria were previously held by BJP. In 2018 bypolls, SP won three Lok Sabha seats of Gorakhpur--vacated by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Phulpur, which was vacated by deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya, and Kairana apart from the Noorpur assembly seat.SP ally (Rashtriya Lok Dal) won the Kairana assembly seat. In the 2019 assembly bypolls on eleven seats, SP had been the only gainer, winning three seats. It retained its Rampur seat and gained one each from the BJP and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).“Samajwadi Party did well in the bypolls and it will win seats in the forthcoming bypolls too. People are agitated, and want SP back,” said SP state spokesperson, Rajendra Chaudhary. “We had invited applications for the eight seats. Applications came and now the national president would finalise candidates,” he said. The election commission has declared the schedule for Bihar assembly polls and is likely to soon announce one for UP assembly bypolls as well. “One of the reasons why Samajwadi Party is not contesting Bihar assembly polls is to remain focused on UP bypolls,” said a party leader. Last week SP declared that it won’t contest Bihar polls and will instead support Rashtriya Janata Dal. Also Read: Truck driver arrested for issuing threat to CM Yogi AdityanathSP state president Naresh Uttam Patel has completed a round of virtual meetings with the party outfits and sector in-charges in seven of the eight constituencies. Patel has asked the party outfits in the eight constituencies to take the bypolls, happening ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls, very seriously. “The bypolls are crucial and would have a far-reaching impact,” he asserted.He has also asked the party outfit in the eight constituencies to intensively campaign, both virtually as well as by conducting door-to-door campaigns while maintaining Covid safety protocols.

When people compare the present government’s scorecard with the previous SP led government, they feel cheated by the BJP,” said SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi.Political analyst SK Dwivedi predicts a tough contest between the BJP and the SP in coming bypolls. “Both parties are evenly poised. On Ram temple or China issue, people are with the BJP but on issues like unemployment, price rise, law and order they are against it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/samajwadi-party-banking-on-past-record-as-it-readies-for-up-bypolls/story-lc3Jw6s99SdQIvZMwrKtWP.html
27-09-2020||Delhi||DDA to tweak rules; CGHS housing plots to be auctioned to private developers||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will amend the rules that will enable the agency to auction land to private developers for residential projects, in a proposal aimed at meeting the growing demand for housing in the capital city. The proposal, was approved last year, permits the amendment in the DDA (Disposal of Developed Nazul Land) Rules, 1981.In a meeting chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal in August 2019, the DDA had approved the proposal to auction residential plots meant for allotment to Cooperative Group Housing Societies (CGHS) to private developers. It was a first-of-its-kind effort by the DDA, which is the main developer in Delhi, to allow private players to develop housing in the national capital.Also read: DDA in for a major overhaul, to downsize sanctioned workforce by halfIn January and May, the land-owning agency had advertised for auctioning of seven and nine group housing plots, respectively. The plots were withdrawn from the auction list following an order issued on July 28. These plots were located in areas such as Rohini, Dwarka and Narela, and measured up to three acres or over 5,000 square (sq) metres (m).According to a DDA official, who didn’t wish to be named, “These plots couldn’t be auctioned, as this needs a change in the DDA (Disposal of Developed Nazul Land) Rules, 1981 and Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)-2021.”Nazul land refers to the land acquired by the government that is placed at the disposal of the DDA for development as “approved under various development schemes”. The land-owning agency has to approve a proposal of changing the mode of disposal of Nazul land from allotment to auction by an amendment in the DDA (Disposal of Developed Nazul Land) Rules, 1981.Anurag Jain, vice-chairman, DDA, said that the process to amend the rules is in progress and these plots would be auctioned in November.“There is a need to amend the Nazul rules. We had sent the proposal to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), which had pointed out some changes. We have made these changes and prepared a proposal that will be tabled in the next meeting of the DDA. Once approved, it will be sent to the ministry for notification. We expect to include these plots in the auction slated for November,” Jain said.The idea behind the decision was to gradually allow private developers or CGHS to develop housing projects in Delhi. Private developers, who are allotted land after auctions, will be required to construct housing facilities in keeping with the MPD, 2021, which earmarks 15% of the developed area for people who belong to the economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society.The land-owning agency has not been able to meet the housing needs of the city, despite undertaking large-scale housing projects at Narela, Dwarka and Rohini. Though DDA has been allotting plots to individuals for the construction of houses, it hasn’t given any to CGHS after a fraud was uncovered in the early 2000s.According to a DDA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, only one CGHS plot has been allotted on the basis of court orders since 2005. DDA has allotted 884 plots to CGHS to date.“This land can’t be auctioned until the ministry notified the changes in the rules. But this is a good move, as it will ensure better construction quality and at competitive pricing,” said Sabyasachi Das, former planning commission, DDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-to-tweak-rules-cghs-housing-plots-to-be-auctioned-to-private-developers/story-2H92YuJpRMy5GtimUsYraP.html

27-09-2020||Delhi||World Tourism Day 2020: Delhiites, get back to exploring the heart of the city||Are you too missing packing your bags and going for a holiday? Well, the pandemic has surely turned the travel and tourism industry upside down. Many are grappling with the aftermath of the lockdown, and trying their best to let Unlock bring in some business for them. On World Tourism Day, September 27, we speak to those people in Delhi-NCR whose livelihood has been impacted the most, and how they aim to bounce back. “Our wholesale business is gone, online is the only route,” says Saurabh Monga, the third-generation from his family who has been running Monga Handicrafts Corner in Janpath. Last six months have been one of the toughest periods for their family, like most others in the country. “We used to see foreigners frequent our small shop so often. Now we just open the shop and sit idle all day. There are no sales, or customers,” says Monga, adding, “We had to pay the standard 10% hike in rent inspite of no business during the lockdown. We had to even fire some workers due to lack of funds... Though there are limitations, retail and online sales are the sources of income we will have to eventually depend on. And interstate tourism surely drive our growth.” Can tales from the past help people heal in tough times like these? “Absolutely,” says Asif Khan Dehlvi, founder, Delhi Karavan that organises heritage tour walks. Walk conductors like Dehlvi have been feeling the financial pinch in absence of any business. Busy cooking and tending to his parrots, Dehlvi says, “I didn’t conduct heritage walks online because it felt like we are giving up any hope of things getting normal. After monuments reopened, I started getting requests for walks... since August. But the situation wasn’t conducive. Now, I feel people need fresh air, and stories!” All set to bounce back to the scene in the month of October, Dehlvi adds, “I plan to regroup with my team and start taking socially distanced tours in open areas like Mehrauli Archaeological Park, and Sanjay Van.” Vishal Bhaskar, a Delhi-based tourist guide, says, “Business would have been at its peak in these months, had it not been for Covid-19. Places like the Qutub Minar and Humayun’s Tomb have now started seeing people return to their fold, but many are scared of hiring us because they are unsure of our health and safety. Well, had we been unwell, why would we be at work?” “I used to be on assignments for nine months a year, but since last six months I’ve been at home,” says Bhaskar, adding, “Tour guides across the Capital have taken up safety measures. Socially distanced tours can be undertaken, and we are ensuring all safety measures even in buses run by tour operators such as regular sanitisation, provision of sealed water bottles, sanitisers and wet wipes on seats, etc. Our primary income was from international tourists, but for that to resume we have little hope this year. So locals must get to exploring the city,” Bhaskar concludes.

The two men decided to leave the dhaba, but they were attacked from behind,” the DCP said.Neelesh and Akash -- the two brothers who run the dhaba -- and three-four of their associates allegedly attacked the duo with a big knife, stick and cooking utensils in the street.“The local beat policeman, Damodar, and constable Vijay were passing by on a motorcycle just then. When they heard the commotion, Damodar hopped off the motorcycle and got into the middle of the fight with a lathi in his hand,” the DCP said.Damodar was able to thwart the attack, but not before Gaurav was stabbed multiple times. The policemen, however, held both the attackers.The DCP said that an FIR is being registered in this case and the role of other people seen in the footage is also being verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-lathi-wielding-constable-rescues-man-from-fatal-knife-attack/story-WjRRWs0Z6M4fe8mLWUFfrK.html
27-09-2020||Lucknow||Durga Puja set to be low key in Uttar Pradesh, guidelines awaited||Majority of Durga puja committees across the state of Uttar Pradesh are in a fix about how to celebrate the festival this year in absence of specific directions from the government.Although the state government on Thursday said people should celebrate festivals at their homes as no public gatherings would be allowed, Durga puja committees said they could take a final call only after the government issued clear guidelines pertaining to Durga puja.Many Durga puja committees said they were writing to the district administration to issue guidelines for Durga puja festivities, beginning from October 22 and concluding on October 26 this year.“The government should clarify how Durga Puja rituals will be carried out this year,” said Arun Banerjee, the president of over 105-year-old Bengali Club in Lucknow.Meanwhile, a number of Durga puja committees in Lucknow have decided to go for ‘ghot puja’ (worshipping an urn symbolising the goddess) without any idols of goddess Durga. Also, there will neither be any distribution of ‘prasad bhog’ nor conduct of cultural programmes to avoid mass gathering.“We are waiting for proper guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) from the district administration. However, we have decided that there will be no distribution of ‘bhog’. Nobody will be allowed to get into the Durga mandap. Rituals like Pushpanjali will be held but without flowers,” Banerjee said.Also Read: Political activities gain momentum ahead of bypolls in Uttar Pradesh “Maybe by the month end, we are expecting detailed ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines, following which, we will take a final decision on how to go about conducting Durga puja, which is less than a month away,” he added.Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash said the matter of SOPs pertaining to Durga puja will be looked into. “We will discuss the matter with police too,” he said.Bondhu Mahal Durga puja committee in Lucknow has decided to organise a low-key puja because of the prevailing pandemic.“We have decided to go for ‘ghot puja’ sans any idol of Maa Durga.

Adherence to social distancing norms and other Covid-19 guidelines is mandatory for them, the chief minister said. A maximum of 50 people will be allowed to participate in these gatherings, Banerjee tweeted on Saturday evening.These relaxations were announced ahead of Durga Puja celebrations, which will begin from October 22.On Thursday, Banerjee announced guidelines for the upcoming festival. The pandal needs to be open from all four sides for proper ventilation. Hand sanitisers will have to be mandatorily placed at entry points of pandals, and wearing of face masks will be binding, the guidelines dictated.“To return to normalcy, jatras, plays, open air theatres, cinemas and all musical, dance, recital and magic shows shall be allowed to function with 50 participants or less from 1 October, subject to adherence to physical distancing norms, wearing of masks and compliance to precautionary protocols,” Banerjee tweeted.On the other hand, the ministry of home affairs has so far denied reopening permits to movie theatres that have been shut since the middle of March. However, cinema is a state subject in India.Multiplex and single screen owners have run social media campaigns throughout September in protest against the denial of reopening permits to them. In over six months that the cinema halls have been shut, the Indian film industry has incurred losses of around Rs 3,000 crore, according to the financial daily newspaper Mint. Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases in India neared the six million-mark on Sunday with 88,600 people getting infected with the virus in 24 hours. As many as 94,503 people have died due to the virus in the country.

27-09-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai, Maharashtra by October 2nd week: IMD||One of the wettest-ever monsoons for Mumbai can be expected to withdraw between October 9 and 15 from the state, according to the weather department.The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in June this year, revised the date of southwest monsoon’s withdrawal from Mumbai by nine days. The new withdrawal date is October 9 against the previous one, predicted for September 29. This means the monsoon will linger a bit more than its normal schedule.“Withdrawal from Rajasthan and surrounding areas of northwest India is expected by September 28 onwards. Going by the visible trend, a sharp decline in rain activity over central India can be expected from October second week onwards, and withdrawal over Mumbai first and (then) rest of Maharashtra can probably be expected by mid-October,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD said, “As per our extended rainfall forecast till October 22, there is significant rainfall reduction expected between October 9 and 15, indicative of monsoon withdrawal symptoms. There is a possibility of withdrawal starting around that time.”Independent meteorologists said larger global weather factors were responsible for the marginally late withdrawal over the west coast and central India such as La Niña conditions - a phenomenon when the western Pacific Ocean warms up creating a low pressure area near Australia pulling winds from the Indian Ocean strengthening equatorial dynamics keeping southwest monsoon circulation active.“Unseasonal showers during the first week of October can lead to crop damages along interior Maharashtra that farmers need to be wary about,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP climate studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.Meanwhile, Maharashtra has recorded 18% excess rain so far this monsoon. Among weather stations along the Konkan coast, Mumbai suburbs have witnessed the second wettest monsoon ever with 3,681.4 mm rain between June 1 and September 27.Also Read: Things will get worse before it gets better.

27-09-2020||Kolkata||Bengal BJP’s top guns counter TMC’s offensive on farms bills||A day after the ruling Trinamool Congress’ farmers’ wing hit the streets in protest against the contentious farm bills, Bharatiya Janata Party’s top guns in West Bengal launched a counter offensive against the TMC with a series of public meetings on Saturday. On Friday, members of the Kisaan Khet Mazdoor, affiliated to the TMC, took out protest rallies across the state. A sit-in demonstration was also held in central Kolkata. The Left Front and Congress also took out a joint rally. On Saturday, some senior leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit including Mukul Roy, national executive member, Sayantan Basu, state general secretary, Locket Chatterjee, BJP MP and Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, state vice president among others, held meetings in the districts to clarify on the alleged misgivings on the three farm bills passed by Parliament. “The TMC is spreading all lies. The bills will allow the farmers to sell their products wherever they want and to any person they wish. The TMC, however, doesn’t want this. This is because TMC backed middlemen buy the products from farmers and sell them at exorbitant rates in the cities. The farmers get nothing,” said Sayantan Basu, who held a meeting at Siliguri in north Bengal. West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) helmswoman Mamata Banerjee had earlier condemned the bills and said that the bills would lead to an epidemic comparable to the Bengal famine of 1943 which claimed more than two million lives. Also Read: Dropped in reshuffle, Bengal BJP leader Rahul Sinha says defectors from TMC favouredThe three bills passed by Parliament are the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Centre has asserted that the proposed laws will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income. The Left Front and the Congress had earlier sent a letter to Mamata Banerjee urging her to convene a special session of the state assembly soon to discuss the “anti-worker and anti- farmer” bills. The BJP meanwhile has launched a massive campaign on the social networking and micro-blogging sites to spread awareness on the bills and bust the alleged propaganda of the ruling TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-bjp-s-top-guns-counter-tmc-s-offensive-on-farms-bills/story-Tl2uj3Kh5VP6Gw2tIqIfNN.html

27-09-2020||City||Mumbai’s KEM Hospital starts Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine trial, 3 volunteers administered dosage on Day 1||After days of delay, Parel’s King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital finally on Saturday started the clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccination produced by the University of Oxford. On Day 1, three volunteers between 20 and 45 years of age were administered the first dosage of the drug. According to hospital sources, two of the volunteers are businessmen, while the third is a researcher with a government body. None of them have any comorbidity. They underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to ascertain if they are infected with Covid-19. Their antibody test revealed that they were exposed to the virus. “The volunteers were given the dosage in the afternoon, following which they rested in the hospital for an hour. Later, they were discharged from the hospital, but we will keep a close check on their health,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean, KEM Hospital. “As per randomisation, out of every four participants, one will receive a placebo (false drug),” he said. The hospital has selected 20 more volunteers for the trials. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), each of the volunteers has been covered under ₹1-crore life insurance, in case they die due to any side-effect during the trial. Also, they have been given a medical insurance of ₹50 lakh, in case they develop any adverse effect from the vaccination. The vaccine induces a strong immune response. It provokes a T cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with coronavirus) response within 14 days of vaccination and an antibody response within 28 days. Meanwhile, BYL Nair Hospital has selected three women volunteers for the clinical trial, which is likely to start from Monday. In the second week of September, KEM and Nair hospitals had to halt the trial after a participant developed an adverse condition in the United Kingdom (UK). Later, the Drug Control General of India (DCGI) gave its nod to run the second and third phases of the trial. However, both the civic hospitals had to get the final approval from their ethics committees before starting with the screening of the volunteers. Meanwhile, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume – partnered with British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate, formulated at the University of Oxford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-s-kem-hospital-starts-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-3-volunteers-administered-dosage-on-day-1/story-d4rBBjz8GDjpIAHhkJ1cuI.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Meeting between Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai sparks off speculation||A meeting between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut at a five-star suburban hotel on Saturday sparked off speculation in the political circles over whether the two sides are trying to mend their relations amid the slugfest between the two in the past few months. The meeting assumes significance, as the Sena-led state government is facing flak over the death case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput as well as amid the frosty relationship between the ruling party allies after right-wing trolls have targeted Aaditya Thackeray who is a Sena minister and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s son. The BJP dismissed any political motive behind the meeting. “Sanjay Raut wanted to meet Devendra Fadnavis to take his interview [for Sena mouthpiece] Saamana]. As Fadnavis wanted the interview to be published unedited, the two decided to meet once before the interview work on the modalities. The interview will take place after Fadnavis returns from Bihar,” said BJP leader Pravin Darekar. Raut, a strong critic of the BJP, did not react to the media reports on the meeting. Political analysts have pointed out that there is more to the meeting than what meets the eye. “No one will just meet to discuss an interview. This seems more of a message by the Shiv Sena to its allies Congress-NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) that it still shares good relationship with the BJP,” said political commentator Hemant Desai.Sena and BJP were ruling allies in state till 2019 and contested Assembly polls together. However, the two had differences over sharing the CM’s post after winning the majority. Thackeray then forged an alliance with Congress and NCP to form a government under him. Sena and BJP have been involved in a bitter tussle since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/meeting-between-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-and-bjp-s-devendra-fadnavis-in-mumbai-sparks-off-speculation/story-FYfeMdzDafiTy0WdkPgphJ.html

As defendants (university and senior administrative officers) did not appear, case proceeded ex-parte. And on February 3, 2020, the civil suit was dismissed by the trial court after which she appealed.The court of additional district and sessions judge Rajesh Sharma observed: “There is no reason as to why oral and documentary evidence produced by a plaintiff must not be relied and acted upon. So there was no reason for the trial court to decline relief of recovery along with interest being arrears of salary and security amount lying with the defendants, which has been illegally withheld by them.”The court accepted the appeal, thus setting aside the trial court’s order.The varsity and the administration have been ordered to pay Manhas ₹86,400 at 6% interest per annum from the date of filing the suit till its realisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-court-directs-private-university-to-release-former-professor-s-salary/story-gykCPAwCmgwzKXkUyazXOP.html

27-09-2020||Mumbai||2-year-old boy rescued and returned to mother in Ambernath, 5 held||The Ambernath police have arrested five persons on Thursday in connection with child trafficking and kidnapping case.The five kidnapped a two-and-a-half year old boy from Circus Maidan area in Ambernath and sold him for ₹70,000. The boy’s mother had registered a missing complaint report on September 15. The toddler was rescued by Ambernath police and handed over to the mother.The five accused, which include three women, Puja Shettiyar, (28), Jaynatabi Khan, (33), Sheru Saroj, (45), Mukesh Kharwa, 36 and Maya Kale, 30, are allegedly small-time thieves and drug addicts, claimed the police.The boy, Vikas Mandal, is the son of Vijaya Mandal, 30. She stays in a slum near Circus Maidan. According to police, Kale has a small pan shop in the area and sees Vikas regularly when he used to come and play on the ground near her shop.Shettiyar was the customer to whom the remaining four tried to sell the toddler. She works as a labourer.A police official requesting anonymity said, “As per Shettiyar’s statement, her husband left her three years ago when she was pregnant. She was unwell after her delivery and unable to take care of the baby, so she sold him to someone in Mumbai. Her in-laws recently told her that they were ready to accept her and the child, so she wanted a child around Vikas’s age to show them as her own. In her statement, she told us that she mortgaged her house and could afford to pay ₹70,000 for a child that age.”Shettiyar circulated the message that she was looking for a child. Saroj and Khan, along with Kharwa, devised a plan to kidnap Vikas and took Kale’s help for the same. They took him on September 15 when he was playing outside his house.Senior police inspector, S Dhumal, said, “After the child’s mother lodged a complaint, we conducted a search in the same area. We found no trace of the child. Later, we asked all the auto rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers about the boy. We came to know that Kale was seen with the boy and arrested her and the remaining accused. We also found the boy with Shettiyar, who also resides in Ambernath.”Dhumal said that the accused have being changing their statements constantly and they were still verifying the claim that the baby was taken for Shettiyar, as the police suspect that Shettiyar might be further selling him to someone else.Dhumal said, “All the accused have been booked for kidnapping and child trafficking, and remanded in police custody till October 2.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-year-old-boy-rescued-and-returned-to-mother-in-ambernath-5-held/story-NK8pGieCRk3v6zK3WNTMDM.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||3 dangerous buildings razed in Ulhasnagar||After Bhiwandi building collapsed killing 38 people, the Ulhasanagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) has started demolition of dilapidated buildings in its jurisdiction. On Saturday, the UMC demolished three buildings after the court vacated the stay on demolition of dangerous buildings.The civic body has a total of 153 structures in dangerous condition, out of which 33 are extremely dangerous. All the 33 buildings have been vacated, claimed the authorities. The corporation, on Saturday, had demolished three out of the 33 extremely dangerous structures including Humlog Apartment near Jhulelal Mandir in Ulhasnagar 1, Shanti Palace Apartment behind Yatri Niwas, Ulhasnagar 2 and Om Shiv Ganga Apartment near Venus Lal Chakki Road, Ulhasnagar 4.Ganesh Shimpi, assistant municipal commissioner of UMC, said, “In the first phase, we carried out a demolition of three buildings. After a while, the others buildings will be demolished soon. All the dangerous buildings were given prior notice. Even if the buildings are vacant, the lives of residences in the neighbouring buildings are at risk. Ulhasnagar being densely populated, in case any of the dangerous building collapses, it will risk the lives of people staying nearby.”The UMC had also appealed to the citizens to carry out the structural audit of their buildings at the earliest and carry out the necessary repair work if any.Shashikant Dyma, 52, a social activist from Ulhasnagar, claimed that around 27 to 28 people died in building collapse incidents in the last 10 years. Dyma said, “The authorities don’t take any effort in carrying out a survey of dangerous buildings. If an incident of wall or plaster collapse takes place in a building, only then it is declared dangerous. All the 33 buildings have been declared dangerous for the same reason. No building is declared dangerous on the basis of structural audit.”He alleged that despite the claims of the corporation that all buildings have been evacuated, residents still continue to stay in three or four such structures “as the city does not have transit camps to rehabilitate the residents”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-dangerous-buildings-razed-in-ulhasnagar/story-TXpJoWUMy2HRleBuB9QfVP.html

Upholding an order of the district consumer forum, the commission had directed the institute to pay Rs 1 lakh to a Chandigarh resident.The institute had filed a plea in March arguing that it can entertain petitions in certain categories of cases against consumer panel orders. However, the bench of justice HS Madaan observed that the institute, itself having approached the commission, cannot now say that it lacked jurisdiction. It added that the institute, under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, can approach the national commission.The complainant, Shabnam Khunger, a Chandigarh resident, had approached the consumer forum, stating that she had visited the Sector-9 institute for an eye check-up in October 2017 and was advised a cataract surgery. She was informed about two kinds of surgeries –Phaco or Robolazr – worth Rs 1.49 lakh. For this, she contacted her insurance firm for cashless treatment, but was allowed treatment worth only Rs 48,000 and her claim of Rs 1 lakh was rejected. This prompted her to approach the consumer forum. The insurance firm was of the view that there was no need for a robotic surgery. Hence, the remaining amount was repudiated. The institute had argued that it was the patient who opted for it. The forum had then ordered that the insurance firm was liable to pay the entire amount, and penalised the eye institute for “unfair trade practices” by directing it to pay the complainant Rs 1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-dismisses-eye-institute-s-plea-against-consumer-panel-order/story-GTzDYeGV510rDjzy5FJ91J.html
27-09-2020||Chandigarh||Business gains momentum, but bars in Chandigarh stare at long road to recovery||With the Chandigarh administration’s order allowing local bars to reopen from September 1, their business slightly improved, but owners say they’re only seeing 20%-30% customers of what they used to witness earlier. Proprietor of Pyramid lounge and bar at Elante mall, Sunveer Sondhi, who is also the city head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said, “Clubs are learning how to handle people as per the SOPs issued by the administration. Even if the 50% cap on the number of people inside is lifted, we will still be able to manage the crowd and ensure that social distancing is maintained. It would help us with our business also.” The administration’s decision to allow events with up to 100 people at banquet halls has also been received positively by some of the bar and banquet owners here. President of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association, Ankit Gupta, who also runs Himani’s Vertigo lounge in Sector 35, said, “The opening of banquet halls is good news for the hotel owners. However, no relaxation has been extended to bars. Business is improving, but it is still nowhere near the point it used to be before corona times.” Sector-26 outlets bounce back The Sector-26 market on the Madhya Marg, which houses some of the city’s famous bars, lounges, and clubs, had suffered a major setback during the lockdown. The business, however, has started to flourish again, owners of various establishments say. Inderjit Singh Banga, proprietor of Sector 26’s Prankster and head of NRAI’s Gurugram chapter, said the situation in their market is improving every day. “When we couldn’t serve alcohol, our business dropped to just 10%. But now, it has climbed by 30%-35%. Weekend is the best time for us. We are gradually regaining our confidence,” he added. Director of Social in Sector 7, Manish Goel, who also runs Swagath hotel in Sector 26, said the situation has greatly improved for both these markets. “We have been able to get the youth segment back, but families and middle-aged patrons still avoid visiting us,” he said. However, a bar owner, on the condition of anonymity, said in the absence of proper checks and surveillance, many illegal activities were going on. “In Sector 26, various outlets have started serving hookah, which is not allowed. They have also started hosting live band performances, which are not allowed as per the SOPs. But there is no one to monitor,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/business-gains-momentum-but-bars-in-chandigarh-stare-at-long-road-to-recovery/story-JO1aFSvtrP7m8QpmuJVd7K.html

The overall case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stood at 2.66%, second-highest in the country after Punjab, and much higher than the national rate of 1.59%. Of the 430 deaths on Saturday, 227 were from the past two days, 110 from over the past week and remaining 93 were from the period before it, according to the health department. Across the state, number of cases dropped to 133,161 this week (September 20-26), from 150,250 last week (September 13-19). The fatalities have come down to 2,520 from 3,101. The case fatality rate (CFR), too, dropped to 1.89% this week from 2.06% last week. However, 30,778 fewer Covid-19 tests had been conducted this week. From 6,21,307 tests between September 13 and 19, the number of tests reduced to 5,90,529 in the week ending September 26.Pune remained on top of the daily caseload list by reporting 3,324 cases (1,796 in city, 1,390 in rural parts and 1,138 in Pimpri-Chinchwad) and 90 deaths.Nashik clocked 1,595 new cases and 17 deaths, while the state’s second capital, Nagpur, reported 1,635 new cases and 15 fatalities. Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur, three western Maharashtra districts, continued with high number of cases with 779, 678 and 703 new cases respectively. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) clocked 4,819 (23.6% of total state cases) new cases and saw 110 deaths (25.58% of deaths in the state). On the heels of the spike in Covid-19 cases over the Past few weeks and a day after state crossed its grim 1.3 million mark, Maharashtra crossed the mark of 1 million recovered patients after 23,644 new recoveries were reported on Saturday. At the recovery rate of 76.94%, after the total recoveries of 10,16,450 till date, the state has 2,69,119 active patients across the state. Further, as of Saturday, 158,749 patients have been recovered and discharged post Covid-19 treatment in Mumbai. The city’s recovery rate is 80.75%.

Dharavi’s tally is 3,123, of which 2,662 have been discharged.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held review meetings with officials from various districts with a high number of Covid cases. District authorities were told to strictly implement lockdown norms and personal hygiene protocols. He has also directed district authorities to increase testing and early detection of patients to ensure arrest of the spread and keeping the fatality rate low. “My Family, My Responsibility’ drive is being implemented effectively across the state. This will help us in tracing the patients early and treat them without wasting time. Countries like United Kingdom are witnessing emergence of the second wave of the infection after rolling out unlocking measures. Youngsters have started moving out freely in the process of earning their bread and butter and for their families. This has led to the risk of infection for elderly people at home. The appropriate Covid-19 behaviour, which includes use of masks and social distancing, should be strictly followed. The administration can impose heavy fine for the violations of such protocols,” Thackeray said.Thackeray held review meetings with the districts in Marathwada, Vidarbha and north Maharashtra. The district collectors and municipal commissioners have been directed to increase number of tests and trace high/low-risk contacts of cases early to contain the spread. He said while the state’s test rate per million population was more than 45,000 in some of the districts it is much low. Thackeray had held review meetings with officials from other two divisions — Konkan and Pune — on Friday. “About 93% of the state’s caseload is from 20 districts, which have been identified by the Centre. The districts are being focused upon by the state government. If the cases and fatalities in these districts are arrested, the overall state percentage will automatically improve,” said an official from the health department.Water supply and sanitation minister Gulabrao Patil, who is also the guardian minister of Jalgaon, said that the aggressive tracing of contacts in his district has helped them in treating patients early. “During the ‘My Family My Responsibility ‘drive we have identified 8,000 infected people who are being treated according to the protocol. Our case fatality rate (CFR) has now reduced to 2.47%, which used to be over 6% two months ago and even the caseload has reduced significantly over the past from their doorsteps,” he said. After announcing to increase the daily testing rate to 1.5 lakh, state tested 95,888 samples in last 24 hours with a positivity rate of 21.29%. State has 1,945,758 people in home quarantine, while 30,571 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-case-tally-rises-to-1-321-176/story-52rdzqnmhLIGBoeQm4PffN.html

Around 53% of respondents said they faced breathing problems when wearing masks. As many as 44% said they felt uncomfortable when masked.The World Health Organization has stressed the importance of wearing masks to curb the spread of the virus.The survey was conducted as part of ‘ApnaMask’ initiative by EkDesh, an NGO, and 248 people from Mumbai and Nagpur were interviewed.The survey found 48% of the respondents were not afraid of catching the virus and 42% believed that vaccine was the only solution to controlling Covid-19.As many as 55% of respondents said masks would not control the spread of the virus. The survey found N95 masks were among the preferred ones.The compliance towards wearing masks was the highest among those in the 36-55 age group.In Mumbai, it is mandatory to wear masks at public places. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which was levying fines up to ₹1,000 for violations, brought down the amount to ₹200 recently. The municipal authorities in Mumbai have collected fines worth ₹27.48 lakh from 2,798 citizens, who were found without masks in public places between April 9 and August 31.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a Mumbai-based consultant, said there might be a certain discomfort because of wearing masks while on the move. “But citizens should not forget that until we do not have a vaccine, masking, and social distancing are the only available ways to fight and control the spread of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-survey-finds-over-50-respondents-in-mumbai-nagpur-don-t-feel-the-need-to-wear-a-mask/story-xAcQG0RPAp6nCeRtthWupL.html
27-09-2020||City||Mohali microbrewery fined ₹19,000 for overcharging on liquor bottle ‘served as it is’||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed a Mohali microbrewery to pay a “punitive cost” of ₹15,000 for overcharging on a liquor bottle “served as it is”.“In order to stop this malpractice prevailing in restaurants of charging exorbitant amounts from the consumers by totally ignoring the rules and law, to make huge profits, it is important to put a punitive cost,” ruled the Commission, while disposing of a complaint filed by one Gursharan Preet Singh of Sector 49C, Chandigarh. The fine will be deposited in the legal aid account set up by the Commission.In May 2017, Gursharan had moved the Commission, alleging that The Brewmaster, a microbrewery in Phase 5, Mohali, had “arbitrarily and by adopting unethical practice overcharged the amount over the MRP on the liquor bottle which was served as it is to them”. In April 2017, he had visited the restaurant and ordered a bottle of Black and White whiskey. The MRP mentioned on the bottle was ₹1,364, but in the final bill, he had been charged ₹2,395 for it. He further said that even though he had objected to paying more than the MRP, the manager had forced him to pay the entire bill.In February 2019, a notice was issued to The Brewmaster, but as no one appeared on their behalf, the case had proceeded ex-parte.The consumer commission held that “It is incumbent upon them (The Brewmaster) to charge MRP mentioned on the bottle, since the bottle was served as it is to the consumer. It is not the case that the liquor was served from the bottle in different quantities or served in glasses by opening the same along with other things.”Stating that “putting a punitive cost will send a clear message that restaurant owners cannot exploit consumers”, the Commission also directed The Brewmaster to refund ₹1,031 (difference in the MRP and price charged) along with 12% interest per annum, along with a compensation of ₹3,000 to the complainant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-microbrewery-fined-19-000-for-overcharging-on-liquor-bottle-served-as-it-is/story-HJX4HWvdmDF7lK57kFfjqL.html

According to the information provided by the university, last year 38 students were admitted in the one-year certificate course.The drop in the number of students has pressed the department to offer offline admissions as well. However, on September 26, the last date for admission to the courses in Chinese and Tibetan languages, no new takers showed up.What’s more, not a single application has been received for admission in the certificate course in Tibetan language this year. Last year, 38 students were admitted in the course, which offers 57 seats. Admissions in diploma and advance diploma courses at the department are yet to be carried out.Established in 1964 at PU, the erstwhile Department of Central Asian Studies was renamed ‘Department of Chinese and Tibetan Languages’ in 2003.A faculty member of the department, on the condition of anonymity, said, “There could be various reasons for the drop in students this year, including the delay in admissions. Also, the impression among the people may have been affected due to the worsening ties between India and China.”Dean university instructions (DUI) RK Singla said, “Certificate courses get less response sometimes. Class 12 passouts have a lot of other options as well. We have asked the department to offer offline admissions, too.”On the other hand, the department of French and Francophone studies has received around 400 applications against 200 total seats for admission in the certificate course in French language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-many-takers-for-chinese-language-course-at-panjab-university/story-VUNwYBNRo3A5nQad8uLS8H.html

27-09-2020||Chandigarh||With positive mindset, doctors’ efforts, comorbid patients admitted in Chandigarh are overcoming Covid||Gurpal Singh, 40, returned home after defeating Covid-19 even though he is a patient of diabetes. Though his condition had worsened and he had to be put on oxygen therapy, he said his dedication and resolve to beat the virus proved beneficial.A kidney recipient, Aditya Kaushal, 32, contracted Covid and was admitted, but even with complications, he defeated Covid-19 in 11 days.“Covid-19 started affecting my kidneys and I started having problems in passing urine. When I got admitted into PGIMER, I used to ask doctors if I will survive. They just asked me to keep a positive mindset and it helped. A team of nephrologists continuously monitored me and I recovered in no time,” he said.Dr SK Singh, 55, had also developed pneumonia due to Covid-19 and was shifted to the ICU in a critical condition with oxygen saturation levels decreasing at an alarming rate. He, too, survived and is back to his daily routine.A 13-year-old boy after undergoing heart transplant surgery had also contracted Covid-19. He, too, survived with the standard protocol treatment.Even though patients with pre-existing diseases are at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and developing complications, there are growing examples of how such patients have survived the ordeal.305 comorbid patients admitted at PGIMER At the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), which caters to the critically-ill patients of the region, 305 such patients have so far been admitted who required aggressive treatment in the intensive care units. Of them, 177 have recovered and have been discharged so far, while 27 patients are still undergoing treatment.Doctors treating such patients say the line of treatment includes targeting the existing conditions and strict monitoring of vitals. A management plan for patients is designed, customised to every patient’s needs.Dr GD Puri, dean academics and head, department of anaesthesia and intensive care, said, “Doctors from all specialties take rounds of the Covid-19 wards and treatment is provided to patients as per their comorbidity.”“The target is to keep the vitals in check. Endocrinologists take care of the patients who have diabetes; a team of nephrologists has been deputed for patients with kidney ailments. In a day, 40 doctors from the anesthesia department perform duties in different Covid-19 wards, ICUs, and dedicated operation theatres. Many patients survive due to such efforts,” Dr Puri said.Dr Vipin Kaushal, additional medical superintendent of the Covid-19 hospital, said not just clinically, but patients were also being provided psychological support. “It is team effort that leads to recoveries. We work on patients who develop serious complications and who require mental support as well. In isolation, patients are away from family, so providing extra support is important in such cases,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-positive-mindset-doctors-efforts-comorbid-patients-admitted-in-chandigarh-are-surviving-covid/story-AQHt2P4I7jMKnoS91Tl4QI.html

The polls that were to constitute a new senate, after the term of the present senate ends on October 31, were postponed on August 15 for two months due to the pandemic.Batting for extension in the present senate’s term for smooth running of the varsity and its affiliated colleges, senator Dua in his letter to the V-C has said, “The students and their parents have no proper information. Everything is vague to them. This is due to lack of governance, as no proper meetings of the senate and syndicate are being held.”Permission sought from DC for PUTA pollsThe Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) on Saturday wrote to the deputy commissioner, UT, requesting to expedite the permission for holding the teachers’ body elections at Panjab University.The polls scheduled for September 25 and 26 were postponed by returning officer Vijay Nagpal due to the pandemic.

27-09-2020||Chandigarh||‘Chandigarh needs a parallel private healthcare system’||Dr G Dewan, director, health and family welfare, who retires next week after 35 years of service, spoke to Amanjeet Singh Salyal on Saturday about the challenges thrown up by the Covid-19 outbreak, non-communicable diseases in the city, and his career with the UT health department. Excerpts:How has the health infrastructure in Chandigarh evolved since you joined as a medical officer in 1985?When I joined services in Chandigarh the population was around 3.5 lakh. It’s now estimated at 12 lakh. Thus, there’s need for creating more public health infrastructure as well as services. The Government Medical College (GMCH) came into existence in the late ’90s. Earlier, there was less influx of patients as well as the population from the adjoining states in the UT. The General Hospital in Sector 16 has been upgraded to a multispecialty unit (GMSH). Other healthcare facilities have been upgraded too.It’s felt in the medical fraternity that while the three UT run hospitals are underutilised, PGIMER is overloaded. Your take?You cannot compare apples with bananas. PGIMER is a top-tertiary care hospital with huge responsibility, infrastructure, and workforce. We, too, have our role to play. There is equal burden on every hospital.How have GMSH-16 and GMCH-32 kept pace with new standards in patient care?Upgrading the health sector will always remain a challenge as new technology comes up every day. You have to upgrade it on a timely basis. This in turn helps set a benchmark for keeping up patient care standards. We keep hearing about novel procedures being conducted in UT run hospitals. These are great achievements.What changes in disease patterns and patient loads have you seen as health administrator?Earlier the burden of waterborne diseases was huge. We have improved, but new challenges have emerged in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. We have a huge burden of diabetes in the city. We will have to set up a system to study the patterns of disease and work out how our education and information systems have to be developed for intervention. This will help in the treatment of dengue and Covid-19.Unlike Mohali and Panchkula, Chandigarh does not have private healthcare providers of repute? Is that required?Yes, we need a parallel private healthcare system. Though there are issues regarding availability of land and viability of that industry, it has to be looked at. But, I feel that the public health sector cannot provide top-class living facilities that few patients want. Priority areas of the government health sector in Chandigarh?We need to rethink the model of healthcare delivery through aggressive preventive medical care. The importance of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme has increased manifold. We need to strengthen it to understand the epidemiology of diseases. Outbreaks in future have to be contained quickly.Chandigarh is the country’s best planned city, yet it saw widespread Covid-19 infections. Were there any missteps?I disagree. You cannot treat Chandigarh as an isolated city even if it is planned. We have huge mobility of persons from Chandigarh to the tricity suburbs. The number of infections started to increase as the lockdown restrictions were lifted in phases. However, we have kept infection numbers in check and are seeing a gradual decrease. The ratio of fatalities is less or equal to that of neighbouring states and less than the national average. Our goal is to bring it below 1% from 1.3%.How do you reflect upon your career since 1985?I served in eight different positions in the Chandigarh administration and the municipal corporation during my tenure. I am happy to share that I have ideated in many innovations in the department that focused on improving health indicators.Your post-retirement plans?After the delightful privilege of serving my city, I am passing on the baton to the new generation with a lot of confidence and assurance. This gives me a chance to spend more time with my family and also take up social welfare work in the field of education and health through new forums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-needs-a-parallel-private-healthcare-system/story-I0hUNAhjY2FT35pd8F0TBJ.html
27-09-2020||Mumbai||Maratha outfits turn down Maharashtra government’s decision to extend EWS quota to community, vow to intensify protests||Maratha outfits have decided to intensify their ongoing protest, demanding the restoration of reservation for its community members in jobs and education. Protests will be staged from today onwards in different parts of Maharashtra and will continue into the first week of October. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court (SC) had stayed the implementation of the law granting reservation to Marathas and referred the matter to a larger constitutional bench. Turning down the state government’s decision to bring Marathas under the 10% quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), community leaders have decided to raise the issue politically and stage protests outside residences of members of Parliament (MPs) and legislators. On Saturday, dozens of Maratha outfits under the aegis of Sakal Maratha Kranti Morcha held a day-long conference in Nashik. Among those who spoke were Bharatiya Janata Party MP and Maratha leader Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje; former member of legislative council (MLC) Narendra Patil; Maratha Mahasangh’s Rajendra Kondhare and legal experts. Starting today, Maratha outfits will stage a dharna outside the offices of all prominent political parties in Pune. Between October 5 and October 10, protests will be held outside residences of legislators and at the offices of tehsil and district collectors. Kondhare said, “We have decided to turn down the government’s decision to bring us under the EWS quota as it does not serve any purpose. Our immediate demand is that the state government should immediately safeguard the interest of our youths who have secured admissions or government jobs under SEBC reservation stayed by the top court. Secondly, the schemes which are being shown as earmarked for the community are old ones and meant for other communities too. The state government can add 12% more seats in admissions to secure the quota for students from the community.” Karan Gaykar of Sakala Maratha Kranti Morcha said, “We want MLAs [members of the legislative assembly] and MPs from the state to raise this issue at the appropriate forum by writing to the President, Prime Minister, Governor and chief minister. It is the responsibility of the state and Central government to ensure the stay on the reservation is vacated at the earliest. We are also planning to hold a protest rally in Delhi if we do not get the expected response.” The Maratha community has said the government’s decision to extend the EWS quota to them – announced on Tuesday – to them serves no purpose. The state has also announced other socio-economic schemes that would be made available to the community once Marathas were diverted to the EWS category. State minister Ashok Chavan, who heads a Cabinet sub-committee on the Maratha reservation issue, said the state government is fighting the legal battle and Maratha outfits should appreciate its efforts. “Bringing the community under EWS was the only option readily available before the state government. The community should understand this is a temporary arrangement done by us until the stay is vacated by the Apex Court. The protests cannot be against the government as the decision was given by the court and various Maratha outfits too were interveners in the petition against reservation, which was stayed. We have been taking all the outfits, political parties and their leaders into confidence in our battle. We expect the stay to be vacated by the SC at the earliest,” said Chavan. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act 2018 gives reservation of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions respectively to the Maratha community. On September 9, a three-judge bench of SC stayed the implementation of this reservation for the year 2020-21 and transferred the matter to a five-judge constitutional bench. Following this, on Tuesday, the state Cabinet allowed the Maratha community to be eligible for the EWS quota of 10 %, which was implemented by the Central government last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-outfits-turn-down-maharashtra-government-s-decision-to-extend-ews-quota-to-community-vow-to-intesify-protests/story-s292J0kx3sFTQpERPRYYGL.html

27-09-2020||Delhi||Over 3/4th special educator posts in Delhi MCD schools vacant, HC told||Over 75% posts of special educators — who cater to students with disabilities — are lying vacant in schools run by the Capital’s three civic bodies, according to an affidavit the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) submitted in the high court on Friday. The SDMC — a nodal agency for the recruitment of teachers in the three civic bodies — submitted that 1,192 special educator posts, of the 1,540 notified, in civic body schools are vacant.The affidavit was submitted in response to a contempt petition filed by advocate Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist against the civic bodies and others for not filling up the vacant posts. “After the last hearing, the SDMC had sent requests to the other municipal corporations in order to calculate the amount of vacancies available in the post... it has come to light that there are 1,192 (239 are in east MCD, 561 in north MCD and 392 in south MCD) vacancies to be filled in the post of special educator (primary) in the municipal corporation schools,” the affidavit stated. The north, east and south corporations run 712, 399, and 592 schools respectively for children up to class 5, all of which cater to around 600,000 students. Of these, around 3,500 are students with disabilities.Officials at several schools run by the civic bodies said they have been struggling in the absence of special educators. “The situation has become even more difficult during the Covid-19 lockdown when schools are closed and classes have been shifted online. We can’t expect children with disabilities to study using WhatsApp links and YouTube videos... They need attention, and a regular special educator is required to call them and engage them for some hours every day till schools reopen,” a principal of an east MCD school said. Similarly, principals in schools run by the south and north MCDs said they are facing issues due to the unavailability of an adequate number of special educators. The principal of a south MCD school said, “We do not have any special educator at present, due to which we have to seek help from other schools to help children with disabilities enrolled with us. The contract of the guest teacher who was teaching these children at our school till last March, has also not been renewed as of now.” Alka Shama, additional east MCD commissioner said, “We have already sent the requisition for the vacancies of special educators to the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB). Presently, we have around 70 special educators and we have divided them into the groups according to the need of students. They have been in regular touch of all students with special needs during the lockdown,” she said. The DSSSB conducts recruitment exams for government or civic body run schools in Delhi. The chairperson of the south civic body’s education committee Mukesh Suryan said the contract of all guest special educators will be resumed soon. “We have also sent our requisition for the vacant posts to the DSSSB. We are regularly sending study material to children with special needs and our teachers are also in regular touch with their parents,” he said. A north MCD official, who asked not to be named, said the civic agency has also sent their requisition for the vacant posts to the board. “We also conduct regular training for our other teachers and principals in handling children with special abilities.” Agarwal said the posts of special educators were first created both in MCD and government-run schools in 2011 after a high court order. “It is very sad that till date the posts have not been filled up in civic bodies run schools. Hiring guest teachers or sharing teachers is against the nature of the court’s judgement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-3-4th-special-educator-posts-in-delhi-mcd-schools-vacant-hc-told/story-gwvtAIW1wDsTxmvf20cctI.html
27-09-2020||Delhi||Process to provide 24X7 water to Delhi households has begun: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has begun the process to appoint a consultant to make water available 24x7 to every household in the next five years. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said Delhi consumes 930 million gallons (MGD) of water every day or 176 litre per person per day. This includes water use of all kinds, including industrial, swimming pools, for farm fields and so on, he said. “This is not a lot, but it is not less either. At present, there is no accountability. A lot of water is either stolen or goes waste due to leakages. We are appointing a consultant who would recommend us steps to ensure not a single litre of water goes waste. It would also suggest us the technologies available across the globe to put in place a hi-tech, automated, and real-time water management system,” the chief minister said.  Clean water availability round-the-clock was one of the 10 promises made by Kejriwal in his 10-point guarantee card during the 2020 Assembly elections. “Delhi is the national capital of the country. If you visit any capital city across the world such as London, Tokyo, Paris, you will receive 24x7 clean tap water supply. In Delhi, the water pressure is low and people have to install pumps, and if one person installs a pump, it causes a problem for neighbours. Every household has to install water tanks to store water. We have to bring all of this to an end. Just like the citizens living in the national capitals of other countries receive 24x7 water with full pressure, without the need for a water tank and any water pump, we will do the same in Delhi,” the chief minister said.To enhance the availability of water in Delhi, he said the Delhi government is in talks with “water-rich” states such as Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand to explore the possibility of water-sharing pacts. Kejriwal addressed the concerns raised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which alleged that the decision of Delhi government ‘One Zone-One Operator’ policy is a step towards privatising the DJB. The DJB is a state-run organisation in Delhi. “No privatisation of water is happening, I am myself against privatisation of water. There can be no privatisation of water at any cost,” said the CM. The DJB on Thursday had announced ‘One Zone-One Operator’ policy under which the city will be divided into 7-8 zones and a private operator will be appointed to look into the works in each zone. The decision was taken in a board meeting presided over by Delhi water minister and DJB chairman Satyendar Jain. “After extensive discussions and deliberations at various levels to improve the services and bring efficient management in the water supply and sewerage system, it was decided to award the contracts to private operators for the operation, maintenance, and management of water supply and sewerage networks in various zones of Delhi on the lines of ‘One Zone-One Operator’,” said a statement issued by the DJB on Thursday. “The operators will be appointed for a period of 10 years under the scheme on a contract basis,” it said. Ankit Srivastava, DJB technical advisor, explained that the services are not being privatised and no layoffs will be done within the water utility. Senior officials said the powers of monitoring and supervision will rest with the DJB. “We are still living in old times, where if we have to transfer the availability of water from one area to another, we have to send a valve in those areas. We have a technology in DJB, where one can operate a valve through a remote control sitting in a control room at the click of a button. The central control room has full information on which pipeline and which area has how much water, and full information on the availability of water is available on a real-time basis. This is also called a SCADA system. The consultant will tell us about this technology. Now, we are moving towards providing a 24x7 supply of water to Delhiites,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/process-to-provide-24x7-water-to-delhi-households-has-begun-kejriwal/story-EYsotyRq8v9c2DBhnds7fM.html

The survey for October is likely to get delayed; the report will be submitted in court on the 30th of this month, so it is unlikely we will be able to begin the next round of the survey from October 1. It is likely to be delayed by a week to 10 days,” Jain said during a media interaction on Saturday. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, increased from 29.1% in August to 33% in September, according to the initial findings of the third round of sero survey, as reported by HT earlier this month. The first sero survey of 20,000 people in Delhi was conducted in collaboration with the National Centre for Disease Control between June 27 and July 10 that found 22.9% to have antibodies. The government then announced that a similar survey would be conducted by it during the first week of every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/4th-sero-survey-likely-to-be-delayed-delhi-govt/story-Ziljz64QpxRgdk7882jfBN.html
27-09-2020||Delhi||AAP leaders hit out at MCDs for Green Park gate demolitions||Senior Aam Aadmi Party senior leader Durgesh Pathak and Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti on Saturday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations for demolishing eight gates of the Green Park Extension RWA without any prior notice.“These gates were built by the RWA for the safety and security of the residents. The Delhi police is also under the BJP ruled central government and if the Delhi police was competent enough to secure the residents of the RWAs then there would not have any necessity to build these gates. The BJP-led MCDs could have suggested some other ways to deal with the situation. But instead of taking any constructive measure the BJP just demolished 8 gates with bulldozers,” said Bharti in a press conference. AAP’s Pathak said the Delhi Police should immediately deploy constables on all those gates to secure the area. “No person should be allowed in from those gates without proper ID. If the BJP believes they can continue this destructive attitude across Delhi then they are wrong,” he said.The Delhi BJP said the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) demolished the gates only after receiving multiple complaints from the residents there. “If the AAP feels the gates were wrongly removed, then why wasn’t area MLA Somnath Bharti or AAP’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak present when the action was being taken?” said Praveen Shankar Kapoor, Delhi BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-leaders-hit-out-at-mcds-for-green-park-gate-demolitions/story-YANXWzauRq1wVRs21IC2kI.html
27-09-2020||Delhi||Air quality on the decline in Delhi, expect worse in coming week||Delhi’s air quality has been witnessing a steady dip over the last three days. On Saturday, the city’s air quality index settled at 172, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The overall AQI at 4pm was 172, considered to be in the ‘moderate’ category. On Friday, the average air quality was 134, also in the ‘moderate’ zone. CPCB’s hourly average air quality data, however, shows that from Saturday early morning, pollution levels started rising in the city. Data shows that the hourly average levels have been gradually deteriorating from 152 at 6am to 155 at 7am and then by 12 pm it went down to 169. From 2pm, the levels have remained over 170. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the city at present is getting north-westerly winds from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, where crop stubble burning has already begun. However, since the wind speed has remained between 15-20kmph, the dispersion of pollution particles is happening at a faster rate. “The wind speed has been on the higher side, which is keeping the pollution levels in the ‘moderate’ zone. But in the coming weeks, the wind speed will slow down and with crop residue burning increasing in Punjab and Haryana things are expected to get worse,” said a senior IMD scientist. He said that on Friday and Saturday, around 60 to 70 ‘red dots’, which are symbolic of farm fires, were observed around Punjab and Haryana in satellite imagery. He said most burning instances were seen from the districts of Amritsar and Tarn Taran. Every year at the onset of winters, Delhi’s air quality is severely affected by large-scale stubble burning activities in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. Government data shows that in 2019, 44% of the city’s pollution was contributed by stubble burning. Looking for solutions for this annual occurrence, Delhi, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote a letter to union environment minister Prakash Javdekar, proposing the use of Indian Agricultural Research Institute’s (IARI) innovation, which decomposes the stubble in the field itself and converts it to manure, which can be used by farmers to prepare their fields for the next crop. “Our scientists seem to be have developed an effective solution. I know we are late for this season. But let’s put all efforts to prevent as many fires as we can in the available time,” Kejriwal tweeted. Data collated by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows that on Friday, over 250 cases of crop residue burning were spotted in Punjab. Out of this, nearly 170 cases were from Amritsar. Pawan Gupta, research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said that apart from the smoke from these fires, Delhi is also likely to experience a spell of dust coming in from the west. “Dust transport from the west is also expected to affect the air quality in northern-central India over the next two to three days,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-on-the-decline-in-delhi-expect-worse-in-coming-week/story-KZnqRJPWOu5zAdV2GJM26N.html
27-09-2020||Delhi||Gang rape in Shangri-La: Two more arrested from Andhra Pradesh||Two more persons have been arrested from Andhra Pradesh in connection with the alleged gang rape of a woman in her twenties by five men in front in a room at Delhi’s Shangri-La Hotel on Ashoka Road-Janpath on September 18, the police said on Saturday. With the duo’s arrest, the investigating team has arrested all the six accused persons, including a 33-year-old woman, the police said. Those arrested from Andhra Pradesh were identified by the police as Sri Niwas,50, who works as manager in a pharmaceutical company, and Shekhar Babu,55, who deals in real estate. The duo was caught on Thursday from their respective homes by a Delhi Police team that has brought them to Delhi on Saturday on transit remand, said senior police officers associated with the case. “The hotel room where the alleged gang rape took place was booked in the name of Niwas and Babu. The booking and payment was done by Niwas through a website. The duo had come to meet Manoj Sharma, the alleged prime accused in the case, to get personal loan from him. Like the duo, the rape survivor had also met Sharma for getting a loan of R18 lakh,” said an investigator, quoting the duo’s disclosure statement and requesting anonymity. According to the officer, Sharma was arrested on September 20, a day after the rape survivor filed a case against the five men and alleged that the woman who was in the room had instigated and provoked them to assault her. Two more men -- Sanjay Chaudhary,46, a bailiff in Saket Court, and Jagdeep Singh,60, a businessman – were arrested on September 21. The woman was caught a day later, the officer said. The survivor, the officer said, in her statement to the police said she met Sharma in the first week of September through a common friend. She contacted Sharma on September 18 for a loan of Rs 18 lakh. “The Delhi Police is currently looking into an incident which allegedly took place at the hotel. We are unable to provide any details as this is an ongoing investigation. The hotel is extending its full support to the authorities,” a spokesperson for Shangri-La Hotel had said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gang-rape-in-shangri-la-two-more-arrested-from-andhra-pradesh/story-wgdmeGlL435bnC0pRhuxyH.html

He also demanded an investigation into the lathicharge on farmers during the Pipli rally on September 10.“The farmers were not allowed to express their views on the bills and the government used police force on the protesters. The government is not even ready to admit that the farmers were lathicharged,” he said, while demanding that the government should immediately withdraw the cases registered against the farmers for holding peaceful protests.

27-09-2020||Arts||Homing in on the hate: are pigeons pals or pests?||I’m ambivalent about pigeons. Growing up, I ignored them while neighbours fed hundreds on the pavement. I figured as an adult I’d ignore them as they flew past (and often into) the glass walls of my workplace too. What I didn’t anticipate was how much hate I’d see around me for the bird, how quickly and casually they’d be dismissed as stupid, and how gleefully people would refer to them as ‘sky rats’. Was it always like this? In cave paintings dating from 4500 BCE Iraq, humans seem quite at peace with pigeons. At the Olympics, they still release doves to honour the trained pigeons that once carried race results across Ancient Greece. In 1850, when the news service Reuters was launched, they had on their staff 45 pigeons trained to transmit headlines and stock updates. Britain had a National Pigeon Service during WWII. Before satellites, pigeons flew into enemy zones with tiny cameras. In 2016, American performance artist Duke Riley trained 2,000 of them to fly, their legs fitted with tiny LEDs, in choreographed formation over Brooklyn, for 30 minutes. Scientists are fascinated by them. Pigeons mate for life, co-parent equally and recognise expressions and remember faces for years. They have been trained to play table-tennis, understand space and time (though they’ll still fly into glass windows), and distinguish Monet’s style from Picasso’s. A decade ago, they proved they could be faster than broadband. In one experiment, USB-strapped pigeons flew 100 km to a destination, quicker than data files could be transmitted across the same path. The hate is relatively recent. Combing through a century of news reports, sociologist Colin Jerolmack found that as our cities rose upwards, so did our intolerance for anything that threatened the dream of orderly sanitised urbanisation. In 1966, a New York City parks commissioner called pigeons “rats with wings” and the term stuck. Pigeons are no worse than other birds, just the most visible ‘enemy’. The truth is, they have more to fear from us. Over the last century, North Americans hunted the fleshy passenger pigeon, which once numbered 3 to 5 billion, to extinction. There is a conspiracy theory that we drove all birds extinct. Since 2017, Peter McIndoe’s cult website BirdsArentReal.com has claimed that the CIA eradicated all birds in 2001. What we see now, he claims, are feathered surveillance bots. It doesn’t explain all the poop, but McIndoe has 276k followers on Instagram. A related meme, that the lockdown was a global ruse to get people to stay home so the pigeons’ batteries could be changed, went viral in March. Ours in now a world in which it’s easier to argue that the birds are drones than to get office-goers to stop hating the real thing. What a coo.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/homing-in-on-the-hate-are-pigeons-pals-or-pests/story-MQEUyUEd9tp72PzyWp4mfK.html
27-09-2020||World||Joe Biden has upper hand over Donald Trump in debate expectations game||Democrat Joe Biden takes the stage at the first presidential debate of 2020 on Tuesday staring at an opponent, in President Donald Trump, who has unwittingly done him a big favour -- lowered expectations for Biden’s performance.The president has spent months painting Biden as sleepy, doddering and senile, a move that may have lowered the bar for Biden’s performance in the eyes of many voters who will be seeing him on stage in Cleveland for the first time since the Democratic convention.An even passable performance by the former vice president might come off looking like a win in a debate that has taken on outsize importance after Covid-19 limited the candidates’ in-person campaigning.“President Trump will definitely try to throw the vice president a bunch of curveballs that are designed to get him off his game,” said Jay Carney, who was Biden’s communications director before becoming White House press secretary under President Barack Obama. “The vice president fully expects and is preparing for that and knows that taking that bait is not what he wants to do.”Waiting for GaffesBut if the gaffe-prone Biden stumbles, or looks even a little like the caricature Trump has painted of him, his campaign may be damaged. There are two more presidential debates to go, but first debates -- like first impressions -- have a way of sticking to candidates.A good debate performance by Trump at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland could help revive his faltering campaign. He’s trailing Biden by about 7 points nationally, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Trump, bolstered by his unwavering confidence in his ability to sell himself, has said he’s done little of the traditional preparation for a high-stakes debate. He says his daily back-and-forth with reporters, sometimes two or three times a day, is practice enough.“I think I prepare every day. I think, you know, when you’re president, you sort of see everything that they’re going to be asking,” Trump said in a Sunday interview with Fox News.Trump muddied the waters a little more on Sunday, tweeting a “demand” that Biden take a drug test before or after the debate -- the latest in a series of baseless suggestions that the former vice president’s public appearances have been affected by drug use.But first debates are often a trap for incumbent presidents, who have less time for practice than their rivals, or just aren’t as likely to get worked over in debate prep by loyal and sometimes even fawning aides.Ronald Reagan devastated President Jimmy Carter in 1980 by asking voters if they were better off than they were four years ago. President George W. Bush was criticized for complaining about how hard his job was while debating John Kerry in 2004. Bush’s father, President George H.W. Bush, faced double-barreled attacks from Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot in his first re-election debate in 1992 -- and famously looked at his watch mid-debate. President Barack Obama, one of the Democratic Party’s most gifted orators, was clearly bested in his first debate with Mitt Romney in 2012.Wall Street will be watching. Trump’s refusal last week to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election reinforced moves by traders to hedge against post-Nov. 3 volatility. Assets ranging from currencies and gold to stocks and interest rates are now reflecting an unusual potential for sharp moves around and after Election Day.Covid CampaignsTrump has only resumed his signature campaign rallies in earnest in the last month, staging events at outdoor airplane hangers that hold fewer people than the sports arenas he’s accustomed to filling.And Biden has largely eschewed all but small, tightly scripted campaign events in what his aides say is an effort to abide by best social distancing practices during the pandemic. But that’s exposed him to far less of the usual give-and-take with reporters and the public.Biden, for his part, had fewer campaign events last week, staying home to have aides pepper him with questions and craft responses in person at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and over video conference call. Longtime advisers Ron Klain and Anita Dunn are leading the effort. Dunn’s husband, Bob Bauer -- who served as White House counsel during the Obama administration -- has played Trump in mock debates, according to a person with knowledge of the debate preparations.The Biden campaign believes Trump will be eager to lob insults and spread misinformation, presenting a challenge for anyone debating him. That’s particularly acute for Biden because any verbal misstep by the Democratic nominee offers Trump a chance to pounce.Prepping for AttacksAides have prepared Biden for Trump’s likely attacks on his family, particularly after Senate Republicans last week released a report critical of the former vice president’s son, Hunter, that detailed millions of dollars in transactions and payments that they said came from Chinese businessmen with ties to the Chinese government as well the widow of the former mayor of Moscow. A lawyer for a Hunter Biden denied he had any financial relationship with the former mayor, and the report found no wrongdoing by Joe Biden.Biden has become angry and defensive on the campaign trail when he senses his family is being attacked, including snapping at an Iowa voter in January who asked about his son’s business dealings.“I hope I don’t get baited into getting into a brawl with this guy,” Biden said at a fundraiser earlier this month. “It’s going to be hard, because I predict he’s going to be shouting.”Trump has been honing his attacks through an accelerated campaign schedule over the past week where he often riffs at length about his Democratic challenger.After the debate, Biden is looking to match some of Trump’s frequency of campaign appearances, embarking on a train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, marking his first multi-day swing since March, according to a person familiar with the candidate’s travel plans.Setting ExpectationsTrump may be doing more preparation than he’s letting on. The president has had a phalanx of campaign aides accompany him on his recent trips around the country, and enlisted former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie – who played Hillary Clinton in Trump’s mock debates in 2016 – for additional assistance.Trump aides have studied Biden’s previous debate performances – including two prior vice presidential debates -- and briefed Trump on how Biden has consistent answers to certain questions he’s honed over decades of time in Washington.And the Trump campaign has lately changed course on setting expectations, portraying Biden as a veteran debater thanks to a lifetime in politics.“He was in the Senate for three decades, where all they do is debate,” said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. “He debated twice as vice president and by all accounts he won those debates. During the primaries he was in 11 debates and managed to defeat two dozen challengers. He’s a guy who knows his way around the debate stage.”But attempts by Trump’s campaign to raise expectations for Biden have been largely foiled by the president, who keeps up his drumbeat that the 77-year-old former vice president is unable to function without a Teleprompter.Debate StrugglesBiden’s team has also played the expectations game, saying that for the vice president, a key challenge will be to absorb the personal diatribes the president is planning to unleash.Biden allies also acknowledge he at times struggled during the Democratic debates, stumbling over his words or failing to parry attacks, like when Senator Kamala Harris, now his running mate, eviscerated him in a primary-campaign debate for his past stance on busing children to racially integrate schools.And Biden’s team has tried to coach him not to get too caught up in trying to fact-check Trump, according to a person familiar with the campaign’s thinking. They worry too much time spent debunking Trump will take away from Biden’s opportunity to present his vision for the country. They expect moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News to do the fact-checking so Biden doesn’t have to.“Debates don’t reward folks who speak in complete sentences and long paragraphs,” Carney said. “They really reward one-liners and insults and zingers.”Still, the former vice president has made clear he expects to best Trump.“He doesn’t know how to debate the facts,” Biden told MSNBC in an interview that aired Saturday. “He’s not that smart. He doesn’t know that many facts. He doesn’t know much about foreign policy. He doesn’t know much about domestic policy. He doesn’t know much about the detail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-has-upper-hand-over-donald-trump-in-debate-expectations-game/story-oIre6LKRo5U2xWc59LgP9H.html

And I believe we can come to an agreement.”Formal talks between Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows aimed at hammering out a relief package broke down on Aug. 7 with the two sides far apart. Pelosi and Mnuchin have since spoken by phone.With formal Covid-19 relief talks stalled for weeks, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal on Thursday said Democratic lawmakers were starting to draft a bill totaling at least $2.2 trillion. Pelosi on Sunday said it was “definitely a possibility” that she would offer legislation in the coming days if the impasse with the Trump administration continued but said she would rather have a deal with the White House than a “rhetorical argument.”Any legislation the Democratic-led House might approve would be unlikely to advance in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.Pelosi and Schumer had originally sought a $3.4 trillion relief package but have scaled back their demands. Meadows has previously said that Trump would be willing to sign a $1.3 trillion bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-democrat-expresses-hope-deal-can-be-reached-with-white-house-on-covid-19-relief/story-I83Z5b5kGhAzkNQJ8p328K.html
27-09-2020||World||Judge plans to decide on TikTok US app store ban by end of day||A US judge in Washington said he plans to decide later on Sunday whether to block a Trump administration order banning Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download.US District Judge Carl Nichols said after a 90-minute Sunday morning hearing that he plans to issue a public order later in the day. The Commerce Department TikTok app store ban is set to take effect at 11:59 p.m. EDT (0359 GMT).John E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued during the hearing that the ban was “unprecedented” and “irrational.”“How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations underway that might make it unnecessary?” Hall asked during the hearing. “This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.”US officials have expressed national security concerns that personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China’s Communist Party government.ByteDance said on Sept. 20 it made a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee US operations. Negotiations continue over the terms of the agreement and to resolve concerns from Washington and Beijing.The deal is still to be reviewed by the US government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).The Justice Department said a preliminary injunction allowing Americans to continue downloading the TikTok app would be “interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.” On Sept. 19, the Commerce Department delayed the ban to give the companies an additional week to finalize a deal.TikTok argues the restrictions, amid rising US-China tensions under the Trump administration, “were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by politicalconsiderations relating to the upcoming general election.”A separate set of restrictions are set to take effect Nov. 12 barring other transactions with TikTok that would effectively ban the app in the United States, the company said.Another US judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect on Tencent Holdings’ WeChat app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-plans-to-decide-on-tiktok-us-app-store-ban-by-end-of-day/story-mpUGiioyWzOf847Zd6sfkI.html
27-09-2020||World||Strong govt policies needed to build traveller’s confidence: Experts||Coronavirus-hit travel and tourism sector needs strong government policies to tap opportunities in the new normal, industry experts said on Sunday. Experts suggested that short vacations and holidays nearer to home are likely to be in trend post Covid-19. They called for uniform protocols across states to attract domestic tourists and tap those who go out of the country. “This is the time that we need to look at the policies, which would help build the tourism sector post Covid-19. So, we have to adapt to it and build our policies in the new normal,” Maharashtra Principal Secretary - Tourism, Excise and Civil Aviation - Valsa Nair Singh said at an online interaction on the occasion of the World Tourism Day. “We think this is the time when we need to consolidate all the infrastructure. We are identifying destinations, where we need to strengthen the infrastructure work,” she said. The Maharashtra government has come up with the Beach Check and Agri Tourism policy, she said during an online interaction organised by the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Now when you look at the post-COVID trends, you find that short holidays and holidays are nearer to your home. They are going to be the ones who will have to sustain the sector. So, the state’s coastline, the rural tourism and Agritourism will be more about incentivising farm stays and rural homestays exit tracks. “We are making an opportunity out of COVID by developing sustainable tourism, with destinations that are safe and that are not congested,” she pointed out. United Nations World Tourism Organisation Director Technical Cooperation and Silk Road Development Suman Billa said the UNWTO estimates that international tourist arrivals this year is likely to drop. “What this means in number is that we are going to see one billion less travellers, in terms of tourism exports we are going to see USD 1 trillion less. And in terms of job losses, which is the most important indicator, we are going to see something like 100-120 million job losses on account of COVID,” he said. Therefore, there is a need to think of a business plan and a business proposition for the new reality in order to navigate space success, he opined. “I think there is going to be a shift towards more meaningful experiences, and which means that the market will redefine the products. Those who are able to redefine and cater to the changing consumer preferences are those who are likely to survive,” he added. He said in India every state has their own protocols, and even people do not know what to expect from some states. “So, the first thing that we need to do is to harmonise all protocols. Make it productive and make it predictable so that a tourist when he travels should know what is to be expected,” he opined. Further, he suggested that there should be a limited approach by focusing on some key destinations. “It’s very difficult for us to say that all the country is safe. I think the important thing for us to do is to cut your cloth according to your coat, pick up a few key destinations, and work backwards to make them completely safe, and if we succeed, that experience can be used to ramp up in other destinations,” he added. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) president Gurbaxish Singh Kohli said the Indian industry to be very resilient and can always find an opportunity given in the crisis. “Survival is right now the most important factor in this. Right now, we know that the consumer confidence is at an all-time low and our focus must be on how to regain the trust of consumers. We must be first ready to survive, and then be ready for when that trust comes in,” he said. As there are lockdowns in many places, long haul travel is not going to happen, he said, adding that short travel or road travel, where one can travel by road by car in 2-4 hours is going to be the industry’s focus for the time being. “There is a need to focus on tapping those who go out of the country if we can do that it will be a win-win situation,” he added. India Cruise Lines Association Chairman and Jalesh Cruise Mauritius Chief Executive Officer Jurgen Bailom said there’s a lot of positive to take out of this unfortunate situation, and a lot of learning, a lot of great ideas, a lot of new technology, a lot of new things which we can do better in the future and help the industry. “We work very closely with the government and we are extremely excited to get started again. And I’m all for Incredible India. I think India is a beautiful country, I believe most of the Indians did not see their own country. You have the third-largest coastline in the world. And I think there are great opportunities to come out,” he added.

27-09-2020||World||Diminished response by ‘killer’ T cells behind high mortality rate in elderly Covid-19 patients: Study||Elderly patients face a higher risk of severity and death than younger patients due to COVID- 19, and new research, comparing the immune response among age groups, may help explain the reason why?Older patients with the disease have lower frequencies of the immune cells needed to expel the virus from the body, the researchers found. The study was published this week in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.“Elderly people have more severe diseases compared to young people, and we found that the cytotoxic part of immune control is not as efficient to respond to the virus in older people,” said virologist Gennadiy Zelinskyy, Ph.D., at the University Hospital Essen, in Germany, who also led the new study.He and his colleagues analysed blood samples from 30 people with mild cases of COVID-19 to observe how T cells, which are necessary for recognition and elimination of infected cells, respond during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient ages ranged from the mid-20s to the late 90s. In all patients, the investigators found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infections led to lower numbers of T cells in the blood of the patients, compared to healthy individuals.This reduction has been one of many unwelcome surprises from COVID-19, said Zelinskyy. Most viruses, once inside the body, trigger an uptick in the immune system’s expansion of T cells. These include “killer” T cells, which play a critical role in eradicating virus-infected cells. They produce cytotoxic molecules that destroy infected cells in the body. But if a person’s immune system produces fewer of these T cells, said Zelinskyy, it will be less successful at fighting off a viral infection.In the COVID-19 patient group studied by Zelinskyy and his colleagues, the researchers similarly found that the number of CD8+ T cells producing cytotoxic molecules in response to virus diminished with increased age, and that reduction was significantly higher, on average, in patients over 80. Moreover, the “killer” T cells from patients aged 80-96 produced cytotoxic molecules at a lower frequency than similar cells from younger patients.The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to cells in the nose or mouth. From there, it may spread to the lungs and move on to other organs, triggering a life-threatening infection. “Cytotoxic T cells really fight for control during this acute phase of infection,” Zelinsky said.If an elderly patient’s immune system produces fewer killer T cells, and these cells are inadequately armed, he said, they may be mounting an insufficient defence against SARS-CoV-2. The viral particles can continue to spread and, as a result, the infection worsens.The new data suggest that cytotoxic T cells play a key role in the control of early infections, but Zelinskyy cautioned that it’s too soon to know if that connection can be harnessed to design effective immunotherapy that uses these cells. In previous studies on viral infections in mice, his group found that a checkpoint inhibitor --immunotherapy that activates killer T cells and effectively releases the brakes on the immune system -- improved virus control at first but had the potential to later cause damage to the lungs and other organs. Further studies are warranted, he said, to better understand the potential risks and benefits of interfering with T cells as a way to control SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diminished-response-by-killer-t-cells-behind-high-mortality-rate-in-elderly-covid-19-patients-study/story-JYAtF8Q7eWxYbAPLErb5XN.html
27-09-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden prepare for first presidential debate. Here’s how||Ahead of the first debate-stage matchup between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, each campaign is promising a stark contrast in policy, personality and preparation.Trump has decided to skip any formal preparation. And while Biden’s team believes the significance of the debate may be exaggerated, the Democratic nominee has been aggressively preparing to take on the president.Biden’s campaign has been holding mock debate sessions featuring Bob Bauer, a senior Biden adviser and former White House general counsel, playing the role of Trump, according to a person with direct knowledge of the preparations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Bauer has not actually donned a Trump costume in line with Trump stand-ins from previous years, but he is representing his style and expected strategy.“I’m sure the president will throw everything he can at (Biden). My guess is that they’re preparing for that -- bombarding him with insults and weird digressions,” said Jay Carney, a former aide to Biden and President Barack Obama.“I think it’s an important moment — I think it’s really important for President Trump, because the direction of this election has been pretty stable for a long time now, and he needs to shake it up as any candidate would who’s behind,” Carney added. “The question is, can that work?” Trump and Biden are scheduled to meet on the debate stage for the first time Tuesday night at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. The 90-minute event moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace is the first of three scheduled presidential debates. Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, will also debate in October.For some, the debates represent the most important moments in the 2020 campaign’s closing days, a rare opportunity for millions of voters to compare the candidates’ policies and personalities side-by-side on prime-time television. Trump has been trailing Biden in the polls for the entire year, a reality that gives the president an urgent incentive to change the direction of the contest on national television if he can.Others, including those close to Biden’s campaign, do not expect the debates to fundamentally change the race no matter what happens, given voters’ daily struggles with the pandemic and the economy. They also point to high-profile debates in past elections thought to be game-changing moments at the time but that ultimately had little lasting effect.Those with knowledge of Biden’s preparations suggest he will not take the fight to Trump if he can avoid it. But on Saturday, at least, he was on the attack when he discussed his strategy on MSNBC.“I’m prepared to go out and make my case as to why I think he’s failed and why I think the answers I have to proceed will help the American people, the American economy and make us safer internationally,” Biden said, arguing that Trump won’t persuade voters with broadsides because “the people know the president is a liar.” He also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler’s propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, saying, “He’s sort of like Goebbels. You say the lie long enough, keep repeating, repeating, repeating, it becomes common knowledge.” Biden said he doesn’t expect Trump to articulate a detailed vision for a second term.“He doesn’t know how to debate the facts, because he’s not that smart,” Biden continued. “He doesn’t know that many facts. He doesn’t know much about foreign policy. He doesn’t know much about domestic policy. He doesn’t know much about the detail.” While Biden has said he will try to be a fact checker of sorts on stage, the Democrat is being advised to avoid direct confrontations and instead redirect the conversation to more familiar campaign themes of unity and issues that matter most to voters: the economy, health care and the pandemic.“Arguing over facts, litigating whether what he’s saying is accurate, that is not winning to Biden,” said Jen Psaki, a former Obama aide who is close to Biden’s team. “This is an opportunity to speak directly to the American people. His objective should be to speak directly to them, but not be pulled in by Trump. That is hard.” Trump has not been doing any formal preparation, according to aides and allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.No set has been constructed and aides refused to say whether anyone is playing Biden. Trump, instead, has maintained that the best preparation is doing his day job — particularly his frequent and often contentious interactions with reporters. White House aides also scheduled an ABC town hall earlier this month to expose Trump to real voter questions for the first time in months in preparation for the second debate.Privately some aides and allies are worried that Trump’s lack of formal preparation will lead him to fall into the same hubris trap as other incumbents in their first general election debate. Obama, for example, famously struggled in his first matchup against Mitt Romney in 2012.But other Trump backers are confident that the president is ready to handle any tough questions or pushback from Biden.“The debates matter,” said Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president’s daughter-in-law. “Donald Trump certainly did a great job on the debates (in 2016) and I think this will be no different.” Lara Trump also seemed to simultaneously raise and lower expectations for Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-prepare-for-first-presidential-debate-here-s-how/story-IYLyIFdlbAfS8YozEEVtzH.html

A six-year-old boy reportedly cotracted the microbe and died earlier this month. According to reports, the boy, Josiah McIntryre, got infected by water of that area. The residents were strictly asked not to use tap water except for flushing the toilet. Naegleria fowleri, the microscopic amoeba, can cause a deadly infection in the brain. The amoeba enters the body through nose and from there, it travels to the brain. Josiah’s mother, Maria Castillo, said her son died at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston on 8 September, and that doctors told her the cause was the brain-eating amoeba, NBC News reported.The areas affected include Lake Jackson, Freeport, Angleton, Brazoria, Richwood, Oyster Creek, Clute, and Rosenberg. However, the warning was later lifted from the other places except Lake Jackson.The contamination of US treated public water systems by the microbe is rare but not unheard of. According to the CDC website, the first deaths from naegleria fowleri found in tap water from treated US public drinking water systems occurred in southern Louisiana in 2011 and 2013. The microbe also was found in 2003 in an untreated geothermal well-supplied drinking water system in Arizona, as well as in disinfected public drinking water supplies in Australia in the 1970s and ’80s and in 2008 in Pakistan.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brain-eating-microbe-residents-of-texas-asked-not-to-use-tap-water/story-gaEdAOFayxt55LRyugb4HK.html

Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians, declared martial law and mobilised their male populations. Armenia said Azerbaijan had carried out an air and artillery attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan said it had responded to Armenian shelling and that it had seized control of up to seven villages, but Nagorno-Karabakh denied this.The clashes prompted a flurry of diplomacy to prevent a new flare-up of a decades-old conflict between majority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan, with Russia calling for an immediate ceasefire and Pope Francis leading calls for talks.Pipelines shipping Caspian oil and natural gas from Azerbaijan to the world pass close to Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia also warned about security risks in the South Caucasus in July after Azerbaijan threatened to attack Armenia’s nuclear power plant as possible retaliation.Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, after thousands of people were killed and many more displaced, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.In Sunday’s clashes, Armenian right activists said an ethnic Armenian woman and child had been killed. Azerbaijan said an unspecified number of its civilians had been killed. Nagorno-Karabakh denied a report that 10 of its military were killed. Armenia said Azeri forces had attacked civilian targets including Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital, Stepanakert, and promised a “proportionate response”.“We stay strong next to our army to protect our motherland from Azeri invasion,” Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan wrote on Twitter.Azerbaijan denied an Armenian defence ministry statement saying Azeri helicopters and tanks had been destroyed, and accused Armenian forces of launching “deliberate and targeted” attacks along the front line.“We defend our territory, our cause is right!” Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, said in an address to the nation. International diplomacyRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country has mediated between former Soviet republics Armenia and Azerbaijan, spoke by phone to the Armenian, Azeri and Turkish foreign ministers.Turkey said Armenia must immediately cease what it said was hostility towards Azerbaijan that will “throw the region into fire”, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter that Ankara would continue to show solidarity with Azerbaijan.Erdogan urged the Armenian people to “take hold of their future against their leadership that is dragging them to catastrophe and those using it like puppets”.France also urged the sides to end hostilities and immediately restart dialogue. The pope appealed to Armenia and Azerbaijan to resolve their differences through negotiations, saying he was praying for peace.At least 200 people were killed in a flare-of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in April 2016. There are frequent skirmishes and at least 16 were reported killed in clashes in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-disturb-peace-in-south-caucasus-brings-nagorno-karabakh-back-in-focus/story-rdEwcgr3gN98dyS0GIKq1O.html

A ceasefire was agreed in 1994, but both sides accuse each other of attacks.Turkey has traditionally backed Muslim-majority Azerbaijan.Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Armenia must immediately cease what he called hostility towards Azerbaijan that could “throw the region into fire”.Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Armenia had violated international laws by carrying out attacks and accused it of being “reckless”. “We believe this conflict can be resolved through peaceful negotiations, but the Armenian side has shown no interest so far other than continuing to occupy parts of Azerbaijan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-azerbaijan-clash-turkey-s-erdogan-voices-support-for-baku/story-1Q38nkTIsfDjdPP0Gwvk5H.html

27-09-2020||World||Afghan Sikhs, Hindus leave their birthplace as threat from Islamic State rises||Afghanistan’s dwindling community of Sikhs and Hindus is shrinking to its lowest levels. With growing threats from the local Islamic State affiliate, many are choosing to leave the country of their birth to escape the insecurity and a once-thriving community of as many as 250,000 members now counts fewer than 700.The community’s numbers have been declining for years because of deep-rooted discrimination in the majority Muslim country. But, without what they say is adequate protection from the government, the attacks by the Islamic State group may complete the exodus.“We are no longer able to stay here,” said a member of the tiny community, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Hamdard, out of fear he may be targeted for speaking out. Hamdard said seven relatives of his, including his sister, nephews, and son-in-law were killed by Islamic State gunmen in an attack on the community’s temple in March, which killed 25 Sikhs.Hamdard said that fleeing his homeland is as difficult as leaving a mother behind. Still, he joined a group of Sikhs and Hindus who left Afghanistan last month for India, from where they will eventually move on to a third country.Although Sikhism and Hinduism are two distinct religions with their own holy books and temples, in Afghanistan the communities are interwoven, having been driven into a kinship by their tiny size, and they both gather under one roof or a single temple to worship, each following their own faith.The community has suffered widespread discrimination in the conservative Muslim country, with each government “threatening us their own way,” said Hamdard, whose home was seized by warlords after the U.S. invasion in 2001, forcing him to live in one of two Sikh temples in the Afghan capital of Kabul.Under Taliban rule in the late 1990s, Sikhs and Hindus were asked to identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, but after a global outcry, the rule was not enforced. Also driving the exodus is the inability to reclaim Sikh homes, businesses and houses of worship that were illegally seized years ago.Hindu temples in Kabul’s old city were destroyed during brutal fighting between rival warlords from 1992-96. The fighting drove out scores of Hindu and Sikh Afghans.Aside from the March attack by IS gunmen, a 2018 Islamic State suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad killed 19 people, most of them Sikhs, including a longtime leader who had nominated himself for the Afghan parliament.“Suffering big fatalities for a small community is not tolerable,” said Charan Singh Khalsa, a leader of the Sikh community living abroad, who declined to say where he was living out of fear for his safety. He left Afghanistan after his brother was kidnapped and killed in an attack by gunmen in Kabul two years ago. He said the last three years have been the worst period for all Afghans, but especially so for Sikhs and Hindus.Community leaders have slammed recent governments for failing to step up security in the face of the IS threat.Afghanistan’s government in 2010 decided to dedicate a chair in the national assembly to religious minorities, and there have since been two Sikh representatives.But Khalsa called these posts “symbolic”. He criticized the government for taking too long to grant political representation powers to the community and for failing to “provide security to our places of worship.”A senior Sikh community leader told The Associated Press that the group is in negotiations with the government over its security needs and the repairing of the temple after it was destroyed in March’s attack. The community leader spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media.At a press conference last month, President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said that members of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu community will return once peace is restored. The president’s office did not respond to a request for comment from the AP, but other Afghan officials have pledged to assist the community.“We will use all our facilities to provide security to the people,” Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said, without elaborating. “We are committed and responsible for their (Sikhs and Hindus) mental and personal security.”It is not clear what kind of security measures are being discussed, nor when they might be seen on the ground.Until then, the community’s flight is accelerating, with large numbers of Sikhs and Hindus continuing a recent trend of seeking asylum in India, which has a Hindu majority and a large Sikh population.In August, a group of 176 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus went to India on special visas. They were the second batch since March, with the first 11 members arriving in India in July.Khalsa said that a group of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Canada and European countries has volunteered to sponsor the exodus of those remaining in Kabul who cannot afford air tickets and temporary accommodation in a transit country.Several Canadian legislators have asked the country’s immigration ministry for a special program for Afghan Sikh and Hindu refugees, requesting that they be brought to safety in Canada amid the increasing security threat.For Afghan Sikhs, the thought of being uprooted is painful, despite the circumstances.“It’s hard to leave our birthplace but we have no other option,” said Hamdard. “Afghanistan does not want us anymore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-sikhs-hindus-leave-afghanistan-as-threat-from-islamic-state-rises/story-XFX1KBBAqZREkmfzzNm7YL.html

27-09-2020||World||Joe Biden maintains national lead over Donald Trump in two polls||Former US Vice President Joe Biden held a lead over President Donald Trump among potential voters nationally, according to two polls conducted in the past few days.In a poll by the Washington Post and ABC News, Biden had a 10 percentage point advantage over Trump. Biden’s lead was eight points in another survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College.In the Washington Post poll, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris had 54% support among likely voters compared with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at 44%. Among registered voters, Biden had a 53% to 43% lead. The margin is statistically unchanged from the 12-point gap in the Washington Post and ABC’s August survey, which was taken before both parties held their conventions.Biden is ahead of Trump by 65% to 34% among the women surveyed, while 55% of men polled supported Trump compared with 42% for Biden, according to the report. The poll was conducted by telephone Monday through Thursday among a random national sample of 1,008 US adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.In the New York Times poll, the former vice president was leading Trump 49% to 41% among likely voters. Women favored Biden by 53% to 37%, while the candidates were tied among men, both at 45%.A total of 950 likely voters were polled between Tuesday and Thursday for the New York Times/Siena College poll, which had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, the report said.Both surveys were conducted after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but before Trump’s nomination of federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Saturday. Biden led Trump by eight points on the question of who was more trusted to handle the next appointment to the Supreme Court, according to Washington Post and ABC.The same question had Biden leading over Trump by 50% to 43% in the New York Times/Siena poll, with 56% thinking the next justice should be appointed by the winner of the upcoming election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-maintains-national-lead-over-donald-trump-in-two-polls/story-AS6srMazPg1DvmK1QLra5I.html
27-09-2020||World||Donald Trump’s choice of Amy Coney Barrett may not sway female voters he lacks||President Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett is poised to give the Supreme Court its most conservative female justice in history but is unlikely to accomplish the one thing that could help seal his re-election -- a new surge of support from women, a segment of the electorate his campaign has struggled to attract.Trump on Saturday named Barrett to replace the liberal jurist and feminist icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, fulfilling his pledge to nominate a woman.The difference between the two women’s views couldn’t be more stark: Ginsburg was a champion of preserving a woman’s right to an abortion, while Barrett says abortion is “always immoral” and has already ruled as a circuit court judge to restrict the procedure.If the Senate confirms Barrett, which is likely given its Republican majority, the pick keeps the court’s gender balance at six men and three women. Barrett would be the only woman on the court’s conservative wing.The move poses a risk for Trump. Since Sandra Day O’Connor became the first woman on the court almost 40 years ago, the reaction to Barrett’s appointment and polling data suggests women are looking at a nominee’s potential rulings and judicial record as much or more than her gender.Conservative women who oppose abortion rights are already in Trump’s camp, but they are a small minority of women voters. Surveys show that very few women, if any, are going to switch their support from Democratic nominee Joe Biden based on Trump’s choice of a female jurist. Instead, there are signs it could actually drive Democrats to polls.Republican activists say their voters are eager to hear Barrett’s voice from the bench. Barrett’s appointment “energizes the very same voters, the women voters, that are faithful Catholics and evangelical and encourages them to once again return Donald Trump to the White House,” said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America.But with the election just more than a month away, Trump’s campaign was hoping a female nominee could attract some new women voters, especially in the suburbs.“For Donald Trump to win, he needs to close that gap with women,” said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who founded Republican Voters Against Trump. The White House seems to think nominating a woman will help them with women voters, she said.“What they don’t realize is that it may actually backfire on them because a lot of these suburban women that they need actually won’t like the idea of somebody who is very far right ideologically taking Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court.”Most women don’t support Trump. A national poll by Quinnipiac University released Wednesday showed 58% of women backed Biden, while 38% backed Trump -- a 20-point gap that amounted for the entirety of Biden’s overall lead. Among men, Trump and Biden were essentially tied at 47% to 46%.Even in Republican states whose voters largely support Trump, it’s women who cut into his lead. Biden leads Trump among women by 10 points in Georgia, 14 points in Iowa and 8 points in Texas, all states where Trump leads overall, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released last week.Ginsburg’s death just sharpens that divide, given that most women say they don’t believe Trump should fill her seat at all.A CNN poll found 65% of women believe the winner of the November election should fill the seat, compared to just 52% of men. Women were also more likely to say that Trump’s appointments have “changed the court for the worse.”Democrats and progressive groups have seen a surge of donations since Ginsburg’s death and will portray the nomination as a threat to abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ rights.The Supreme Court vacancy is more motivating for Democrats, said Nancy Zdunkewicz, a Democratic pollster with Change Research.“The conventional wisdom that the politics of Supreme Court vacancies are more motivating for conservatives -- this is not what we see in the data,” she said. “It’s not in the data, not even kind of. It’s looking more important for suburban white college-educated women who are liberal.”Polls have shown that 70% of women oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, a number that has steadily risen over the years.Biden is capitalizing on those numbers, warning that allowing Trump to pick Ginsburg’s replacement threatens not only the Affordable Care Act, but “women’s health,” widely seen to mean abortion rights.“I think Amy Coney Barrett, her record is going to be a big driver of Democratic engagement in this election -- and so is the interest in protecting Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s legacy,” said Shaunna Thomas, cofounder of UltraViolet, a feminist advocacy group.Ginsburg became the nation’s second female Supreme Court justice when President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1993. She was the court’s only woman from 2006, when O’Connor retired, to 2009, when Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined the court. Justice Elena Kagan was confirmed a year later.Barrett’s confirmation would guarantee that the court will have at least three female justices for the foreseeable future. The court could get a fourth if Biden wins and keeps his promise to nominate a Black woman if he gets the opportunity.Until now the biggest skeptics of reproductive rights on the court have all been men. In 2014 when the court ruled 5-4 that companies can refuse on religious grounds to offer their workers the free birth control promised under the Affordable Care Act, five men were in the majority and all three female justices dissented.Now Barrett is likely to join the conservative bloc on the court, comprised of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, all Republican appointees. She will be a new face for originalism, which focuses on the original meaning of the Constitution’s words and casts doubt on Roe v. Wade.“I’m excited about having a constitutionalist, originalist woman on the court,” said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, which backs Trump’s judicial nominees. “This will be our first originalist woman, and it illustrates the breadth and diversity of opinions among women in the law, and I think that’s a great thing for Americans to see.”Barrett, a Catholic mother of seven, wrote in a 1998 law review article that abortion and euthanasia “take away innocent life” and that abortion is “always immoral.”Barrett could be just as valuable a role model to young women as Ginsburg was and that serves a broader purpose than Trump’s re-election, Nance said.“There was a lot being said about Ruth Bader Ginsburg being a role model for women and I would agree with that -- but I would say there’s never been a conservative woman justice. So we are very eager for there to be a role model for our daughters,” Nance said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-choice-of-amy-coney-barrett-may-not-sway-female-voters-he-lacks/story-4clUcVCZWYvrGuE3YTHwqL.html
27-09-2020||World||French president says longtime Belarus leader ‘must go’||France is stepping up the pressure on Belarus’ longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko, with President Emmanuel Macron telling a prominent French weekly that “Lukashenko must go.”The European Union said Thursday it does not recognize Lukashenko as president of Belarus because of large-scale protests by Belarusians who question the results of last month’s presidential election that Lukashenko claims he overwhelmingly won. Opposition members and some poll workers in Belarus say the vote was rigged.Ahead of a trip Monday to Lithuania and Latvia, Macron was quoted in Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche newspaper as saying “it’s clear that Lukashenko must go.”“What’s happening in Belarus is a crisis of power, an authoritarian power that can’t manage to accept the logic of democracy and is clinging on by force,” the newspaper quotes Macron as saying.In a speech Saturday to the virtual UN General Assembly, Belarus’ foreign minister warned Western nations against interfering or imposing sanctions over the country’s disputed presidential election and the government’s violent crackdown on protesters.Thousands of Belarusian citizens have taken part in huge rallies since the Aug. 9 election, which they say was rigged in favor of Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years and just took a secretive oath of office for a new term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-says-longtime-belarus-leader-must-go/story-AKsLfDnO3Cj0TxnE5ouO5O.html
27-09-2020||World||‘If coronavirus doesn’t kill us, climate change will’: Leaders to UN||In a year of cataclysm, some world leaders at this week’s annual United Nations meeting are taking the long view, warning: If Covid-19 doesn’t kill us, climate change will.With Siberia seeing its warmest temperature on record this year and enormous chunks of ice caps in Greenland and Canada sliding into the sea, countries are acutely aware there’s no vaccine for global warming.“We are already seeing a version of environmental Armageddon,” Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said, citing wildfires in the western US and noting that the Greenland ice chunk was larger than a number of island nations.This was meant to be the year “we took back our planet,” he said. Instead, the coronavirus has diverted resources and attention from what could have been the marquee issue at this UN gathering. Meanwhile, the UN global climate summit has been postponed to late 2021.That hasn’t stopped countries, from slowly sinking island nations to parched African ones, from speaking out.“In another 75 years, many ... members may no longer hold seats at the United Nations if the world continues on its present course,” the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries Group said.The main goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord is to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, but scientists say the world is on track to soar past that. A new study found that if the world warms another 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the West Antarctic ice sheet will reach a point of irreversible melting. It has enough water to raise global sea levels by 5 meters (16 feet).The Pacific island nation of Palau hasn’t had a single Covid-19 infection, but President Tommy E. Remengesau Jr. warns it’s the rising seas that will bring the country down.“The momentary drop in (carbon) emissions this year cannot be allowed to generate any complacency about global progress,” he said, referring to the sparkling skies that followed lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus around the world. Pollution has crept back up as restrictions ease.World powers cannot shirk their financial commitments to fighting climate change during the pandemic, Remengesau said, even as economies are battered.But few pledges have emerged at the UN gathering, aside from China’s announcement that it aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.The pandemic has muted the UN meeting, with world leaders speaking not from the podium in New York but via video from home. That has sapped the urgency of diplomacy and left nations wondering just how many people are listening.Amid concerns that the world is distracted, it was perhaps no surprise that the student-led movement Fridays for Future returned to the streets this week for the first major demonstrations for climate action in months.Still, island nations have seized on the unusual circumstances to show off what’s at stake.The prime minister of Tuvalu, Kausea Natano, delivered his UN speech with a vista of turquoise waters and swaying fronds behind him that instantly fired the imaginations of house-bound viewers.But the prime minister quickly shattered any dreams. While Tuvalu is free of the coronavirus, the pandemic struck as the island nation was recovering from a pair of tropical cyclones — storms that scientists say are likely to become wetter as the planet warms.Tuvalu’s highest point is just a few meters (yards) above sea level. The pandemic’s effect on the movement of goods exposed food insecurity as local agriculture becomes more difficult with rising sea levels, Natano said.“While Covid-19 is our immediate crisis, climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the Pacific and its peoples in the long run,” the prime minister said.From the Marshall Islands, also free of Covid-19, President David Kabua used the virus’s example to plead for more help now.“Change relies on protecting the most vulnerable, because those on the frontline – whether healthcare workers battling the pandemic or small island nations sounding the alarm on climate change – are critical to the survival of us all,” he said.“Small island and atoll nations like mine do not have time for paper promises,” Kabua added.Urgent pleas also came from Africa, which contributes least to global warming but stands to suffer from it the most.“In favoring solutions based on the respect for nature, we’re also preserving the health of our peoples,” said President Issoufou Mahamadou of Niger, part of the Sahel region south of the Sahara desert where temperature increases are expected to be 1.5 times higher than the world average.“Our global home that was teeming with millions of species of God-given creatures, both great and small, is slowly dying,” said Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who last year noted that his country was the only one in Africa to reach the goal of making renewable energy 75% of its energy mix.He added: “Our world is yearning for us to stop its ruin.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-coronavirus-doesn-t-kill-us-climate-change-will-leaders-to-un/story-yXWHJp7gcAWQr3VDTszhSI.html
27-09-2020||World||Late night protest in Portland, Oregon, declared unlawful||Law enforcement declared an unlawful assembly late Saturday, forcing protesters from downtown Portland, Oregon, and making several arrests, just hours after demonstrations earlier in the day ended without many reports of violence.Hundreds of people were gathered downtown in Oregon’s largest city when the unlawful assembly was announced just before midnight by the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office.Images showed protesters crowded in and around a park near the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse — the same courthouse that had been the scene of nightly unrest over the summer. A protester was seen burning an American flag.Earlier, protesters had shot fireworks at police. Video posted by KOIN-TV showed officers warn that protesters who hurl projectiles will be subject to arrest.Several arrests were made, according to reporters at the scene, but a specific number was not immediately available.The unrest came just hours after a right-wing rally and counterprotesters largely dispersed without serious violence. Although, police were investigating an assault after one person who was documenting the event was pushed to the ground and kicked in the face.Separately, police said a criminal citation was issued after officials confiscated firearms, paintball guns, baseball bats and shields from a pick-up truck that was initially stopped for having obscured license plates as it left the rally.Oregon State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton and Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese praised the minimal violence in a joint statement late Saturday.“Our Unified Command worked well to prevent violence before it started,” Hampton said in the statement. “Law enforcement officers performed a number of traffic stops and took weapons off the streets.”“On Saturday, Oregonians denounced hate, racism and violence,” Reese stated, adding that, “the Unified Command was able to help keep the peace.”Several hundred people, dozens of them wearing militarized body armor, gathered to support President Donald Trump and his “law and order” reelection campaign Saturday afternoon. The attendance was far fewer than the 10,000 organizers had expected after tensions boiled over nationwide following the decision not to charge officers in Louisville, Kentucky, for killing Breonna Taylor.Organized by the Proud Boys, a group that has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the rally was described as a free speech event to support Trump and police and condemn anti-fascists and “violent gangs of rioting felons” in the streets.Local and state elected officials condemned the event and rushed to shore up law enforcement ranks as left-wing groups organized several rallies to oppose the Proud Boys’ message. About 1,000 counter-protesters gathered at another park.The events began at noon and were largely dispersed by 3 p.m.The rally came as Portland has seen nearly nightly protests since the police killing of George Floyd in late May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/late-night-protest-in-portland-oregon-declared-unlawful/story-itDo6DgsL0ZJNK0yAnHiuK.html

The 48-year-old judge is Trump’s third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh.“This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, and it is a very proud moment indeed,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. Barret, in response to her nomination, said that he had no illusions that the road ahead of her was easy, adding that she had never imagined to find herself in this position.  “I assure you that I will meet the challenge with both humility and courage,” she added.Here is all you need to know about the US President’s pick:• Judge Amy Coney Barrett has been on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017, also as a Donald Trump nominee. According to Trump, she is one of the US’ ”most brilliant and gifted legal minds”.• Her appointment in place of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will give conservatives a 6-3 majority at the US Supreme Court and will provide a boost to Trump’s re-election effort. The majority on the Supreme Court is likely to last a long time and ensure an enduring legacy for Trump.• Barret, 48, will become the youngest justice on the court if confirmed. • She was instrumental in getting a ruling thrown out that blocked an Indiana law that would make it harder for a minor to have an abortion without her parents being notified, according to news agency Associated Press. The Supreme Court ordered a new look at the case after her intervention.• In a dissent in 2019, Barrett argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun. According to AP, Barrett wrote that “while both Wisconsin and the United States have an unquestionably strong interest in protecting the public from gun violence, they have failed to show, by either logic or data that disarming Kanter substantially advances that interest.”• In the same year, she wrote a unanimous three-judge panel decision making it easier for men alleged to have committed sexual assaults on campus to challenge the proceedings against them.• Barret’s ideological mentor was late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. • She would be the sixth justice on the nine-member court to be appointed by a Republican president, and the third of Trump’s first term in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-all-you-need-to-know-about-donald-trump-s-recent-nominee-to-us-supreme-court/story-6zOyV30YA3nsThGpfeol5K.html

Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan also said Armenian forces hit three Azerbaijani tanks. Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnically Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan that has been out of Azerbaijan’s control since the end of a war in 1994. Both sides have heavy military presence along a demilitarized zone separating the region from the rest of Azerbaijan. Stepanyan said the fighting Sunday began with an Azerbaijani attack, but Azerbaijan said the Armenian side attacked and that Azerbaijan launched a counteroffensive. The news was harshly received in Turkey. Turkey’s ruling party spokesman Omer Celik tweeted: “We vehemently condemn Armenia’s attack on Azerbaijan. Armenia has once against committed a provocation, ignoring law.” He promised Turkey would stand by Azerbaijan and said, “Armenia is playing with fire and endangering regional peace.” Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin also took to Twitter, condemning Armenia. “Armenia has violated the ceasefire by attacking civilian settlements ... the international community must immediately say stop to this dangerous provocation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-says-it-shot-down-2-azerbaijani-copters-in-dispute/story-Wp8BsuXkcbe5fnMYuyyhYL.html
27-09-2020||World||Travellers from Dubai, UK contributed maximum Covid-19 importations into India: IIT study||Travellers from Dubai and the UK were primary sources of Covid-19 importations into India, according to an analytical study done by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi. According to the research, which has been published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, Covid-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to international travels. The study has also found that infected cases from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh played less role in spreading the disease outside their communities. Whereas infected people in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka played a significant role in the local transmission, and some of them caused interstate transfer too. “We tracked the spread of Covid-19 and its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few super spreaders who played a central role in the transmission of the disease in India. The Covid-19 spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local,” Sarita Azad, Assistant Professor, IIT Mandi, told PTI.“The research team has used the travel history of infected patients from January to April as the primary data source and a social network was created depicting the spread in the early phase of the pandemic. The research found that the maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (144) and the UK ( 64),” she added. Azad explained that statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of Covid-19 importations into India. “Dubai’s eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of Covid-19 importations into India.“Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14,” she said.“The modularity class of states such as Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh was low. Hence, it is likely that infected cases from these states played less of a role in spreading the disease outside their communities. Whereas states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka played a significant role in the local transmission, and some of them caused interstate transfer too,” she added. Azad, who conducted the analytical study, along with her student Sushma Devi, said, “When a pandemic like Covid-19 subsides, a good research work serves as a record for the future. In this work, we have used real time data and demonstrated how the disease got diffused from the global to national level from January 30 to April 6. This will be an important contribution to understanding the disease transmission in India during the early phase of the pandemic.” India’s Covid-19 caseload neared 60 lakh with 88,600 fresh infections being reported on Sunday, while the number of people having recuperated from the disease crossed 49 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 82.46 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry. The total coronavirus cases mounted to 59,92,532, while the death toll climbed to 94,503 with 1,124 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/travellers-from-dubai-uk-contributed-maximum-covid-19-importations-into-india-iit-study/story-wio7sB7LBrVuEXmsDdzzsM.html

It instead criticises pro-Khalistani extremism, detailing how such extremism is catalysed by Pakistan, and rightly rejected by the vast majority of Sikhs.”The WSO, in a statement, had said that the report  released earlier this month was “poorly researched”, made “unfounded claims”, failed “to engage in a contextually based analysis”, made “no attempt to present a balanced analysis on the issue” and “uncritically” parroted “a narrative” that is “pushed by India with respect to Sikhs in Canada.” This argument was also countered by MLI, saying the “report does not suggest or insinuate what the letter signatories and other critics have come to conclude without evidence, nor have the actual claims made in the report been refuted.”  In the report, Milewski had connected the WSO to the separatist Khalistan movement, citing its Constitution. In an emailed response to the criticism, Milewski said,  “it does not dispute the whole thesis of the article. It does not dispute the Pakistani role in the Khalistan movement, and it does not dispute that support in India is very weak, or even that the movement is fulfilling Pakistan’s purpose in bleeding India without doing anything to create a Sikh state.“In that sense, it’s hard to see how I could ask for more. Still, I think the Khalistani reaction reveals a degree of desperation that I had not expected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-think-tank-defends-report-linking-pakistan-to-khalistani-separatists/story-omAMV1GvNZCGQyU3YMXhUJ.html

Those who are getting these vaccine shots are also made to sign a “nondisclosure agreement”, according to which they can’t talk about it to the news media.High-risk population, including staff of state-owned companies, government officials, vaccine company staff, teachers are being inoculated on an emergency basis. Global heath experts are raising questions whether their consent has are being taken or not. In its defence, China has said that the World Health Organization supported China’s experimental coronavirus vaccine programme, which started in July. China informed WHO in June, Zheng Zhongwei, a National Health Commission official, told Reuters.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan has said countries can approve use of medical products within their own jurisdiction in the current emergency situation but only as a “temporary solution”. China currently has 11 vaccines in clinical trials and four in Phrase 3 trials.Among these. two are developed by state-backed China National Biotec Group and one by Sinovac Biotech.

She has been a judge on the seventh circuit court of appeals since 2017, also as a Trump nominee.Barrett’s confirmation, which is likely to go through, will give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court that will last a long time and will ensure President Trump an enduring legacy. Barrett will be the third justice he would have sent to the top court, tilting the ideological balance of the bench.Though Democrats do not have the numbers to stop the confirmation, they will put up a fight that will play out in the final weeks leading up to the presidential election.Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, called for the US senate to not act on Trump’s nomination until “after the American people select their next president and the next Congress”. Biden also pointed to Barrett’s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the Obama-era health insurance plan that Trump and Republicans have been trying to overturn. Barrett’s judicial philosophy was molded by her mentor late Justice Antonin Scalia as she acknowledged in her speech accepting the nomination: “A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.”Barrett, who is a devout catholic and mother of seven children, including two adopted from Haiti, is considered to be anti-abortion, pro-gun and, as Biden pointed out, anti-Obamacare. Critics also say she is anti-immigrant and has supported President Trump’s wealth test for immigrants.Republicans control the senate with a 53-47 majority are expected to fast-track the confirmation. Democrats cannot stop it unless they can peel away four Republican senators, and that appears unlikely.

The aim is to prevent patients from developing the serious lung damage for which Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone are administered.“We are focusing very heavily now on treatment of early infection and, or prevention of infection,” Fauci told the Journal of the American Medical Association in an interview Friday. “And that’s the bridge to the vaccine.”Immunization against SARS-CoV-2 could begin in the US in November or December, Fauci said, though it will probably take until at least the third quarter of 2021 for enough Americans to have been protected against the pandemic virus to significantly diminish its threat. Fauci said 100 million doses of vaccine may be produced by December, with all six companies supplying the US slated to have made 700 million doses by next April.With no vaccines yet proven to prevent Covid-19, health authorities must continue to push for new treatments and measures to stop the coronavirus from spreading, said Robert “Chip” Schooley, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, who is studying more potent versions of an existing antiviral.“Optimally, we’d have an oral antiviral drug you can give to more people earlier in the course of the illness,” Schooley said. Vaccines might not be 100% effective, “which is better than nothing, but we’re still going to have to rely on drugs and behavioral modifications for a long time to come.”Blockbuster studies published by the journal Science on Thursday showed about 14% of critical Covid-19 patients have impaired levels of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens.The finding opens up new strategies for identifying high-risk patients and treating them with interferon infusions or, in some cases, removing interferon-blocking antibodies from their blood in a procedure called plasmapheresis.Interferon, which is already being studied in dozens of clinical trials, might improve the effectiveness of antiviral drugs if they are administered early in an infection, according to Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, who has studied coronaviruses for 38 years.Infusions of coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies may also reduce the amount of virus in patients early in an infection, preventing an immune overreaction that’s behind most life-threatening cases, said Thomas File, an infectious diseases physician in Akron, Ohio, and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Monoclonal antibodies, a product made by cloning an antibody captured from the blood of a patient who recovered from Covid-19, could also be given to high-risk patients in nursing homes as a preventative treatment, Fauci said. Ely Lilly & Co.’s experimental antibody LY-CoV555 showed some hopeful signs in a trial among out-patients, the company said on Sept. 16.“We have some cautious optimism that monoclonal antibodies may be an important therapeutic for early disease,” Fauci said Sept. 10 in an online briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “We need something to keep people out of the hospital.”‘Tricky Medicine’Dexamethasone and similar steroid medications might cause harm if given too early in the course of a Covid-19 illness, said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California.“Steroids have definitely proven to be valuable in very sick people, but it is tricky medicine,” Crotty said in an interview. The medication inhibits a part of the immune system from going “haywire” and causing damaging inflammation, as well as the part of the immune system generating antibodies to counter the infection.The problem highlights the need for treatments to fight the virus while supporting the immune system, and regimens that can be mixed and matched depending on the body’s success in fighting the infection, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.“This is part of the dance with this virus,” Osterholm said. “You’re trying to take the best of the host and enhance it, and take the worst of the host and suppress it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-covid-19-treatments-could-be-bridge-to-vaccine-says-anthony-fauci/story-RW1pDRR1UVEaOlhCbmc5UP.html
27-09-2020||World||Donald Trump campaign sues to block mail-in ballot rule changes||President Donald Trump’s campaign committee and the Republican National Committee sued Saturday to block North Carolina election officials from enforcing rule changes that could boost the number of ballots counted in the presidential battleground state.The Republicans’ lawsuit claims a new system adopted by the State Board of Elections will allow for absentee ballots to be cast late and without proper witness verification, “which invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting.”The elections board on Tuesday issued new guidance allowing mail-in absentee ballots with deficient information to be fixed without forcing the voter to fill out a new blank ballot for November’s general election.The change means absentee voters who don’t provide complete information on their envelope about a witness who saw them fill out the ballot won’t have to complete a new ballot and locate another witness. A voter will just have to turn in an affidavit confirming they filled out the original ballot.North Carolina is one of eight states with witness and or notary public requirements for absentee ballots, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. North Carolina General Assembly leaders announced late Saturday they had also filed a similar lawsuit in federal court against board members. They asked a judge to block enforcement of the board’s absentee ballot alterations, which they contend would wrest away from the legislature its constitutional job to set the rules for federal elections.The national Republicans’ federal lawsuit claims the state elections board made a partisan “backroom deal” that undermines state lawmakers’ “carefully-considered, balanced structure of election laws.” The suit claims the board’s guidance usurps a law that says a ballot may only be accepted if it has a witness signature on it.“While touted as allowing greater access to voters during the current pandemic — an objective already addressed in recent months by the General Assembly — the actual effect is to undermine protections that help ensure the upcoming election will be not only safe and accessible but secure, fair, and credible,” the suit says.The lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign and the RNC also accuses the board of trying to override state law in saying that ballots postmarked on or before Election Day can be counted if they are received within nine days of the election instead of the three days prescribed by law.The state elections board and its chairman, Damon Circosta, are among the defendants named in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs also include two Republican congressmen from North Carolina, US Reps. Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop.Circosta and a board spokesperson didn’t immediately respond Saturday evening to text messages seeking a response to the lawsuits.North Carolina and other states expect a major surge in absentee voting for the Nov. 3 election amid the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 1 million voters in North Carolina already had requested an absentee ballot as of Sept. 24 and that nearly 240,00 completed ballots had already been returned, the lawsuit says.The state elections board’s new guidance to county boards means residents won’t be forced to start over from scratch in casting votes if a witness fails to sign or provide an address on the envelope containing their absentee ballot. The guidance means that the ballot now won’t be considered “spoiled,” and the voter will be sent an affidavit to sign to rectify the problem.Issues with deficient witness information on mail-in ballots have disproportionately affected Black voters. Ballots cast by African Americans account for about 43 percent of those classified as having incomplete witness information, according to state elections data earlier in the week. Yet Black residents account for 16 percent of overall ballots returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-campaign-sues-to-block-mail-in-ballot-rule-changes/story-vVHqNjxQFofFpzXQlumysI.html
27-09-2020||World||‘It is clear Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko has to go’: France president Emmanuel Macron||French President Emmanuel Macron said Belarus’s leader Alexander Lukashenko has to step down, in comments to a French weekly published on Sunday.“It’s clear he has to go,” he told the Journal du Dimanche, speaking days after the European Union refused to recognise Lukashenko as the country’s legitimate president.“It is a crisis of power, an authoritarian power that cannot accept the logic of democracy and which is hanging on by force. It is clear that Lukashenko has to go,” he said.Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Belarus since August 9 elections which opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya says she won, despite Lukashenko’s insistence he took a landslide victory.The embattled leader has launched a brutal crackdown against the protesters -- drawing condemnation from the West, but support from Moscow.He recently triggered new demonstrations and fresh Western criticism after holding a secret inauguration for himself.Macron on Sunday said he had been “impressed by the courage of the protesters” in Belarus.“They know the risks they are taking by demonstrating every weekend, and yet, they are pushing forward with the movement to make democracy come alive in this country that has been deprived of it for so long,” he said.“Women in particular, who march every Saturday, command our respect,” he added.More than 90 people -- most of them women -- were arrested on Saturday at opposition rallies, one NGO said.The EU on Thursday said Lukashenko’s inauguration lacked “democratic legitimacy” and refused to recognise him as president.Brussels is reviewing its relations with the country, the bloc’s diplomatic chief has said.EU ministers decided in principle last month to impose sanctions against the regime, but Cyprus has been blocking approval until the bloc agrees similar measures against Turkey over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean.On Friday, EU Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia expanded their own sanctions against Belarus.The issue will be debated during an EU summit on October 1-2 in Brussels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-is-clear-belarus-leader-alexander-lukashenko-has-to-go-france-president-emmanuel-macron/story-F4T04y5QSRInBx6fW8hw6N.html

A 9:30 a.m. hearing on Sunday is set on the issue before US District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington. ByteDance said on Sept. 20 it had made a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in the short video sharing app’s US operations, but the exact terms remain unclear.The Commerce Department gave the companies an additional week to finalize a deal before an order banning TikTok from US app stores takes effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-rejects-bid-to-delay-tiktok-us-app-store-ban-set-for-sunday/story-XhnqUZztiuVhSNF8lCTASP.html

The over-speeding bus, on its way to Karachi from Hyderabad, skidded off the road and burst into flames on Saturday, police and rescue officials said. At least 13 people have lost their lives in the accident near Nooriabad area, they said. “They were 22 passengers in the bus when it overturned and caught fire… many of them were trapped inside and got burnt. Others who escaped or have been rescued also suffered injuries,” additional IG Motorway Police Dr Aftab Pathan told the media. Five of the survivors were in a critical condition, he said, adding that officials were trying to retrieve the bodies from the wreckage of the bus. “The accident took place after the bus travelled some 60 kilometres from Hyderabad and the vehicle has been totally destroyed in the accident,” the officer said. Edhi ambulances from Karachi and Edhi Home rushed to the spot along with fire tenders to extinguish the blaze. Earlier this year, six members of a family, including four children, were charred to death while five others injured when a fire broke out in a moving van in New Karachi area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passenger-bus-catches-fire-in-pakistan-13-killed/story-o2cOdn2e6kPnAsQJo1u9HK.html
27-09-2020||World||Joe Biden compares Donald Trump to Goebbels, saying he’s promoting a ‘lie’||Democratic nominee Joe Biden compared Donald Trump to Joseph Goebbels, saying the president was repeating a “lie” in the same way the Nazi propagandist did in the 1930s and ‘40s.“He’s sort of like Goebbels. You say the lie long enough, keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, it becomes common knowledge,” Biden said in an interview on MSNBC that aired Saturday.Biden was responding to a question about how he would confront repeated false accusations from Trump that he’s a socialist.The comment came hours before Trump announced conservative judge Amy Comey Barrett as his pick to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, and three days before Biden and the president are scheduled to meet for their first debate.Adolf Hitler and Goebbels, his minister of propaganda, espoused a technique known as the “Big Lie,” which involved repeating a colossal falsehood until the public came to believe it was true. Hitler coined the term in his 1925 book “Mein Kampf.”“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it,” Goebbels is often reported to have said, although the source of the comment is unclear.Biden had compared Trump to Goebbels once before, when he called for the president’s impeachment in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-compares-trump-to-goebbels-saying-he-s-promoting-a-lie/story-NaMhkaDxrRp05wqAw1OOQO.html

Trump predicted that Barrett, a staunch conservative, will get a “very quick” confirmation in the Republican-controlled senate.Barrett is “a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act,” the healthcare plan known as Obamacare that was adopted when Biden was vice president, the Democrat said in a statement.Trump has been trying to end Obamacare “for four years,” Biden said, but twice the Supreme Court “upheld the law as constitutional.“But even now, in the midst of a global health pandemic, the Trump Administration is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-us-senate-not-to-confirm-supreme-court-nominee-before-election/story-zdKAyU32GJZwN82ehZRhTN.html
27-09-2020||World||A look at Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s notable opinions, votes||Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, has been on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017. Her short tenure as a judge has led to few noteworthy or controversial opinions. She has, however, signed onto several decisions that are sure to be questioned in a possible confirmation fight. Here are summaries of some of her notable opinions:Abortion Barrett has twice joined dissenting opinions asking for decisions blocking laws enacted by abortion opponents to be thrown out and reheard by the full appeals court.Last year, after a three-judge panel blocked an Indiana law that would make it harder for a minor to have an abortion without her parents being notified, Barrett voted to have the case reheard by the full court.In July, the Supreme Court in July threw out the panel’s ruling and ordered a new look at the case.Also read: Donald Trump picks conservative Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme CourtIn 2018, a three-judge panel ruled that Indiana laws requiring that funerals be held for fetal remains after an abortion or miscarriage and banning abortions because of the sex, race or developmental disability of a fetus were unconstitutional.Barrett was among four judges who wanted the full court to weigh in and suggested that the laws, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, might be constitutional.Supreme Court abortion decisions “hold that, until a fetus is viable, a woman is entitled to decide whether to bear a child. But there is a difference between ‘I don’t want a child’ and ‘I want a child, but only a male’ or ‘I want only children whose genes predict success in life,’” Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the dissenting judges.Barrett also joined the part of the opinion on the fetal remains law. “Many states have laws that prescribe how animals’ remains must be handled,” Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the dissenters. “The panel has held invalid a statute that would be sustained had it concerned the remains of cats or gerbils.”Last year, the Supreme Court reinstated the fetal remains law, but not the ban on abortions for race, sex and developmental disabilities.GunsIn a dissent in the 2019 gun-rights case of Kanter v. Barr, Barrett argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony — in this case, mail fraud — shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun.The two judges in the majority agreed with Trump administration arguments that the defendant, Rickey Kanter, could not own a gun under federal or Wisconsin law because of his criminal conviction.Barrett used most of her 37-page dissent to lay out the history of gun rules for convicted criminals in the 18th and 19th centuries, consistent with her embrace of interpreting laws and the Constitution according to the meaning they had when they were adopted.Barrett wrote that “while both Wisconsin and the United States have an unquestionably strong interest in protecting the public from gun violence, they have failed to show, by either logic or data that disarming Kanter substantially advances that interest.”She said that her colleagues were treating the Second Amendment as a “second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.” Barrett quoted from a 2010 opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that extended gun rights, but the phrase also has been used more recently by Justice Clarence Thomas and other conservatives to complain that the Supreme Court has shied away from recognizing gun rights.Campus sexual assault Barrett wrote a unanimous three-judge panel decision in 2019 making it easier for men alleged to have committed sexual assaults on campus to challenge the proceedings against them.The case involved allegations by a female student at Purdue University that her boyfriend had sexually assaulted her. The students were identified in court documents as John and Jane Doe.John Doe sued in federal court claiming sex discrimination after Purdue suspended him for a year and took away his Navy ROTC scholarship. Barrett concluded Purdue’s process was unfair and allowed his lawsuit to continue.“The case against him boiled down to a ‘he said/she said’ — Purdue had to decide whether to believe John or Jane,” Barrett wrote.The judge criticized the university official who ended up siding with the female student. “Her basis for believing Jane is perplexing, given that she never talked to Jane. Indeed, Jane did not even submit a statement in her own words,” Barrett wrote.Immigration Barrett was in dissent in June when her two colleagues on a 7th circuit panel put on hold, just in Chicago, the Trump administration policy that could jeopardize permanent resident status for immigrants who use food stamps, Medicaid and housing vouchers.Under the new policy, immigration officials can deny green cards to legal immigrants over their use of public benefits.She wrote that existing immigration law and Clinton-era welfare reform had already limited public assistance to noncitizens. The administration was just using leeway those laws had given it, Barrett wrote. The objections of immigrants and their advocates “reflect disagreement with this policy choice and even the statutory exclusion itself. Litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes,” she wrote.Access to a lawyer Barrett dissented in the case of a Wisconsin man who admitted that he fatally shot his wife seven times but argued that he had been provoked, making his crime second-degree homicide instead of first-degree homicide, which carries a higher penalty.A federal judge reviewed the provoking claim in a pretrial hearing without prosecutors present and without allowing the lawyer of defendant Scott Schmidt to speak. The judge rejected Schmidt’s claim of provocation, and he was convicted of first-degree homicide and sentenced to life in prison. However, a 7th Circuit panel overturned that decision, saying that Schmidt had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Barrett, in her dissent, disagreed that the pretrial hearing where the judge questioned Schmidt about his provocation claim was a situation that required Schmidt’s lawyer and said the Supreme Court has never extended the right to counsel outside an adversarial proceeding.The Supreme Court’s “’critical stage’ precedent deals exclusively with adversarial confrontations between the defendant and an agent of the state,” she said.She added: “Perhaps the right to counsel should extend to a hearing like the one the judge conducted in Schmidt’s case. But (federal law) precludes us from disturbing a state court’s judgment on the ground that a state court decided an open question differently than we would — or, for that matter, differently than we think the (Supreme) Court would.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-look-at-judge-amy-coney-barrett-s-notable-opinions-votes/story-rXLVg46QoPRa4ebjPUfWPJ.html
27-09-2020||World||Donald Trump picks conservative Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court||President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Saturday, capping a dramatic reshaping of the federal judiciary that will resonate for a generation and that he hopes will provide a needed boost to his reelection effort.Republican senators are already lining up for a swift confirmation of Barrett ahead of the November 3 election, as they aim to lock in conservative gains in the federal judiciary before a potential transition of power. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping the nomination will serve to galvanize his supporters as he looks to fend off Democrat Joe Biden.Trump hailed Barrett as “a woman of remarkable intellect and character,” saying he had studied her record closely before making the pick.“I looked and I studied, and you are very eminently qualified,” he said as Barrett stood next to him in the Rose Garden.An ideological heir to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett would fill the seat vacated after the Sept. 18 death of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in what would be the sharpest ideological swing since Clarence Thomas replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall nearly three decades ago. She would be the sixth justice on the nine-member court to be appointed by a Republican president, and the third of Trump’s first term in office.For Trump, whose 2016 victory hinged in large part on reluctant support from conservative and white evangelicals on the promise of filling Scalia’s seat with a conservative, the latest nomination in some ways brings his first term full circle. Even before Ginsburg’s death, Trump was running on having confirmed in excess of 200 federal judges, fulfilling a generational aim of conservative legal activists.“This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, and it is a very proud moment indeed,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. He encouraged Democrats to take up her nomination swiftly and to “refrain from personal and partisan attacks.” The set design, with large American flags hung between the Rose Garden colonnades, appeared to be modeled on the way the White House was decorated when President Bill Clinton named Ginsburg as his nominee in 1993.The announcement came before Ginsburg was buried beside her husband next week at Arlington National Cemetery. On Friday, she was the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol, and mourners flocked to the Supreme Court for two days before that to pay respects.Barrett said she was “truly humbled” by the nomination, adding that she would be “mindful of who came before me.” She praised Ginsburg upon accepting the nomination, saying, “She has won the admiration of women across the country and indeed all across the world.” Within hours of Ginsburg’s death, Trump made clear he would nominate a woman for the seat, and later volunteered he was considering five candidates. But Barrett was the early favorite, and the only one to meet with Trump.Barrett has been a judge since 2017, when Trump nominated her to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But as a longtime University of Notre Dame law professor, she had already established herself as a reliable conservative in the mold of Scalia, for whom she clerked in the late 1990s.She would be the only justice on the current court not to have received her law degree from an Ivy League school. The eight current justices all attended either Harvard or Yale.The staunch conservative had become known to Trump in large part after her bitter 2017 appeals court confirmation included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. The president also interviewed her in 2018 for the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, but Trump ultimately chose Brett Kavanaugh.Trump and his political allies are itching for another fight over Barrett’s faith, seeing it as a political windfall that would backfire on Democrats. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Biden, also Catholic, is trying to recapture.While Democrats appear powerless to stop Barrett’s confirmation in the GOP-controlled Senate, they are seeking to use the process to weaken Trump’s reelection chances.Barrett’s nomination could become a reckoning over abortion, an issue that has divided many Americans so bitterly for almost half a century. The idea of overturning or gutting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion, has animated activists in both parties for decades. Now, with the seemingly decisive shift in the court’s ideological makeup, Democrats hope their voters will turn out in droves because of their frustration with the Barrett pick.Trump has also increasingly embraced the high court — which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping -– as an insurance policy in a close election.Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the coronavirus pandemic have already led to a flurry of election litigation, and both Trump and Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,” Trump said Wednesday of the election, adding, “And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices.” (AP) CPS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-picks-conservative-amy-coney-barrett-for-supreme-court/story-PTozx2hZYcPMjB1qPoJCSL.html

The Metropolitan Police said 16 people were arrested and nine of its officers were injured during the clashes, which saw protesters hurling bottles and water. Two of the injured police officers have been hospitalised with head injuries.Thousands of anti-lockdown demonstrators had gathered at Trafalgar Square and later moved to Hyde Park in central London for a so-called “We Do Not Consent” rally to protest against restrictions, including the current “rule of six” which limits numbers allowed to gather as part of curbs to control the spread of coronavirus.The Metropolitan Police had issued a statement to warn that it would be stepping up patrols in line with the planned demonstrations, even as it reminded the public that such gatherings could be in breach of regulations designed to protect people from coronavirus. It is illegal for people to gather in groups of more than six, unless they are exempt. While protest is one of those exemptions, organisers must submit a risk assessment and must comply with social distancing.“As the crowds began to swell in Trafalgar Square, it became impossible for people maintain social distancing and keep each other safe,” said Commander Ade Adelekan, who is leading the Met Police operation on Saturday.“This lack of action voided the risk assessment submitted by event organisers the night before. Therefore, today’s demonstration was no longer exempt from the coronavirus regulations. In the interest of public safety, officers then worked quickly to disperse crowds,” he said. Earlier, he had said that his officers will use the approach of engaging, explaining and encouraging people to follow the regulations. “However, if people fail to comply, and continue to put themselves at risk, officers will take enforcement action,” he said. “I know there is great frustration to these regulations, but they have been designed to keep everyone safe from what is a lethal virus. By flagrantly gathering in large numbers and ignoring social distancing, you are putting your health and the health of your loved ones at risk,” he added. A number of highly trained public order officers as well as mounted officers were among the visible police presence throughout central London, in order to respond “swiftly” to breaches of the coronavirus regulations and scenes of violence, the Met Police said. Meanwhile, protesters could be seen holding placards reading: “When tyranny becomes law, resistance becomes duty”, “Unmask the Truth” and “No More Lies, No More Masks, No More Lockdown”, while also chanting “take off the mask”. Last weekend, a similar anti-lockdown protest also turned violent, resulting in 32 arrests. “I am very frustrated to see that nine officers were injured during clashes with a small minority of protestors. This is especially saddening in light of the injuries sustained by officers last weekend. We will be supporting those officers who were injured and I wish them a very speedy recovery,” added Commander Adekelan. Saturday’s rally comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for tougher curbs for the UK capital, which is now on the government’s Covid-19 watchlist. All its boroughs are now part of 92 areas of concern around the UK, where the death toll from the deadly virus is edging towards 42,000 with infection rates continuing on an upward trajectory. Large parts of Britain are already under stricter localised lockdowns, with more than a quarter of the population facing curbs as further rules come in force this weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flout-covid-19-curbs-for-anti-lockdown-london-rally/story-hefwaiCl2k44CxdzgqmNTN.html

The list released by Congress national general secretary Mukul Wasnik contains 9 candidates’ names, as per the state Congress. With these 9 candidates Congress has announced the names of 24 candidates so far. It released the first list containing 15 names on September 11. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to announce the names of its candidates. The Election Commission of India is yet to announce the dates of the bypolls. However, it had said recently the bypolls would be held along with Bihar state assembly polls by November end. The candidates in the second list include ex-BJP MLA Parul Sahu from Sagar who recently joined the Congress. She will contest from the Surakhi assembly seat in Sagar district that she represented from 2013 to 2018. She was denied a ticket by the BJP in the 2018 assembly elections. From BJP, it’s minister for transport and revenue in Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet, Govind Rajput who is likely to contest from the seat. Rajput resigned from the seat on March 12 this year as a Congress MLA to later join the BJP.Other candidates and the constituencies for which their candidature has been announced by the Congress include Pankaj Upadhyaya- Joura assembly seat, Ajay Kushwaha- Sumaoli, Satish Sikarwar- Gwalior East, Harivallabh Shukla- Pohri, Kanhaiya Ram Lodhi- Mungaoli, Uttam Raj Narain Singh- Mandhata, Abhishek Singh Bana- Badnawar and Rakesh Patidar- Suwasara. State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Selection of and announcing the names of candidates are internal matters of the Congress. However, the list suggests Congress doesn’t have much choice to select among party leaders and merit of the party leaders has been ignored which will soon be reflected in the rumblings in the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-declares-second-list-of-candidates-for-assembly-bypolls-in-mp/story-O1sS5wE3Fil1TGh6qq4KGP.html
27-09-2020||India||‘Over 700 CBI investigations pending for more than a year’: Central Vigilance Commission||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has claimed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been slow in investigating certain cases due to several reasons including work overload, delay in obtaining reply to the Letter Rogatories (LRs) sent to various countries seeking information, government departments not supplying relevant records and sanction to the agency, delay in obtaining forensic reports from laboratories, among other reasons. Other reasons cited by the apex vigilance body for CBI investigations getting stuck for years are shortage of manpower, time taken in scrutiny of voluminous records in economic offences, bank fraud cases and significant time spent by officers in locating and examining witnesses living in distant places. Also read: Bihar polls - Too many glitches and hitches in NDA’s seat-sharingAccording to CVC’s annual report, which was released on Sunday, investigation was pending in 744 CBI cases for more than a year at the end of December 2019 out of which 678 were related to Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. It was found that about 25 corruption investigations in CBI are pending beyond five years. Overall, total 1,239 investigations and enquiries were pending in CBI till December last year. The data reveals that the CBI registered total 608 FIRs and 102 preliminary enquiries (PEs) in 2019. Another worrying trend for the CBI, as shown in the CVC annual report, pertains to pendency of its cases in courts. As of December 2019, a whopping 6,226 PC Act cases probed by the CBI were pending trial in various courts across the country, some for more than 20 years. When it comes to appeals and revisions filed by agency and accused persons in various high courts, Supreme Court and additional session courts are taken into account; a staggering 11,380 appeals/revisions are pending in courts, CVC data suggests. The CVC says, “The Commission is concerned about the slow progress of disposal of the large number of cases pending trial in different courts for long periods, at times for over twenty years. Such inordinate delays in investigation defeats the very purpose of efficient vigilance administration and are an impediment to the fight against corruption.” The CBI spokesperson was not available for comments. However, an officer, requesting anonymity, said “Many of the high profile white collar criminals use their money to delay the cases in courts”. Also read: Sharad Pawar lauds SAD’s Badals for their strong pro-farmer stanceThe delays in courts, the CVC adds, happen due to limited number of hearings, non-availability of witnesses, dilatory tactics adopted by the accused by way of filing applications for transfer of cases from one court to another challenging the legality of investigation by CBI and court stay and inadequate strength of prosecution staff due to vacancies. Discussing the nature of cases received against government officials, the CVC says large number of complaints received against public servants are “frivolous, vague, non-specific, pertaining to procedural lapses, or administrative violations.” Also, a significant number of complaints seeking investigation against officials in Central ministries, departments are “anonymous”, having wild or unverifiable allegations and in some cases, the intention of the complainant is just to harass someone rather than reporting corrupt activities. As a general policy, anonymous complaints are not entertained by the CVC since October 2018 and only those complaints are recommended for investigation which have a clear vigilance angle. According to the CVC’s annual report for 2019, out of total 35,649 complaints against public servants, almost 20 percent (7,425) were vague while 19 percent (6,975) were anonymous in nature. “In many complaints, the allegations were found to be either vague or unverifiable. The Commission received a large number of complaints against public servants working in the state governments and other organizations who do not come under the jurisdiction of the Commission or which are of administrative nature,” stated the CVC report reviewed by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-700-cbi-probes-pending-for-more-than-a-year-central-vigilance-commission/story-kCFUYulS8oI7MXzIde9L2M.html

We had gone to his house in Jakirnagar under Mango Police Station but his brother told us that he had left for Dubai a couple of days ago. His second wife, Rashida Begum, had stated in her complaint that he was to leave India on Sunday. We are taking necessary steps to call him back to India and further investigation is on,” Alok Ranjan, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Law and Order, said.The prompt action came after Mahila Vikash Manch (MVM) leader Nishat Khatoon tweeted Rashida’s plight tagging Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, Jharkhand police DIG Kolhan and East Singhbhum DC. Jharkhand police immediately forwarded the matter to Jamshedpur SSP Dr Tamil Vanan who formed a team headed by DSP (law and order).Also read: ‘Will hug CM if I have Covid-19’: BJP’s new national secy from Bengal“I have also tweeted the matter, copy of FIR and passport and other details to Emirate Steel - where Hasibullah works in Abu Dhabi-, Indian embassy in UAE, UAE government and Union Ministry of External Affairs, Delhi, seeking prompt and necessary action to get him back. MVM has also filed a detailed complaint with the Jamshedpur SSP. As per Supreme Court’s order and central law, talaq by post, WhatsApp or on telephone, et cetera., have been banned and is now illegal,” Nishat Khatoon, MVM president said.Rashida, on the other hand, has accused her husband Hasibullah of sending talaqnama by post on September 18 without meeting and discussing it with her. “He didn’t even give me talaq in person and yet just sent a talaqnama to my parental house in Mahato Para under Jugsalai PS by post on September 18,” Rashida alleged in her complaint to DIG Kolhan and Jugsalai PS OC last evening. HT has a copy of her complaint.She has also accused Hasibullah of hiding his first marriage, torturing and threatening her to get Rs 5 lakh from her parents. “I was married as per Muslim rituals to Hasibullah Khan from Jakirnagar (Mango) on November 16, 2018. I came to know that he was already married after he took me to Abu Dhabi six months after marriage. When I started questioning him on this he started manhandling and torturing me and threatened to give talaq, demanding Rs 5 lakh,” Rashida alleged.She further alleged that she was branded omnious and was not allowed to enter the house after her mother-in-law died of Covid-19 on August 10 this year, She was driven out of the house on August 14 by Hasibullah and his elder brother Sifulah Khan, she said. Nishant said the first wife, Nauseen, had separated from Hasibullah after taking Khula.Hasibullah, on the other hand, accused his second wife of breach of trust and lying in his talaqnama sent by post. “Our marriage was on the condition of her bearing me a child as my first wife was not able to bear a child. After six month in Abu Dhabi, I had brought her back here. 10-15 days after I went to Abu Dhabi again, she told me that she was pregnant. I had sent Rs 25,000 and Rs 65, 000 to my mother for her treatment,” Hasibullah’s talaqnama read.“After nine months, when my mother asked about the date of delivery, she said that she had delivered a stillborn baby. She even refused to show me medical documents for this though. Later when documents were checked, she gave the excuse that she had a tumour in her stomach, breaching all my trust. Hence, I have given her talaq and she is no more my wife,” Hasibullah said in the talaqnama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-flees-to-dubai-after-giving-second-wife-talaq-by-post-police-on-chase/story-8O1AIBluxsiPgX0LzbJfMJ.html
27-09-2020||India||Viral caseload shoots up in Kerala as it logs more than 40,000 new Covid-19 cases in 1 week||After keeping coronavirus in check for barely some time, the viral caseload has increased alarmingly in Kerala in the past one week forcing health authorities to review containment strategies. State health minister K K Shailaja on Sunday admitted that it is a testing time for Kerala and cases may go up sharply by next month.More than 40,000 cases were reported in the last one week and the positivity rate has gone up to 11.9% while the national average is below 8%. “Our strategy was right from day one and we contained deaths considerably. Our death rate is still below one per cent. But of late cases are surging and it was expected. It is the second wave of the virus,” she said.The minister asked people not to lower their guard at this critical point and avoid big gatherings to avoid high mortality rates. She said relaxations during the Onam festivities and the ongoing protest by the opposition parties were the main reasons for the present surge. The state is witnessing protests seeking the resignation of minister KT Jaleel who was interrogated in connection with the sensational gold smuggling case.The minister said the state with high density of population (860 people per square km) and with a high population of elderly people (more than 15 per cent of the population is above 60) was a sitting duck but it managed well, slowing down the death rate (reported 678 casualties). She held a high-level meeting to review the situation. The health department has asked asymptomatic patients to remain in isolation in their homes and not to crowd hospitals. In Covid-19 active cases (56,709) the state is in the fifth position now in the country. According to health experts what is worrying is that in Kerala, Covid-19 cases peaked when other states are showing a downward trend and they expect the situation will continue like this till October-end. “The reverse quarantine was successful to a large extent. Despite surge in cases the state managed the death rate considerably,” said Dr B Iqbal, chairman of the expert committee for Covid-19 management.On Sunday, the state reported 7,445 new cases taking the total to 1,75,384. Patients who have recovered stand at 1,17,921 and active cases are 56,709. With 21 new casualties, the death toll has gone up to 678. The state has also increased tests with 54,493 tests being carried out on Sunday. The total number of tests has gone up to 27,71,533.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/viral-caseload-shoots-up-in-kerala-as-it-logs-more-than-40-000-new-covid-19-cases-in-1-week/story-yLuSLlwutL27GNZ9x2b6KJ.html
27-09-2020||India||Covid-19: India far from achieving herd immunity, says health minister Harsh Vardhan||Indians will have to follow the safety protocols against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as herd immunity in the country still remains a distant goal, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday.India on Sunday inched closer to the 6 million mark of Covid-19 cases after it recorded 88,600 fresh infections between Saturday and Sunday morning. The nationwide death toll mounted to 94,503 after 1,124 people died due to the viral disease in the last 24 hours.“Indian population is still far from achieving herd immunity against Covid-19 as shown by ICMR’s second serosurvey. Hence, all of us should continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the Union minister said during his social media programme ‘Sunday Samvaad-3’.Herd immunity is used to describe the indirect protection a population acquires in which the majority of people have natural or acquired immunity to infection. This is possible either through a large proportion of the population getting infected or vaccinated.“The first serosurvey of May 2020 revealed that the nationwide prevalence of novel coronavirus infection was only 0.73 per cent,” the health minister also said.Harsh Vardhan said that the findings of the second serosurvey, which determines the prevalence of the coronavirus strain in the country, are going to be released soon. The serosurvey also aims to determine how the disease prevalence has changed since the first one in May, when the nationwide lockdown was in force, to now when there are fewer restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-far-from-achieving-herd-immunity-says-health-minister-harsh-vardhan/story-0aP1I4YHYhcXydIuXOoRRM.html

The inauguration took place through video conferencing and was attended by Union minister for development of north east region (DONER) Jitendra Singh and the chief ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland and Sikkim. “I have been to several places within the country and abroad and visited many tourist destinations. But I don’t think I have seen such natural beauty in any place except northeast,” Shah said. “Importantly, people in the region have preserved and promoted their rich and diverse languages, traditions and culture beautifully despite a lot of challenges. I am sure with the initiatives taken by our government, the region will become one of the most sought after tourist destinations in coming years,” he added. Calling the region a prized ornament, Shah said that without the Northeast’s culture assimilating with the rest of India, the country’s culture can never be called complete. Destination Northeast is an annual festival organised by the DONER ministry with the objective of showcasing and celebrating the region to other parts of the country in order to strengthen national integration. The theme for this year’s event is ‘The Emerging Delightful Destinations’ and will be a virtual event due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The festival held earlier at Varanasi, Chandigarh and Delhi had attracted lots of visitors and educated people in those places about the northeast. I hope the next festival is held at my constituency Gandhinagar in Gujarat,” Shah said. Stressing on the need for peace in the once strife-torn region in order to promote tourism and investment, the Union home minister said since 2014 steps taken by the Centre have helped replace violence with development. Shah mentioned the Centre’s Act East Policy, which aims to open the Northeast region for trade and tourism with South East Asia and listed the initiatives taken in the past six years for development and connectivity in the region. “At the time of the country’s independence the northeast contributed nearly 20% of India’s GDP, but it gradually declined over the years. Our efforts are to ensure that it reaches those levels again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-launches-destination-north-east-2020-to-promote-region-s-tourism-culture-and-business/story-I0z9VIPDrrOvNnEF570YhI.html

President Ram Nath Kovind signed the bills, making them an act, and the government notified them.The passage of these bills has led to a series of protests by farmers across the country, the Shiromani Akali Dal’s exit from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and also saw the suspension of eight parliamentarians of the Rajya Sabha when Parliament proceedings were ongoing.Protests against the three acts - The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 - began in Punjab and Haryana in early September before the monsoon session had begun.Also Read: Address farmers’ issues now | HT EditorialFarmers and farmers’ union leaders are still continuing to stage protests all over the country over the passage of these bills as they fear public procurement will be affected and the system of minimum support prices (MSP) will exist no more. Farmer leaders believe that the passage of these bills will affect how the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) used to work exposing farmers to the whims and fancies of private players and corporations belonging to the agricultural sector.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has continually assured farmers that their agricultural produce will continue to be sold under the ambit of MSP and government procurement will not be affected. Opposition parties had earlier requested the President to not give his assent to the three bills.Parliament also saw huge ruckus in the upper house which then led to the suspension of eight opposition members due to unruly behaviour. Former Union minister and SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from her post as her party voiced its concerns regarding the passage of the bills.Farmer agitations against the passage of the bills continue across northern India. Farmers in Punjab held a ‘Rail Roko’ agitation while in Rohtak farmers blocked the Rohtak-Chandigarh National Highway. Protests were also held in Bengaluru and Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-get-president-s-assent-amid-protests-sad-s-exit/story-5CLoiIi9r3HhTHWJbuZwLL.html

Hazra’s comments came during his media interaction at Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district where he went to attend a meeting of party workers on Sunday afternoon.Hazra and a large number of BJP workers were not wearing masks and social distancing norms were not maintained during the meeting. Reporters asked Hazra why wasn’t he or the others wearing any mask. “Our workers are fighting a bigger enemy than corona. They are fighting Mamata Banerjee. Since they were not affected by corona they are not scared anymore. I will hug Mamata Banerjee if I have corona (get infected). She treated victims of the disease pathetically. Their bodies were burnt with kerosene. We don’t even treat dead cats or dogs like that,” said Hazra.

It added that what transpired during the meeting could not be known immediately. The process of unlocking Maharashtra and the Covid-19 situation in the worst-hit state were some of the issues that were discussed during the meeting, PTI reported.Sharad Pawar has met Thackeray several times in the past over similar issues.The meeting between the veteran Maratha leader and Shiv Sena chief came after Fadnavis and Raut met at a hotel in Mumbai on Saturday sparking speculation over whether the two sides are trying to mend their relations amid the slugfest between the two in the past few months.On Sunday, Raut said that he met the former Maharashtra chief minister to discuss some issues and that both of them could have ideological differences but there was no enmity between them. Fadnavis also asserted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has no intention of joining hands with the Shiv Sena or to bring down the Thackeray-led state government. Fadnavis also said the meeting was regarding an interview for Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.The Shiv Sena had withdrawn from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre in November last year and then snapped ties with the BJP after the Maharashtra assembly elections over the issue of sharing the post of the chief minister.

27-09-2020||India||President Kovind gives his nod to all 3 farm bills, government notifies them||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave his assent to all the three contentious farm bills, which opposition parties say are anti-farmer and corporate-friendly, after they were recently passed by Parliament during its monsoon session amid vehement protests.The three bills - The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - have now become acts.The government, which has said that these landmark legislations will make farmers self-reliant, has notified them. More than a dozen opposition parties had urged President Kovind not to sign the contentious bills, alleging that they were passed “unconstitutionally” in “complete disregard” of parliamentary norms.SAD quits NDA: How farm bills ended friendship between oldest alliesThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) even pulled out of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition at the Centre over the passage of the contentious farm bills, which the Punjab-based party said were “lethal and disastrous”. The SAD and the BJP had been allies since 1996 when both forged a pre-poll alliance ahead of the 1997 Punjab assembly elections which brought them to power.Farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the bills and have said the Centre’s farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to allay the fears of the farmers, saying that the country’s agriculture sector has unshackled itself after the passage of these bills. Farmers and the farm sector, Modi said, need to be strong to lay a strong foundation of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. “They have the power to sell their fruits or vegetables to anyone, and anywhere. It is this power which is the foundation of their growth, now the same power has been given to farmers across the country. They have got the freedom to sell not only fruits and vegetables but grains, sugarcane, mustard and anything that they grow, they can now sell to anyone and anywhere they like,” PM Modi said while addressing the 69th edition of his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.Also Read: Harsimrat Kaur Badal quits Cabinet over farm billsSeveral Union ministers, including defence Minister Rajnath Singh, have said said the Centre has taken the steps to ensure that farmers get the right price for their produce.“Our government has taken steps to ensure that the farmers get the right price for their produce. I have studied the bills, and I am saying that the farmers will benefit from it. But some people are trying to mislead the farmers,” Singh said recently.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis). The government says this is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price. And the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potato from the list of essential commodities and will do away with the imposition of stock holding limits.Pullout won’t help SAD in state polls: Sukhdev Singh DhindsaThe Sukhbir Singh Badal-led SAD had asked the central government not to bring the bills in Parliament till “all reservations” expressed by farmers are “duly addressed”. But when the Centre did not pay heed, the SAD asked the government to send these farm bills to a select committee, which did not happen.

We also demand that the NDA government takes back these black legislations and ensure ‘one nation, one market and one price’,” Bhupesh Baghel said, according to news agency ANI.The Congress leader also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet ministers for “misleading farmers”. “PM Modi, his cabinet colleagues and BJP leaders are saying that farmers can now sell their agriculture produce anywhere. I want to ask them: when were farmers not allowed to sell their produces as per their wish? They’re misleading farmers,” the chief minister said.On September 20, the Rajya Sabha passed the two key farm bills - Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. During the agriculture reform bills debate, the upper house witnessed ruckus as several opposition parties raised a strong objection.PM Modi on Sunday once again hailed the passage of the bills on his Mann Ki Baat radio programme, saying it has empowered the country’s farmers.“One who is grounded stays firm even during the biggest storms. During these tough times of corona, our farm sector, our farmers are a living example of this. Even during this crisis, our agricultural sector has again shown its prowess. Our farmers, farm sector, villages, are the foundation of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.

Fighting for farmers is part of Trinamool DNA,” TMC lawmaker Derek O’Brien said.The Rajya Sabha MP, who was suspended from the Rajya Sabha over the ruckus last week along with seven other members during the passage of the bills, said his party will contest the farm bills passed by both the Houses as it has a direct bearing on states’ role, minimum support price, public distribution price and procurement.Also read | SAD quits NDA: How farm bills ended friendship between oldest allies“In 2006, Mamata Banerjee risked her life on a historic 26 day fast for farmers’ rights.

27-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand hoteliers keep fingers crossed as business returns slowly||Hoteliers in Uttarakhand have claimed that there is a gradual improvement in the tourism sector after the government eased Covid-19 restrictions on tourism activities last week. They said the influx of tourists in the state’s popular spots like Mussoorie and Nainital has started. Hotels in the state which were closed down for about 5-6 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic have been receiving queries for booking for the next few days especially in the first week of October. “Post relaxations we have seen some improvement in the business which was hard hit by the pandemic. In the last few days, about 10-15% business is back with some tourists visiting Nainital and Mussoorie on Saturday,” said Sandeep Sahni, president, hotel and restaurant association of Uttarakhand. He, however, said that the industry will take several months to get fully back on track. “Our industry is a perishable industry and the losses incurred can never be recovered. During the lockdown, we lost our business during the prime season which is during the summers. We lost about ₹2,000 cr during that in the state. We are expecting about 30-40% of the business by the end of October but for 100% it will take months,” said Sahni. Sanjay Agarwal, general secretary of Mussoorie Hotel Association said, ‘post restrictions, the hotels have got about 70% of the total bookings for the first week of October which has got a long weekend.’ “Tourists are slowly coming after the restrictions on movement were lifted. We are getting maximum bookings and queries from Delhi-NCR region which are closer to Mussoorie,” said Agarwal. He also said that hoteliers have no option but to be patient to recover their losses. “It will however take a considerable time to fully recover. But we have no option but to wait,” he said.Ved Sah, general secretary of the Nainital hotel association too claimed that the hotels in the popular tourist spot are getting bookings for the next few weeks. “As the restrictions have been eased, the tourists have started coming. We are getting bookings from tourists for the first week of October which is a good sign for business,” he said. However, president of the Uttarakhand hotel and restaurant association, Sahni claimed that the industry will collapse if the government doesn’t provide assistance. “The medium and small hotels in our industry have been majorly affected. They don’t have money to sustain and have suffered job losses. The whole industry is on the verge of collapse if there is no timely government assistance,” said Shani. The state government, however, seemed optimistic that the tourism sector which is a major source of revenue generation, will recover. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Sunday said, “The government is taking many steps to boost the tourism in the state. We have been undertaking projects to ensure tourism activities round the year including water sports, adventure sports, circuits for religious tourism and others.” “The pandemic has surely affected the industry, but it will surely gather pace after once the pandemic ends,” said Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hoteliers-keep-fingers-crossed-as-business-returns-slowly/story-9SgB7ObSHd5CbRDJeEuVXM.html

On Saturday, Pandey met chief minister Nitish Kumar at the party office and again dismissed speculations over his joining politic. After being the centre of the Maharashtra police versus Bihar police controversy in the investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput death case, his sudden decision to retire from his services triggered speculations.  Former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who recently took VRS, joins JD(U) at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's residence in Patna. pic.twitter.com/jtVtl6eA1U“I was called by CM himself and asked to join. Whatever the party asks me to do, I will do. I don’t understand politics. I am a simple person who has spent his time working for the downtrodden section of society,” he said. Pandey’s voluntary retirement just before the Bihar Assembly Elections 2020 set tongues wagging as political ambition is not new for this 1987-batch IPS officer. In March 2009, he took premature retirement as he reportedly wanted to contest the Lok Sabha elections on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket but was not granted one.On Saturday, the former DGP met Nitish Kumar but said it was not a political meet. “I came here to thank chief minister Nitish Kumar as he gave me full freedom to work. There was no talk related to polls and I have not yet decided on my joining the JD (U),” Pandey had said.. But JD(U) sources have confirmed that the former DGP “would be joining the party at the earliest.” Just after his voluntary retirement, a music video featuring Pandey as ‘Bihar’s Robinhood’ was released on YouTube — in what is being seen as the groundwork to build his image.Bihar is scheduled to go to the polls in three phases — on October 29, November 3 and November 7. The counting will be held on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bihar-dgp-gupteshwar-pandey-likely-to-join-jd-u-today/story-Uo6FNWCeCJsYojblvmzniP.html
27-09-2020||India||Over 70 hot springs identified in Uttarakhand and HP for power generation||Over 70 hot springs in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh with potential to generate electricity, have been identified by the scientists of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) Dehradun, said the institute. Kalachand Sain, director WIHG said they have identified around 40 hot springs in Uttarakhand and 35 in Himachal Pradesh, where thermal energy from the springs can be used to generate electricity. Sain said of the 40 hot springs in Uttarakhand, around 50% have electricity generation capabilities and further studies are being conducted on the rest of the hot springs. Similar is the status of power generation potential of hot springs identified in Himachal Pradesh. There are around 600 geothermal springs with varying temperature and chemical conditions in the Himalayas, according to the department of science and technology (DST). For many, it is a bit difficult to understand the existence of hot springs amid the snowy chilling conditions of the Himalayas.Anil Gautam, head of environmental quality monitoring group at People’s Science Institute said that hot springs are formed in the Himalayan region when water comes into contact with an underground geo-thermal point, gets heated up and comes out through a thermal vent, which is then called a hot spring. “The more and more we go deep inside the Earth, temperature keeps increasing due to different types of thermal activities already taking place under the surface of the Earth. When a water source passes nearby these zones (where thermal activities are taking place) it carries the heat along with it and releases through thermal vents as hot springs,” said Gautam. The WIHG director said this is first of its kind exercise to explore the power generating capacity of hot springs at such a scale here; which will also help in understanding practical challenges of plugging the release of carbon dioxide from these hot springs by condensing it back into the water. WIHG’s study of gas emissions from Himalayan geothermal springs has shown that they discharge a significant quantum of Carbon dioxide (CO2) rich water. Sameer Tiwari and Santosh Rai, senior scientists at WIHG working on this project, said they have selected one hot spring near Tapovan, Joshimath in Chamoli district to explore power generation in partnership with a Uttarakhand based private company named Jaydevm energy private limited.Also Read: Uttarakhand BJP to go among farmers to explain ‘benefits’ of agri bills “Geo-thermal points in the Himalayan region are scattered along the geological fault line of Main Central Thrust (the geological fault line where the Indian plate has pushed the Eurasian plate along the Himalaya), and hot springs are found along this fault line. Studying the geo-thermal points, we are finding out the reservoir energy estimate of the springs. While studying these points, we found that geo-thermal spring in Tapovan is capable of producing up to five megawatts of energy which is reserved there and can be converted to electricity. This geo-thermal energy can be used for producing electricity for the next 20 years,” said Tiwari. These scientists are now planning to build an infrastructure at the hot spring in Chamoli like a tube-well or a bore-hole where the hot water will be released and mixed with another substance with a lesser boiling point, to produce more steam to push the turbine for producing electricity. Tiwari added that this method will reduce CO2 emissions.“There will be almost zero carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere as once the vapour is used for electricity generation, it will be condensed and transferred back into the earth, maintaining the water level and stopping carbon emission.” Also Read: 949 new Covid-19 cases take Uttarakhand past 46,000-mark, 11 patients die The senior scientist further added that for using geothermal energy the cost of setting up the infrastructure is around four times higher than the thermal power plants, but once set up, the cost of production is four to five times lesser. Manoj Kohli, director of Jaydevm Energy Private Limited said that with the technical support of WIHG, they are planning to set up the geothermal electricity generation plant by the end of this year in Chamoli. “We will start working on setting up the plant after a meeting with the chief minister, for which talks are underway. The project will cost around Rs 135 crores for the generation of five megawatts electricity. For this project, we will be making two structures similar to bore-well, for production and another well for transferring that water back into the earth,” said Kohli. The turbines will be connected to a generator for electricity production. One unit of electricity produced through this method is likely to cost around Rs 4-5.5 and the rate for selling this electricity will be discussed with the state government”, he said. What is a hot spring and where it gets heat from? A generally accepted definition of a hot spring says the temperature of water coming out of a natural source should be over 36.7 degrees Celsius. When a water channel of spring gets into touch with a heat source underground, it emerges as a hot spring. According to experts, there are various sources of this heat like the decay of naturally radioactive elements underground, shallow intrusions of magma (molten rock) and tectonic activities. Also, the temperature of rocks within the earth increases with depth and if water percolates deep enough, it is heated. Water of thermal springs can hold more dissolved solids than cold water due to which such springs have high mineral content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-70-hot-springs-identified-in-uttarakhand-and-hp-for-power-generation/story-bjJX2H9EHfaFVKeycOiOJP.html

He is a former Chief Minister. Also, he is the leader of opposition in Maharashtra and Bihar Polls-in charge of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Our meeting was fixed as I wanted to take his interview for Saamna. Due to Covid-19 and other reasons, it could not materialise,” he said.“There can be ideological differences but we are not enemies. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was aware of our meeting. We were not sitting in a bunker it was an open meeting,” he added.In November last year, the Shiv Sena withdrew from NDA which ultimately led to party leader Uddhav Thackeray becoming Maharashtra Chief Minister through support from Congress, and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).Raut also spoke on the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) pulling out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).“The strong pillars of the NDA were the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal. We were in power and opposition together. The Shiv Sena was forced to exit the NDA, now the Akali Dal left it. They were with BJP since 1996. NDA has got new allies, I wish them all the best. I do not consider an alliance as NDA that does not have Shiv Sena and Akali Dal,” Raut said talking to reporters here.Days after quitting the union cabinet, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday decided to pull out of the BJP-led NDA alliance over “Centre’s stubborn refusal to give statutory legislative guarantees to protect assured marketing of farmers crops on MSP”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ideologically-there-can-be-differences-but-we-aren-t-enemies-raut-on-meeting-fadnavis/story-Bs2ogEgcxq1Gd2M7z64FuM.html

It looks like monsoon will withdraw on an above-normal note,” Palawat said.Rainfall in the range of 96 to 104 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) is considered as ‘normal’, while precipitation in the range of 104 to 110 per cent of the LPA is ‘excess’.Nine states have received excess rainfall, while 20 states have recorded normal precipitation, the data shows.The official rainfall season in India is from June 1 to September 30. Monsoon arrived over Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date.June recorded 17 per cent more rainfall, while July saw 10 per cent deficiency. However, there was an excess rainfall in August -- the month recorded 27 per cent more rainfall than normal.Parts of north India -- Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir --- have recorded deficient rainfall. The Union Territory of Ladakh has recorded high deficiency of rainfall this year.Large parts of the country in west and south India, including Gujarat, Goa, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have received excess rainfall. Sikkim is the only state to have received large excess rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-withdraw-from-north-india-in-2-days-rainy-season-to-end-on-above-normal-note/story-kCNu72HA0aZWTN54hkMsZN.html

In fact, some are voluntarily going back the lockdown road to arrest the spread of Covid-19. Unlock 4 in India commenced on September 1 and will be over by September 30 as all previous phases of the unlocking continued for a month.The Centre is not in favour of lockdown at this point of time when it is focussing on allowing more activities to boost the economy. In its Unlock 4 guidelines, the ministry of home affairs specified that there will be no local restrictions in areas which are not containment zones — without Centre’s permission.In a recent meeting with the chief ministers of seven states that are contributing maximum to the country’s Covid-19 tally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged the CMs to reassess local lockdowns and instead identify micro-containment zones so that the economic movement doesn’t get stymied.However, several administrations are choosing lockdowns instead of relaxations as people are flouting social distancing norms and the number of cases, on the other hand, is on the rise. Also Read: Fear of Covid-19 second wave in Maharashtra, says Uddhav ThackerayRaipurA total of 10 districts of Chattisgarh, including Raipur, are under complete lockdown from September 21 to September 28.

India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.” He said that even during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries.“Thank you for your commitment to solidarity, Prime Minister @narendramodi. Only together, by mobilising our forces and resources jointly for the common good, can we end the #COVID-19 pandemic,” WHO Director-General Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.Modi told the 193-member UN General Assembly that in India and the neighbourhood, “we are moving ahead with phase 3 clinical trials in India.” Modi further assured that India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of the vaccines.He, however, questioned the response of the United Nations in combating the pandemic that has so far infected over 32 million people in the world and will soon reach the grim milestone of a million deaths.“Over the last 8 to 9 months, the whole world has been battling the pandemic of the Coronavirus. Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?” Modi said.Melissa Fleming, Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications at the United Nations, said Modi’s assurance is a “welcome news” because UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had told the General Assembly in his address last week that “vaccinationalism” is not only unfair but self-defeating.With the Covid-19 pandemic soon reaching the grim milestone of a million deaths, Guterres had chided those countries who are making “side deals” to have a Covid-19 vaccine exclusively for their own populations.“Such ‘vaccinationalism’ is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe, until all of us are safe. Likewise, economies cannot run with a runaway pandemic,” Guterres had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-chief-hails-modi-s-assurance-of-india-s-vaccine-prodn-prowess-to-help-nations-fight-covid-19/story-a9xM5e0cG8KhV0MAfySVdP.html

Prasad was arrested on Saturday by the bureau allegedly for receiving contraband from suspected peddlers who had supplied charas to actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik.NCB had sought Prasad’s custody for nine days till October 5 but the court granted the agency his custody till October 3. NCB told the court that it recovered ‘one roll joint believed to be remains of smoked ganja from Prasad’s house during the search conducted on Friday.The agency in its remand application before the court claimed that Prasad’s role was revealed during the interrogation of Sanket Patel, allegedly one of the drug peddlers. Patel had allegedly claimed to have delivered Ganja (Weed) to Prasad at his residence in Andheri on the instructions of Karamjeet Singh. Singh is alleged to be a drug distributor with a local network that caters to the Bollywood fraternity.The agency further stated that Patel had confessed to have delivered Ganja around 12 times to Prasad from May 2020 to July 2020. Further, Prasad paid Rs 3,500 for each delivery of 50 grams of Ganja,” read the application of NCB which sought Prasad’s custody.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput case: Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor leave NCB office after hours of questioningThe agency further submitted before the magistrate that Prasad had admitted to taking Ganja from arrested alleged drug peddler Ankush Arneja and Singh through his associate Patel.

27-09-2020||India||Indian Army ready for winter endurance test at 5,800 metres on Finger 4 of Pangong Tso against PLA||At the height of 5,800 metres on Finger 4 mountainous spur a winter endurance test is set to take place this winter with both the Indian Army and Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) facing each other with first short snow already fallen on the Karakoram and Kailash ranges in the Ladakh region.While the winter is expected to take the turn for worse after Diwali this year, the situation on all friction points is a stalemate with PLA accusing the Indian Army of upping the ante south of Pangong Tso on August 29-30 as a result of which their claimed withdrawal plans were scuttled.The situation along the 1,597-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh continues to be tense but under control with a small detachment of Indian Army facing off a PLA detachment on Gogra Hot Springs or patrolling point 17 A. The situation on the north bank of Pangong Tso is that a small number of troops on both sides are at the Finger 4 height with PLA stationed behind finger 6 and Indian Army on finger 3. There is no PLA presence on the ground level of PLA four or five but on the dominating height of finger four.ALSO WATCH | Ladakh: With tanks, combat vehicles, Indian Army ready to counter China amid tension On the southern banks of Pangong Tso, the Indian Army is dominating the Rezang la-Rechin La ridgeline on Kailash ranges with strong positions to defend the LAC despite PLA’s presence on Black Top and Helmet with the Indian troopers in between the two at the saddle. “The situation is that both sides are defending their positions but the ridgeline in the area is with the Indian Army,” said a military commander familiar with the postures of the two armies.Although the Indian Army will have a new Ladakh Corps Commander in Lt Gen PG K Menon in place of Lt Gen Harinder Singh in October, the former is Colonel of the Sikh Regiment who dishes out the choicest Punjabi cuss words despite being from Kerala. He has a vast experience on the LAC as he was the brigade general staff (Operations) of the XIV Corps in Ladakh before commanding a division in Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh.While the PLA has deployed a brigade strength of mechanized infantry around Tien-Wien Dien across the Daulet Beg Oldi LAC, the Indian Army troops are patrolling the Depsang bulge area within the patrolling limits despite the Chinese efforts to block them. The PLA air activity in this area is more than in the south of the DBO sector due to the close proximity of the Hotan airbase in Tibet.As another round of Indian and Chinese military-diplomatic dialogue for total Ladakh disengagement will soon take place, the Indian Army commanders are prepared for the long winter ahead. From November onwards, it will be the endurance powers of a voluntary army (India) against conscript (PLA) army that will be on display. Sitting on the glaciated heights of Saltoro ridge since 1984, the Indian Army will surely give a run for money to the adversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-ready-for-winter-endurance-test-at-5-800-metres-on-finger-4-of-pangong-tso-against-pla/story-79mBhBrvFh0Zho9RU4dr9M.html

He is the leader of the Tamil race. Those who do such things thinking they are insulting him are insulting themselves,” he said and strongly condemned the incident.PMK leader S Ramadoss hit out at the defacing of the statue and demanded “strong action” against those involved.MDMK founder and Rajya Sabha MP Vaiko, AMMK leader and independent MLA T T V Dhinakaran and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, MP, also criticised the latest episode of targeting Periyar’s statue and demanded that such elements be dealt with strictly.E V Ramasamy, fondly addressed by supporters and followers in the reverential term ‘Periyar’, led a popular self-respect movement in the state based on rationalist principles and is the founder of DMK’s parent organisation, Dravidar Kazhagam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statue-of-e-v-ramasamy-periyar-found-smeared-with-saffron-dye/story-SjuMRHocYoKgxePGwdqt8O.html

27-09-2020||India||Nadda’s team has 11 leaders from UP as party eyes 2022 state polls||Uttar Pradesh featured prominently in Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda’s new team announced on Saturday, prompting experts to say it was done keeping 2022 state polls in mind.The party chose Jat MP from Fatehpur Sikri, Rajkumar Chahar, 53, to head its national kisan morcha (farmers’ wing) replacing Virendra Singh Mast, the Ballia MP. Chahar has been given a key role as the ruling party defends its agriculture sector ‘reforms’ that the opposition parties have dubbed ‘anti-farmer’ and which have sparked widespread protests against the government leading to one of the oldest NDA constituent—Shiromani Akali Dal of Punjab-- leaving the coalition. In all, 11 leaders from UP have found a place in Nadda’s team. Former UP finance minister Rajesh Agarwal, a lawmaker from Bareilly, has been made treasurer in the national body while party MP Rekha Verma, a Kurmi leader, is among the 12 national vice presidents announced by the party. Verma had defeated Congress leader Jitin Prasada, currently busy connecting with Brahmins in UP.“The team has adequate caste representation as it has a Brahmin, a Thakur, a Vaishya and an OBC. It has a Muslim too, for Syed Zafar Islam is now a Rajya Sabha MP from UP,” a party leader said, adding all regions from west to east were represented in the new team. Arun Singh, a Thakur and Rajya Sabha member from UP, has been retained as the national general secretary and office in-charge. Amit Malviya, also from UP, would continue to be the party’s IT and social media head. Of the 11 members from UP in Nadda’s team, six are MPs from the state, including two Lok Sabha members.“Before being made party chief, Nadda ji had been UP in-charge and thus the selection of team members is a clever mix of caste and regional balance,” a party leader said. Also Read: State polls, regional outreach among the key reasons for BJP team rejigRashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) leader Shiv Prakash from Lucknow is among the three co-general secretaries (organisation) in the national panel. “Despite the focus on the south, as well as induction of leaders from Bihar and West Bengal, the two states due for elections soon, there is no missing the continued focus on UP. At a time when the party is facing an aggressive opposition over its recent agriculture reforms, it has made an MP from UP its kisan morcha head. Then another leader from UP continues to head the party’s IT strategy and yet another UP leader is now the national treasurer,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political expert. Also Read: Maharashtra BJP leaders Vinod Tawde, Pankaja Munde appointed party’s national office-bearers“I would say UP’s representation has been made keeping the 2022 state assembly polls in mind and that is why Lok Sabha MPs have been given place in the national body,” he said.BJP’s Basti MP Harish Dwivedi said his appointment as national secretary was proof of the party rewarding its cadre. “I am just a simple worker and yet I have been picked as national secretary. I am indebted to the party leadership,” he said. The 23-member media team too has three faces from UP, including two Rajya Sabha members – Sudhanshu Trivedi and Syed Zafar Islam. Gaurav Bhatia is the other member on the national panel. This the first major reshuffle in the national body since 2014. Former BJP chief Amit Shah, now the country’s home minister, after taking over from Rajnath Singh, didn’t bring about any major changes in the national team, party leaders said. Vinod Sonkar, the MP from Kaushambi, who headed the party dalit morcha (wing) is now the party’s national secretary.“It’s a perfectly balanced national body,” said UP BJP vice president Vijay Bahadur Pathak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-s-team-has-11-leaders-from-up-as-party-eyes-2022-state-polls/story-pe73KMEcSkvuKaxnx9tvkJ.html

27-09-2020||India||Mann ki Baat: Farm sector playing key role in making India self-reliant, says PM Modi||The farm reforms introduced by the central government during the monsoon session of Parliament are benefitting farmers across the country and the agriculture sector is key in leading the country towards self-reliance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, days after nationwide protests were held by farmers’ groups and opposition leaders against the controversial new legislations. In his monthly radio address Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, Modi cited the examples of several states to underline how farmers had benefitted when they were allowed a choice to sell their produce directly in the market.Also read: With tweet on Covid-19 vaccine, Rahul Gandhi takes a jibe at PM’s ‘Mann ki Baat’“It is said that the one who is rooted to the ground, is equally firm during the course of the biggest of storms. In this difficult period of corona [pandemic], our agricultural sector, our farmers are a living testimony to this,” Modi said adding that the sector has been freed from restrictions.Parliament has passed three bills that the Modi government says are aimed at unleashing reforms in agriculture. While some experts have hailed the move, farmer bodies and opposition parties allege that the laws will benefit only the corporate sector and traders.The new laws aim to liberalise the agriculture sector by removing hurdles created by the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (AMPC) Act in direct procurement of agricultural produce by buyers and create a level-playing field for all, thereby allowing private players a bigger role in farm trade. Farmer bodies and opposition parties say that these reform bills take away price protection provided through MSP, whereas the government maintains that MSP will remain in place and the bills will ensure higher remuneration for farmers.“I keep receiving letters from these farmers who narrate how new dimensions are getting added to agriculture,” the Prime Minister said.Citing the example of Kanwar Chauhan in Haryana’s Sonepat district, and others who are selling directly in Delhi, Modi said: “What is different that these farmers have? They have the strength to sell their produce where they wish. Now the other farmers of the country have also got this strength. They have got the freedom to sell their produce, not just vegetables and fruits, where they want to.” “The agricultural sector of the country, our farmers, our villages are the very basis of Atmanirbhar Bharat, a self reliant India. If they remain strong then the foundation of Atmanirbhar Bharat will remain strong,” the PM said, referring the government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ [self-reliant] initiative. Modi also spoke about paying tribute to freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on his birth anniversary on Monday, saying: “Can you imagine that an [British] Empire, which ruled over a huge chunk of the world... was terrified of this 23-year-old. Shaheed Bhagat Singh was as much a fighter as he was a scholar, a thinker.”In the coming days, we will remember many great personalities who have contributed to the making of India, Modi said, adding that the country will remember its two “great sons” Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on October 2.The Prime Minister began his address by talking about the art of storytelling and its role in the Indian society. “Storytelling is as old as civilisation...I urge all storytellers to include all inspirational stories from the period of foreign rule as we are going to celebrate 75 years of independence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-farm-sector-playing-key-role-in-making-india-self-reliant-says-pm-modi/story-8MyYwCxJLp17DDB58frLLI.html

They would be given the option of arriving at these pre-decided rural destinations along the banks of the Ganga by boats.“There are several sites in rural pockets which have potential to attract domestic as well as foreign tourists. These sites have lush green and idyllic surroundings. As part of the plan, facilities for the tourists have been developed at these places. Ghats equipped with potable water facilities have been developed at Markandey Mahadev and Shooltankeshwar Temple,” regional tourism officer Keertiman Srivastava said. He expects the foreign tourist traffic to begin after the pandemic eases.“Foreign tourists would start arriving in Varanasi once the Covid-19 situation eases out. So we are working on a plan to promote rural tourism, one that would help foreigners get an idea of life in rural Varanasi and may enjoy boat rides in picturesque surroundings,” he said. But it is not just the foreign tourists that the tourism department is banking on to promote the rural circuit. There are plans to market these villages among domestic tourists as well.“Tourist guides would be involved in the whole plan as they would tell the tourists about the destinations and idyllic surroundings. So as of now, the tourists could be taken to see the village life in Kaithi, or be driven to Ramna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s adopted village Jayapur or for that matter could be taken to Kakarahia to have a feel of rural life,” he said. “So far these Kashi villages are frequented by domestic tourists, mostly from places adjoining Varanasi. Now, we will market these villages among domestic tourists. The rural tourism would also give a boost to the village economy. We plan to involve boatmen too as through them we could offer tourists the option of visiting these destinations by boats too,” he said. This morning, tourism department officials met locals in Kaithi village to raise awareness among them about importance of tourism and how to welcome tourists and attend to them when they visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-adopted-village-in-up-govt-s-blueprint-for-rural-tourism-in-varanasi-post-covid-19/story-f5zdJzjeJHxuIEw9gxCJ5N.html

In India, there has been a rich tradition of storytelling. We’re proud to be denizens of land that nurtured tradition of Hitopadesha and Panch Tantra.”- “I urge all storytellers to include all inspirational stories from the period of foreign rule as we are going to celebrate 75 years of independence. Especially between 1857 and 1947. We can introduce our new generation to them in form of stories”.- “The coronavirus crisis period has served in fostering bonding among family members, bringing them even closer.”- “There is a saying: ‘One who is grounded, stays firm during the biggest of storms’. Our farmers are a living example of this during Covid-19.”- “During corona time-period, I would once again remind you — always wear a mask, do not venture out without a face shield. ‘Do Gaz Ki doori’ will protect you and your family.

If they remain strong then the foundation of Atmanirbhar will remain strong.”- “Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts and ideas are more relevant now than earlier.

Violence erupted across districts on Thursday when the candidates of teachers recruitment examination-2018 blocked the Udaipur-Ahmedabad highway, pelted stones at the police, damaged properties and torched vehicles demanding filling of 1,167 general vacant posts with Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates. The violence continued on Friday and incidents occurred on Saturday as well. The state government on Saturday rushed three senior police personnel – director-general of police (DGP) (crime) ML Lathar; Jaipur police commissioner Anand Shrivastwa; and additional director-general of police (ADG), anti-corruption bureau (ACB), Dinesh MN – to Udaipur to bring the situation under control. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot also appealed the protesters to maintain calm, and end the demonstration, saying his administration is ready to meet all the legitimate demands, according to a statement. Governor Kalraj Mishra spoke to Gehlot on phone in Jaipur and called principal secretary (home) Abhay Kumar and ADG (law and order) Saurabh Srivastava at Raj Bhawan, directing them to control the situation, it said.On direction of the chief minister, former Udaipur MP Raghuveer Meena and other public representatives of Dungarpur district met a delegation of agitating candidates to resolve the matter on Saturday.“We have appealed the agitators to end the violence while assuring them that the government will do what is legitimate to meet their demand. The meeting was held in a positive manner,” Meena told news agency PTI.Internet services were suspended in four districts -- Dungarpur, Udaipur, Banswara and Pratapgarh -- of southern Rajasthan on Saturday and Section 144 (prohibition of gathering of five or more persons) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was imposed.Police said one of the protesters, identified as Tarun Ahari, succumbed to his injuries. It is unclear how Ahari was injured in the protest. At least six trucks, five buses, four police vehicles, nine cars, nine tempos and a motorcycle have been torched in the region over the last three days. Over 1,000 rubber bullets were fired by the police to bring the situation under control. Demonstrators have also continued protesting at NH-8 .

27-09-2020||India||Jaswant Singh, founding member of the BJP and former Union minister, passes away||Jaswant Singh, former Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet who held the crucial portfolios of external affairs, defence and finance, died after a prolonged illness on Sunday morning. Having joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as one of its early founding members after serving in the Indian Army, Singh had a bitter falling out with his party in 2014 when he was denied a Lok Sabha ticket of his choice from Barmer in Rajasthan. He contested the 2014 general election, which was his last as an independent, but lost. Singh -- considered close to Vajpayee and veteran BJP leader LK Advani -- was twice expelled from the party; in 2009, the parliamentary board of the BJP expelled him after his book Jinnah - India, Partition, Independence was published. He rejoined the party after 10 months, but faced a second expulsion in 2014 when he defied party orders and challenged the BJP’s decision of not fielding him as a contestant from Barmer.  Watch | Former Union Minister Jaswant Singh passes away, PM Modi pays tributePrime Minister Narendra Modi condoled his death on Sunday, tweeting that Singh served the nation diligently, first as a soldier and later during his long association with politics. “…During Atal Ji’s Government, he handled crucial portfolios and left a strong mark in the worlds of finance, defence and external affairs. Saddened by his demise,” the PM wrote. In separate tweets, he also said true to his nature, Jaswant Singh fought his illness with immense courage for the last six years. “Jaswant Singh Ji will be remembered for his unique perspective on matters of politics and society. He also contributed to the strengthening of the BJP. I will always remember our interactions. Condolences to his family and supporters. Om Shanti,” PM Modi said tweeted. Singh -- a four-time member of the Lok Sabha and elected to the Rajya Sabha five times -- was the external affairs minister during the Kandahar hijacking case, and had escorted Mulana Masood Azhar and two other terrorists in lieu for the release of hostages on board Indian Airlines IC-814 that was hijacked on December 24, 1999. After India conducted the nuclear tests in 1998, and the US imposed sanctions on India, Singh was the lead negotiator for talks with the then US deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott. The two-year negotiations paved the way for the visit of the then US President Bill Clinton, considered to be a turning point in India-US relations. Singh had been ill after a fall at his home in August 2014 and was admitted to the Army Research and Referral Hospital in the national capital. He had been in and out of the hospital and was re-admitted in June this year. At 82, he died of a cardiac arrest on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaswant-singh-founding-member-of-bjp-former-union-minister-passes-away/story-ISIdNURH3YKDg7Q86oEDJO.html

27-09-2020||India||SAD quits NDA: How farm bills ended friendship between oldest allies||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the oldest ally of Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), parted ways on the issue of farm bills which were recently passed by Parliament.The BJP government at the Centre has said that these landmark legislations will make farmers self-reliant.Also Read: ‘All must unite against Centre’, says SAD chief Sukhbir Singh BadalThe Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis). This, the government says, is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agri business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price. And the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potato from the list of essential commodities and will do away with the imposition of stock holding limits.The SAD had sought from the BJP-led central government not to bring the bills in Parliament till “all reservations” expressed by farmers are “duly addressed”.But when the Centre did not pay heed, the Akali Dal asked it to send these farm bills to a select committee which was also not accepted.Thereafter, Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against the bills.Also Read: ‘No morality, just political compulsion’, says Punjab CM on SAD’s exit from NDAEarlier, the SAD had been maintaining that the Centre had assured that these ordinances would have no bearing on the existing crop procurement policy.The issue had become a thorny one for SAD. According to Hindustan Times’ Hindi language publication Hindustan, staying with the government would have sent a wrong message to a big chunk of votebank in Punjab - the farmers. SAD has a grip on the Malwa region of Punjab, which is dominated by farmers. And it doesn’t want to risk the 2022 Assembly elections.The Akalis formed the government in Punjab twice before 2017. But in 2017, they only got 15 seats out of 117. Looking to come back to power, the Akalis do not want to antagonise the farmers, according to Hindustan.SAD was part of the NDA since 1997. Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal used to describe ties with the BJP as ‘nau-mass da rishta’ (ties like nail and flesh).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-quits-nda-how-farm-bills-ended-friendship-between-oldest-allies/story-Mq3KPxuwhDGk84TPvsqn7L.html

Shukla is now on a hunger strike alleging involvement of local Congress leaders and workers in the assault.Police have rejected Shukla’s allegations and claimed that the violence was the result of a conflict between two groups of journalists and cases have been registered by both sides.Shukla is one of the leading voices demanding a journalists’ protection law in Chhattisgarh, promised in the Congress party’s manifesto. He has also raised voice against alleged atrocities against tribals and journalists in Bastar region on several occasions.“I am sitting on a hunger strike in front of the district collector’s office (to protest) against the violence against me,” said Shukla talking to HT.“Police are falsely saying that the incident was the result of a fight between two groups of journalists. The accused, who they are calling a journalist, is the leader of a workers’ union and runs a newspaper. The other accused are a Congress leader and his supporters,” Sukhla said.He went on to say that he was attacked in front of the cops, who did nothing to save him.“A journalist Satish Yadav was beaten up badly by Congress workers on Saturday and I went to the police station to register a case against the accused. Yadav was writing consistently about the Congress leader, whose wife is president of Kanker municipal corporation. When we were registering a case, some goons came and started to beat me up in public.

The accused is an independent corporator who fought against the Congress. We believe that strict action should be taken against the culprits,” said Trivedi.State unit of the BJP condemned the incident and alleged that the Congress party is not willing to listen to any criticism of its government in the state.“This is gunda-raj of Congress workers in the state. The people of the state are victims of this and now journalists are also being beaten up by them,” said senior BJP leader Sacchidanand Upasane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-chhattisgarh-journalist-beaten-up-in-kanker-district-of-bastar-region/story-jDzPrH3GNKN6BQ3lpfwo5J.html

They were planning attacks at numerous locations including Delhi-NCR, Kochi and Mumbai.In a statement released after the arrest of the nine suspects last week, the NIA had said, “As per the preliminary investigation, these individuals were radicalised by Pakistan-based al Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Region. For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fundraising and a few members of the gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10th-al-qaeda-operative-part-of-group-planning-to-trigger-attacks-in-india-arrested/story-6HUe6G8DR8C6ZUb1RT4nRN.html

Modi’s outreach talk that focuses on a range of subjects will broadcast on All India Radio, DD and Narendra Modi mobile app at 11am. “Do join tomorrow, 27th September at 11 AM. #MannKiBaat,” PM Modi wrote on microblogging site Twitter on Saturday. The programme will also be streamed live on the YouTube channels of AIR, DD News, PMO and information and broadcasting ministry.In his previous address, the Prime Minister had called for startups in the country to come together to make India a manufacturing hub for toys. “India should become a hub for toy production,” he had said, adding that the global toy industry is over Rs 7 lakh crore but India’s share is very small and the nation will have to work to increase it.“Some areas are being developed as toy clusters. The best toys are those which encourage the creativity of children,” he added, suggesting startups to “team up for toys”. Come, let’s play,” he had said.Modi had also renewed his pitch for the nation to become self-reliant across all domains. “At a time when Atmanirbhar Bharat is becoming a mantra of the people, how can any domain be left untouched by its influence?,” he said He had also suggested people to bring home dogs of local breeds. Modi had also highlighted the potential of the country’s young people by drawing attention to the ministry of electronics and information technology’s Atmanirbhar app challenge launched on July 4 that threw up alternatives to popular applications such as Twitter and TikTok.Mann Ki Baat’s latest episode comes a day after the Prime Minister’s pre-recorded video address to the UN General Assembly where he expressed his concerns about the pace of reform of the United Nations its response to challenges such as terrorism and the Covid-19 pandemic. Modi’s speech focussed largely on the need to reform the UN with him saying today’s world and contemporary challenges are significantly different from those of the era when the body was created in 1945.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-69th-episode-of-mann-ki-baat-programme/story-b1wwVaMTJYbeotBK7lzJFO.html
27-09-2020||India||PM Modi pledged that every poor person will have a roof over their head by 2022: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged that by 2022 every poor person in the country will have a roof over their head. “Now our Prime Minister has pledged that by 2022, when the country will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of independence, then every poor person in the country will have a roof over their head. The country had to wait so long for this economic planning. Whereas Deendayalji was saying the same thing in the 1960s,” Singh tweeted (roughly translated from Hindi).“Today, in the Deendayal Smriti Lecture, I spoke on the topic of ‘Sankalp Bharat Ka Sankalp’. The relevance of the national goals that Deendayalji had set after attaining independence has not diminished from any point of view. Those goals are important in fulfilling the resolve of self-reliant India,” he tweeted. Deendayal Upadhyaya had said that there should be a system that protects political freedom, Singh added. “For this, an ordinary Indian can also get a chance to live a life of honor. Prime Minister Modi has started many schemes, due to which the poor of the country have an account in the bank, have gas facility in their homes, electricity facility in the villages, road facilities, now internet facility is being provided,” Singh tweeted. In a country where half of the population are farmers, agriculture was neglected for such a long time that farming became a profitable business. Due to vested interests, agriculture and farmers of this country have never been given the land where the farmers of this country can also get the full fruits of their hard work, the defence minister stated.Now, Prime Minister Modi has taken some such steps which will help the farmers of this country to get a better price for their produce, he added. “In the last session of Parliament (monsoon session), two agricultural bills have been passed, through which farmers have got freedom to sell their produce in the true sense,” Singh wrote. “Our commitment for the welfare of the farmers of India dates back to the days of Deendayal Upadhyay. No one can deter us from this path. For the first time after independence, Atalji had made the country’s village, poor and farmer the centre of his policies. Now Modiji is working on the same path and in a big way,” he added. “Recently, I released a negative list of 101 defense equipments, through which this policy was decided, that all these equipments and platforms will no longer be imported in India. Only one decision has led to manufacturing opportunities of Rs 52,000 crore in a year,” Singh tweeted. The Defence Minister further stated that the second major policy announcement in the defense sector is the approval of FDI up to 74 per cent in the field of defense. This has made the path of ‘Make in India’ easier for foreign defense companies as well. Soon we are also going to introduce new Defense Production and Procurement Policy.“Self-reliance is very important in the field of defense. A country that depends on imports for its defense equipment will never be strong and self-respecting. Therefore, being self-sufficient in the defense sector is linked to the ‘self-respect’ and ‘sovereignty’ of our country,” Singh tweeted. “Today at the UNGA meeting, Prime Minister has kept the points of people of India with full clarity and strength. Today, the whole world has heard and appreciated his message as the lofty voice of self-respecting India. I heartily congratulate him for his effective address,” he added.

27-09-2020||India||Govt needs Rs80,000 crore over next year to vaccinate everyone against Covid-19: SII chief||India will need to spend around Rs80,000 crore over the next year to give the Sars-Cov-2 vaccine to all its citizens, the chief executive of Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) said in a tweet on Saturday, while asking the government whether it is prepared for such funding. SII is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer and has partnered with multiple vaccine manufacturers that have candidates in clinical trials, including a widely watched one by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. If any of these vaccines are approved, SII is expected to produce around 400mn of them by the end of the year. “Quick question; will the government of India have 80,000 crores available, over the next one year? Because that’s what @MoHFW_INDIA needs, to buy and distribute the vaccine to everyone in India. This is the next concerning challenge we need to tackle,” said SII’s CEO Adar Poonawalla, while also tagging the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) twitter handle.He was quick to add another tweet explaining the reason behind him asking the question.“I ask this question, because we need to plan and guide, vaccine manufacturers both in India and overseas to service the needs of our country in terms of procurement and distribution,” Poonawalla said.Officials in the PMO refused to respond to queries on the tweet. Experts indicated the government will need to step in over the pricing issue as well. “Forget about it. The vaccine will have to be taken over by govt and reasonably priced providing it free to the poor and govt health care givers... the rest pay and buy as per the administered price. Can perhaps be covered under Insurance to be examined,” K Sujatha Rao, former secretary of health and family welfare ministry, said in reply to Poonawalla’s tweet.It was not immediately clear how Poonawalla arrived at the figure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-needs-rs80-000-crore-over-next-year-to-vaccinate-everyone-against-covid-19-sii-chief/story-tMrQwGl2wuVgfndNqfrWsM.html
27-09-2020||India||Suit seeks removal of mosque in Mathura||A civil suit was filed before the court of Civil Judge, senior division Mathura on behalf of child deity, Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman on Friday seeking removal of the Shahi Idgah Masjid which stands adjacent to the Sri Krishna temple complex at Mathura, and claiming ownership of the entire 13.37 acres land which is believed to be birthplace of Lord Krishna.The suit comes 10 months after a case filed on behalf of child deity Ram Lalla succeeded before the Supreme Court in relation to the disputed site at Ayodhya, with the top court ruling in favour of Ram Lalla on November 9, 2019. The suit has been filed through the next friend (a legal term for a person who represents someone directly unable to maintain a suit) of the deity, Ranjana Agnihotri, an advocate and a resident of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. Six other devotees are also plaintiffs to the suit.“A suit filed before Mathura civil court on behalf of Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman seeks a declaration that the entire 13.37 acres of land be vested in the deity and also for cancellation of collusive compromise decree,” said advocate for the plaintiff, Vishnu Shankar Jain.Jain’s reference is to a settlement entered into between the Shri Krishna Janamsthan Seva Sansthan which is the governing body of the temple complex and the Committee of Management of Trust of Shahi Idgah in 1968 based on which the dispute regarding the land was settled.The UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, the Idgah Trust, Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and another trust Shree Krishna Janambhoomi Trust have been made defendants to the suit which claims that the Idgah Trust encroached upon the land belonging to Shri Krishna Janamasthan Trust and the deity and erected a super structure at the place.The birthplace of Lord Krishna lies beneath the structure raised by the trust, it added.As per the suit, the recent history of the temple complex can be traced back to 1618, when Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela of Orchha built a temple dedicated to Lord Shri Krishna at the latter’s birth place by spending the equivalent of ₹33 lakh. This temple was partly demolished in 1669 on the orders of Mughal ruler Aurangzeb and the Idgah mosque was built. After Marathas came to power in 1770, the temple was restored, it said.Later the area fell into the hands of East India Company in 1803, which auctioned it in 1815. It was purchased by Raja Patni Mal of Banaras.In 1944, Rai Kishan Das and Rai Anand Das, the heirs of Raja Patni Mal, executed a sale deed on consideration of ₹13,400 (paid by Jugal Kishore Birla) and the ownership of 13.37 acres was transferred in favour of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya, Goswami Ganesh Dutt and Bhikhen Lalji Aattrey.“Name of Sri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust is entered as owner and right has been granted to offer ‘namaz’ on Eid at the Eidgah site which is owned by us. Muslims should voluntarily give away their claim for amicable solution,” Gopeshwar Chaturvedi, Shri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust member said.  Tanveer Ahmed, Secretary at Shahi Masjid Idgah in Mathura said there is no dispute. “Mathura is land of peace, those in politics are not in favour of peace and are raising the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suit-seeks-removal-of-mosque-in-mathura/story-7NAouMj59EnwRxpguZAlmO.html
27-09-2020||India||JP Nadda sets up new BJP team||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced a new team nine months after the party appointed JP Nadda as its new president that comprises 12 vice presidents, eight general secretaries, three national joint secretaries and 13 secretaries, with almost 60% of the office bearers being new. Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha Saroj Pandey and Anil Jain, and Ram Madhav and P Muralidhar Rao have been dropped as national general secretaries, but their exclusion has sparked speculation of a coming cabinet reshuffle, with some of them being accommodated. Also read: State polls, regional outreach among the key reasons for rejigThe changes have seen the appointment of party functionaries from election-bound states of Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala in key roles -- a clear indication that the changes are being made with an eye on coming assembly elections.  “Effort has been made to ensure there is representation from all regions of the country, from North-East to the Southern states. In keeping with the BJP’s concerted attempt to give young people more opportunities; the average age of this team is much lower than the previous teams,” said a party functionary who asked not to be named. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his congratulations to the team and said: “I am confident they will uphold the glorious tradition of our Party of serving the people of India selflessly and with dedication. May they work hard to empower the poor and marginalised.” The new team includes MP Dushyant Kumar Gautam, a Dalit leader, D Purandeswari from Andhra Pradesh, CT Ravi, an MLA from Karnataka, Tarun Chugh from Punjab and Dilip Saikia an MP from Assam in the list of the national general secretaries. All are new entrants. Kailash Vijayvargia, Bhupender Yadav and Arun Singh have been retained as national general secretaries. Among those dropped, while Madhav was in charge of the North Eastern states and Jammu and Kashmir, Rao was in charge of Karnataka and Rajasthan. Pandey and Jain were in charge of Maharashtra and Haryana. “New faces have been given a chance; dropping of some names from the national general secretaries list does not imply a falling-out of favour,” said a second BJP functionary who asked not to be named. The BJP has also announced the appointment of Rajesh Aggarwal, a former cabinet minister from Uttar Pradesh as the treasurer of the party; the post had been vacant since 2014 after the incumbent Piyush Goyal was appointed a minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet. Sudhir Gupta, an MP from Madhya Pradesh where several assembly seats are up for by-election, will be the joint treasurer. There are several additions in the list of national vice-presidents, including West Bengal leader Mukul Roy. A former TMC leader, Roy’s appointment has scotched speculation that he will break away from the BJP in the election-bound state where friction within the party unit has become a cause for concern for the central leadership. Roy’s appointment however led to Rahul Sinha, who was dropped from the team to post a video to express his disappointment. A person familiar with the developments in the state said the changes have created friction in the state unit, as both Roy and Anupam Hazra who has been appointed national secretary are former TMC leaders. Former Chattisgarh CM Raman Singh and former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje remain national vice presidents as does Baijayant Panda. Nadda is shortly expected to announce the states that the party’s general secretaries will be in charge of. This will be followed by appointments of officer bearers at the state level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-sets-up-new-bjp-team/story-J2Bi17zmEdtyW6fdDHbqRL.html

Sunday is also when the number of confirmed infections in India is likely to cross 6 million, as its fatality count nears 95,000.“Unless we do it all, (2 million deaths) ... is not only imaginable, but sadly very likely,” Mike Ryan, head of the UN agency’s emergencies programme said late on Friday, while adding: “We are not out of the woods anywhere.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Overall, there are at least 32 million confirmed infections, according to worldometers.info. Three countries – the United States, India and Brazil – have been the worst hit, recording more than 17 million infections between them, and together accounting for nearly 55% of all cases and over 44% of all deaths in the world. In India, the total number of infections crossed 5.99 million on Saturday after 88,951 new infections were recorded in the past 24 hours. The country at present has 957,414 active cases and the number of deaths is 94,539 — fast approaching the 100,000 mark by adding an average of 1,109 deaths a day in the past week.India has had the worst Covid-19 outbreak in the world since the first week of August, accounting for more than a quarter of all recorded since then. In the past week, nearly one in every three (29.9%) new infections reported in the world and one in every five deaths (20.9%) have come from India.But, in what has been seen as a silver lining, there has been a recent drop in daily infections. The seven-day average of daily cases dropped for the 10 consecutive days leading to Saturday — something that has never happened since the outbreak started in India in March. Over these 10 days, the seven-day average of daily new cases of Covid-19 has fallen by over 8,900. India has conducted over 70 million tests for the detection of Covid-19 till now, with the country’s testing capacity having crossed 1.4 million tests daily.

27-09-2020||India||Janata lockdown in Madhya Pradesh town as Covid-19 takes turn for worse||Traders associations, public representatives and others in Narsinghpur town, 241 km south east of Bhopal, have come forward to declare a one-week Janata lockdown in the district to check the spread of coronavirus over there. The district reported as many as 2126 Covid-19 cases with 13 deaths till Friday evening as per the state government’s data. While the Janata lockdown decision was announced by representatives of traders associations in the town on Friday, traders associations of Gadarwara and Gotegaon, two other towns in the district, joined the self-lockdown campaign on Saturday, as per associations’ representatives and the district administration. With the Covid-19 situation getting worse by the day in the state traders associations and others in certain pockets of other cities like Indore, Jabalpur etc took decisions on self-lockdown in the past one week or so but Narasinghpur in Mahakoshal region happens to be the first town in Madhya Pradesh where different traders associations and public representatives came together to impose self-lockdown restrictions in the Unlock period for one week at a stretch which are as good as lockdown restrictions, said Ashish Jain, grocery association office-bearer in Narasinghpur. “The administration didn’t enforce it at all. It’s good to see public representatives led by local MLA Jalam Singh Patel and traders associations coming forward to take the decision on their own. The associations pertain to cloth merchants, ornaments, grocery etc. However, there is no restriction on supply of milk, sale of vegetables and medicines or other essential commodities. At the same time, there is no punitive action against anyone if he is running his shop”, said collector, Narasinghpur Ved Prakash. In Jabalpur, another city in Mahakoshal region, jewellers association, medicine dealers associations and certain other traders associations observed self-lockdown in the third week of September. The other towns in Jabalpur district where people imposed self-lockdown include Sihora, Patan and Gosalpur towns in the district for certain days this month. In Indore which saw self-down in different pockets of the city earlier as many as 20 traders associations came forward a few days back to declare self-down on Saturday and Sunday in the entire city, a decision which was appreciated and supported by the district administration. Ramesh Khandelwal of Ahilya Chambers of Commerce said, “We are making constant appeals to traders to comply with the self-lockdown decision which is in the interest of all in the city.” However, differences cropped up too among traders over the issue of self-lockdown. Indore’s Maharani Road Electric Appliances Market Association’s patron Jeetu Bagani said, “The sale at our shops has been reduced to merely 10%. Now, festivals are approaching. Lockdown has already broken our back. Hence, we are not supporting the self-lockdown.” In Sagar, Panna, Damoh, Tikamgarh and Chhatarpur cities in Bundelkhand region several traders associations observed self-lockdown on different days this month. Welcoming the decisions taken by the traders associations in different parts of the state a senior government official said, “Coronavirus is spreading mainly because people are not following safety protocols. It is not only Madhya Pradesh but also other parts of the country which are witnessing alarming spread of Coronavirus. People will have to understand that the government has its own limitations of resources and there is no medicine or vaccine so far to cure the disease. Hence, the decisions taken in different parts of the state on self-lockdown will definitely help all of us.” As per the health department’s bulletin released on Friday night, Covid cases tally touched 117588 with 2227 cases reported in the past 24 hours. There were 30 deaths reported from across the state in the past 24 hours to increase the tally of deaths to 2152. So far, the state has seen recovery of disease of 93238 patients while the number of Covid tests conducted till Friday night stood at 1929748.

27-09-2020||India||Delhi reports 46 Covid-19 deaths, highest toll in 72 days||With 46 deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Delhi saw the highest single-day fatalities in 72 days, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The city had reported 58 deaths due to the viral infection on July 16 during the previous surge in cases. So far, 5,193 people have died of the infection in the city. With this, the seven-day case fatality ratio (CFR) – the fraction of people who died among those who tested positive – went up to 1%. The average seven-day CFR has been increasing steadily over the last two weeks, from just 0.68% recorded 14 days ago. “The city had seen an increase in the number of cases, with over 4,000 cases being recorded each day. However, the patients admitted to the hospitals do not die on the very first day; they die over a period of time which is probably the reason for the increase in the number of deaths that we are seeing now. With the number of cases now slowly stabilizing, I think the number of deaths will also be controlled over the next week or so,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung Hospital. The cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of the total number of cases and deaths reported in the city – however has been on a steady decline, with the figure standing at 1.94% in Saturday’s bulletin. This indicates that a higher proportion of the deaths in the city happened during the surge in cases in June and July. The highest number of deaths reported in a day during that period was 101, according to data provided by the chief minister’s office. Dr Gupta said, the hospitals are slowly reporting a decline in the number of serious patients. The daily health bulletin shows that the number of hospitalisation as on Friday was 6,840, which was lower than the 7,019 hospitalisation on average reported during the last seven days. The number of cases also saw a dip in Saturday’s health bulletin, with only 3,327 new Covid-19 cases being reported in the city, despite over 57,000 samples being tested. The positivity rate – fraction of samples that return positive among the total samples tested – has also seen a decline, with it dipping below 6% for the first time since mid-August when very few cases were being reported. The positivity rate stood at 5.77% as per Saturday’s health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-46-covid-19-deaths-highest-toll-in-72-days/story-VUvjPQTVnrwrMZFwCQDngI.html
27-09-2020||India||Akalis quit NDA over farm bills||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said on Saturday it was exiting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition at the Centre after Parliament’s approval of three contentious farm bills, days after the party’s lone minister in the central government resigned from the Union Cabinet over what the party said were “anti-farmer” laws.All leaders at the SAD’s emergency core committee meet late on Saturday were unanimous in deciding that the party can no longer be part of the NDA, its president Sukhbir Singh Badal said.Parliament has passed the three bills that the Narendra Modi-led government says are aimed at unleashing reforms in agriculture. While some experts have hailed the move, farmer bodies and opposition parties allege that the laws will benefit only the corporate sector and traders.While announcing the decision to snap its 24-year-long ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the SAD cited “injustice to farmers, Sikhs, Punjab and the Punjabi language”. “The core committee decided unanimously to pull out of the BJP-led NDA alliance because of the Centre’s stubborn refusal to give statutory legislative guarantees to protect assured marketing of farmers crops on MSP [Minimum Support Price] and its continued insensitivity to Punjabi and Sikh issues like excluding Punjabi language as official language in Jammu and Kashmir,” said a statement issued by SAD spokesperson Harcharan Singh Bains after the three-hour-long meet.The SAD, a long-time constituent of the NDA, and the BJP have been allies since 1996, when they forged a pre-poll alliance ahead of the 1997 Punjab assembly elections that brought them to power. In a statement, Badal said that the SAD will continue to stand by its core principles of peace, communal harmony and guard the interests of Punjab, Punjabi in general and Sikhs and farmers in particular. Last week, the SAD’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned as the Union minister for food processing in protest against the three farm bills that were later passed in the monsoon session of Parliament.The new laws aim to liberalise the agriculture sector by removing hurdles created by the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (AMPC) Act in direct procurement of agricultural produce by buyers and create a level-playing field for all, thereby allowing private players a bigger role in farm trade.Farmer bodies and opposition parties say that these reform bills take away price protection provided through MSP, whereas the government maintains that MSP will remain in place and the bills will ensure higher remuneration for farmers.Badal said the new laws on agricultural marketing are lethal and disastrous for the already beleaguered farmers. He said the SAD was the oldest ally of the BJP but the government did not listen to it on honouring the sentiments of farmers.Responding to the developments, BJP national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said: “Farm bills are for the benefit of the farmers… MSP was an administrative mechanism, which will continue to be operational as earlier. The Akali Dal’s apprehensions are uncalled for. Hope they will realise it and come back to the NDA fold. But our government will continue on the path of farmers’ welfare and take steps to increase agriculture sector income.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akalis-quit-nda-over-farm-bills/story-lsvL3rGoqp5g3XE0CUoAWL.html

27-09-2020||India||Amid rising demand for treating Covid-19 patients, pharma authority caps price of medical oxygen||The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), which regulates drug prices in the country, has capped the prices of medical oxygen and oxygen cylinders over complaints of black marketing and hoarding, in view of the increased demand for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.The price, at present, has been capped for a period of six months. Officials familiar with the matter said that the move was aimed at ensuring the availability of medical oxygen at reasonable prices, as many states are dependent on medical oxygen supply from other states.“As of now, there is no supply shortage. However, since major oxygen manufactures in the country are not equitably distributed, it is pertinent to take proactive measures to ensure there is no shortage in future also, considering the demand is increasing because of Covid-19,” a senior government official familiar with the issue said, requesting anonymity.Delhi, for instance, does not have an oxygen manufacturing unit, and gets its supply from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Punjab gets its supply from Haryana; Madhya Pradesh from Rajasthan, Gujarat from Maharashtra; while Andhra Pradesh and Telangana get most of their supplies from Karnataka.The demand for medical oxygen has gone up almost four times, from 750 metric tonnes per day to 2,800 metric tonnes daily, causing a strain across the production and supply chain. “During COVID, the supply of medical oxygen through cylinders has increased from 10% to around 50% of total consumption. Price regulation at this end is imperative for the continued availability of medical oxygen across the country,” the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers said in an official statement.Adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19, with about 6% of the Covid-19 patients, including those in intensive care units (ICUs) and on mechanical ventilators, requiring oxygen therapy at any given time.An empowered group at the Centre responsible for looking into this issue had recommended that the NPPA consider capping the ex-factory prices. Officials cited above said the Union health ministry gave a free hand to NPPA to take necessary steps to immediately regulate the availability and pricing.A statement by the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers said, “The Authority deliberated upon the matter in its extra ordinary meeting held on 25.09.2020. It has been decided to invoke extra-ordinary powers in public interest, under Para 19 of DPCO, 13 and under Section 10(20) (l) of Disaster Management Act, 2005 to deal with the emergent situation arising due to the pandemic.”As a result, the ex-factory price of liquid medical oxygen at the manufacturers’ end has been capped at Rs15.22 per cubic metre, exclusive of GST; and the ex-factory cost of medical oxygen cylinder at the filler end has been capped at Rs25.71 per cubic metre, exclusive of GST.The Centre has also constituted an inter-ministerial empowered committee to take measures, including setting up a control room to monitor supply and demand of oxygen on a real-time basis, to ensure availability. The committee comprises members from the Union health ministry, department for promotion of industry and internal trade, department of pharmaceuticals and ministry of textiles, among others.The measures taken by the committee include the provision for a 24x7 green corridor for movement of liquid medical oxygen tankers between states, so that there is an “unrestricted and unhindered” movement of tankers. The entry of heavy vehicles ferrying the tankers into the city limits during the day has also been permitted, to cut down on turnaround time.States have also been advised to ensure facility-wise or hospital-wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning, for timely replenishment so that there is continuous availability. Also, micro-level planning is to be done to maintain oxygen pipelines and oxygen manufacturing units, so that there is no leakage of oxygen.Critical care specialists say it is important to ensure a seamless supply of oxygen during the current pandemic.“Unhindered oxygen supply is critical in saving the lives of Covid-19 patients. In moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, the lung cells don’t participate in normal functioning that results in lungs failing to take up oxygen from the blood and also not being able to remove carbon dioxide from the blood. It leads to oxygen levels dropping in the blood, for which oxygen support is given externally to compensate for the impaired lung function,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-authority-caps-price-of-medical-oxygen/story-LvfdGHhKJZIe4Ta2l4FyjP.html
27-09-2020||India||Centre orders early procurement of paddy in Punjab, Haryana at MSP||The Union government has ordered early procurement of paddy in Punjab and Haryana at minimum support prices, a move widely seen as being aimed at reassuring agitating farmers about the sanctity of the procurement system through notified market yards run by agricultural produce market committees (APMC).Harvests of paddy, the key summer-sown staple, have begun arriving at mandis, or APMC markets in Punjab and Haryana, prompting the government to start the procurement process through the Food Corporation of India, a government order said on Saturday. In other states, procurement of paddy will begin on October 1, it added. Interestingly, protests against the recently passed farm reform bills have been the most intense in these two states. “Agencies including the Food Corporation of India are in a state of readiness for smoothly undertaking procurement operations,” a government notification said.Also read| ‘MSP not most preferred mode for farmers in Uttar Pradesh’: NITI Aayog study“In view of early arrival of paddy in the ‘mandis’ of Haryana and Punjab, Government of India has approved the commencement of procurement operations for paddy/rice immediately in both these states from today i.e. with effect from 26th September, 2020 to ensure that farmers are facilitated in selling their produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP) expeditiously,” the notification added.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pushed three farm bills through Parliament to deregulate the trade in agricultural commodities. The Opposition has accused the government of passing the controversial farm reforms in a haste without scrutiny of a parliamentary select panel. Also read: Here’s why farm protests have been loudest in Punjab, HaryanaFarmers on Friday blocked roads and rail lines in protest against the bills. The reforms will replace a socialist-era regime that required farmers to sell their crops to licensed middlemen at state-run APMC market yards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the bills “historic”, insisting that freer trade will benefit farmers by allowing better price discovery in newer tax-free markets, where they will be able to engage with buyers outside the APMC system.Also read: Paddy procurement to commence in Haryana from Sept 27The reforms have stoked anxieties among farmers — particularly in the food-bowl states of Punjab and Haryana — about whether the state-owned Food Corporation of India will continue to buy agricultural products at minimum support prices set by the government. The government has targeted to procure 31% of total paddy from Haryana and Punjab. It has targeted to procure 113 lakh tonnes of rice from Punjab and 44 lakh tonnes from Haryana during the kharif procurement season. Total rice procurement target has been set at 495.37 lakh tonnes for the whole country for the 2020-21 kharif season. This is the second procurement-related move taken by the government to reassure protesting farmers in recent days. On September 21, it made an advance announcement of MSPs for several winter-grown crops. Economists have said liberalising farm trade is critical to boosting productivity and bring private investment in post-harvest infrastructure to increase rural incomes. “The broader reforms are aimed at corporatisation of the agriculture sector, which need not be a bad word. Ultimately, there has to be a market clearing mechanism for agricultural trade. The government clearly wants to send out a message that, despite the reforms, MSPs and the procurement mechanism will remain intact,” said R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-orders-early-procurement-of-paddy-in-punjab-haryana-at-msp/story-dgfB7KMOABGtxy9Q69YwEO.html
27-09-2020||India||State polls, regional outreach among the key reasons for BJP team rejig||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s new team of national office bearers has some surprises , but the composition of the team is in line with the party’s established approach of always keeping an eye on elections, rewarding those who join the fold, and focusing on communication and outreach. Almost 60% of the team is now, and the 70-member team has 12 women as well as representatives from scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes. Eye on elections The presence of representatives from states that will pick new assemblies over the next year is an indication that the party is already in election mode and preparing for major poll battles in states such as West Bengal and Kerala. Representatives from the election-bound states of Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala are conspicuous by their presence on the team, which took over nine months to finalise. A notebale exclusion is that of functionaries from Tamil Nadu, which also goes to polls in 2021. As against three and two members from WB and Kerala respectively and five from Bihar there are none from TN.  The party has pitched itself as a contender for the seat of power in West Bengal; it has dislodged the Congress as the prime opponent of the Pinarayi Vijayan Government in Kerala. In Tamil Nadu, where its chances of becoming a strong political force is still weak, there is speculation that the party is playing a role in bringing together warring AIADMK factions. The AIAIDMK has been supportive of the government in Parliament and has lent support for the passage of critical bills, including the recent farm laws. New believers While the BJP leadership asserts that the team has been picked for ensuring regional balance and the optimal mix of social groups, the elevation of t those who joined the party after 2014 has stoked some unrest. The picks from West Bengal, former TMC leaders Mukul Roy and Anupam Hazra, have proved contentious already . BJP leader Rahul Sinha who was dropped from the list was the first off the block to criticise the appointment of former TMC leaders instead of loyal RSS and BJP workers. In Kerala too, the party has picked a former Congress leader Tom Vadakkan and a former Congress and CPM leader Abdullah Kutty riling the state unit. Both the West Bengal and Kerala units of the party are rife with factionalism. Regional Balance The regional balance and the outreach towards the North Eastern states has also been ensured with the naming of two representatives from Nagaland. While well known faces from the South, Ram Madhav and Murlidhar Rao have been dropped as national general secretaries; representation has been maintained through the nomination of representatives from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. Communication Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated instruction to party members to communicate with the electorate at regular intervals has meant that the party has to undertake massive outreach campaigns not only ahead of elections or policy announcements, but to counter the opposition’s narrative in real time. On Friday, the PM gave direction to party workers to counter the opposition’s criticism of the farm bills. The party has a long line-up of spokespersons and it is not surprising that it has strengthened its team of national spokespersons. The new team has 23 members, up from the previous 11, and includes three former ministers and 9 MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-polls-regional-outreach-among-the-key-reasons-for-rejig/story-kQOq8gsKClc0RA0G1MsMqO.html
27-09-2020||India||In 9-page letter, Mamata Banerjee warns Governor Dhankhar of legal consequences||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in a nine-page letter, has warned Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar of legal consequences and has accused him of trying to destabilise an elected government. “You have passed judgments on the current state of affairs of our state in the following words ‘safe haven to terror, crime, flourishing illegal bomb-making, corruption’ etc. Such unsubstantiated statements without evidence or mere imputations are absolutely false and baseless and may cause unnecessary panic among common people and cause loss of life, for which law will hold you responsible,” the letter stated. On September 19, after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested six alleged Al Qaeda operatives from Murshidabad district, Governor Dhankhar, in a series of tweets, had alleged that the state has become a “home of illegal bomb-making”. Also read: ‘No morality, just political compulsion’ - Punjab CM on SAD’s exit from NDA“Thus with due respect to your August post, in the interest of the people of West Bengal and the Constitution, I request, air and advise you in the capacity of the chief minister of this state, to act within the mandates of the Constitution and refrain from acting on a political mandate, if any, to destabilize a democratically elected government,” Banerjee wrote in her letter. Late in the night, Dhankhar tweeted that he would respond on Sunday.  As communication @MamataOfficial has found way in public domain I seek media to focus on my eye opener note @WBPolice Significantly, unlike her earlier physical stance in support of cop ⁦@KolkataPolice⁩, this time defence is by way of letter.

Even though the letter didn’t clarify who is A Singh, a senior police officer said that it was Arjun Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker. “This is illegitimate and reeks of favoritism. Further, the accused, by successfully obtaining the Governor’s extra-legal intervention and interference, has actually put the Governor in a dangerously precarious position which might have consequences under the law,” the letter stated.

Would respond to CM.” The acrimonious relationship between Raj Bhawan and the government has been making headlines since last September with the TMC accusing Dhankhar of overstepping his limits and interfering in day-to-day affairs of the government. Expressing her “pain and anguish” the chief minister also wrote in her letter that the governor is like the “British Crown” and has no right to interfere with the day-to-day administration of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-9-page-letter-mamata-banerjee-warns-governor-dhankhar-of-legal-consequences/story-mj3PjZEex7MHHaohbVrhQO.html

The prize is given to scientists below the age of 45 years for outstanding research in seven fields – biology, chemistry, environment science, engineering, mathematics, medicine and physics. In a small ceremony to mark the 79th foundation day of CSIR on Saturday, health minister Harsh Vardhan felicitated the winners as well as those of six other awards.The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize includes a Rs 5 lakh award and a citation that was given to two researchers from each of the seven fields .“The present time is a difficult time. It has been nine months that we have been continuously engaged with the fight against Covid-19. Apart from the health ministry, the whole scientific community of India has been serving the cause of mitigation of Covid-19. Now, the Feluda paper diagnostic kit in the offing, and I am very eagerly waiting for it as it will revolutionise the testing capability and capacity,” said Harsh Vardhan, the union science minister, at the event.

27-09-2020||India||Stopping a Covid-19 generation of stunted children essential||The take-home rations programme under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) was halted for the first three weeks after the lockdown, following which the government and partners swung into action to ensure they reached beneficiaries, which are upwards of 70 million children and 17-19 million women. “Many states started giving take-home rations on a fixed day, some like Telangana used volunteers to distribute to homes. But even with the best efforts, the reach has not returned to pre-Covid levels. If take-home rations over the past seven months reached 50% of beneficiaries of pre-Covid days, we should accept it as success,” said Dr Rajan Sankar, director, The India Nutrition Initiative, Tata Trusts. Under the take-home ration programme, energy-dense micronutrient fortified extruded blended food (Balbhog) is given to children between the ages of seven months and three years (seven packets to normal weight, 10 for severe underweight) to meet their nutritional requirements. Initiatives such as these have helped bring down stunting (low height for age) from 48% in 2005-06 to 34.7% in 2018, and a close to 10% decline in underweight children, with 33.4 per cent children recorded as underweight in 2018.But with 50 million children remaining stunted (low height for age), India still accounts for a third of the global burden of childhood stunting. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “The first two months after lockdown were a nightmare, and take-home rations stopped completely. Raw materials were not available, markets were closed, transport stopped, staff and self-help groups were afraid of infection and did not know the safety protocols or what to make. There were lots of practical problems, which got streamlined by the middle of May. If anything, it proved the need for decentralisation and standardisation,” Sachin Jain, Right To Food campaign activist in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Since March, millions of India’s poor have been depending on rice, wheat and dal (lentils) given under the public distribution system, which does not meet the nutritional needs of pregnant women and children under three years. Experts fear it will lead to a surge in underweight, stunting and wasting among children, low birth weight babies, anaemia, and low body weight adolescents and adults. “India took two decades to bring down low birth-weight in children. This will be the first thing that will go up. Underweight and stunted children will grow up to be small adults and they will have small children. So, we will have a Covid generation of underweight adults who will produce one more generation of underweight children. We have to really work to prevent this, and hopefully plasticity may help overcome the nutritional deficit,” said Sankar. Plasticity is human adaptability to adapt to changing environment. Poor nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life causes irreversible damage to the child’s physical and mental development. Undernourished children are physically smaller than average and have weaker immunities, raising their chances of getting infections, including life-threatening ones such as pneumonia and diarrhoea. Each episode of diarrhoea leads to a child losing vital nutrients from the body, with repeated infections leading to stunting and wasting. The Covid-19 setback will make it tougher to achieve India’s national nutrition mission vision 2022 gals to lower undernutrition by 3% each year and decrease anaemia in children and women by a third. “It will take anything from between three and six months (to reach pre-lockdown beneficiaries), if we make a sincere attempt to start doing it for all services to ensure optimally nutritious food reaches children, and pregnant and lactating women,” said Shankar. India’s ICDS programme is the world’s biggest food supplementation programme that targets children in the first 1,000 days of life, pregnant women and women in the first six months after delivery to lower food insecurity and protein-energy malnutrition. Since 1975, hunger has reduced dramatically in India, which calls for a need to focus on nutritionally-optimal supplementation to also meet micronutrient deficiencies so that it supplements a poor diet being eaten at home, and does not simply replace it with another poor diet.An obvious way to supercharge supplementation is by fortification, which can be done at the smallest self-help group level with standardization and training. “Supplements with empty calories should not be used, we should have a balanced energy-protein supplement with the right nutrients. No new research is required, we know what is needed, it just needs to be changed. We have a programme, we have the budget for it, we just need to correct it to make it nutritionally optimal. The moment we do it and show it, it will work,” said Sankar. Using the same food for mothers and children doesn’t work as children between six months and two years require highly nutritionally dense food because they eat less than adults. Since the nutritional requirement per kg of bodyweight is much higher for children, giving them adult food children doesn’t provide them the required calories or vitamins and minerals to develop. ICDS ration must be especially prepared for children in much smaller quantities for optimal growth and development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopping-a-covid-generation-of-stunted-children-essential/story-gs7Mq97KCkaAhini8cfCiJ.html

India will also help cold chain and cold storage facilities of other nations as well,” he added.India has said more than four vaccines against Covid-19 are in advanced stages of pre-clinical trial in the country. The government is also closely tracking the progress of candidates being tested by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited and Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is one of the frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has struck a production and clinical trials deal with AstraZeneca for the UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin will begin its Phase III trials in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow and Gorakhpur. Serum Institute of India will also begin its Phase III trials of the Covishield vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University at Sassoon General Hospital in Pune.PM Modi also called for a stronger global response towards the Covid-19 pandemic. In his speech, he questioned the United Nations, “Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?”Globally, more than 32.8 million people have been infected with Sars-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, of which 994,503 people have lost their lives. India has recorded 5,903,932 cases so far with 93,379 people dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-vaccine-production-delivery-ability-will-pull-the-world-out-of-covid-19-crisis-pm-modi/story-SFvJFx9rz2xBB9xpxU8DiK.html

27-09-2020||Today's||Aaditya Thackeray writes Maharashtra’s Safarnama on World Tourism Day||In these turbulent times, where we find ourselves confined in our living spaces, I have realised how important it is to fulfill the urge of travelling. In all these times when going has got tough, I have often found myself reflecting on my previous travels. Last year this time, I was on a State-wide Jan Ashirwad Yatra. During the course of my travels, I journeyed through Konkan’s stunning coast, addressed rallies in the backdrop of Sahyadris’ astonishing green peaks, experienced the diverse culture of my home state, had the most delectable meals, and prayed in the rhythm of the metronome of clanging bells at temples that have lasted centuries. Fast forward to today, as a minister for tourism, I am striving to bring all these experiences to people across the world in the most seamless way.My firm belief is, travel- tourism- hospitality is one sector which may be our biggest saviour in a post-CoViD-19 world in terms of generating opportunities for employment and bringing revenue to the state. Therefore, before we enter a post-CoViD-19 world, it’s our effort at the tourism department to ensure that we are ready for the sector’s lift-off. Maharashtra with all its grandeur, natural beauty, and warm hospitality has been home to many from across the country, especially for those who arrive here with aspirations and ambition. Now we are getting ready to host the curious, the backpackers, the luxury seekers, the wanderers, the lazy and the athletic, the religious, the spiritual and all those who are seeking an experience of a lifetime. To achieve this, we want to enable every segment in the travel space through policy reforms. The strategy is twofold, ease of travel and stay, and ease of doing business in the travel industry. In the hospitality sector too, we are working on bringing down licenses to as low as single digits. We’re working with the best minds and doing all in our scope to ensure that through the tourism ministry, we facilitate the tourism sector to bring world-class services to the tourists, create opportunities for employment, and achieve overall economic and sustainable growth.In these pandemic-stricken times, we are preparing ourselves to give tourism a lifelong boost. Currently, we are doing this through policy reforms that should have ideally been in place decades ago. In the last few months, our department has made numerous policy initiatives including the beach shack policy, which will encourage our people from the beautiful coastline to offer local delicacies to the world, to water sports on Maharashtra’s beaches. We have also passed the Agri– Tourism Policy. This will facilitate homestays in farms and encourage villages to open their lands to tourists who want to engage in experiences like strawberry picking, mango plucking, learn more about the organic lifestyle, and many such activities. Besides, we are also introducing a Caravan policy to enable those, who are fascinated by the idea of sleeping under the night sky. We are encouraging adventure activities and formalising trekking circuits in Maharashtra, especially in the Sahyadris that is dotted with forts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. As the department, we plan to systematically move from micro-management to being enablers, so as to let the best in the business set up and operate in Maharashtra. The MTDC presides over a bunch of hotels and land parcels that occupy some of the most majestic tourist locations in the state. We want to revive these hotels and bring greater revenue to the State. While MTDC also maintains the presence of extremely affordable hotels in Maharashtra, we also are looking at expanding luxury resorts, to bring in the luxury seekers to land their chartered planes into Maharashtra.Sindhudurg, traditionally, has been tagged as the tourism district in Maharashtra, but it never has got its due. Right after the MVA Government took over, two five star luxury hotels have already signed in. Few more are on the way, along with the Chipi airport, Mumbai-Goa coastal highway, the beach shacks, agri-tourism, and water based activities. Tadoba, where the majestic tigers are sighted more often currently than anywhere else, is also attracting luxury hotels because of the outreach of the MVA Government’s tourism department. These are just two examples of a multi pronged, multi faceted tourism policy we are pursuing in Maharashtra. Coastal tourism, adventure activities, trekking, spiritual tourism, health tourism, eco tourism, heritage tourism, urban and rural tourism and the list goes on.This land of Shakti and Bhakti has much to offer to the world.The last 9 months of our administration at the tourismdepartment has been probably its most active time in the history of the state. CM Uddhav Thackeray ji, DCM Ajit Pawar ji, Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat ji are wholeheartedly supporting each and every effort of the department to ensure that we welcome tourists to our state and take the wonders of our beautiful state to the world. This is just the beginning of our work in the quest to open Maharashtra to the world. My colleague minister Aditi Tatkare and I are firm in our belief that tourism, while helping economic growth should also go hand in hand with sustainable development, and that is the way to move forward.As we move ahead into the near future and hopefully inch towards a post COVID world soon, we look forward to celebrating this beautiful state and its warmth with the world. Tourism is like a sponge, it can go on absorbing more revenue, employment, and capacity, unlike any other sector. In a world that is coming so close in travel and communication, with everything on our screens, we strongly believe that experience is still an urge of human nature, and that is highly possible only through tourism. In this vast expanse of opportunities and experiences that the travel and tourism space offers, I invite everyone to join us in our endeavour to transform Maharashtra’s tourism for tomorrow.

27-09-2020||Editorials||China’s push to be a climate leader | HT Editorial||China’s recent declaration that it will aim to be carbon neutral by 2060 has created a stir. Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared his country would slightly better its Paris Accord pledge by reaching peak carbon emission before 2030. There are many devils in the details, including what Beijing defines as carbon neutrality or peak emissions, but this could well be a major turning point in environmental history. China produced 9.8 gigatonnes of carbon last year, a little less than the combined carbon emissions of the United States, European Union and India.Mr Xi, not known for his environmental concern, will have multiple reasons for the announcement. One is to place China firmly in a global leadership role when it comes to climate. Mr Xi’s announcement will help boost a Chinese image much tarnished by its bullying neighbourhood policy — and its handling of the coronavirus epidemic, which originated in Wuhan. Another is to help boost China’s already considerable capabilities in green technologies such as electric vehicles, solar power plants and batteries. Green tech will determine manufacturing competitiveness in the coming decades.India has not shirked its responsibility when it comes to climate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been an outlier among other leaders in his commitment to decarbonising India. But China’s promise is a reminder that India can do more. The next economic stimulus should be infused with a more radical commitment to greening the power sector and a recognition that climate-friendly economics can be a large job creator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/china-s-push-to-be-a-climate-leader-ht-editorial/story-eX3waQ2l6ZEKoLHmHpmThL.html
27-09-2020||Editorials||Address farmers’ issues now | HT Editorial||The three farm bills piloted by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to liberalise agricultural trade and passed by Parliament, overriding demands by the Opposition for greater scrutiny, are a done deal. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are continuing to protest the bills, fearing deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful corporate agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before, but it is unlikely this will force the government to have a rethink. The reforms have cost the Bharatiya Janata Party one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which has quit the ruling alliance. Farm reforms have been long overdue in India, but the government’s new farm laws have become contentious for two reasons: one, they do not guarantee acquisition of farm produce at the minimum support price (at least, not in letter); and two, the manner in which they were pushed through, by a dubious voice vote, ignoring calls for parliamentary oversight, even voting. A prolonged agitation by farmers can impact rabi or winter-sown farm operations, hamper procurement of kharif or summer-sown crops and delay the benefits that should accrue from the reforms themselves. Reforms can’t be forced on a sector that still employs the poorer half of all Indians. Mere laws cannot change ground realities or alleviate India’s agrarian distress if the farming community doesn’t perceive them to be beneficial. The agriculture sector has been the only bright spot in the Indian economy, growing 3.4% in the June quarter, as the overall economy contracted 23.9% due to the widespread lockdown. It will have to keep up the momentum to protect rural incomes, even as the wider economy heads for a rare recession. The government must, therefore, resolve this crisis. The government ought to have agreed to the Opposition’s demand to send the bills to a select committee for greater scrutiny. And it should have written in the concept of support prices into the laws. These would have reassured agitating farmers, satisfied critics and made regulatory oversight more robust. One way to do this is by framing appropriate rules to operationalise the farm bills that provide for a strong regulatory mechanism to ensure that private agribusinesses don’t act as the new overlords.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/address-farmers-issues-now-ht-editorial/story-oov5IHBUiYkRLxHuFojVyI.html
