The 2005 amendment and the subsequent SC ruling are significant steps towards removing gender-based discrimination in HSA. However, the provisions of HSA which govern the devolution of property of a deceased woman are still firmly rooted in outdated assumptions. These provisions treat the Hindu joint family, traditionally led by a patriarch and lineage traced through exclusive male relations, as central to all matters of inheritance. Therefore, HSA tries to retain property within the husband’s family as far as possible when a woman dies childless. This results in unfair discrimination against the woman’s natal family. Even when the woman has acquired the property through her skills and efforts, the husband’s natal family has a stronger claim over it than her parents. However, there is no reciprocal provision for the property belonging to the husband. The notion that the law should preserve property in a Hindu joint family is based on two outdated assumptions. First, that the joint family is the most relevant and important unit of societal organisation among Hindus. Second, that women do not have the wherewithal to acquire and manage their property. Both these assumptions are out of touch with today’s reality. The joint family is becoming increasingly irrelevant as an institution. According to the Census, the average family size of Hindu households reduced from 5.16 persons per household in 2001 to 4.9 persons per household in 2011. According to the Census, the median family size in urban areas has dropped below four. This is part of a larger trend of reduction in family size over the years and shows just how irrelevant joint families have become. Even the Hindu Code Bills committee expressed the same opinion in its 1944 report. BN Rau, the chair of the committee (and who would later play a pivotal role in drafting the Constitution of India), noted that the institution of a Hindu joint family is outdated and should be abolished. The assumption that women do not have the capacity to acquire, hold, and manage their property is refuted by examining the socio-economic status of women today. The Hindu Code Bills committee, however, called this argument specious in its report. Proponents of this argument pointed to the low literacy rate among women as a justification. But the Committee refuted it by pointing out that the literacy rates among men were not significantly higher either. Regardless, HSA, as passed by the Parliament, included the problematic provision. Today, far more women are employed than they were at the time when HSA was enacted. The workforce participation rates for women have increased from 12% in 1971 to 25% in 2011, according to Census figures. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 reports that 28% of women (between the age of 15-49) own land – either jointly or by themselves – and 37% own a house (jointly or by themselves), 53% of women have savings accounts in banks. They own 21.5% of all proprietary establishments in the country, according to the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation. Their literacy rate has increased from 9% in 1951 to 65% in 2011. They now represent 46% of the total annual enrolments in higher education, and are 53% of the total post-graduate degrees awarded every year. This change in the status of women demands a fundamental change in the treatment of their property under the law. While some would argue that this provision only kicks in after their death, the lack of ability to provide for their natal family even after their death vis-a-vis a man’s ability to do the same impacts how women’s overall role is perceived in society. Further, there are three demographic trends that add to the urgency of this reform. First, according to the Census 2011, there were 49.5 million women in India who were or had been married, and had no surviving children, up from 24 million in 1981. Second, India’s total fertility rate declined from 5.91 in 1960 to 2.51 in 2017, which means that women have fewer children today than they used to in the past. Third, the number of widowed women in India increased from 24 million in 1961 to 43 million in 2011. The increase in the number of widowed women far outstrips the increase in the number of widowed men. This is likely in part because the average life expectancy for women is higher compared to men, and the rates of remarriage for women are far lower. Put together, this means that the pool of women who are widowed and do not have children will likely be higher in the future than it is today. It is this growing pool of women who are, and will continue to be, affected by HSA’s discriminatory provisions. The assumptions in HSA that govern the devolution of women’s property are no longer valid. We must acknowledge the reality of society and treat women on par with men in all spheres of life, including in matters of property devolution.

10-09-2020||News||Autonomous bodies are crucial to the government’s functioning. Streamline them||The Union textile ministry recently abolished the All India Handicrafts Board, Handloom Board and the Power Loom Board in consonance with the government’s vision of minimum government, maximum governance. The ministry also changed the status of the eight Textile Research Associations to “approved bodies”, instead of the earlier “affiliated bodies”. Thereafter, the government withdrew the officials of the ministry of textiles from the governing bodies of these textile associations. This is a bold step in achieving leaner government machinery and to introduce systematic rationalisation of government bodies. The intention to review the “other” government organisations has been evident for quite some time. In the 2016 Union Budget speech, then finance minister Arun Jaitley announced that a task force has been constituted for rationalisation of human resources in various ministries. He also contemplated a comprehensive review and rationalisation of autonomous bodies. Ministries and departments frame policies and ensure their implementation. They are supported by a number of organisations such as autonomous bodies, statutory bodies, subordinate and attached offices, and affiliated organisations, etc. Their mode of establishment and funding, and functional autonomy differs. Autonomous bodies (ABs) are a major stakeholder in the government’s functioning as they are engaged in diverse activities, ranging from formulating frameworks for policies, conducting research, and preserving the cultural heritage, etc. Institutes imparting technical, medical and higher education fall in this category. Most of the ABs receive money from the Central Government by way of grants-in-aid (GIA). Since 2016-17, the Union budget accounts for the GIA figures to ABs separately. As per statement no. 24, 2017-18 (revised estimates), the amount disbursed to autonomous/grantee bodies was Rs 799.55 billion, which, in 2019-20, was increased to Rs 943.84 billion. These ABs employ a sizeable number of people as well. The apex administrative body of ABs is called governing council or governing body and is chaired by the minister or the secretary of the respective ministry. Besides, the ABs have specialised committees such as the purchase committee, works committee, finance committee, with nominated ministry officials. These ABs are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), and the annual report is presented in the Parliament every year. Despite a laid out administrative structure in ABs, there are a number of governance issues that needs review. On one side of the debate are proponents who believe that since these bodies are funded by taxpayer’s money, they should follow the policies of the government and be accountable the way the government departments are. Others claim that they being “autonomous” have the right to make their own financial and administrative policies. Obviously the stronger side wins, as autonomous bodies are not clearly defined. To compound matters, the exact count of ABs is not known, with estimates ranging from 400 to 650 plus. Then, ABs employ a considerable number. For example, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, an AB under the ministry of agriculture, has almost 17,000 employees. However, unlike the government and the public sector undertakings, in which the recruitment rules are uniform and the recruitment is done by a centralised body such as the Staff Selection Committee (SSC), the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and the Public Enterprise Selection Board, there is no such body for CAB recruitments. As a result, the mode of recruitment and recruitment rules differs for each of these bodies, sometimes even across ABs within the same ministry. Finally, there is an accountability issue. Even though the senior ministry officials are required to attend ABs’ committee meetings, they mostly don’t due to their busy schedules. They nominate junior officials who often lack the jurisdiction to take meaningful decisions during the meetings. As regards audits, some ABs are audited by CAG whereas many are done by chartered accountants. There is, thus, an urgent need to review the governance of ABs, and devise uniform procedures. First, a legal framework to describe an AB should be drawn up, which defines the boundaries of its working, its autonomy, and the various policies that it must follow. This will simultaneously help identify the numbers. Based on a laid-out framework, each ministry will need to undertake a comprehensive review of ABs under their jurisdiction. ABs that have outlived the cause for which they were established may need to be closed or merged with a similar organisation or their memorandum altered as per the new charter. There are others who have changed course over time. The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, for example, works in the field of art education of teachers and is under the ministry of culture, whereas integrating art education in school-learning is the primary domain of the education department (earlier the ministry of human resource development). Second, in order to bring about uniformity in the policies, a task force needs to be set up under a pan-Indian agency such as SSC or UPSC to streamline the recruitment rules, salary structure, allowance and perks paid to employees, and mode of recruitment. Third, to ensure the participation of ministry officials, committee meetings of similar ABs should be held together so that the appropriate authorities could provide meaningful suggestions. It is also alleged that most of the agenda items raised by ABs are routine in nature. This should be discouraged, and only the important policy issues that need the ministry’s intervention should be taken up in such meetings. And, finally, a one-time performance audit of ABs should be undertaken by an independent agency. CAG had done an exhaustive performance audit of autonomous scientific bodies in 2016, highlighting the gaps in their performance. Such a theme-based audit should be done for other ABs as well.

Officials said that if they find violations, then the schools will be asked to remove it, and if this is not done then action would be taken for violating the terms of agreement. The authority has given land on lease to educational trusts in sectors 3, 4,5,6,7, 7 extension, 9, 9A, 10, 10A, 14, 15 part one and two, 17, 21, 22 and 23. Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer I, HSVP, said that an official will look in detail into the issue. “We have sought information on nine points pertaining to building plan and in case any violation is found it will have to be removed so that should confirms to the approved plan,” he said. The official said that the illegal constructions were apparently made in the common areas of the school premises and, in case of emergency, it could hamper the evacuation of children. As per the rules of HSVP, a school which obtains land from the authority on concessional rates has to admit 10 percent students from economically weaker section (EWS) category and only the fee prescribed in government schools could be charged from them. Gogia said the schools will also be asked to submit details on admissions to students from the EWS category. “This is an important issue and if there are violations here, it too will attract appropriate legal action,” he said.Last year also the authority had issued notices to schools and sought information regarding the admission to students from EWS category. “Due to the Covid 19 pandemic this year a lot of parents are in distress and seeking admissions under this category and we want to ensure that schools which have taken land from HSVP admit these students promptly,” said Gogia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-inspect-34-pvt-schools-for-building-plan-violations-ews-admissions/story-t9UyJekMAsDFHQkImZySIN.html

According to the department’s officials, this exercise will help prevent registries of unauthorised structures. They added that these maps, along with the markings, will be shared with other civic agencies and police so that areas prone to unauthorised development are identified with ease and can be monitored and regulated in a better manner. The department will also identify and mark colonies where demolition drives have been carried out earlier. Earlier on Tuesday, the department also updated its website, enabling it to accept online applications for issue of no-objection certificates to buyers and sellers, who are seeking to get registration of property done from the revenue department. Under the new property registration regime implemented by the state government, an NOC from DTCP is necessary to get an appointment for property registration.“The purpose of the exercise is to keep a strict watch on unauthorised colonies and prevent registration of small plots in violation of rules, which leads to development of unauthorised colonies. The work has been started and it will be completed in the next one week,” said Ravi Sihag, senior town planner, Gurugram, adding that the information will be shared with all departments so that unauthorised colonies can be identified. According to DTCP’s estimates, over 100 unauthorised colonies have come up in the district in the last one year itself.RS Bhath, district town planner, said that the enforcement wing of the department has also carried out demolition drives against these unauthorised colonies on a large scale. He further said the recent ban on registration of unauthorised plots will further help in curbing unauthorised colonies. “In the next two weeks, large scale demolition drives have been planned to curb unauthorised colonization. On Tuesday, four unauthorised colonies were demolished in Pataudi, which were being developed over 15 acres. Plinths, walls and 10 under construction structures were demolished,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-dtcp-to-mark-unauthorised-colonies-on-district-urban-plan-more-demolition-drives-on-the-anvil/story-fofJEauSmSFXO9ZE6XzGDJ.html

The police said the accused men are yet to be identified, adding that the local police and crime branch teams are conducting the probe. According to the police, the incident took place around 3 am when the dairy owner, Saroj Singh, who also has a house on the dairy farm, went to a room, where labourers had been asleep, to call them for some chores. In the police complaint, she said that she called out for the labourers but there was no reply. “When I entered the room to check, I was alarmed to see that two labourers and the driver had been tied up and gagged by armed men. I started yelling but the accused men pointed a gun against my head and threatened to kill me. They tied my hands and as I was lying on the floor, they kicked me and slapped me. They were carrying guns and knives. Five of the accused then went towards my house while the other two stood next to us,” she said. The police said the accused men rummaged through the house and broke the lock of an almirah, eventually decamping with ₹4.5 lakh cash, gold and silver ornaments, at least two mobile phones and keys of a car. A police official, requesting anonymity, said, “We have recovered a bag, allegedly belonging to the accused men, from the spot, which they may have dropped in haste. The bag contains three cartridges of ammunition, which have been sent for forensic examination. The suspects are yet to be identified.” The police said the victim filed the complaint late on Wednesday night after her relatives from Jamalpur arrived. A case was registered against the accused men under sections 395 (dacoity), 397 (robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), section 458 (lurking house trespass or house breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 25/54/59 of the Arms Act at Farrukhnagar police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farruknagar-armed-dacoits-tie-up-victims-decamp-with-cash-gold-and-car/story-bg8vFvLoayAyUFyLo0Li7I.html
10-09-2020||Gurugram||Residents of JMD Gardens demand transfer of maintenance to the RWA||The residents of JMD Gardens on Sohna Road have been protesting outside the office of the developer located inside the residential complex for the past two weeks, demanding the transfer of maintenance to the residents’ welfare association(RWA). According to the residents, although the possession of flats was handed over to the 500 homebuyers of the complex in 2010, the transfer of maintenance is yet to take place. The residents said for the past five to six years, they have been fighting for the transfer of maintenance. Richa Agarwal, a resident, said for the past two weeks, they have been peacefully protesting against the builder asking for their right to have better maintenance services. Residents said, despite paying a monthly maintenance fee of ₹5,000 per house every month, the residents are being denied of proper maintenance services. “This protest will continue until the developer hands over the maintenance to the RWA , addresses the shortcomings in the construction, and gives a complete account of the money collected from the residents. We have already met the local MLA, the deputy commissioner and have even reached out to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) several times, requesting their support,” said Agarwal, adding that in February 2019, the DTCP had issued a letter asking the builder to hand over the maintenance to the RWA. However, in a meeting held at the office of the DTCP IN 2019, in which home owners were also present, the representatives of the developer had questioned the legality of the RWA and said that the matter was sub judice. They, however, had assured that they would abide by the directions of the DTCP, said officials familiar with the matter. Gopa Kumar Warrier, a resident, said there are several maintenance issues with the society. The lifts are in poor shape and are often dysfunctional. “The lifts often get stuck in between floors. There is a continuous seepage of water in the basement of all towers and sometimes the sewage leaks on the roads. We need a solution to these problems,” he said. The residents further said that the developer has substantially reduced its staff, including guards, gardeners, electricians, housekeeping, and plumbers, over the last few years. The RWA had to employ its own gardeners, they added. RS Bhath, district town planner (DTP), when asked about the matter, said that a meeting of the residents and developer will be called within a week. “The process to transfer the maintenance to the RWA will be initiated and the issue will be resolved in the next 15 days,” he said. Sunil Bedi, chairman and managing director of JMD Group, did not respond to phone calls and messages, seeking his response on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-of-jmd-gardens-demand-transfer-of-maintenance-to-the-rwa/story-z8opPQ8XE2MNIF57vBKjcK.html

The MCG will be floating a tender in this regard next week.“The bids for the tender will open on September 16 following which a concessionaire will be finalised for the project. The main aim behind this project is to increase the city’s public transport options as well as reduce the overall pollution in the city,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.As per Sharma, a route feasibility study would also be carried out by the concessionaire, to determine the areas for where e-rickshaws are severely needed so that routes can be accordingly determined. He further said that for all the MCG e-rickshaws, fixed fare rates would also be decided, according to distance.“We will be the regulatory body for this project. Although the contractor would be purchasing the vehicles on subsidised rates as well as selecting the drivers and maintaining the vehicles, the MCG would be finalising the routes and the fares for this project. This way, we will ensure that the facility is provided in areas with dire-need of public transport while also making certain that the fares are capped and residents aren’t paying an exorbitant rate to avail the facility,” said Sharma. It is not the first time that the MCG has come up with a plan of starting its own set of e-rickshaws with a private contractor. In September 2016, the then MCG additional commissioner, Amit Khatri, who is currently the deputy commissioner of the city, had come up with a plan of starting 1,000 app-based e-rickshaws in the city along with an app-based company that would provide last-mile connectivity to residents from areas located near rapid metro stations. This plan, however, never came to fruition, and the same company launched 500 e-rickshaws a year later at all Delhi metro stations in the city, in partnership with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).MCG officials said they aim to phase out diesel autorickshaws in the city that are considered to be highly-polluting. Last November, citing high pollution levels and the banning of diesel auto-rickshaws across NCR cities by Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), the district administration, Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB), and Gurugram traffic police had jointly started a campaign to help convert an estimated 20,000 autorickshaws from diesel to the cleaner CNG. “We will be reaching out to diesel auto drivers to join the project by informing them that with this mode they will not only be helping the environment by cutting down pollution levels but also save them running costs as they no longer would be needing to pay for diesel to run their vehicles,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-introduce-e-rickshaw-services-to-cut-pollution/story-LyDC6yQQVbBT8A5fV4WP4I.html
10-09-2020||Gurugram||Ggm records: highest single-day testing, highest single-day cases||Thursday was a day of records for Gurugram -- at 309, it had the sharpest spike in Covid-19 cases and at 3,188, it was the highest tests done in a day. The boost in testing numbers comes after the state government permitted walk-in for Covid-19 testing without any prescription.The numbers are according to the state daily health bulletin. The total case count in the district is now 14,295. The daily positivity rate stands at almost 11%, while the number of active cases is 1951 (13.64% of the total cases). Cases in Gurugram had seen an an uptick in May and June but by mid-July, a steady drop in cases was noticed. There were only 650 active cases in the August first week. After mid-August, however, cases saw an upward trajectory with more than 100 new cases being reported in a day. By September first week, more than 200 new cases started emerging in a single day. The daily growth rate is almost 2% now. Testing upOf the total tests on Thursday, 2159 were conducted in government labs and 1,029 in private labs. Out of the total samples, 1900 were tested through the “gold standard” Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing method and 1,288 through the less accurate but faster Rapid Antigen Test (RAT).  On August 7, the state health department following the advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued an order allowing coronavirus tests without prescription in government and private facilities. Before that, government lab at Civil Hospital, sector 10 was conducting an average of 2000 tests and private labs were administering 400-500 tests. The gradual increase in the testing has begun from August 22. Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, said, “There are multiple reasons for increased testing. With daily increase in the cases, there has been increase in the contact tracing. More people are getting tested who have come in contact with an infected person. Secondly, walk-in for Covid-19 testing has given a boost to private labs.” The union ministry of health and family welfare and ICMR on Thursday wrote to all the states asking them to establish a monitoring mechanism at the district level to follow up with cases that test negative on an antigen test. These teams ensure retesting of all symptomatic negative cases with RT-PCR testing. Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer, was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-records-highest-single-day-testing-highest-single-day-cases/story-DQGfedr5d4nvBWzA367I2M.html
10-09-2020||Gurugram||PHCs, private labs in Gurugram see a rise in people seeking Covid-19 tests||In the two days since Haryana removed the mandatory prerequisite of having a doctor’s prescription to undergo a Covid-19 test, primary healthcare centres (PHCs) and private laboratories across the district have seen an influx of patients seeking to get tested, revealed data from the health department. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram confirmed that this was the case, and estimated that between 300 to 400 people, who may otherwise have earlier faced restrictions in doing so, have come forward since Wednesday to get tested. As a result, Gurugram district on Thursday collected 3,188 samples (its highest ever in a single day), while private labs collected nearly a third of these. Until September 8, private labs were collecting between 500-700 samples per day, district health bulletins show. This number jumped to 972 samples on September 9 and 1,029 samples on Thursday. Rishabh Rajput, director of Covid-19 and microbiology divisions at Modern Diagnostics, a certified testing lab in Jawahar Nagar, said, “We are expecting even more people to undergo tests in the coming days. The barriers have been removed, both in terms of money and prescription requirement. The last two days have definitely been busier for us. We’re conducting more tests and attending to more inquiries from customers.” A similar trend was also seen at district PHCs and testing camps in containment zones, according to health department staffers deployed in the field. Anantha K, a senior lab technician, who has been with the district health department for over a decade, said, “On Wednesday, there was a noticeable increase in people wanting to get tests done. Thursday was slightly more crowded. A few people were entirely asymptomatic with no recent illness, but eager to get tested anyway. Most others were showing symptoms or said they have recently fallen ill. We administered either a rapid antigen or a RT-PCR test depending on the condition of the patient.” While the health department continues to rely heavily on rapid antigen tests — 1,157 of 2,159 samples collected on Thursday were for antigen tests — private labs said they have been seeing a greater demand for the more reliable RT-PCR tests, which take a day to provide results. “Very few people are asking for antigen tests, and almost everyone who does also asks for a RT-PCR test as well,” said a staffer at another private laboratory in Budera, seeking anonymity. Experts believed that removing barriers to testing is an important intervention, at this juncture when Gurugram is reporting it’s highest daily increases since the beginning of the outbreak. “One, this move will help destigmatise tests and encourage people who need one to access it. The second thing is that you are also changing the nature of the testing pool. A more random sample should bring down the positivity rate and also give us a truer sense of what the mortality rate of Covid-19 really is,” said Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, a Gurugram resident and vice president of research and policy at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/phcs-private-labs-in-gurugram-see-a-rise-in-people-seeking-covid-19-tests/story-FlmQ5nxnLTcRUuuXkdA5UK.html

However, waste disposal continues at the secondary dump situated below the bus stand flyover. The members of scooter market association have also been objecting to the same.The tribunal, in its orders dated September 8, told DC Varinder Sharma and PPCB to verify the facts of the complaint and file an action-taken report in two months.The next hearing of the case has been scheduled on December 14.The petitioner, advocate Gurinderpreet Singh said, “Despite the numerous complaints made in the past and protests staged by social activists, the MC has failed to shift the dumping site, which results in unhygienic conditions in the area and spreads foul smell. We were forced to move the NGT, which has sought a report in the matter.”Scooter market association president Satinderpal Singh said, “An open garbage dump near the market creates a lot of nuisance. The road between Bhai Chatar Singh Park and the dump also gets blocked as garbage is strewn around on the road by rag-pickers. The dumping site should be shifted as shopkeepers and visitors are living under the threat of an epidemic.”When asked about the garbage mess near the park, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The MC is working to install static compactors under the smart city mission. Open garbage dumps would cease to exist after compactor installation. Also, no garbage is being dumped inside the park and the park is also being rejuvenated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/garbage-dump-near-chatar-singh-park-ngt-directs-ludhiana-dc-ppcb-to-submit-action-taken-report/story-BvOBX80wgId2MXJYh4PoqI.html

Mayor Balkar Sandhu and councillor Jaspal Giaspura inaugurated the road work.The residents had been raising a hue and cry over the pathetic condition of all the three roads — including the main road (PSPCL office road), Oswal road and a road at the backside of Avon Cycles —leading to Giaspura area. Accidents, including overturning of loaded vehicles, were a frequent affair on these stretches due to deep potholes.On August 11, members of Samajwadi Party had staged a protest against the state government and MC’s failure in constructing the roads. Following this, the residents of different areas, including Jeet Singh Colony, Azad Nagar and Amardas Colony, had also protested outside the office of area MLA Balvinder Singh Bains stating that the roads were in a bad condition for years and the authorities had failed to find a solution to the problem.Councillor Jaspal Giaspura said, “The road construction had got delayed by three months due to a contractor who was laying sewer lines on the stretch. He did not complete the work, so the task was handed over to a different contractor. The road construction work commenced on Thursday and will be completed in 45 days. It will be a huge relief for the residents. Re-carpeting and other road repairs would be started in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-commences-construction-of-giaspura-main-road/story-r8kgCBhOe5s6dsWIJyOngI.html

When the cops intervened the mob turned on them after one Gurpreet instigated the horde.The mob tore the ASI’s uniform and tossed his turban. They then dragged him on the road with his hair. It was only after sarpanch Amarjit Singh came to the ASI’s rescue did the attackers desist. The ASI had to be hospitalised as he was grievously injured in the attack. Other police personnel were able to escape. The accused also vandalised the cops’ vehicle.

This also raises questions on the working of senior officials, including branch head and the zonal commissioner, as they were unaware of the fact that the machine, which was allotted to the inspector, was in possession of the suvidha kendra employee. Moreover, there was no check on the recovered amount being submitted into the MC account on a daily basis.”“This has resulted in harassment of residents. They had paid their dues through the respected employees, but now they have received inflated bills as the amount already paid by them did not reach the MC. If no action is taken against the employees in a few days, I will raise the matter before the higher authorities,” the councillor added.When asked, mayor Balkar Sandhu said additional commissioner Rishipal Singh is conducting an inquiry into the matter and 48 other machines which have been allotted to MC employees are also being checked. “Action would be taken against the guilty officials after the inquiry is completed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-5l-embezzlement-in-mc-cong-councillor-seeks-action-against-employees-higher-officials/story-jKzNVUx9ka0KL50pXVLk1M.html

During the meeting, it was decided that the vigilance bureau will first take permission from the financial commissioner (taxation) before initiating any inquiry against the department officials.Earlier, the protesting employees had stated that FIRs are still being registered against them on flimsy grounds and arrests are also being made. Search operations are being conducted in officials’ houses, which is humiliating. Recently, the vigilance bureau had also conducted raids in Transport Nagar and a few other areas.Deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) Rajpal Khaira said, “The strike has come to an end the office is now open with 50 percent staff. Few works like issuance of permits etc were affected due to the strike, but there was no revenue loss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-excise-officials-end-strike-resume-work-with-50-staff/story-xJrVs3X9uCvIKKItixsC8K.html

The trains ran on a curtailed schedule -- morning (7am to 11am) and evening (4pm to 8pm). On Thursday, the Red Line saw a ridership of 8,037, as per a DMRC update at 7.30pm.The Violet Line between Kashmere Gate to Ballabhgarh was also resumed on Thursday.A DMRC spokesperson on Thursday said that with the services available on most of the Metro lines now, the total ridership on Thursday was 84,841 till 7.30pm, including 31,234 on the Blue Line.With the opening of the Red Line, all DMRC stations in Ghaziabad, including Vaishali and Kaushambi on the Blue Line opened for service. The drop in ridership was another sign that the economy, limping slowly back to pre-Covid times, was yet to run on full power.“There were very few passengers in the morning though the opening of Metro has eased travelling,” said Amit Sharma, a commuter from Patel Nagar. “Before the pandemic it was easy to board the train, but now with so many procedures in place, the entry time has increased.” The Red Line is of particular importance to residents of Ghaziabad city and Sahibabad through stations at Shaheed Nagar, Raj Bagh, Major Mohit Sharma Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Mohan Nagar, Arthala, river Hindon and Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda. Javed Ahmad, a resident of Hindon Vihar said that the passengers boarding the metro were few as schools, colleges are yet to open up and many people are working from home. “Once these open up in coming time, ridership will increase in metro trains. Presently, people are preferring use of own vehicle due to fear of Covid-19. Even I was using my bike to travel to Shahdara. But with metro trains running, the travel time and cost of travelling with get reduced,” he said. On Wednesday, the DMRC resumed the passenger operations of the Blue Line connecting Dwarka with Noida electronic city and Vaishali. In a statement on Thursday, the DMRC said the overall passenger boardings (line utilisation) on Wednesday was 10,3412. The ridership figures for the Blue line stood at 17443 during the morning hours on Thursday while the total ridership according to DMRC figures stood at 47600 for all seven operational lines during the morning hours on Thursday. The DMRC spokesperson reiterated that the actual utilisation of a metro system is reflected from the number of journeys performed by a passenger in completing his/her journey by using one or more lines (passenger boardings or line utilisation) and not by ridership alone. The DMRC has already laid out guidelines for safe travel during the times of pandemic. There are strict checks for temperature of passengers at the entrance and they are also required to sanitize their hands with automatic sanitizer dispensing machines. The luggage is also sanitised and passengers are frisked at the inside entrance and thereafter allowed to move to the platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operations-resume-on-red-line-but-few-passengers-from-ghaziabad-city/story-3fPpOIUCYtOWixvqNZfYbN.html

Sunil Jain, the owner of the grocery store in Bhangel, Noida, has been arrested an FIR registered against him at the Phase-2 police station . Officials said most of the seized contraband items are related to superstition, and used in occult practices and for preparing dubious concoctions. The recovered items are as follows: 10 grams of dead fireflies, eight jackal bones (siyar singhi), two owl claws, 10 hattha jodi or genitals of monitor lizards, and three kilograms of Costus root. “We received information from a wildlife NGO that a grocery shop in Bhangel was selling such prohibited wildlife items. Upon search, we found a number of contraband items, kept there for sale. These items are either used in occult practices or as medicines which have no proven medicinal value. Costus root is a Himalayan herb, whose sale or export is prohibited without a licence. A case was registered under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) against the shop owner,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. “Items like fireflies and monitor lizard genitalia have no medicinal values but they are often used by quacks to fool the gullible. In several cases, the hattha Jodi itself is fake. Siyar Singhi or jackal bone is believed by many to be the bone that the jackal has in its skull, which is false. Owl’s claws are used in occult practices,” Saket Badola, country head, TRAFFIC, a global wildlife trade monitoring network that works in India as division of WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. Speaking of Costus root, Badola said because of its overexploitation and habitat destruction in the Himalayan regions of Kashmir and Himachal, it is one of the few protected plant species in the country. “Costus root has several medicinal properties and, hence, is one of six species of plants protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. This means that the person selling it should prove that its procured through legal or harvested methods,” Badola said. Police said Jain was sent to jail on Thursday. “The accused was arrested for selling the prohibited wildlife species. A case was registered under sections of Wildlife Protection Act 1972. He has been sent to jail,” a police statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dead-fireflies-owl-claws-among-host-of-wildlife-contraband-seized-from-grocery-store-in-noida/story-ZHzho06yktSaPrv5snQTjP.html

He stayed back for five months and on August 26, he returned to Greater Noida. When he reached office, he was informed that he has been sacked,” Singh said. He added that Pratap stayed in Greater Noida in order to claim his PF from the company.However, the police said that on the night of September 7, the company was closed and Sharma was patrolling the factory premises when he allegedly noticed a suspect jumping off the boundary wall of the factory. Sharma told the police that he had allegedly asked the suspect to surrender but that the suspect tried to attack him.“I fired two bullets at him with my licensed gun and then informed the police and the firm’s management,” Sharma had allegedly told the police. Officials rushed the victim to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Based on a complaint filed by the company manager V K Singh, the police had registered a case against the suspect (Pratap) under sections 457 (house trespass or house breaking by night in order to commit offence) and 380 (theft) of Indian Penal Code on September 7. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that investigation has revealed that Pratap had worked in the company as a helper from 2014 to 2016. “From 2016 to 2020, however, he was not associated with the company.

He added that some students also cheated during the BTech exam on Tuesday.Kumar said that the university prohibits the use of mobile phone in MBA and B.Tech examinations. “As per our initial probe into the matter, we found that about 460 students had appeared in the examination in two days. We have cancelled both the examinations and shifted the examination centre for the rest of the exams to a neighbouring college )GL Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management),” he said.The university has not issued a schedule for re-conduct the examinations which were annulled. Over 756 technical colleges in the state are affiliated to APJAKTU which is organising examinations at 156 centres in Uttar Pradesh.The controller of examination also said the university has formed a three-member committee to probe the matter further and fine the college management for lapses.The executive director of ITS Engineering College did not reply to repeated calls and text messages asking for comment. According to sources, the college has reportedly served notices to eight observers and invigilators who were on examination duty on Tuesday and Wednesday.As per the guidelines issued by the university for exams, as soon as any case of unfair means comes to notice, the invigilator shall bring it to the notice of the center superintendent as well as varsity-appointed observer.

The home isolation facility has also reduced burden on the health care infrastructure,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-the-10-000-mark/story-VEwcewrwrbt0SjVLMgdiIO.html
10-09-2020||City||UP slashes rate of Covid tests in private labs to ₹1,600, officials told to expand contact tracing||The Uttar Pradesh health department on Thursday slashed the rate of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TrueNat tests for Covid-19 from ₹2,500 to ₹1,600 at private laboratories. Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary (home), while announcing the decision also sent written directions to all district magistrates and chief medical officers in his regard. As per the prevailing norms in the state, private laboratories were charging ₹2,500 for RT-PCR test since April 23. The revised directions stipulate that the price of RT-PCR as well as TrueNat test shall not exceed ₹1,600, else the lab will face action under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. “This is so because there has been a reduction in the rates of RT-PCR test kit reagents and viral transport medium (VTM) kits,” Prasad, said. The tests, whether conducted through rapid antigen kits, TrueNat or RT-PCR, is done free of cost at all government facilities. The district health department officials said they have received the new directions. “The directions will now be communicated to private laboratories and they will not be charging more than ₹1,600 for tests. In Ghaziabad, about 90% of tests are done at government facilities and only 10% are done by the private labs,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. In Ghaziabad, there are about 20 government collection points such as static booths, mobile vans and mobile teams where anyone can get themselves tested free of cost. “We have come to know about the direction and since it is a government order, we will comply,” said an official at the lab attached to Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi.The officials of the Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association said there has been reduction in the rate of regents.“During the initial months of the pandemic, there was big gap between demand and supply. Since that has now been reduced, the benefit should be passed on to the patient. So, the reduction in test charges seems justified,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of IMA’s Ghaziabad chapter.According to the figures of September 9, the Ghaziabad district has collection of 227,270 samples of which results were received for 225,323 samples. In UP, the officials said they have completed 7,067,208 tests overall till September 9. The state officials has also asked the districts to take comprehensive contact tracing of positive patients and have asked the district officials to trace at least 12 to 15 contacts per patient. “The chief minister has stressed on contact tracing and said that it needs to be stepped up to 12 to 15 contacts per patient. The chief minister has sought an improvement in districts that are tracing fewer contacts,” Awasthi said. According to the district health department, Ghaziabad has completed 98% contact tracing of 9,840 patients between March and September. The contact tracing exercise has yielded 74,707 contacts with an average of 7.74 contacts per patient. Officials said they have stepped up contact tracing with 99% of 4,971 patients yielding 44,751 contacts between August 1 and September 7. This is about 9.09 contacts per patient. The contact tracing exercise is vital to find high-risk persons. These could be family members, friends of the patient with whom he had come in contact with before he turned out positive. As soon as any person is detected positive for Covid-19, the contact tracing teams gather information about her contacts and they all are subjected to tests and monitoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-slashes-rate-of-covid-tests-in-private-labs-to-1-600-officials-told-to-expand-contact-tracing/story-nSE07PLQCBgu7cSAPKCJWL.html

The cabinet had decided on September 4 to open all religious places in the hill state, also known as Devbhoomi, with strict safety guidelines in place. Bajreshwari Temple, one of the 52 Shakti Peethas, in Kangra town wore deserted look even hours after the temple opened on Thursday morning. Few local devotees turned up. The situation was similar in other temples in Una, Bilaspur and Hamirpur districts. Raj Kumar Sharma, a priest at Chamunda temple, said: “Today is just the first day. We expect the number of devotees to increase in the coming days.” Devotees were allowed to enter the temple premises only after thermal screening. Chintpurni temple opened at the 9am with a few devotees from surrounding areas. Una deputy commissioner Sandeep Kumar cycled to the temple to review the arrangements. Chamunda temple was opened at 11am after the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) inspected the premises to review the safety arrangements. At Jwalamukhi temple, a total 349 devotees came to pay obeisance. However, the priests and the shopkeepers are unhappy over the opening and closing time of the temples. Kapil Sharma, a priest at the Jwalamukhi Shrine, said the temple trust had fixed the timing from 9am to 5pm like government offices. However, most devotees come early morning or late evening during the aarti, said Sharma. He said the timings should be changed to 6am to 10pm. Meanwhile, temples in Hamirpur also opened according to the government guidelines. Mahant Rajinder Giri, chief priest of Baba Balak Nath Temple, Deotsid, has welcomed the government’s decision to open the temples and appealed devotees to follow the norms to prevent spread of the virus. According to the guidelines, a maximum 500 pilgrims a day will be allowed at the Chintpurni Temple in Una and at the shrines of Kangra and Hamirpur districts, while 1,000 devotees will be allowed to offer prayers Naina Devi Temple in Bilaspur everyday. Offerings are prohibited and devotees are not allowed to touch anything. For devotees coming from outside the state, a Covid-19 negative report and two days of prior booking is mandatory. The pandemic not only hit the income of local residents dependent on the temples for a livelihood but also took a toll on the income of the temples as donations dipped by more than 90% during the lockdown. Vinay, who runs a shop near Bajreshwari temple, said vendors had suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. “However, we can now hope our businesses will resume as devotees will start visiting temples,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/temples-open-in-himachal-pradesh-but-covid-scare-keeps-devotees-away/story-fW0IAcaJHaQGRGGJTD334O.html

In the meantime, another notification for population census was issued by central government and panchayats and new revenue units could not be formed. Later, due to the pandemic, the central government withdrew the census notification, which left the state free to create new panchayats and revenue units,” the CM said. The CM said there were many remote and backward areas in the state and the rules had been relaxed to form new panchayats in the area. Panchayati Raj minister Virendra Kanwar said 206 new panchayats had been formed in 2005. “There are many big panchayats in remote areas where people have to walk 20-25 km to reach the panchayat headquarters. He said a total of 325 new panchayats were being formed.” Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri asked the CM when will the voter list be finalised, reservation roaster issued and code of conduct enforced.

The high court bench of justice Raj Mohan Singh acted on the plea of Malik, filed on August 10. Malik had allegedly injured an ex-navy officer, Narinder Verma, 46, his neighbour, at Kharar’s Jal Vayu Vihar on June 27. The firing was the result of an old rivalry between the two. A case was registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act at the Kharar police station.His counsel, senior advocate Bipan Ghai had told the court that the police have not investigated the case properly as incriminating material has been ignored for the reasons best known to the police. It was also told that the accused was waylaid and, in the melee, shots got fired from the revolver. The police did not register FIR on the accused’s complaint. Seven injuries were found on him but only three were declared serious and the police managed X-Ray. When lodged in Ludhiana jail, he fell ill and was examined again and other injuries surfaced, Ghai had told the court.The court found that the police failed to comply with the earlier orders and did not produce a medical record of the accused at the time of the arrest. The court also found that report submitted by the local deputy superintendent of police (DSP) was ‘conspicuously’ silent about the injuries found on the petitioner. “This is the state of affairs even after granting the last opportunity to the respondent state.......State counsel contended that the investigation is still pending,” the court observed on the failure of the state in producing the medical record. The court has now granted bail to Malik while posting the matter for October 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jal-vayu-vihar-firing-hc-grants-bail-to-former-flight-lieutenant/story-ZIPpp2d5ZoIiTQx1BvqPTO.html

On September 3, Mohali SDM Jagdeep Sehgal issued notices to private building owners. Some of the owners removed the hoardings on their own, but most of them did not pull them down. The drive began at around 11 am and continued till 7 pm on Thursday. The enforcement team of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) carried out the drive in the presence of Naib Tehsildar and the police force. The Punjab and Haryana high court in 1995 had issued directions to all deputy commissioners to remove hoardings on national as well as state highways as these were not just eyesores but a traffic hazard that could divert motorists’ attention. Mohali additional deputy commissioner, Aashika Jain said, “The drive went peacefully and we have followed the directions of Punjab and Haryana High court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-illegal-hoardings-pulled-down-along-nh-21/story-RMTdDqBkZgPdzAsLjVLOIP.html
10-09-2020||Chandigarh||No machine facilities, long queues: Paying power bills a pain in Mohali||Long queues in the heat and no social distancing. Paying electricity bills in Mohali is no mean feat, local residents complain, especially after machine facilities for payment were discontinued from August 1.Even social distancing is not being followed.Long queues have been reported of late at the main office of the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) in Phase-1 of Industrial Area, Mohali, and at Kharar, Zirakpur, Dera Bassi and Lalru.Despite four counters in Mohali, many consumers have to wait for long hours and many have to return home disappointed because of the restricted timings from 9 am to 2 pm.Surprisingly, though it began operations since 1976, the PSPCL main office in Industrial Area has not been modernised. Without payment machines, lines extend well outside the small queue shelters in front of the counters.Even the fans there are not very effective.In 2017, PSPCL installed five electricity bill payment machines in various parts of Mohali, including Phase-9, Sector 68, Phase-9 Gurdwara, Sohana Gurdwara and Phase-1 Gurudwara. Two were also installed in Zirakpur, two in Kharar and three in Lalru. The contract with the machine supplier, however, was cancelled from August 1.Raghbir Singh Grewal (75), a Sector 71 resident, complains that no separate queues are allowed for senior citizens and women. “We suggest that the authorities concerned keep drop boxes and make quick payment arrangements for senior citizens and women.”When contacted, superintending engineer, Mohali, Mohit Sood said, “We have done marking to maintain social distancing, but consumers are not following it. As far as payment machines are concerned, the state government has cancelled the contract with the company as there were several issues.”Electricity bills can be paid online too, at the PSPCL website, to help local residents avoid the hassles of visiting a payment centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/long-queues-no-social-distancing-paying-power-bills-a-pain-in-mohali/story-dmZP1IatxENfPECAHzyERN.html

10-09-2020||City||Vidhan Sabha witnesses heated exchanges over CM’s remarks||Proceedings of the House on the third day of monsoon session of the Himachal Pradesh assembly was delayed by 25 minutes after Congress leaders objected chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s comments against the Opposition party in reply to adjournment motion. As soon as the House assembled, leader of Opposition, Mukesh Agnihotri, stood up and objected to the words used by the CM. He alleged that Thakur said that those who are sitting in the well and clapping will also do so in the next birth. “Terminology like shameless and unscrupulous against the opposition members by the CM should be expunged from the proceedings of the House and Thakur should apologise,” he demanded. The CM said that he was replying to an important issue (Covid-19) and the opposition was raising slogans like chor (thief). The CM said that his remark on clapping was taken out of context. Agnihotri objected and said that the language was unparliamentarily and Thakur should withdraw his words. Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar said that if any offensive remark was made he will look into it. However, the Opposition didn’t budge and demanded apology from the CM. This led to a heated exchange between both sides. Congress leaders said that when a bill to cut salaries of MLAs was being tabled, the CM wrongly remarked that the Opposition was demanding their money back. Thakur responded that his intent was not otherwise but the Opposition should also refrain from sloganeering. The proceedings started after parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj intervened and convinced the Opposition members to let them start the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vidhan-sabha-witnesses-heated-exchanges-over-cm-s-remarks/story-Z76JelJIEIaKITgGxijU9M.html

Modi also said the project will also boost Ganga cleanliness projects and subsequently the aim to provide clean environment to dolphins under Project Dolphin will also receive a boost.With elections nearing in Bihar, Modi stressed on the bonhomie between the centre and the state. Lauding the state government’s flagship programme of Har Ghar Jal Scheme, he said,” Under Nitish Kumar’s leadership, the project to equip every household with piped water is indeed praiseworthy.

Five years ago, safe drinking water had reached only 2 per cent of the households and now this number has crossed 70 per cent, he said. He also lauded the Bihar CM for providing farmers with support during the times of coronavirus pandemic. “The farmers played a pivotal role in providing food to the nation during the lockdown phase and when coronavirus was spreading,” he said and highlighted the success of the PM KISAN scheme in the state. “The government transferred about Rs 6,000 crore to 75 lakh farmers in Bihar so far under PM-KISAN scheme,” he said and the appreciated Bihar government for tackling floods and Covid bravely. “We are aware of the flood situation in Bihar and adjoining areas.

Let me tell you that your future is bright. Government is keen to expand this sector with new innovations, products,” Modi said and pitched for encouragement of local products. “We need to be more vocal for local products like Madhubani art to make Bihar self-reliant,” he said. Nitish Kumar said the project will allow people involved in pisciculture and animal husbandry to help bring variety and new technologies in the sector. “79% people in state live in villages and 76% are dependent on agriculture and related activities,” he said and informed the PM house state was utilizing wetlands for fishing and farming. Bihar’s deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said that these schemes will take the state towards Blue and White Revolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm-inaugurate-projects-in-bihar-lauds-nitish/story-Dze94XWxbctLniFqOwWE1O.html

10-09-2020||City||Raghuvansh finally quits RJD, on a bitter note||PATNASenior RJD leader and former union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh resigned from the party on a bitter note on Thursday, more than two months after resigning from as the party’s national vice-president.Singh made his announcement in a handwritten letter addressed to jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad from AIIMS, Delhi, where the 74-year-old socialist veteran has been undergoing treatment for his recent ailments. The letter was circulated in the media by his aides. “Yes, Raghuvansh ji has resigned from the RJD. It is confirmed ,” said Ashok Singh, close aide of the former MP.RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary refused to comment.In his letter, Singh expressed his pain at leaving the party and underlined his socialist background, loyalty and long association with the RJD chief. “I have stood solidly behind you for 32 years after the death of Jannayak Karpoori Thakur. But not anymore. I have received lots of affection from the party, supporters and people. Forgive me,” said Singh, who has been a five-time Lok Sabha member from Vaishali. RJD had been trying hard to patch up with the Singh, a prominent Rajput face, after he opposed the induction of another former MP and strongman Rama Singh into the party. Rama Singh also is a known Rajput face in Vaishali who Singh sees as a rival. The former union minister, who held the rural development portfolio in the UPA-1 government and steered the ambitious MGREGA programme for rural employment, was also said to be annoyed with RJD’s top leadership for the last few years for other reasons, including the denial of a Rajya Sabha berth by the party after he lost the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls. The appointment of another Rajput leader and former MP Jagdanand Singh as RJD’s state president last year had also not gone down well with Raghuvansh Sngh, sources said. He was also reportedly unhappy with RJD’s decision to project leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the party’s chief ministerial face and had said that any decision on the CM face in the grand alliance should be taken after consulting all allies in the opposition coalition. After Singh’s letter became public, speculation was rife in Patna that he may join the JD(U) and could be offered a Rajya Sabha berth or made an MLC from Governor’s quota in coming days. There was also speculation that he could be made chairman of Bihar Legislative Council. At present, Awadhesh Narain Singh is the acting chairman of the Council. On its part, JD(U) welcomed the development. Party MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh said, “RJD could not give respect to one of the prominent socialist leaders of Bihar though the party talks big about protecting dignity of masses. I salute Singh for leaving the RJD which is stuck in the quagmire of arrogance and corruption,” he said. BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said Singh was a very respectable leader of the state but he was insulted by the RJD. “Singh commands respect across all parties. But he was insulted by the RJD which used him for long and then dumped him,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raghuvansh-finally-quits-rjd-on-a-bitter-note/story-Bk9Shzh1f1OaNg0Qv92C7M.html

The Goa government must withdraw [the] ‘ban on protest’ order and ensure that hardworking government employees are given full support in these testing times because the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and are not forced to protest,” tweeted Digambar Kamat, the leader of the opposition in the Goa legislative assembly. Also read: Goa’s Sindhu Prabhudesai Nayak among winners of national teachers’ awardsThe Goa Forward Party (GFP), an opposition outfit, has also spoken against the state government’s alleged draconian move. “This is about civil liberties. The way the government is issuing orders to muzzle voices is fascism of the highest order. These are state government employees and not bonded labourers,” alleged Durgadas Kamat, spokesperson, GFP. On Wednesday, the state government had issued a circular directing employees not to involve “in any agitations or campaigns, which would amount to the criticism of the government, or to sign and submit representations without routing it through proper channels”.The government had warned that any violation of the Central Civil Service (CCS) (Conduct) Rules, 1964 “will attract disciplinary action”. “The CCS (Conduct) rules, 1964, have a provision by which a government employee can express h/his opinion for consideration of the government. It is imperative that all government employees adhere to the provisions of the CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964, scrupulously as its violation will attract disciplinary action,” Sanjeev C Gauns Dessai, director, vigilance, Goa, had stated in his circular that was sent to all heads of departments and government undertakings.The government cited no specific instances but only stated that “a number of government employees are getting involved in agitations, campaigns against its politics and signing petitions to that effect”. While the circular doesn’t give any specific instance or violation of the rules, government employees, especially those at the state secretariat, have recently agitated after they were made to work without any compliance with social distancing norms amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state.Later, the government paid heed to their demands and ordered that not more than 50% of the secretariat staff should come for work on a day and also introduced a rotational presence of workforce until the pandemic-induced healthcare crisis blows over. A delegation of state government employees, through their association, had also called on then Goa governor Satya Pal Malik when the state government had decided to scrap a housing loan scheme as part of an austerity drive because of the viral outbreak.Several employees had also raised their voice against government-run projects, especially within the wildlife sanctuaries, raising concerns about the destruction of the tiny coastal state’s fragile ecosystem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-opposition-demands-withdrawal-of-circular-gagging-government-employees/story-P14rgJxi1z2kKbQKEyWS3K.html

10-09-2020||Pune||Pune’s Fergusson College principal says online teaching is the way forward||Fergusson College (FC), run under the Deccan Education Society (DES), is currently ensuring a smooth admission period, with the Class 11 (FYJC), in particular moving through its phases. Apart from that, preparations for final-year exams are also on. Prof Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, tells Dheeraj Bengrut that while the method of teaching is undergoing a drastic change, the college is well prepared to ensure admissions and exams will not be affected in terms of it all being online now. The Fergusson campus is closed, and will remain closed in the interim. Given the restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic, is online teaching and e-content generation in place at the college? Our faculty are working on creating the e-content for students. There are many things which we have to adopt very strictly and accordingly, we have started online classes for our students. From that point of view, our faculty are preparing e-content by recording and conducting ‘live’ online lectures. Even for practical classes, we have to make small groups of students and will try to run two-three practicals in one day. The teaching method has completely changed. Online and offline, both need to be blended. It needs to be interactive, so we are using new technology. We have also started the e-library for our students, through which students can directly get access to e-books. For this semester we are fully preparing for online teaching, as there is little chance of starting physical classes as of now. What is the plan for the final-year examinations at Fergusson? As we are autonomous college, we take three internal assessment programmes. We are planning to take it online for this year. If that is not possible, then questions will be given to the students on WhatsApp or other social media platforms. Students will make their notes on it and send back a PDF or MSWord file to the faculty. An open book exam option is also there, may be a time of two hours will be given… so we are exploring several options to conduct exams. As we come under the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), we will get their guidelines too and accordingly, the exams will be conducted. Is the admission process for the various courses and Class 11 progressing smoothly? For the last six years we have been conducting an online admission process. Earlier, there was a lot of movement on the campus, but now, due to Covid-19, it is completely closed. All information related to the admission process for all our graduate and post-graduate courses is given on our website. We are well prepared - filling up the admission form, choosing subjects and payment of fees - everything will be done online. First year and second year admissions are completed and their online classes have also started. For the Class 11 admission, the first merit list is declared and our college cut-off is also out.

10-09-2020||Mumbai||Why should TV news not be regulated by govt, asks HC||The Bombay High Court on Thursday said it was surprised to know that the government had no control over the electronic media and asked why television news should not be regulated by the state.The observation was made by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni while hearing a bunch of petitions that sought various reliefs related to the case of the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, including a direction to restrain the press in its coverage of the case.The bench impleaded the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as a party in the matters.It also directed the ministry to file a reply in court indicating the extent of state control that is exercised in respect of telecasting news, particularly such news that “may have serious ramifications”.The bench also made the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the central agencies that are currently probing issues related to the case, as parties.This, after the one of the petitioners alleged that the agencies were “leaking” probe related information to the press and the public.The bench, however, refused to implead actor Rhea Chakraborty as respondent in the case.“We do not see any reason to implead the proposed respondent number 12 (Chakroborty), an accused who is presently in judicial custody,” it said.The petitions, filed by activists, and eight retired senior police officers, allege, among other things that several TV channels were running a parallel probe into the case,and that they were running a malicious campaign against the Mumbai police through their current reportage in the case.On September 3, another bench had heard the same pleas and had passed an order urging the press to show restraint while covering the developments of Sushant Singh Rajputs death case.On Thursday, senior advocate Milind Sathe, who appeared for the former police officials, told the bench that despite the order, TV channels were continuing with their slander against the Mumbai police.Sathe submitted transcripts from news broadcasts whereby, channels had insinuated that the Mumbai police had been assisting or shielding the accused, and the “drug mafia”.CJ Datta told advocate Sathe that he shouldn’t be bothered by what a news anchor was saying.He, however, added that the court hoped and trusted that “the spirit of the order dated September 3” would be kept in mind by TV news channels.The Union government, meanwhile, pointed out that the petitioners should have approached the Press Council of India, a statutory body which regulates the print media, and the News Broadcasting standards Authority (NBSA) with its grievances against the TV news channels.At this, the bench noted that the NBSA wasn’t a statutory body.“We are surprised that the state has no control over the electronic media. Why should it (TV news) not be regulated in case they may have serious ramifications,” the bench said.It directed all parties to file their replies, rejoinders etc within the next two weeks, adding that while the pleas remained pending, the NBSA was free to act upon any complaints received so far against such news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-should-tv-news-not-be-regulated-by-govt-asks-hc/story-rkKly8yl1qK0oZ9LcHrOeI.html
10-09-2020||Environment||Uttarakhand forest department to use GIS to check for encroachments||To keep a check on encroachments on forest land, the Uttarakhand forest department has now asked all officials to use the Geographic Information System (GIS) technique to measure encroachments. Jai Raj, the head of forest force (HOFF), Uttarakhand forest department, issued the directions to all divisional forest officials in the state in a letter Wednesday. The letter read, “Encroachment on government land has been increasing continuously in the state, including forest land. It is important to vacate or remove encroachments from forest land with regular checking, but till then, it is important to ensure that more land is not encroached upon. Instead of routine checks, encroachment must be checked effectively, for which Geographic Information System (GIS) technique should compulsorily be used.” The forest department has further asked all divisional forest officers to check satellite imagery of forest areas of the past years to check for changes in encroachment. The divisional forest officers have also been asked to employ stricter measures to check encroachment and not just erect boundary pillars. In the last two surveys conducted by the Forest Survey of India over a period of four years from 2015 to 2019, Uttarakhand has not reported an increase of even 1% forest cover. In the latest report, Uttarakhand has reported its recorded forest area (RFA) as 38,000 sq km, which is 71.05% of its geographical area. The reserved, protected and unclassed forests comprise 69.86%, 26.01% and 4.13% of the recorded forest area in the state, respectively. In June this year, seven forest officials were injured in a clash over alleged forest land encroachment by Van Gujjar families in Rajaji Tiger Reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/uttarakhand-forest-department-to-use-gis-to-check-for-encroachments/story-X1i3Lz4f7tyhKHV19ySdqJ.html

Though students are not allowed on campus yet, given that lecturers have not yet begun, online lectures, e-content generation and the admission process is on in full swing at SPPU. “Covid has taught us one important lesson that we were totally not prepared for. The kind of knowledge that we provide turned out to be virtually of no use. Knowledge should be of help to the society. All different aspects related to communicable diseases, from the preparedness point of view, shows that our syllabus needs to be revisited,” said SPPU vice-chancellor, Prof Nitin Karmalkar. “That is what we are concentrating on. It is going to be a seamless integration of different departments. So, right from zoology, sociology, health sciences, environment and all the other departments need to be integrated,” Karmalkar added. After the Supreme Court’s decision that final year exams be held, the SPPU management has begun preparations. “We are now preparing to conduct the final year exams. Whether it is online or offline is going to be decided soon. If some students fail to appear for the exam, we will take another exam in December or January. Tentatively the exams will be conducted from the first week of October,” Karmalkar said. “The online admission process is going on smoothly and for our various graduate and post-graduate courses 30,000 students have applied for admission,” he added. Kamlakar Shete, a final year commerce student said, “The situation in Maharashtra is not good and the number of Covid-19 cases are increasing. Most of the students are from the rural parts, so internet connectivity is one of the main issues which we face. Our suggestion is to mark students by giving home assignments for this year.” Reshma Khadilkar, a final year Science student said, “We are already bored sitting at home for the last six months and waiting for the exams to be held. Online exams are a good option, but it should be done fast as we want to take admissions for post-graduation courses.” SPPU’s final year exam preparations Two lakh final year students for 56 courses These students are from 700 affiliated colleges, 234 recognised institutes and 71 research institutes in Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik districtsTentative exam dates will be October 1- 22 For both, professional and non-professional courses, each paper will be marked out of 50, to be completed in 1.5 hours||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unlock-pune-sppu-syllabus-defines-a-new-inter-departmental-learning-strategy/story-YM9QgdkB5YieYrWG8hUzKJ.html

There are just 283 such beds available in the city of close to three million people across 18 hospitals. The ICU beds account for 7.54% of the total available in Covid-19 facilities. Experts say the percentage should ideally be 20. “ICU beds for Covid-19 patients should comprise 20% of the total beds because the number of serious patients is growing,” said former Indian Medical Association (Lucknow) president Dr PK Gupta. “Since level one treatment is now being done under home isolation, an increased number of level three beds/ICU beds should not be a problem.”Officials said there are also 569 high-dependency beds equipped to handle patients in need of care of the level between the general ward and ICU. The demand for oxygen has also gone up. It has increased by at least five times at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS)’s Rajdhani Covid-19 Hospital during the last one month.“Presently, there is a consumption of 400 to 500 jumbo cylinders per day, which was between 80 and 125 jumbo cylinders per day around a month and a half ago,” said Radha Krishna Dhiman, director, SGPGIMS. “There are around 180 patients admitted to the Rajdhani Covid-19 Hospital and about 80 of them are on oxygen support.

10-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers lathicharged at Pipli near Kurukshetra for defying prohibitory orders, finally given nod to hold rally||Police resorted to mild lathicharge on farmers at Pipli Chowk near Kurukshetra on Thursday for defying prohibitory orders as they were headed to the grain market to take part in a rally against the Centre’s recent agriculture ordinances. Hundreds of activists, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union Haryana president Gurnam Singh Chaduni, blocked the Chandigarh-Delhi national highway (NH-44) in the morning when they were prevented from reaching the grain market, inconveniencing commuters and causing a traffic jam. A few farmers also sustained injuries as police used force to stop them from entering the grain market. After two-and-a-half hours, the Kurukshetra district administration relented and allowed the farmers to head to the grain market much to the relief of the commuters stranded on the highway. Deputy commissioner Sharandeep Kaur Brar said, “The farmers lifted the blockade and the movement of traffic was restored. The farmers have been allowed to hold the rally but they have to maintain (Covid) norms.” “The administration is responsible for this situation. We have a right to protest peacefully but they want to suppress our voice. We will continue our fight and force the Centre to withdraw its anti-farmer and anti-arhtiya (commission agent) ordinances. They are using coronavirus as an excuse to suppress our voice,” Chaduni said. Police also released some farmers who were detained during the protest. While addressing the farmers, Chaduni termed it as their first victory. He said the fight will continue until the Centre withdraws its anti-farmer ordinances and brings in a law to ensure that all farmers get the benefit of Minimum Support Price. Chaduni, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Haryana assembly elections on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket, accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of forcing farmers to hold protests by bringing ordinances in the name of agriculture reforms. In video message, he said the farmers have decided to protest at district headquarters on September 15 and all roads in Haryana will be blocked if the state government fails to withdraw the ordinances.The farmers were protesting the three ordinances passed by the Union cabinet in June: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance; and the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance. While the government says the ordinances will create an environment where farmers and traders have free choice of sale and purchase, farmers claim that with these ordinances, the government is planning to discontinue the minimum support price (MSP) regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-lathicharged-at-pipli-near-kurukshetra-for-defying-prohibitory-orders-finally-given-nod-to-hold-rally/story-zSfXnWG2j6NHPD43IG408I.html

Her Covid-19 test report came negative on Wednesday. Her intestine surgery, which was performed on Tuesday, was also successful.”Dr. Ranjan said, “Her intestine, measuring around one-third portion of a large bowl, was removed, as it had started rotting following a rupture. Though the baby is still in the intensive care unit (ICU), she is recovering fast.”The baby was admitted by her parents, who belong to Jharkhand’s Palamu district’s Bishrampur block, to RIMs on August 29. The newborn was admitted to RIMS as she was suffering from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which in lay terminology means ruptures in the intestine.RIMS doctors said the newborn needed to undergo a Covid-19 test before she could be operated upon in line with the standard operating protocols (SOPs) regarding the viral infection.The baby tested Covid-19 positive on September 3 evening. The parents went missing shortly after their daughter’s viral infection was communicated to the father.Doctors at the paediatric department said initially for around five days, her parents appeared concerned about her health condition, but later they went missing immediately after they came to know that she had tested Covid-19 positive. They could not be reached on their contact number as well, the doctors added.The hospital staff with the help of local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) took care of the baby in the absence of her parents. However, her parents’ consent was required by RIMS authorities to perform the surgery. Later, they got in touch with police to trace her parents.Dr. Ranjan said the girl’s grandparents came to the hospital after police forced them and gave their consent for the baby’s critical surgical procedure.“The baby is doing fine. She will be released from the hospital after she recovers from the surgery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/deserted-by-parents-in-ranchi-hospital-newborn-defeats-covid-19-survives-intestine-surgery/story-hA38lx5e3vu934TwljJaTN.html

Janjali Jena (70), a differently-abled woman, and her son Banamali Jena (45) lived in an abandoned anganwadi centre in Kaligaon village under the jurisdiction of Nandipada police station in Keonjhar district. The deceased mother and the son were purportedly eye-witness to a burglary committed next door by the suspects, said Madan Mohan Naik, a sub-inspector (S-I) of Nandipada police station.

The chemical will be sprayed from a power sprayer mounted on a truck placed over the special train. Civic officials said the train would spray insecticides for 10 days until October 2, including 10 round trips.Also read: BJP leaders, mayors hold protest against AAP for not releasing full funds to civic bodiesThe train would spray anti-larvae chemicals in water bodies, pits and jhuggi jhopri (JJ) clusters along railway tracks, where it is risky for personnel of the three civic bodies to manually spray the chemicals, they added. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) authorities had started the drive from early September. Civic officials said that a truck mounted with a power sprayer would be loaded on an open railway wagon, which has a low flat surface to accommodate the vehicle. The terminator train would move at a speed of 20 kilometres (km) per hour and would cover a distance about 150 km in each round, they added.Delhi has recorded 96, 42 and 97 cases of dengue, chikungunya and malaria, respectively, until September 5. No death due to these vector-borne diseases has been reported to date.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, SDMC, said the special train would run from New Delhi railway station. It would also cover areas under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), she added.“It will cover areas such as Hazrat Nizamuddin, Lajpat Nagar, Sewa Nagar, Lodi Colony, Safdarjang, Patel Nagar, Delhi Kishanganj, Sadar Bazar, Sarai Rohilla, Inderpuri, Mayapuri, Dayabasti, Delhi Cantonment among others following which it will return to New Delhi railway Station. Besides water bodies, the train will spray insecticides over depression created on both sides of railway tracks, where chances of mosquito breeding remain high during monsoon,” she said.In East Delhi, the train will spray larvicides around the tracks of Shahdara railway station, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar and Mandawali.Nirmal Jain, mayor, EDMC, said that during monsoon, mosquito breeding intensifies because of accumulation in water in pits around railway tracks. “It is an effective effort to eliminate the menace of dengue, malaria and chikungunya. Precautionary measures will save thousands of people living near railway tracks from these vector-borne diseases,” Jain said.On August 25, the three civic bodies -- North, South and East -- had launched an awareness campaign about dengue, chikungunya and malaria diseases. Similarly, the Delhi government had on September 6 launched the second edition of its “10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute” campaign to tackle vector-borne diseases. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had urged the public to check their houses every Sunday at 10 am for 10 minutes for the next 10 weeks in a bid to prevent the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes that cause vector-borne diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mosquito-terminator-train-to-beat-vector-borne-diseases-in-delhi/story-Z8JBfHBhbuGJjrvtzHACyJ.html
10-09-2020||City||To mark centenary celebration, AMU to bury time capsule||The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), which is in its centenary year, is on the way to adding another glorious chapter to its illustrious history. However, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has cast a dark shadow over the centenary celebrations. The authorities will bury a time capsule at a suitable on the university’s sprawling campus. The capsule will contain all the details of the institution’s achievements since its inception in 1920 and also an account of contemporary history and current affairs.A five-member committee has been constituted for the ambitious project. The capsule will have a protective covering filled with inert gases and the text will be written on acid-resistant paper in a bid to ensure its longevity.“Professor MK Pundhir, who teaches archaeology in the history department, has come up with the proposal of the time capsule. The time capsule will be buried at a suitable location on the university campus as part of the centenary celebrations. The achievements of the AMU since 100 years of its existence will be placed in the proposed time capsule,” said Professor Shafey Kidwai, the chairman of mass communication department at AMU and also the spokesperson for the university. ‘The idea of a time capsule struck a chord with AMU’s Vice-Chancellor (V-C) Professor Tariq Mansoor, who constituted a committee, headed by the registrar of the university, Abdul Hamid. Professor Pundhir from the history department; Dr Rahat Abrar, director of the Urdu Academy; Rajeev Sharma, chairman of the Mechanical Department; are some of the other panel members. So far, the committee members have held two meetings,” said Professor Kidwai. “The university authorities may hold consultations with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur, which had undertaken a similar time capsule exercise in the past. On September 9, 1920, the then Viceroy Lord Chelmsford had passed the bill for the upgrade of the existing Muhammadan Anglo Oriental (MAO) College to the status of a university. That heralded the beginning of a glorious era,” Professor Kidwai added. Professor Abrar said that it was in December 1920 that AMU became operational. Now, plans are afoot to celebrate the centenary year in a grand manner, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. President Ram Nath Kovind would grace the occasion as the AMU chancellor. A centenary gate would be put up and the time capsule would be buried to mark the historic occasion, he said. ‘We are doing our best amid the pandemic such as the unique concept of burying the time capsule. Perhaps, this is the best way to preserve the legacy of the AMU for our future generations,” Professor Abrar added. The then Viceroy of India, Lord Edward Robert Lytton, was in Aligarh on January 8, 1877 for the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental (MAO) College. At that time, a similar exercise of burying a time capsule was undertaken by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of AMU, although it was not termed as one, said Professor Shafey Kidwai, the chairman of mass communication department at AMU and also the spokesperson for the university. “The district gazette dated January 12, 1877 makes a mention of a similar exercise when a bottle carrying details about Madarastul Uloom (a madarsa upgraded to MAO College) came into being. The gazette mentioned a bottle that carried descriptions along with coins made of copper, gold and silver and was placed in the cavity of the foundation stone,” Professor Kidwai added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-mark-centenary-celebration-amu-to-bury-time-capsule/story-rb8ZLK3VUwYKHJZqfnwO0N.html

He said the authorities later discovered two cloned cheques had been used to withdraw money earlier on September 1 and 3.He said the FIR has been registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC)’s sections 419 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for cheating) and 471 (using forged cheque as original).Also Read: ‘Ram mandir construction to begin after Sept 17’: Temple trust general secyKumar said an initial probe has suggested negligence of bank authorities, as well as the involvement of bank employees, as serial numbers of the cheques were compromised and that allowed fraudsters to prepare the cloned ones.

10-09-2020||Kolkata||Congress’ Bengal president pick sends clear message to Mamata Banerjee||With the appointment of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the president of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee ahead of the crucial 2021 polls, the Congress high command has signaled an interest in further strengthening of ties with the Left and escalation of offensive against the ruling Trinamool Congress, say experts. Chowdhury’s appointment as the new president was announced by party general secretary KC Venugopal on Wednesday. Somen Mitra, who was the party’s president in West Bengal before this, had died on July 30. “Congress President has appointed Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the president of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee with immediate effect,” stated a statement issued by the party. A week ago, Abdul Mannan, a senior Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, had written to Sonia Gandhi with a request to appoint Chowdhury as the state president. “During the 2016 assembly polls in the state, Mannan and Chowdhury had played an important role in forging the electoral understanding with the Left Front. His appointment would help to further strengthen the ties,” said a senior Congress leader. Chowdhury is also known to be one of the staunchest critics of Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress chief and the chief minister of West Bengal. Even while Congress president Sonia Gandhi was attacking the Narendra Modi-led government in coordination with Banerjee, Chowdhury was busy upping the ante against the TMC supremo at the state-level. Also Read: Congress amps up attack on govt, launches online campaign #SpeakUpForJobs“The message is clear. The Congress would not like to walk with the TMC when it comes to state politics because they know very well that the TMC would not leave an inch for them. They would, however, need the TMC when it comes to opposing the BJP at the centre. Hence, Chowdhury was the best bet as he would not only consolidate the party’s position in Murshidabad, a bastion of the Congress, but would also help to strengthen the party’s ties with the Left and at the same time oppose the TMC tooth and nail,” said psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University. Also Read: In poll-bound Bihar, Congress invites LJP to join grand alliance, draws NDA fire The ruling TMC, which had earlier tagged Chowdhry as an agent of the BJP and RSS, however, said that Chowdhury’s appointment as the Congress president will not affect the TMC in any way as the Cong and the Left are facing an ‘existential crisis’ in the state.“The Congress knows very well that Chowdhury is an agent of BJP and RSS and his main enemy is Mamata Banerjee and not the BJP. So they have appointed him thus revealing a dual character. They don’t want to fight the BJP. They want to oppose the TMC. It won’t affect us anyways, no matter whoever comes. The Congress party first needs to stay afloat in Bengal,” said Kalyan Banerjee, TMC MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/congress-bengal-president-pick-sends-clear-message-to-mamata-banerjee/story-B5aHLDBnRpFhJ89RO4ZgGM.html

Kundu, who was arrested at the Makrauli Kalan toll plaza only to be released hours later, said: “The police can’t stop farmers from raising their voice against these ordinances. I will stand by my farmer brothers and protest against the government until these ordinances are revoked. These bills are being brought to sell farmers’ rights to big corporates.” Kundu, who left for Pipli with his supporters, condemned the lathicharge. “This government is against the farmers. If political leaders can canvass in the Baroda constituency (for the byelection) by defying the district administration’s orders (on social distancing), why are farmers not being allowed to hold a rally?” he said. Tosham Congress MLA Kiran Choudhry also took on Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and state agriculture minister JP Dalal for preventing farmers from crossing toll plazas to reach Pipli. “The implementation of these ordinances will lead to the exploitation of farmers at the hands of corporate houses. On one hand, the BJP-JJP leaders are canvassing in Baroda by defying the administration’s orders and putting people’s lives at risk, while on the other hand the government has imposed Section 144 of the CrPC to bar the entry of farmers at Pipli. This shows this government is afraid of farmers protesting,” she said. Meanwhile, Dalal said that the government does not plan to end the minimum support price (MSP) for crops and urged farmers to follow the administration’s orders on social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/meham-mla-balraj-kundu-arrested-on-way-to-haryana-farmers-protest-at-pipli/story-JTm1L0DYoqlUAqMOF92esM.html

Dadar, on the other hand, has 2,841 cases of which 440 are active, as of Wednesday. The BMC said Dadar’s count surpassed that of Dharavi owing to increased testing and also relaxations in the lockdown.Covid-19 cases in neighbouring Mahim are around 2,543 cases of which 406 are active cases. HT had reported on August 29 that while the Covid-19 curve had started to flatten in Dharavi, the number of cases have doubled in neighbouring Mahim and Dadar in the last 40 to 60 days.Out of the total cases in Dadar and Mahim area, more than 70 per cent of the cases have been reported post relaxations of lockdown starting from June 03, 2020The BMC has maintained that the increase in the number of cases in Dharavi’s neighbouring Dadar and Mahim is only because of increased testing and relaxations of lockdown rules along with the Ganesh festival in the last week of August.Kiran Dighavkar, Assistant Municipal Commissioner of G North Ward under which Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi areas fall said, “Our aim is to identify the infection by facilitating maximum amount of testing opportunities. Unlike Dharavi in initial days, 80 % of cases in Dadar are asymptomatic and have been found out due to pro active testing and fever camps.”Dighavkar addded, “Most of the cases are independent cases than from high risk contacts. The reason behind this is that since unlock has happened people might be getting infected from various places. Our only target is to facilitate greater testing opportunities for people.” The number of cases have doubled in case of Dadar in the last around 45 days from 1,444 on July 21 to 2,841 now.Overall, the G North Ward under which areas like Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim falls has 8,223 cases, as of Wednesday of which 6,819 cases have recovered and 945 cases are active cases.The mortality rate for the GN Ward has gone down in the last two months from 10.61 per cent on July 04 GN Ward to 6.23% as on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-mumbai-dadar-overtakes-dharavi-with-2-841-cases/story-9EemzxAeWexwWPPElDd2rO.html

Bengal is fast emerging a hotbed for political gatherings and protests amid the pandemic because the crucial assembly polls are slated be held in May next year.The police are having a harrowing time because of a spurt in political activities, despite the viral outbreak.“We have to tackle these rallies and most of the time the social distancing norms can’t be maintained. Many party supporters don’t wear face masks, which make us more susceptible to contract the contagion. Besides, it is not possible to maintain social distancing norms while apprehending an accused,” said a police officer.

BMC on Wednesday demolished parts of Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow on Wednesday following which a war of words ensued between the Shiv Sena and the Bollywood actress who is known for her roles in movies like Fashion and Queen. BMC went ahead with the demolition even though the hearing was going on in the Bombay High Court.A BMC official told PTI that by the time the HC had issued the stay order BMC had demolished the “majority of the unauthorised additions and extensions.”“The BMC demolished the majority of the unauthorised additions and extensions inside Ranaut’s bungalow by the time the HC stayed the process,” the official said to news agency PTI. BMC pointed out that there were 14 violations which included a toilet converted to an office cabin, illegal pantry on the ground floor, wooden partition in the living room and change in the position of the main gate among many others. The Bombay High Court headed by a bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla told BMC that the demolition ‘smacks of malafide’.“The manner in which BMC proceeded to commence demolition work prima facie does not appear to be bonafide (in good faith) and smacks of malafide (dishonest intentions),” the division bench observed. The actor posted a video on Twitter of the building demolition while calling Mumbai Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and said that Bollywood has turned into ‘Bullywood’. She also alleged that the CM and few Bollywood artists are trying to silence her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-reply-to-bombay-high-court-notice-in-kangana-ranaut-house-demolition-case/story-7Z37i1PiVJSmAzDYiayDhJ.html

The trial will be conducted on 380 volunteers across the nation of which 50 volunteers are undergoing the test at PGIMS, Rohtak. Twelve of the volunteers, aged between 12 years and 65 years, were administered the first dose of Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV). Dr Ramesh Verma, co-investigator of the trials at PGIMS, said the volunteers were administered the first dose of 3 microgram, while young males were given 6 microgram of the vaccine. “We kept them under observation for two hours and they showed positive results. This time, all volunteers are not healthy as was the case in Phase 1. We will administer the second dose to these volunteers after 28 days. This time, they will be given two doses,” Dr Verma said. “We are conducting a full body test of the volunteers to exclude those suffering from major ailments. Phase 2 was started on Tuesday after the successful trial of 375 volunteers across the country. Eighty-one of them underwent the trial at PGIMS. The ICMR did not share data of how many antibodies were developed in the bodies of volunteers of the first phase,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohtak-s-pgims-begins-second-phase-of-clinical-trials-for-indigenous-covid-vaccine-covaxin/story-a1fAfz1No3jkGextcafKFK.html
10-09-2020||Chandigarh||Delay in assent to Bills: Haryana Guv unsure about validation Bill to legitimise de-licensing||Two weeks after the Haryana assembly passed 12 Bills, including the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (second amendment and validation) Bill, 2020, the governor is yet to accord his assent to the Bills. A Bill passed by the state legislature becomes a law only after getting the assent of the governor; or President in case it has been reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President. While bureaucratic reasons, including indisposition of assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta (he has to lend his signatures to the Bills passed) has been attributed to the delay in the process of communicating the Bills by the law department to Raj Bhavan, sources said the governor is unsure about assenting to Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (second amendment and validation) Bill. Bill aimed at giving relief to Ambience Mall developer The validation Bill, if assented by the governor, would come as a major relief to the developers of the Gurgaon-based Ambience Mall and several similar cases involving de-licensing of land. The Punjab and Haryana high court had on July 10 quashed the town and country planning department’s October 18, 2001 and September 1, 2010 orders to de-license two chunks of land (8 acres and 3.9 acres) out of 18.98 acres approved for constructing Ambience Lagoon Island residential complex. The de-licensed land was then permitted by the department for raising a commercial complex, the Ambience Mall. The CBI, on high court (HC) orders, had also registered a criminal case in the matter. Officials said that over 54 similar cases of de-licensing were discovered by the department after the HC ruling which needed to be validated. The HC had termed the term de-licensing a misnomer in the context of the Act and the case at hand. The bench said that the state counsel had admitted that there was no such provision in the Act. The court said the argument that Clause 21 of the General Clauses Act which gives power to grant a licence also contains implied power to de-license was bereft of any merit or logic. Guv may send the Bill to President As per Article 200 of the Constitution, the governor can declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves the Bill for the consideration of the President. Legal experts say there were two issues involved in the Validation Bill which warrant Presidential assent. The assembly has approved insertion of a new clause section 3 (a) in the Act which would give the power to add to, amend, vary, suspend, withdraw or rescind, licence or notification, order, rule or direction or to de-licence. The second is an all encompassing validation clause which said that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal or any authority, any action taken or orders issued, things done or purporting to have been taken or done by the director, before the commencement of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (amendment and validation) Act, 2020, shall be deemed to be as valid and effective as if such action, approval, orders were issued or action taken in accordance with its provisions. Explaining the legal position, former advocate general, Ashok Aggarwal said while the legislature does not have the power to overrule or tinker with the judgment of the high court or Supreme court, it certainly has the powers to bring in a retrospective amendment to remove the basis of a judgment. When asked whether the validation Bill would need President’s assent, the former advocate general said that Governor in his wisdom can always reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delay-in-assent-to-bills-haryana-guv-unsure-about-validation-bill-to-legitimise-de-licensing/story-NOGVX0UWbhx0jB0Gs4Ol1O.html

10-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: On the death of a door||It’s gone. Until last week, the beautiful door was there. But not any more. Nor the old house behind it. A black plastic sheet stands in place of it. A new building is coming up, here in Old Delhi’s Galli Chooriwallan street. Like in any other city locality, long-existing buildings of the Mughal-era Walled City are being replaced by new ones, even if the pace might be slower. To this day, a casual walk through the historic quarter’s by-lanes reveals a series of stately doorways which, when juxtaposed against contemporary doors as it often is the case, speak persuasively for the architectural aesthetics of an earlier era. Permeated with a rich sense of the past, some of these doorways are overwhelmingly grand, despite languishing in a state of utmost neglect. You can stand for hours in front of them, wondering about the kinds of people who went through over the course of decades, and centuries.This wooden door in Galli Chooriwallan was the entrance of a well-maintained private house, tucked at one end of a narrow alley. On any day you would find a few scooters parked outside. Painted green, the door gently tapered into a pointed arch built into the yellow house walls. Fans of the cult movie Garam Hawa will notice that this door greatly resembled the one that led to the house of Salim Mirza, the character played by actor Balraj Sahani (the movie was set in Agra though). But you might as well have thought of the classic Twilight in Delhi—in this novel the characters actually live just a few streets away, in Mohalla Niyariyan.And now the door is history.This morning a team of sweaty dust-covered labourers are placing stacks of bricks onto their bent back and carrying it to the construction site—where the door and the house used to stand just a week ago. A nearby baker talks of a multi-storey flat coming up. “The house belonged to a shopkeeper,” he says.Preservationists of the past might regret the passing away of the lovely doorway, but the truth is that it remained anonymous throughout its long life. Here is a piece of beauty that, ironically, got better publicity while passing away. Rest in peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-on-the-death-of-a-door/story-AGeq2EtqlgXgmGA7RyqLEP.html
10-09-2020||City||Politicos flout ban on gatherings with impunity ahead of Baroda bypoll||Despite the Sonepat district administration’s ban on political gatherings in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, politicians continue to defy the orders and campaign in villages ahead of the Baroda constituency bypolls. Indian National Lok Dal general secretary and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala seems to be on the forefront in violating the administration orders as he had held meetings in nearly 10 villages of the constituency from Monday evening to Tuesday. Images and videos that have emerged from the spot show blatant violation of social distancing and other safety norms. Wrestler-turned Bharatiya Janata Party leader Yogeshwar Dutt too has been violating the Sonepat administration’s orders by conducting village-level meetings. Sonepat deputy commissioner Shyam Lal Punia had announced the ban on political gatherings on Monday, a day after Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Deepinder Hooda was found infected after addressing poll rallies in various parts of the constituency. Apart from Deepender, Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, agricultural minister JP Dalal, power and jails minister Ranjit Chautala, Gohana MLA Jagbir Malik and a few others politicians had also addressed village-level gatherings before testing positive for the virus. Locals fear infection Anil Kumar, a resident of Kathura village in Baroda, said the administration has failed to take any action against the politicians who are putting people’s lives at risk by holding gatherings amid the pandemic outbreak. “So far, six leaders, who had addressed gatherings in this constituency, have tested positive. The Covid-19 is in community spread in our constituency and the leaders have turned infection spreaders. Moreover, the health department has also not increased testing here. These politicians are posing a great risk to our lives,” he added. Joginder Moor, an independent aspirant for Baroda bypoll, said the election commission is yet to announce the poll date but politicians are going ahead with the canvassing. “I am surprised why the district administration has not initiated any action against these leaders though they are issuing challans to commoners for going out in public without masks,” he added. Gohana sub-divisional magistrate Ashish Kumar, who was appointed the nodal officer to implement a ban, said he is in home quarantine after his driver tested positive for the virus. “I will check where the political gatherings were being organised,” he added. INLD leader Abhay Chautala could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/politicos-flout-ban-on-gatherings-with-impunity-ahead-of-baroda-bypoll/story-rnzN9EoRfAX4LfmRZiDU6H.html
10-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Covid death rate highest in country||Struggling hard to keep the virus spread under control, Punjab on Wednesday hit another grim milestone as it became the state with the highest death rate in the country. Punjab’s case fatality rate (2.95%) has surpassed that of Gujarat (2.93%) and Maharashtra (2.90%) --- the two worst-affected states ---- reveals the latest data. Concerned over the high CFR, the Centre recently rushed a team of experts to Punjab. The team comprising PGIMER community medicine expert JS Thakur, and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) deputy director Akshay Kumar is currently touring the worst-affected districts of Ludhiana, Amritsar, Patiala, Jalandhar and SAS Nagar (Mohali) to assess the ground situation. These five districts account for nearly 63% of the total deaths in in the state, with Ludhiana recording the highest number of fatalities. The state has so far recorded 67, 547 total positive cases and 1,990 deaths. The Union government has already directed the worst-hit states to bring down their fatality rate to 1% by improving testing rate, contact-tracing and surveillance. Punjab witnessed 1,067 deaths (around 263% jump) in August alone, and by the start of September, it had surpassed the CFR of the national capital. As per a Punjab government’s status report dated August 16, state’s CFR was 2.6% as compared to Maharashtra’s 3.4%, Gujarat’s 3.5% and Delhi’s 2.8%. But while other states have managed to control the spike in deaths, Punjab is finding itself helpless. State Covid nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar attributes the surge to co-morbidities and late-reporting of the cases. “These two are the biggest challenges. If people don’t come forward for testing at the onset of symptoms, CFR will continue to go up. We need involvement of general public and community leaders to exhort people to go for testing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-covid-death-rate-highest-in-country/story-3tfFURDttuhBA3QqrbQ3mL.html
10-09-2020||City||Cities rapidly becoming concrete jungles: Bombay HC||MumbaiA Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court, on Tuesday expressed concern about rapidly disappearing green cover and open spaces from urban India and the fact that cities were speedily becoming concrete jungles.A two-member bench comprising justice Sunil Square and justice Anil Kilor said that with every passing year and every new census, data evidence showed more and more population living in urban areas as cities were becoming economic engines of the future.“Population is so congested in the lanes and streets of colonies in cities that people hardly find a place to relax,” said the bench, perturbed by sharp decrease in green cover in cities.The bench observed that cities were fast becoming a concrete jungle as green areas have started disappearing with astonishing rapidity and children hardly get opportunities to play out of their houses and experience the natural environment.The bench expressed serious need for protecting parks and gardens as they were the lungs of the localities while deciding a public interest litigation filed by Civic Action Guild Foundation, Nagpur.In the PIL, the non-profit organisation questioned legality of the tender issued by Nagpur municipal corporation in July this year for appointing a contractor to maintain a children’s park. It was particularly aggrieved by the clauses in the tender that allowed the contractor to commercialise the open space by setting up his own sports complex, swimming pool, restaurant, etc.The HC accepted the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner body that the development already carried out at the park was unauthorised and the civic body could not be allowed to further proceed with the tender. It also accepted that allowing commercialisation of the park, which is reserved in the sanctioned development plan as a garden, would amount to change in use.“There is no doubt that if the park is used for commercial purposes, it may frustrate the purpose for which the said open space has been reserved in the final development plan,” said the bench and struck down the tender. It has also directed Nagpur municipal corporation to examine if the construction work done so far was in conformity with the development control regulations and the broader requirement of protecting open and green spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cities-rapidly-becoming-concrete-jungles-bombay-hc/story-idZ8ntJAtFXw8Fli9qSmsI.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Working to save trees near Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra: Aaditya Thackeray||State departments are now working together to come up with a solution to save 98 trees for a road-widening project from Wardha to Mahatma Gandhi’s Sevagram Ashram, the Maharashtra government said on Wednesday.Following a meeting with state public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan on Wednesday, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said multiple options were being looked at, to ensure affected trees were saved. The minister took to social media stating that several representations on the issue were received locally and internationally by the state.To allow ease of traffic and to facilitate the movement of tourists to Bapu’s ashram ahead of his 151st birth anniversary (October 2), the public works department (PWD) had proposed road widening (during the last week of July) from existing 10m to 14m along a 9-km stretch from Wardha to Sevagram, that would lead to the felling of 168 trees. While 70 of the 168 trees were felled, the local and ashram residents and three generations of Mahatma Gandhi’s descendants wrote a detailed letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, last Wednesday, requesting the project to be called off to protect the remaining green cover.“The issue lies across a 2-km stretch leading up to the ashram,” Thackeray said. “A team from the state PWD will visit the site to study alternatives in terms of diversion, transplantation or keeping the width as it (two-lane) along a 2-km stretch. They will submit the feasibility of each option to both the PWD minister and myself. The best option will be implemented to save the trees and ensure the road is safe for travel.”A senior PWD official said the assessment team would be headed by the additional chief secretary (PWD).The environment minister said he was thankful to Ashok Chavan for immediately asking PWD to coordinate with the environment dept and find a solution to save the remaining trees. “We are committed to sustainable development,” said Thackeray.Wardha collector Vivek Bhimanwar said he will be joining the site visit along with PWD and a Wardha forest range officer. “Since the existing road is narrow, our only concern was that it should not create a bottleneck when large traffic volume passes, and become an accident spot. Nonetheless, now everybody is on board to ensure maximum trees should be saved and all options will be explored by us before submitting our report,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/working-to-save-trees-near-sevagram-ashram-in-maharashtra-aaditya-thackeray/story-cGdbp2FB9mobsr6BAEsvYO.html

10-09-2020||Mumbai||27 persons booked for trying to usurp Mumbai civic body land using fake documents||Following a complaint from officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) H-East ward, 27 people, including developer and main proprietor, secretary and treasurer of a housing society, have been booked for allegedly forging documents to get flats and shops on BMC’s land. Shashikant Bhandari, senior inspector from Nirmal Nagar police station, said, “We have registered a first information report (FIR) and are investigating the case. We haven’t arrested anybody yet.”After receiving a complaint in February about people allegedly using forged documents to get property on BMC’s land at Ganpatram Dayma Marg in Bandra (East), Nirmal Nagar police conducted an inquiry. The allegations were found to be true, following which the police informed BMC. On August 31, based on a complaint by BMC, a case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.BMC officials in the complaint said, “In 2004, residents of the plot of land in question formed an organisation named ‘Om Sai Sanstha’ to redevelop their houses and shops. In 2010, they came in contact with Saranga Estate Pvt Ltd to redevelop the plot, for which 42 of the total 48 residents submitted their documents.”“While examining the documents, BMC found 10 Gumasta licences and nine ration cards were fake, 11 people did not have any room on that plot, and eight persons had submitted documents having two different addresses. During initial inquiry, they have found Likhmaprasad Badgujar, main proprietor; Lalchand Gupta, secretary; Rajesh Tripathi, treasurer; Yogesh Gupta of Saranga Developers Pvt Ltd; and 27 others had planned and submitted fake documents to BMC to build houses and shops on BMC’s plot,” read the BMC complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/27-persons-booked-for-trying-to-usurp-mumbai-civic-body-land-using-fake-documents/story-YumJnkTpw6UDr7BYGfK9oJ.html

10-09-2020||Mumbai||24x7 suicide prevention helpline launched: Mumbai resident glad her efforts paid off||For 22-year-old Mumbai resident Raashi Thakran the launch of India’s first 24/7 suicide helpline KIRAN is like a personal victory. The Union social justice and empowerment ministry launched the helpline — 1800-599-0019 — earlier this week. In January 2019, Thakran lost her 18-year-old brother who died by suicide. Since then, she left no stones unturned to initiate a centralised 24/7 helpline number for suicide prevention. “When my brother died, out of curiosity, I called around 20 suicide prevention helpline numbers but only three responded. All these helplines are run by NGOs and none of the function round the clock. This left me thinking what if my brother had called one of them and didn’t get help on time,” Thakran said on the eve of Suicide Prevention Day on September 10. To highlight the issue, last year in June, Thakran, who currently works in Bengaluru, started a petition on Change.org addressing the Union health ministry which gathered almost two lakh signs within two months. She also met some government officials who showed interest in launching a centralised helpline or revamp an already established one. However, as Covid-19 hit India, her efforts got stalled.In June, after Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide at his Bandra residency, her petition gained momentum again, garnering more than four lakh signatures. “It is saddening that despite having over one lakh suicides every year in India, authorities and public needed an actor to die to value the importance of mental health. More importantly, this country didn’t even have a government helpline number,” she added.India reported about 381 suicides daily in 2019, marking a nearly 3.4% increase as compared to 2018, a report by the National Crime Records Bureau stated. Maharashtra recorded the highest number of deaths by suicides. City-based psychiatrists welcomed the launch of the national suicide prevention helpline. “This is a major step towards suicide prevention in the country. But it is saddening that India didn’t have a national helpline for so long. What is even more disturbing is the fact that the authorities had to wait for a virus to hit or an actor to die,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, city psychiatrist. Dr Milan Balakrishnan, secretary of Mumbai chapter of Indian Psychiatric Society and consultant psychiatrist at Bombay Hospital, said, “People suffering from any mental illness often shy away from consulting psychiatrists. But often, they prefer talking to people on the phone through these helplines. It may not help to cure a depressed patient completely, but it is the first step.”He added, “There is need for similar helplines especially at night when patients are free and often feel lonely and want to talk to someone about their thoughts.”Thakran, who has called the recently-launched helpline a couple of times to check its responsiveness, said, “My brother can finally rest in peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/24x7-suicide-prevention-helpline-launched-mumbai-resident-glad-her-efforts-paid-off/story-sEicBdYFizMcwlmLPeWw1L.html

10-09-2020||City||Kangana Ranaut’s Pali Hill office in Mumbai takes centre stage||Mired in controversy for the past three days, actor Kangana Ranaut had purchased the standalone prime property at Pali Hill in Bandra in September 2017 and converted it into her office space. The renovation of the structure was completed earlier this year. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday demolished alleged violations to the structure, amid war of words with the actor. According to civic officials, the 3,000-sqft Bungalow no 5 in Chetak Cooperative Housing Society existed in their records as a residential property since the 1970s. Prior to the purchase in 2017, the property housed a playschool. Ranaut’s office, Manikarnika Films Private Limited, is surrounded by houses of several Bollywood personalities. It is a two-storey structure with a 500sqft separate parking space. Civic officials said on their inspection of the property on Monday, they found 14 types of structural violations and issued a notice seeking a reply on the violations. They said the violations could have been made during the recent renovation work. Kangana Ranaut or her representatives could not be reached for their comments. A civic official said, “The violations listed in the stop-work notice issued were changes made to a residential property converting the space as per commercial purpose. This could be a change of user violation.”“The owner has to carry out renovations according to the approved plans and needs necessary permissions to complete the change of user procedure,” he said.In a tweet, Ranaut said: “There is no illegal construction in my house, also government has banned any demolitions in Covid till September 30…” Meanwhile, Ranaut was also in a legal dispute with BMC over her flat in a posh residential housing society at Khar near Bandra. According to BMC in 2018, it had sent a notice to Ranaut over several structural changes to her house, which were termed violations. Ranaut had challenged it in the Dindoshi civil court. According to BMC officials, the matter has been sub-judice and no action was taken over it on Wednesday. A BMC official said, “The matter regarding her flat and violations is a different issue. The action on Wednesday was in her bungalow in Bandra.” On civic corporation’s notice of 2018 regarding her flat in Khar, Ranaut on Wednesday tweeted: “This was not just to me (the notice), but to entire building and this is not my flat issue but a building issue which builder needs to deal with.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kangana-ranaut-s-pali-hill-office-in-mumbai-takes-centre-stage/story-iPoAFPag9ClO7kmdzP1AtM.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||31% of Maharashtra’s total Covid-19 tests done using antigen kits||Although the use of rapid antigen tests in Maharashtra began in July, the diagnostic tool already accounts for 31% of the total Covid-19 tests, with more than 60% of the daily tests in Maharashtra being carried out using the kits, according to the state health department data. The rigorous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is considered the gold standard for Covid testing. RT-PCR test results come in eight hours, while antigen tests give results in 30 minutes and are considered less reliable in comparison. RT-PCR test is carried out on symptomatic patients and those who come negative in the antigen test. Medical experts advise against over dependence on antigen tests due to its high false negative rate. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March till September 7, Maharashtra has conducted 4,705,932 tests, of which 1,458,827 were antigen tests. The data, accessed by HT, shows that every day, 45,000-50,000 rapid antigen tests are conducted in Maharashtra, while around 25,000-odd tests are through RT-PCR. For instance, 46,961 of the total 72,248 tests conducted on September 2 were through rapid antigen-based kits. While less than 5% were TrueNat tests (originally designed to test tuberculosis), the remaining tests were via RT-PCR. Maharashtra, which is one of the worst-affected states, has one-fourth of India’s active cases. To boost testing, public health officials have asked all hospitals to use antigen tests as a primary testing tool to detect Covid-19 patients with severe acute respiratory infection or influenza-like illnesses. They have also recommended the use of antigen tests for high-risk contacts of patients and symptomatic healthcare workers. In a rapid antigen test, oral or nasal swab samples are taken to detect the presence of antigens (foreign substances that trigger antibodies inducing an immune response in the body) that are found on or within the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Unlike RT-PCR, the biggest advantage of this rapid point-of-care testing method is that it can be performed on the spot and outside a conventional laboratory setting, as it doesn’t deal with a live virus, and gives results within 30 minutes. RT-PCR tests for genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and therefore needs a biosafety level 2 laboratory for analysis, and provides results in five to eight hours. The data shows that on August 2, 50,421 of the 78,711 tests were antigen tests. Again, 40,905 of the 68,175 tests conducted on August 28 were through antigen kits. Districts like Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Solapur are conducting maximum number of rapid antigen tests in the state, which is spending around ₹1 crore every day. “We are not overdoing rapid antigen tests in the state. We are focussing on 50:50 ratio for antigen tests and RT-PCR. In fact, if any person with symptoms tests negative in the state, we run a second confirmatory test under RT-PCR. The false negative reports are not even 1%,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) June 14 ‘Advisory on Use of Rapid Antigen Detection Test for Covid-19’, sensitivity (or the ability to detect true positives) of antigen tests ranged from 50.6% to 84%. “This implies that half of the negative reports given by rapid antigen tests may be incorrect. Also, considering 80% of people in India are asymptomatic, we will miss out on a large number of silent carriers due to ICMR rule [of RT-PCR tests for symptomatic people who test negative],” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. Recently, after veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek tested positive for Covid-19 following the onset of mild symptoms, other family members — actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and daughter Aaradhya — who did not display symptoms tested negative through antigen tests, the first line of testing. Later, in RT-PCR, the duo, who continued to be asymptomatic, tested positive for Covid-19. “This is why antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra. Healthcare experts said that while a testing strategy combining RT-PCR and antigen tests is a good decision, they warn that antigen tests should be restricted to containment zones and specific cases. “Antigen kits can prove effective in containment zones and faster diagnosis of suspected patients with SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) and ILI (influenza-like illness). But deployment of antigen tests for mass-based diagnosis is debatable. The more we increase the testing, the chances of kits throwing up negative results in asymptomatic patients gets higher,” said Anant Bhan, public health expert. As HT reported on August 15, amid scepticism over high false negatives in the rapid antigen test, state government data showed that a mere 0.17% of the samples tested in Maharashtra failed to identify the presence of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. At present, the state has 156 Covid-19 government accredited testing laboratories. But medical experts from the state’s Covid-19 task force said despite increasing testing capacity, it was only through antigen testing that they could bring testing facilities closest to the public as it doesn’t need laboratory set-ups. “In the early stage of the pandemic, when we relied only on RT-PCR, laboratories were getting overwhelmed with samples. Some laboratories even took two-three days to provide the reports which delayed treatment. At least, with antigen tests, people are getting reports on time,” said a senior health officer who requested anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media. “Our focus is to identify super spreaders.” In Mumbai, 95,342 antigen tests were conducted till September 8. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered another one lakh testing kits. “So far, we have concentrated only on running antigen tests in Covid Care Centres (CCC) and hospitals along with containment zones. But now, we will extend the testing to civic-run peripheral units and dispensaries,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Considering the growing demand, ICMR has evaluated 23 brands of antigen test kits. Three of them have been approved— SD Biosensor, LabCare Diagnostics and Coris Bioconcept. The health department can procure any of the three approved kits through the Union health department, while private hospitals can buy it from approved vendors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/31-of-maharashtra-s-total-covid-19-tests-done-using-antigen-kits/story-hOnY3IcIESrTKpyeVMwqWI.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps BMC for finishing razing of Kangana Ranaut’s office before its order; hearing today||Observing that the demolition undertaken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) at the Pali Hill premise of actor Kangana Ranaut on Wednesday morning “did not appear bona fide and smacked of mala fide”, the Bombay high court (HC) ordered the civic commissioner to stop the action in the afternoon. However, by then, BMC had completed the razing. Taking note of it, HC rapped BMC for trying to waste the court’s time by resorting to delay tactics to ensure the demolition work was completed. The civic authorities have been asked to explain their stand and conduct through an affidavit at 3pm on Thursday. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla while hearing the petition filed by Ranaut through advocate Rizwan Siddiqui was informed through video conference that the executive engineer of H-West ward had posted a stop work notice on the outer door of the actor’s premise on Tuesday around 10am. Siddiqui submitted that the alleged unauthorized construction pointed out in the notice was false and hence, even though Ranaut was out of Mumbai, a response to the notice was filed on Tuesday itself and submitted to the H-West ward office. Siddiqui told the court that Ranaut was to arrive on September 9 and had sought seven days to respond to BMC’s stop-work notice. The response, the advocate said, had also called BMC not to misuse its dominant position “to cause prejudice to the petitioner (Ranaut) with any hidden agenda coupled with ulterior motives” as it had given the actor only 24 hours to respond. When the bench took up the matter for hearing at 12.30pm, no one appeared for BMC. After 10 minutes, a counsel appeared, claiming she did not have a copy of the petition filed by Ranaut nor did she have an officer to instruct her with regards to the demolition. On hearing this, the bench directed BMC to stop the demolition work and asked BMC’s counsel to convey it to the municipal commissioner. After 35 minutes of the commencement of the hearing, senior counsel Anil Sakhare appeared and informed the court that BMC officials would answer the queries of the court. The officer informed the bench they had undertaken a survey of the premise and found various unauthorized construction in the premise on September 7. The officer said he had issued a notice under section 35 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act to Ranaut on the same day and had the stop-work notice posted on the outer door of the premise on September 8. After hearing the submissions the bench held: “We find the above conduct of the MCGM highly deplorable, more so since the MCGM was well aware that a Writ Petition would be filed by the Petitioner before this Court at any time, and an application seeking urgent orders will be moved by the Petitioner, and MCGM had therefore filed a Caveat before this Court. We therefore, informed Senior Advocate Shri Sakhare that such conduct on the part of the MCGM is totally unacceptable to the Court.” BMC had filed a caveat on September 8 in HC stating that as Ranaut was expected to file a petition, the court should “Let nothing be done unless prior notice is given to the Corporation.” The bench further observed, “Though the manner in which the MCGM has proceeded to commence demolition work of the said Premises, prima facie does not appear to be bonafide and smacks of malafide, we are giving an opportunity to the MCGM to explain its stand / conduct on Affidavit by 3pm tomorrow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-bmc-for-finishing-razing-of-kangana-ranaut-s-office-before-its-order-hearing-today/story-GlO2hyK7czso1Je4OZN1YM.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai releases final-year exam dates; to be conducted online in multiple choice format starting September 15||Almost two weeks after the Supreme Court (SC) clarified that final-year students can only be promoted based on examination results, the University of Mumbai (MU) on Wednesday released an official circular detailing the examination dates and format.Addressed to all affiliated colleges, the varsity has clarified that all exams will be conducted online in multiple choice question (MCQ) format and only in special cases where students have not been able to appear for exams online will they be allowed to appear for offline exams.In the circular, MU has stated that practical and theory exams for repeater candidates will begin from September 15 and 25, respectively, whereas fresh candidates will appear for exams from October 1 to 17. Colleges have been asked to share a sample paper and question bank with students, and conduct a mock test online in the new format for all their students before the final exams begin.“As discussed earlier, online exams will be in MCQ format and students will have one hour to appear for 50 marks in each subject. These 50 marks will then be converted into the 75/80/100 marks as prescribed by each subject. Only handicap students will be allowed an extra 20 minutes for the same paper and will also have the option of choosing a writer for the examination,” said an MU spokesperson.He added that colleges have also been asked to ensure early assessment of all papers to avoid any further delay in announcement of results. “Answer sheets in the MCQ format will not be eligible for re-evaluation, so results should not take very long,” he said.For starters, all MU affiliated colleges will have to conduct an online survey of their students to find out where they are residing at present (due to the lockdown), and what gadgets (mobile phone, laptop/desktop) and internet facilities are available to them. This will help them find out how many can conveniently appear for online exams.“Colleges have also been asked to start a helpline to counsel students and listen to grievances if any,” added the spokesperson.While MU has clarified its stand on examinations and have left colleges to take forward the process, many heads of institutes are not happy about the convenience with which all onus of exams has been pushed on individual colleges.“In less than a week, we will have to start practical exams for repeater candidates and by October 1 final exams for fresh candidates. In between all this, each teacher needs to submit 250 MCQ format questions for each subject, set final and mock test question papers, conduct online survey for students, as well as ensure that a helpline is up and running for student queries. The amount of work expected from teachers is unacceptable, that too at a time when they are already busy with online classes for the current batches,” said the principal of a suburban college, on condition of anonymity.Colleges will have the option of setting their own time table as long as they follow the dates as prescribed by the university. Once all subject marks are submitted by individual colleges to the university, the final results will be announced, states the MU circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-releases-final-year-exam-dates-to-be-conducted-online-in-multiple-choice-format-starting-september-15/story-YctDWzJeXvx6i7aZN7VDXP.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Interim stay on Maratha quota: Maharashtra to move CJI to get SC order revoked||Facing a political setback with the Supreme Court’s Wednesday order – an interim stay on Maratha quota in jobs and education, which will halt the ongoing college admissions, leading to chaos and discontent among the community – the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will file an application before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for its revocation. The three-judge bench stayed the reservation for Marathas in jobs and college admissions in 2020-21, while transferring the case to the constitutional bench. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 gives the community reservation of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions, respectively. The interim order could affect the appointment of more than 3,000 Maratha youths in government jobs, besides impacting college admissions for thousands of students, including in medical colleges. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose government had passed the bill two years ago, is also expected to use the issue politically to corner the MVA government, comprising three ruling parties Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress. Terming the decision surprising, former chief minister and public works minister Ashok Chavan, who also heads the cabinet sub-committee on reservation, said the government will fight the case to safeguard the interests of Marathas. “We had demanded the transfer of the case to the constitutional bench and it has been admitted to. However, the stay on the quota is incomprehensible as a few other reservation-related cases were transferred to the constitutional bench without any such stay. The petition has been transferred to the constitutional bench for further hearing and thus, it cannot be said that the reservation has been stayed,” he said. “We have convened a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday to discuss the issue and decide the course of action,” he said. “The admissions for post-graduate medical courses have been completed, while admissions to other courses are underway. The stay will disturb the entire admission process of colleges and universities. The Maharashtra Public Services Commission has recruited 127 deputy collectors and tehsildars from the quota recently, although they have not been given the appointment letters. Similarly, 3,000 employees recruited in 2014 under the reservation given by the Prithviraj Chavan government, too, are awaiting the final decision,” the officer said requesting anonymity. The BJP slammed the MVA government. “The MVA government was never serious about the reservation and its legal battle. Had it taken all stakeholders into confidence, the result would have been different. Our government worked day and night to safeguard the interest of the Maratha community and ensure the quota was upheld in the courts. Today’s order is the result of insensitivity and indifference of the government. I am distressed by the development,” said leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. BJP’s state chief Chandrakant Patil said it was the failure of the Thackeray government. Vinod Patil, who is one of the respondents in the petition in the Apex court, said: “When the 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section was transferred to the constitutional bench, there was no stay. The stay to our reservation is surprising.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/interim-stay-on-maratha-quota-maharashtra-to-move-cji-to-get-sc-order-revoked/story-M4GiXeaRUxEPwEHXvAGgEP.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||BJP backs Kangana Ranaut, Shiv Sena terms it conspiracy to separate Mumbai; Pawar says no need to take her seriously||After distancing itself from actor Kangana Ranaut’s remarks about Mumbai and city police, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday backed her and slammed Shiv Sena for the vengeful demolition of her office. The Sena said that BJP’s support to Kangana is a conspiracy to ultimately separate Mumbai from Maharashtra.On Wednesday, BMC demolished illegal structural changes allegedly carried out at the actor’s office at Pali Hill. Sena, which is locked in a verbal spat with the Hindi film actor, controls the Mumbai civic body for more than two decades.Former chief minister and leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis termed BMC’s demolition of Ranaut’s office as `state-sponsored terrorism’. “While one cannot support the statement made against Mumbai police or Maharashtra, one also cannot support such action by the government. It maligns the entire state in the country. Until yesterday, this construction was legal, only because someone spoke about you, you take action and point to illegalities. Then what about other illegal constructions in the city. This is state-sponsored terrorism,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis also termed Thackeray led government as the most scared and undemocratic government in the history of Maharashtra. BJP chief Chandrakant Patil also slammed the government and asked Sena leadership to keep Sena MP Sanjay Raut under control. “This `dadagiri’ won’t work. Kangana, as an Indian, can travel wherever she wants to. Is this how a woman is respected? What is the language that is being used? Raut should be kept under control,” said Patil.Meanwhile, in an embarrassment for the Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said that the timing of the action taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation gave rise to “doubts” over it. He also said that there was no need to take Ranaut seriously.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai on the statements made by Ranaut in the last few days, Pawar said, “We are giving too much importance to the people making such statements. One must understand the impact of such statements on the people at large.”Pawar said he had no information about the legality of the construction at Ranaut’s office which was demolished by the BMC today, but said the action has allowed the people to raise doubt indicating that it could have been avoided.“I don’t know if there was any illegal structure; I read about it only in the newspapers. It won’t be appropriate to comment on this without having proper information. Illegal work is not a new thing in Mumbai. However, BMC’s action in the backdrop of the ongoing situation allows people to raise doubt over it. BMC officials have their own rules and may have found it appropriate to take the action,” the veteran leader said.Sena on Wednesday took on the Union home ministry for providing Y-plus security to actor Kangana Ranaut calling it an insult to Mumbai and its police. In an editorial in Sena mouthpiece, Saamana published on Wednesday, the party alleged that the BJP’s support to the actor looked like a conspiracy to ultimately separate Mumbai from Maharashtra.“There is always a danger to Mumbai because those who support disrespect to ‘Mumbadevi’ are sitting in Delhi and Maharashtra’s assembly… First, defame Mumbai, then weaken it. Make Mumbai completely bankrupt and then one day separate it from Maharashtra. It is seen that these steps are being taken again,” the Saamana editorial said. It added, Comparing Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir and insulting the khaki uniform by calling Mumbai police as mafias are signs of a disturbed mindset…”The editorial, without naming the actor referred to her as a “supari actor”. The Sena mouthpiece added the Maharashtra unit of BJP should have not supported the ones who referred to Maharashtra chief minister in a disrespectful manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-backs-kangana-ranaut-shiv-sena-terms-it-conspiracy-to-separate-mumbai-pawar-says-no-need-to-take-her-seriously/story-2PPIQKjIZ2JNiOGkTQK2qN.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||237,200 passengers landed in Mumbai since Unlock 3.0 in August, 170,600 took off, shows airport survey||With Mumbai gradually easing travel restrictions, a survey by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has shown that more than 237,200 passengers arrived at the city airport since the commencement of Unlock 3.0 in August. In comparison, around 170,600 passengers travelled out of the city during the same period — 66,600 lesser. According to the survey, which was released on Wednesday, while passengers arriving at the Mumbai airport doubled in August as compared to July, there was a marginal increase in passengers flying out of the city. During Unlock 2.0 in July, Mumbai airport registered over 108,500 arriving and around 162,800 departing passengers. In contrast, during Unlock 3.0, Delhi, Varanasi and Hyderabad recorded arrivals of more than 51,200, 19,700 and 16,100 passengers, respectively. Mumbai airport authorities said that it is witnessing a steady growth in passengers arriving at the airport. “When domestic flight operations initially resumed on May 25, CSMIA had observed more passengers departing and travelling back to their hometowns. With the rising trend of business travel as the purpose of flying, the airport has observed growth in arriving passengers since August 1,” said airport operator Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). It added, “Since the resumption of commercial domestic flight operations, CSMIA has catered to a total of 47 sectors in the country, operated by 10 airlines.” Jitender Bhargava, former executive director of Air India, said, “I do not think that business travel has increased, considering that all meetings are taking place virtually. Increase in arrivals is because of increase in the number of international passengers after quarantine rules have been relaxed. They have their onward domestic flights from airports like Mumbai and Delhi. Similarly, even departing passengers from small cities arrive at big airports and then depart for their international destinations.” The airport was recently allowed to increase its daily flight operations from 100 (till August) to 200 this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/237-200-landed-in-mumbai-since-unlock-3-0-in-august-170-600-took-off-shows-airport-survey/story-azewlWx1wEhESTNb31ZsdP.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admissions in Maharashtra stayed until notice; no clarity on taken seats||In line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Maratha quota in jobs and education, the Maharashtra education department has stayed the admission process for first-year junior college (FYJC) until further orders. There is no clarity on what happens to students who have already been admitted through the quota. On Wednesday evening, the department released an official statement announcing the postponement of second merit list which was supposed to be published on Thursday. “The list is postponed and the admissions are stayed until further notice. Revised timetable for FYJC admissions would be released later after getting instructions from the state government,” read the statement. Officials at the education department said they would wait for a detailed court order and the instructions of the state government before deciding the further course of action. On September 4, HT had reported that more than 80% seats under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota, also referred to as Maratha quota, had no takers in FYJC admissions this year. For the 17,844 seats reserved for SEBC students out of the total 3.1 lakh seats in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region this year, only 2923 (16%) students had applied, of whom 2,309 were allotted seats in the first round of admissions. This is a considerable dip from 2019 when 30% of SEBC seats were claimed. However, with an interim stay on the quota, the entire seat matrix for admissions to FYJC is likely to change. Principals said the delay in the admission process might impact all students. “We don’t know what will happen with those students who have already taken admission. Also, with the change in the seat matrix, the seats would have to be recalculated before a new merit list is out,” said the principal of a suburban college. On June 27, the Bombay high court had allowed 12% reservation in education under SEBC category and struck down the state’s proposal of reserving 16% seats to these students. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court, which stayed the reservations in its interim order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-in-maharashtra-stayed-until-notice-no-clarity-on-taken-seats/story-gCY40mQQbJ0ioEy75cSKrN.html
10-09-2020||City||Three arrested for trespassing, attacking security guard of CM Thackeray’s farmhouse||Three people were arrested for allegedly attacking a security guard of chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray’s farmhouse in Raigad on the night of September 8, by Khalapur police station. The three accused, two of whom claim to be journalists of a leading English news channel, allegedly asked the security guard for direction to the farmhouse. When the guard refused to share the information, the three allegedly followed him and assaulted him physically and verbally. The three were arrested after the security guard lodged a complaint. According to Khalapur police officers, the incident took place on Tuesday at Bhilawali village. A police officer said, “The complainant was going for his night duty at the farmhouse around 7pm when two accused approached him and asked for the route to the CM’s farmhouse. The complainant, who got suspicious, said he was not aware of any such farmhouse and walked ahead. The trio later followed the guard and when they saw him inside the bungalow, they entered the farmhouse and started arguing about why he lied to them. The accused later thrashed the guard. After the accused left, the security guard filed a complaint with the police. “ Superintendent of police, Raigad, Anil Paraskar, said, “We have arrested the trio for trespassing and attacking the security guard of the farmhouse. Two of the accused claimed to be employees of a popular television media. We are verifying these claims.” Khalapur police registered a case under sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for assault), 448 (house-trespass), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Transport (KDMT) resumed its services on three routes. Under the Mission Begin Again of Unlock 4.0, the KDMT resumed its services on Kalyan-Umbarde (Shree Complex), Kalyan-Bhiwandi and Kalyan-Malang Gad routes.A KDMT officer requesting anonymity said, “We have resumed services on three different routes as people have been facing a lot of trouble to commute. The civic bus service will ease their woes. Although the services have resumed, strict guidelines mentioned as per the state government will be imposed throughout the services.”A total of seven buses will ply in the morning along these routes and nine in the afternoon.As per KDMT, only 50% passengers will be allowed and five passengers in standing will be allowed inside the bus. Each seat will allow only one passenger. Wearing a face mask will be mandatory inside the bus while bus driver and conductor will ask the passengers to maintain social distancing.All the buses will start at the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) depot near Kalyan railway station. “Passengers willing to take a bus will have to come to the depot,” added the officer.“With no auto rickshaws available, it was very difficult to travel to work. I used to take my two-wheeler daily but could not afford that. The civic bus service resumption is a great relief. Proper social distancing is being followed inside the bus,” said Jayesh Rane, 38, a passenger who took the civic bus to Bhiwandi for work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmt-bus-services-resumes-on-3-routes-to-start-from-depot-near-kalyan-railway-station/story-sMCmVUYwC7s9dx0rzrkDnN.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Hema Upadhyay-Haresh Bhambani murder case: 5 years later, 1 accused on run, 10 witnesses examined||After more than four years in jail and five rejected bail pleas, artist Chintan Upadhyay’s sixth bail plea will be heard on Thursday in the Bombay high court (HC). Upadhyay is the main accused in the double murder of his estranged wife and artist Hema Upadhyay and lawyer Haresh Bhambani. Since his arrest on December 22, 2015, Upadhyay has filed for bail repeatedly. After his applications were rejected by magistrate, sessions and the Bombay high court, Upadhyay moved Supreme Court (SC) for bail in December 2018. In February 2019, Maharashtra state submitted an affidavit that opposed the bail plea but assured the trial would be concluded within nine months. While rejecting Upadhyay’s plea, the SC bench of justices RF Nariman and Vineet Saran had noted, “If the trial is not concluded within a period of nine months, it will be open to the petitioner to apply for bail afresh.” Despite the state’s assurance of a prompt trial, the first witness in the double murder case was examined on August 22, 2019. So far, the prosecution has examined 10 witnesses, none of whom are directly linked to the murders. Advocate Bharat Manghani, representing Upadhyay, said, “The prosecution had voluntarily made a statement in SC during his bail plea that they will conclude the trial within nine months and that period is long gone. Till date, merely 10 witnesses are examined. Why do they make such statements if they can’t stand by it? There is no iota of material to connect Chintan with the alleged crime.” Special public prosecutor Vaibhav Bagade said, “The trial presently is stuck because of the pandemic situation. We are ready with all the witnesses and evidences to present it before the court as soon as the situation becomes normal.” According to Mumbai Police, which submitted a 1,658-page charge sheet in the case in March 2016, it was upon Upadhyay’s instructions that Hema and Bhambani were murdered by metal fabrication artist Vidyadhar Rajbhar. The police believe Upadhyay and Hema’s divorce case and property dispute had led him to plot the murders. Rajbhar allegedly killed Hema and Bhambani on December 11, 2015 and the bodies were then disposed of by his associates Shiv Kumar Rajbhar, Pradip Kumar Rajbhar, Vijay Kumar Rajbhar and Azad Rajbhar. The bodies were discovered on December 12 and within days, Shiv Kumar, Pradip Kumar, Vijay Kumar and Azad were arrested as was Upadhyay. Rajbhar remains on the run. A key element of Mumbai Police’s case against Upadhyay was Pradip Kumar’s statement. However, in June 2016, he retracted the confession, saying it was extracted from him under duress. Mumbai Police maintains the case against Upadhyay remains strong, with statements of 60 other witnesses and call detail records (CDR) that prove contact between Rajbhar and Upadhyay.So far, Rajbhar is at large. According to Mumbai Police’s crime branch, he has not been in touch with his family, including his wife and daughter. “We have checked their CDRs as well but the accused has never contacted them. The last time we got to trace his location was on February 2, 2016, when Vidyadhar had called his brother-in-law to check on the family’s well-being from a different number and a different mobile,” said an officer. The police were able to trace Rajbhar to Assam but his mobile phone was switched off on February 10, 2016, and there has been no update since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hema-upadhyay-haresh-bhambani-murder-case-5-years-later-1-accused-on-run-10-witnesses-examined/story-EgKfqKCH2mCmwyyk1SFwXK.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||SC directs Mumbai-based consumer body, airlines to file affidavits on refunds on tickets booked during Covid-19 lockdown||The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday directed consumer rights body Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), party to the plea, to file an affidavit on suggested amendments to the aviation regulator’s affidavit on refunds for air tickets booked during the Covid-19 lockdown.Last week, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), in its affidavit to the Apex court stated that all airlines will refund the amount for tickets that were booked in the first and second lockdown period. It had, however, said that a financially unstable airline can offer credit shells to passengers. In Wednesday’s hearing, SC also asked airlines to reply to DGCA’s affidavit on refund to passengers booked to fly during the first two lockdowns. According to MGP, senior citizens should not be asked to use credit shells, and airlines should not ask passengers to pay the fare difference. Instead, they should be allowed to fly on the original ticket price until March 2021. A credit shell is an open ticket, issued when an airline holds on to the booking amount in the form of credit.“Spice Jet and Indigo are more or less comfortable but Go Air was not happy with the DGCA affidavit. MGP wants some changes in the affidavit too. Hence, all stakeholders who have anything to say on the government proposal are asked to file their affidavits in one week,” said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman, MGP. The next hearing is scheduled for September 23. SC has asked all the airlines as well as MGP to submit their affidavits by September 16.“On the whole, the proposal of the civil aviation ministry is welcomed by us, as it tries to harmonise and balance the interest of both passengers and the airlines. There is, however, a need for further relief. In the present situation, senior citizens are advised not to travel and hence it will be in consonance with government policy to direct airlines to refund the ticket amounts to senior citizens forthwith. There’s also a need to protect these passengers against the possible fare hike and they should be allowed to travel till March 31 on the same fare,” said Deshpande. DGCA, in its affidavit to the SC, stated that tickets booked for domestic and international carriers between March 25 and May 3 will be fully refunded within 15 days. “If on account of financial distress, if the airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected. This credit shell shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket,” it added.The DGCA affidavit stated that passengers will be able to use the credit shell up to March 31, 2021, and change the flight sector. This means that a passenger booked on a Mumbai-Indore flight can change his/ her sector and fly to any other destination until March 2021.An order was issued by SC on June 13 asking private airlines and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) to find a way to refund the airfare of passengers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown. It was then the meetings were held with all the stakeholders in July and it was decided that tickets booked directly by passengers during lockdown 1 and 2 will be fully refunded.Questioning DGCAs affidavit, a former DGCA official said, “Which airline is doing financially well with this pandemic? Why will an airline provide a refund when they can state that they are currently financially unstable and hence, cannot provide a refund?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/supreme-court-directs-mumbai-based-consumer-body-airlines-to-file-affidavits-on-air-ticket-refunds-to-passengers/story-UepkkVrDa5dXWMRrcKrwPI.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccine trials put on hold at KEM Hospital in Mumbai after move in UK||The King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Parel has decided not to commence trials for the Covid-19 vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, as they have been put on hold after a participant had an “adverse event” in the United Kingdom (UK). KEM Hospital was expected to start the trials on September 11 after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had selected two civic-run hospitals – BYL Nair being the other one – in Mumbai to conduct the trials.“We have decided to halt the trials. Until the causality factor of the adverse event is identified, the safety of the vaccine can’t be guaranteed. The sponsor of the trial and the manufacturer will report this to the regulating authority and ethics committee. Once, they respond, we will start giving the vaccine,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean, KEM Hospital said. “It is not in my hand. It is up to the regulating authority to decide.”Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume, and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca have partnered to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been named Covishield in India.SII issued a statement, which said: “We can’t comment much on the UK trials, but they have been paused for further review and they hope to restart soon. As far as Indian trials are concerned, it is continuing and we have faced no issues at all.”The vaccine is a viral-vector vaccine that harnesses a cold-causing ‘adenovirus’ (a group of common viruses). It has been modified in such a way that it can no longer replicate in cells, and it modifies the ‘spike’ protein in human cells that the novel coronavirus targets to infect people. “The volunteer has been diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. But ‘adenovirus’ doesn’t cause that. So, there is a possibility that this would not happen in India. But it needs proper analysis as the trials are being conducted on healthy people.”Meanwhile, KEM Hospital has received applications from more than 100 volunteers who want to be part of the pan-India clinical trials. The hospital authorities plan to conduct the requisite medical examination of the volunteers till the trails are on hold. “Without wasting time, we will keep the volunteers ready for the trials,” said Deshmukh.Doctors said some volunteers may back out after the reports of the UK participant come out, as the hospital is already getting inquiries regarding it. “We have received more than 40 calls till [Wednesday] afternoon inquiring about the adverse effect on volunteers. But such hiccups are common in clinical trials. Therefore, volunteers are covered by insurance,” said a doctor, on condition of anonymity. Dr Trupti Gilada, infectious disease specialist, Masina Hospital, said, “Such temporary holds are not uncommon in large clinical trials of vaccines or drugs. This is a standard safety check in the process to investigate if any potentially unexplained serious event seen is owing to the vaccine or is a mere coincidence. In fact, this is the reason why large clinical trials are done on new vaccines or drugs to ensure safety in addition to its efficacy. This shouldn’t cause any apprehension.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-vaccine-trials-put-on-hold-at-kem-hospital-in-mumbai-after-move-in-uk/story-lklGH1tJZnMljarp28aB3J.html
10-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana sports minister and former Olympian Sandeep Singh front runner for HOA chief post||Haryana sports minister and two-time hockey Olympian Sandeep Singh is a front runner for the post of president of the Haryana Olympic Association (HOA). The state Olympic body polls are scheduled for September 19 at HOA Bhawan in Panchkula. Former Indian hockey skipper Sandeep, who made his debut in the Vidhan Sabha from Pehowa constituency on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket, is all set to challenge incumbent president former ADGP PV Rathee’s group. Rathee is believed to be close to former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. He had taken the reins of HOA during the Congress regime. If Sandeep is able to topple the Rathee group, he will become the first Olympian to head the body. Other politicians, who are heading sports associations are Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, who is leading the Haryana Rifle Shooting Association and Paralympics Association of Haryana; BJP MP Dharambir Singh in swimming; and Congress Rajya Sabha member Deepender Singh Hooda the wrestling unit. A number of bureaucrats and police officers are also heading the state sports associations. The HOA has a voting strength of 124. There are three votes each for the 33 affiliated state sports associations and one vote each for 21 district Olympic associations. There are four institutional members --- Haryana Police Academy, Madhuban, Motlilal Nehru Sports School, Rai, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation and Shah Satnam Sports, Sirsa, who have a vote each. All 21 district Olympic associations had dues pending for HOA’s annual subscription for the last four to 10 years, but with the state sports minister jumping into the fray, all district bodies cleared their arrears before the last day of submission, which is September 10. “Sandeep being an Olympian and holding the sports portfolio in the Manohar Lal Khattar cabinet is the most-eligible person for heading the HOA. Many state associations have extended their support to Sandeep and hopefully he will be able to sail through,” said the secretary of one of the affiliated state sports associations. In the past, control over HOA has always been seen as a prestige issue for the government in power. Be it the Congress or the Indian National Lok Dal, in their tenure they had used their political positions to capture the state Olympic body. During the previous tenure of the BJP government, Rathee had the numbers, so the government refrained from jumping in the direct HOA elections. In 2015, for a short one-year stint, BJP member of Parliament from Bhiwani, Dharambir Singh, was unanimously made the president with an understanding with Rathee, and later in 2016, Rathee became the HOA chief. “The last state games were organised in 2012. There has not been a single activity in the last four years. This is going against the incumbent group and many sports associations are hoping that the sports minister will strengthen their units and they will be able to hold activities with the government support,” says Sajjan Kumar, who was a joint secretary in the Rathee-led HOA and resigned on September 4. “But, at the same time, you can’t take Rathee ji lightly. He has been at the top of the affairs of HOA for a long time, so some associations might be loyal to him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-sports-minister-and-former-olympian-sandeep-singh-front-runner-for-hoa-chief-post/story-zN2MAuhDZzCox9wrndBiJL.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Four policemen arrested for assaulting a 22-year-old to death in Mumbai’s Juhu area||Four constables attached with Juhu police station have been arrested by a special investigation team (SIT) for allegedly assaulting a 22-year-old to death, on Wednesday. The constables were suspended from service in August after the Bandra division’s assistant commissioner of police (ACP) informed the Bombay high court (HC) that he had identified the four police personnel from Juhu police station who assaulted the victim Raju Velu Devendra. The accused policemen were identified as naik Santosh Ganptrao Desai, naik Anand Sitaram Gaikwad, constable Digambar Sakharam Chavanm and constable Ankush Ambadas Palve. According to the police sources, following the seriousness of the case, an SIT was formed under the supervision of Sakinaka ACP Milind Khetle. The SIT during the course of investigation found the involvement of the four policemen for assaulting the victim and arrested them. The accused will be produced before the court tomorrow.Police sources said last month an internal inquiry had revealed that the four policemen had assaulted Devendra after he was found outdoors during the Covid-19 lockdown. Devendra was subsequently found dead. Juhu police had, however, maintained that in the intervening night of March 29 and 30, Devendra was spotted by locals while allegedly trying to enter a house near Mutthi Swami Chawl in Vile Parle. According to Juhu police, he attempted to flee by climbing the roof but slipped and fell on the ground. A mob chased him to an open space and beat him up, which led to him losing his consciousness. A patrolling police van later took him to Cooper Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival, Juhu police claimed. The police had also registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 141 (unlawful assembly), 142 (intentionally joining unlawful assembly), 143 (member of unlawful assembly), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon) and 147 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code against eight people. The matter, however, reached the high court later when advocate Firdause Irani brought to the notice of the high court Devendra’s death, which according to his family members, was caused due to police brutalities, in an attempt to highlight the police high-handedness in enforcing lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. It was only after the high court took serious note of police brutalities that the ACP of Bandra division admitted that Devendra’s death was not a case of mob lynching and that he was assaulted by four policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-policemen-arrested-for-assaulting-a-22-year-old-to-death-in-mumbai-s-juhu-area/story-gwRGO5dR54MAhjO2I9DnAP.html

The count of total recovered patients in the state stands at 686,462.The state is nearing one million Covid-19 infections, and going by the daily trend of fresh cases, it is likely to surpass the mark in the next two to three days. Mumbai, where the case curve had flattened in August, has witnessed a sudden surge in cases since the beginning of this month. Before Wednesday, the city had reported its highest 24-hour rise in infections of June 27, when 2,077 cases were reported. Mumbai has reported 15,227 cases in just the first nine days of September as against 30,474 in entire August.

An official said the CM has directed district officials to increase hospital beds with oxygen supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highest-24-hour-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-and-mumbai/story-lQBpnxvy2IMl4WiIFb9afN.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||BMC razes, Kangana Ranaut dares as row with Maharashtra government escalates||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday ignited the latest flashpoint in a raging political row by demolishing “structural violations” at actor Kangana Ranaut’s office in Bandra’s Pali Hill, a day after it had issued a notice to her and hours before she landed in the city amid tight security. The day-long drama saw the Bombay high court (HC), based on a petition filed by Ranaut, staying the demolition by the Shiv Sena-controlled BMC two hours later. The HC, which said the civic body’s conduct was “malafide”, has slotted the issue for hearing at 3pm today.Stemming from the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, the 33-year-old actor has been involved in a bitter war of words with Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena over her remarks likening Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). She reiterated the same after the demolition and also criticised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The Maharashtra government has accused Ranaut of carrying forward the political agenda of the BJP. It had moved breach of privilege motions against her on Tuesday, along with saying it will probe a drug-use allegation against her. The building at the centre of all this is Manikarnika Films Private Limited office, located in Bungalow No. 5, a ground-plus two-storey structure at Chetak Row Houses in Bandra’s plush Pali Hill area, which was bought by Ranaut in 2017. Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC’s H-West ward, said “We carried out demolition work of the structural violations at Kangana Ranaut’s office in Bandra’s Pali Hill. Post the demolition process, further action will be taken legally.”The actor took on Thackeray, saying, “Uddhav Thackeray do you think that you and the film mafia today have demolished my house and taken revenge? Today my house is broken, tomorrow it will be your pride. It is all about time, and it will not remain the same always. Uddhav Thackeray, it is good that this aggression and terror happened with me because this will have some significance.”Arvind Sawant, Sena MP and party spokesperson, refused to comment on Ranaut’s video clip where she challenged Thackeray. Despite attempts, Sena MP Sanjay Raut could not be reached for comment on the clip. Earlier in the day, Raut declined to comment on the ongoing issue and said, “I was in Saamana office since morning, I am unaware about happenings outside.” Sena insiders said that the party leadership has asked leaders to not wade into the controversy. “Only Uddhavji or if required, Sanjay Raut, will speak on this matter,” a senior party leader said. The episode started on Monday when a team of BMC officers visited Ranaut’s office and conducted an inspection. The BMC on Tuesday issued a notice to Ranaut over 14 structural violations. The notice was pasted on the gate of her office after her staff refused to take it. Post this notice, Ranaut through her lawyer, wrote to the BMC, seeking seven days to respond to the notice, instead of 24 hours. She also said the notice was in bad law and a misuse of a dominant position. The BMC on Wednesday said they were not satisifed with the reply and went ahead with the demolition. However, two hours after the demolition started with the help of a JCB machine (small earthmover) and cutters, HC ordered a stay.According to civic officials, when structural details were cross-checked by them, they found out that the structure exists in their records since 1970s. They also found out that the office has several structural violations, including illegal extension pointed out in the notice. The BMC listed 14 violations, including toilet converted into office cabin, kitchen constructed in storeroom, illegal pantry on ground floor, wooden partition in living room, staircase orientation changed, balcony enclosed, position of main gate changed, among others.A BMC official said, “We have taken action legally and we will inform the court on Thursday. Further, any action will be taken after HC’s hearing on Thursday. The penalty levied on violators is based on the expenditure for demolition, but now all these calls will be taken after court’s hearing tomorrow.”In tweets on Wednesday morning, Ranaut said, “As I am all set for Mumbai Darshan on my way to the airport, Maha government and their goons are at my property all set to illegally break it down, go on! I promised to give blood for Maharashtra pride this is nothing take everything but my spirit will only rise higher and higher. There is no illegal construction in my house, also government has banned any demolitions in Covid till September 30, Bollywood watch now this is what Fascism looks like.”Meanwhile, according to BMC, every year they have been carrying out around 1,500-2,000 demolitions against illegal constructions. However, this year, BMC officials said the figure will go down considering the outbreak of Covid-19. As per data available between January 2016 and July 2019, the BMC received 94,851 complaints of illegal constructions and that they have taken action against 5,461. RTI Activist Shakeel Ahmed said, “BMC received over 90,000 complaints, but has acted only on over 5,000 cases. This means so many illegal structures or violations are not being acted upon by BMC. What is the reason behind acting selectively? Why did the BMC not act earlier if there were earlier violations?”Advocate and BJP leader Vivekanand Gupta said, “BMC cannot demolish any property in view of Covid-19 situation. The HC has ordered on their own motion, all orders of dispossession / demolition of any court /tribunal /authority are in abeyance till 30th September.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-razes-kangana-ranaut-dares-as-row-with-maharashtra-government-escalates/story-D9Omi5Sdr0dldjcVv4WAcO.html
10-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty moves for bail, plea says she was ‘falsely implicated’||Actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik on Wednesday approached the special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for bail as their pleas were rejected by the magistrate court. The court will hear the bail application on Thursday. Rhea, 28, was arrested by NCB on Tuesday for her alleged involvement in a drugs case linked to late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and was remanded in judicial custody September 22 by the magistrate court. This is her second attempt to seek release after a magistrate court on Tuesday refused to grant her bail as the prosecution raised objection regarding the jurisdiction of the court to hear her plea. Showik, Sushant’s house manager Samuel Miranda, domestic help Dipesh Sawant, and Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra, Abdel Basit Parihar, who were arrested for allegedly peddling drugs, were produced before a magistrate court, which sent them to judicial custody till September 23, said NCB officials. They have all applied for bail and the matter was taken on board and further adjourned for September 10. Rhea, in her plea, stated that she was innocent and falsely implicated. Further, it was claimed that Rhea “was coerced into making self-incriminatory confessions and by her application on September 8 the applicant has formally retracted all such incriminatory confessions.” Rhea and her brother Showik have been booked under Section 27A of the NDPS Act which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders. As per the provisions, if found guilty the two can face imprisonment of not less than 10 years, but cannot be extended up to 20 years and can also be fined Rs2 lakh. The two have been arrested for allegedly arranging narcotic substances for Rajput. After her arrest, Rhea was taken for a medical check-up and Covid-19 test, following which she spent the night at NCB’s office in south Mumbai and was shifted to Byculla jail on Wednesday.The bail pleas of the two were not entertained by the magistrate court, followed by which their lawyer Satish Maneshinde has approached the special court. The pleas are scheduled for hearing on Thursday where the investigating agency would be required to file their reply before the special court. The defence has raised issue of applicability of charges of Section 27A of NDPS Act against the two. In Rhea’s plea, the defence has stated, “the allegations against the present accused would at the most make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug, which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender and hence the ingredients of Section 27A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances.” “The respondent [NCB] is silent as to the amount of financing, quantum of drugs and the type of drugs allegedly procured and financed by the present applicant. The case of the respondent in the layman term is that the applicant would co-ordinate the delivery of the drug for her then boyfriend and occasionally pay for them herself. In essence, her alleged role if any is purchase of a small quantity of drugs for her then boyfriend which would squarely fall within the ambit of Section 20 (b) (ii) (A) (produces, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports, imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses cannabis,) which is punishable with a maximum imprisonment of upto a year or with fine or both,” read the bail plea filed by Rhea’s lawyer. The defence alleged that even though the role attributed to Rhea and her brother Showik is identical to that of another accused in the case, Kaizan Ebrahim, NCB selectively invoked charges of Section 27 A only against Rhea and Showik. “The co-accused, Kaizan, was in fact released on provisional cash bail on the very first day of his remand by the magistrate court,” the defence claimed in Rhea’s bail plea, adding that the agency did not even ask for his custody. The defence have cited several rulings of the Apex court to support their contention and stated that in a case when the person is found to have been booked under bailable offence, he/she is entitled for bail. In the plea filed by Rhea, her lawyer has mentioned that she was questioned for three days by all level of officers of NCB on September 6 to September 8 before she was formally arrested. “There was not a single woman officer who interrogated the present applicant as mended by the law. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Sheela Barse VS State of Maharashtra, has held that the interrogation of females should be carried out only in the presence of female police officer/constable,” read the bail highlighting, that the agency failed to comply with the guidelines of the Apex court. Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday indicated that the investigation by multiple central agencies in the actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case could have been politically motivated. He said someone from the Centre or union home ministry may have directed to focus on the case. Pawar also confirmed to have received seven threat calls.“I don’t know but someone may have directed them or someone from the Centre or home ministry may have insisted to focus more on the case, following which, it is clear that they (investigation agencies) have taken such a stand,” the veteran leader said in response to a question over central agencies under pressure from the Centre to investigate the case.Pawar was speaking to reporters at YB Chavan Centre at Nariman Point, Mumbai after a book launch ceremony.Currently, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are investigating Rajput’s case and all three comes under the union home ministry being headed by Amit Shah.BJP has started a poster campaign seeking justice for the late actor in poll-bound Bihar.Coming out supporting the Mumbai Police force, Pawar said people of Maharashtra and Mumbai have an experience of years of the police and knows how dutiful their force is. “In my view, people don’t take such statements seriously. They have an experience of years of the police force and are aware how dutiful they are. We don’t need to take it seriously even if someone is saying that very often,” the former chief minister said.Pawar confirmed that he has received seven threat calls recently and said he doesn’t take them seriously. “The home minister (Anil Deshmukh) has given a record of the phone calls. There were seven such calls. I have received such calls before as well and don’t take them seriously,” he said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state home minister Anil Deshmukh, too, had received threat calls in the last past two days. Security was also beefed up at Matoshree, Thackeray’s residence at Bandra, following threat calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-rhea-chakraborty-brother-showik-move-for-bail-before-special-ndps-court-hearing-on-sept-10/story-zrvl4bG48Txs23WHoRyWsL.html

10-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 patients at risk of developing lung fibrosis||Doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have recommended lung transplants for two patients who have recovered from Covid-19, because of extensive fibrosis — a condition where lung tissues harden, with lesions caused as the infection heals. The country’s first lung transplant in a Covid-19 patient was performed in Chennai in the end of August. While most people recover fully from Covid-19, some experience persistent symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, erratic heartbeat, gastrointestinal problems, and muscle and joint pains for several weeks. A few develop irreversible cardiovascular and respiratory damage.“If you look at the available data, about 60 to 80% of the individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 may have some form of sequelae (a condition caused by another disease). It can be mild in the form of fatigue and body aches. But it can also be very serious in the form of individuals requiring to be on long-term oxygen therapy. We have had two individuals who have had extensive lung fibrosis and are being advised lung transplants. And we have people who have significant cardiac abnormalities and stroke,” AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said in the weekly ‘National Grand Rounds’ to present current evidence to doctors across the country. Also read | Delhi: Cases cross 4k for first time but drop in positivity rateApart from lung and heart conditions, Dr Guleria also warned about psychiatric disorders as a result of not just the infection, but the lockdown and social isolation imposed to prevent the spread of the infection. Referring to a study from Italy, Dr Anant Mohan, who heads the pulmonary medicine department in AIIMS said only 12.6% of all recovered Covid-19 trial participants were completely symptom-free after two months, 32% had one or two symptoms, and 55% had three or more symptoms — the most common of which are fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, chest pain, and cough. Dr Saurav Mittal, from the same department, presented three cases of post-Covid-19 complications and how they can be managed. The first case of a healthy 65-year-old man demonstrated that there could be persisting fibrosis in previously healthy patients that makes them oxygen dependent. The second case of a 43-year-old healthy man was to demonstrate how even after getting better. Covid-19 patients might develop blood clots in the lungs and secondary infections that can lead to deterioration. And, the third case of a 45-year-old man with mild disease who developed a fever 15 days later was to shows that other infections like dengue could be the reason for the second phase of symptoms. When it come to fibrosis in the lungs, Dr Mohan said that although there was no estimate of the prevalence, he thought the doctors would see several patients in the clinics with such cases. “There is no estimate of prevalence of post-Covid-19 fibrosis but given the volume of Covid-19 cases, even if it is a small percentage, the absolute numbers are likely to be huge,” he said. The doctor said based on knowledge of fibrosis without known causes, and fibrosis caused by other coronavirus diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) shows that people above the age of 65, those who had severe disease, had a long stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and needed mechanical ventilation, and those who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing fibrosis. “Lung transplant is an option for a very select group of people — those with extensive fibrosis and acute respiratory distress but who do not have other co-morbidities like renal dysfunction and muscle wasting after Covid-19,” said Dr Mohan. As for the heart, Dr Ambuj Roy, professor from the department of cardiology at AIIMS, said patients with severe pneumonia and other respiratory infections have a higher risk of heart attacks. “Once a patient recovers from Covid-19, we cannot lower our guards. As we have seen in the case of severe pneumonia, the risk of heart attack goes up by as much as six times. We need to closely follow the recovered Covid-19 patients who have multiple risk factors. Those who are on cardio-protective medicines should continue taking them diligently and those with higher risk should also be prescribed these medicines,” he said. The doctor also referred to a study from Germany which showed that among 100 recovered Covid-19 patients, 78 had some cardiac involvement and 60 had ongoing inflammation of the heart muscle. Professor Pratima Murthy, head of psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, who also joined the rounds via video conference said, “In the beginning, there was a lot of anxiety of getting Covid-19 and stress and depression due to the lockdown. When patients get admitted to hospitals, there are various social and economic factors at play that can lead to extreme depression, suicidal attempts and suicides. People may also develop post traumatic stress disorder about their hospitalisation experience. The inflammatory diseases are known to impact the central nervous system and may trigger mood disorders. It can also increase risk of schizophrenia and psychosis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-patients-at-risk-of-developing-lung-fibrosis/story-MUUEWzj7BB7LqRm6v2VGNL.html
10-09-2020||City||Possession of two parking lots not taken, Ludhiana MC scraps contracts||Three months after a contractor failed to take possession of the parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market and Sarabha Nagar Block-I, the municipal corporation (MC) on Wednesday cancelled the contracts and forfeited the earnest money. Following an e-auction, MC’s finance and contracts committee (F&CC) on June 9 had approved the resolution to allot the two parking lots to the same contractor for Rs 1.1 crore and Rs 4.5 lakh, respectively. Mayor Balkar Sandhu has now directed MC officials to float fresh tenders for all six lots in the city, as the contract period of other four lots will also end on September 30. Though the contracts were to end in August, a one-month extension was given to contractors to compensate for the losses during the lockdown.The civic body had earlier recommended cancellation of the contracts to the F&CC. But, with no meeting of the panel scheduled in the near future, the mayor, who is head of the committee, cancelled the allotments.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said as per norms, a contractor, who failed to take possession of a lot, had to be blacklisted. But, MC had not yet taken any decision in this regard. Members of the Feroze Gandhi Market Association have been demanding that the corporation run the lots itself rather than handing them over to a contractor to avoid fleecing of visitors. They had also escalated haphazard parking of vehicles on roads by the staff of the contractor. MC secretary Neeraj Jain said, “The mayor has cancelled the contracts of two parking lots. We are working on preparing fresh tenders for the e-auction of all six parking lots. Terms and conditions are also being drafted.” Fresh tenders will be floated for the parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market, Bhadaur House, BRS Nagar, Model Town Extension, Multi-storey parking near MC’s Zone A office and Sarabha Nagar market (Block-I).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/possession-of-two-parking-lots-not-taken-ludhiana-mc-scraps-contracts/story-NW0SXkv3nH4GOUSu3WVIcL.html

10-09-2020||Delhi||Work on drain damages 30 trees in Lodhi Colony||At least 30 tree bases are believed to have been concretised along Meera Marg-IV Avenue Road in Lodhi Colony during construction of a drain by the Delhi government’s public works department (PWD). Work on a part of the stretch is still on despite the state forest department issuing a ‘stop-work’ order to the agency last week. The tree line on both sides of the road has been damaged with digging and cementing work being done within a one-metre radius of the tree trunks. The stretch has old and full-grown trees numbered by the forest department.According to forest department officials, a preliminary assessment of the stretch was done last week. The stop-work order was issued when violations were noticed . Digging and filling concrete within one metre of a tree trunk is a violation of the National Green Tribunal’s 2015 order and the Delhi Trees Preservation Act, 1994. Environment activist Verhaen Khanna has filed multiple complaints with the forest department, the PWD and Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai’s office about the violation of green norms during the construction. “At least 30 trees on the route have been damaged. Some corrective measures were taken by the PWD after the forest department asked them to stop work and restore the trees,” Khanna said. When HT visited the spot, the roots of a number of trees lay exposed, or covered with fresh soil as a corrective measure by the PWD. Elsewhere, the tree bases were cemented with a gap of less than a metre, blocking the flow of water to its roots. Piles of concrete and mud were dumped around several trees. A huge Semal tree (no.147) had its roots almost exposed due to digging and fresh soil was put to cover the damage. Deputy conservator of forests (DCF) South, Amit Anand, said he had issued a ‘stop-work’ order to PWD last week. “We received a complaint after which we conducted a field inspection. Digging was done too close to the tree trunks (within one-metre radius). Moreover, because of rainfall, the soil ran off the tree surface and its roots were exposed. We asked the agency to take corrective measures to restore the trees and share their plan on how they will carry out rest of the construction without harming the tree line. We have a hearing with PWD officials on Thursday,” Anand said. “Final orders will be issued after another round of inspection,” he said, adding the stretch has around 30 trees. A senior PWD official, who did not wish to be named, said they had taken corrective measures. “We will ensure none of the trees is damaged,” the official said. Khanna said the stretch has a variety of full-grown trees including semal, pilkhan and amaltas. “Concrete around trees causes the roots to become weak. The tree may dry up or die. Damaging trees will also affect the local flora and fauna that depend on trees for food and habitat. I have been repeatedly filing complaints in the matter, but the damage has already been done. The tree line was extending underneath the footpaths, but now the agency dug up at least 5-6 feet deep to construct the drain, which damaged the root system,” Khanna said. Faiyaz A Khudsar, scientist, biodiversity parks programme, Delhi University, said, “When tree roots are covered by tiles or concrete, they are not able to perform their functions of nutrient uptake and moisture absorption, which leads to weakening of the tree. When a tree is weak, it becomes vulnerable to attack of pest and pathogens, which can result in its decay. The maximum mortality in trees occurs post-monsoon, when most of the underground roots are flooded with rain water and the lateral roots responsible for performing major functions, in case being covered with concrete, will not be able to do their work and hence result in gradual decay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tree-bases-damaged-concretised-during-drain-construction-in-lodhi-colony/story-QGOzNDXG4iNdLV7biVJCkJ.html
10-09-2020||City||90 Ludhiana govt schools given ₹20,000 grant to set up educational parks||To hone students’ mathematic reasoning and inculcate a scientific outlook, the government has asked 90 government schools in the district to set up educational parks where concepts will be illustrated with two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Each school has been given a grant of ₹20,000 for the same. The project is part of the Centre’s Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, under which the district was given ₹18 lakh. The educational parks can be designed according to the space available at schools. In case of dearth of space, a single park, which covers concepts of all subjects can be setup. Schools have been advised to avail the help of art and craft teachers to make the models standout. Schools have been instructed to ensure a bilingual exhibit, with information displayed in English and Punjabi. ‘WILL HELP BREAK MONOTONY OF CLASSROOM TEACHING’ The parks aim to provide students with practical exposure and better concept clarity. Threeke Government Senior Secondary Smart School science teacher Rapwinder Kaur says, “The parks will help to break the monotony of classroom teaching as concepts will be explained through models. I had developed a science park at my school last year where innovative models were made out of waste and construction material lying around the school. The science park had received an overwhelming response from students and teachers of other schools. Science models such as a pinhole camera made of PVC pipes, Newton’s cradle, gyroscope made of a wheel, Newton’s disc made of basket covers, DNA model made of broken water pipes, sound pipes, whispering dish, windmill made using non-functional fans, and a periscope, have been displayed in our schools’ park.”Government Senior Secondary School (Multipurpose) principal Navdeep Romana said, “This is a great initiative by the government as it promotes activity-based learning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/90-ludhiana-govt-schools-given-20k-grant-to-set-up-educational-parks/story-3NnhGQYzu35JKLzzdTh0qO.html
10-09-2020||City||75-year-old victim’s co-worker masterminded armed robbery outside Ludhiana bank||A well-concocted plan by a co-worker of the 75-year-old victim with his criminal friends was behind the Rs 2.8-lakh robbery outside IndusInd bank on Gill Road on September 1, police said on Wednesday.Two of the accused – mastermind Arjinder Singh, alias Robin, of Mohalla Guru Arjan Dev Nagar, and Deepak Lalka, alias Dabbu, a resident of Deep Nagar – have been arrested.“Police have recovered Rs 43,500 from their possession, besides an Aadhaar card, a mobile phone and the motorcycle that was used in the crime,” said commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.Raids are underway to arrest their accomplices – Himanshu Marwaha of Parbhat Nagar, Dholewal; Kuntal Sachdeva of Sadar Area; Abhijit Mand of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Dugri; Gurpreet Singh Kalsi of Vishwakarma Colony; Kashish Bhinder of LIG flats, Dugri; and Mudit Sood of Phase 1, Dugri.DETAILED PLAN FOR EASY MONEYEach of the eight accused had a role to play in the robbery – from establishing the routine of Kuljit Singh, the 75-year-old victim, to following his movement, driving to the bank on a motorcycle, robbing him at gunpoint and arranging a hideout thereafter.The police chief said Arjinder worked in the same factory as the victim and was aware that the latter, as the firm’s cashier, regularly visited the IndusInd bank on Gill Road to deposit and withdraw cash.Eyeing easy money, he roped in his seven friends, who are all drug addicts and habitual offenders. They are facing multiple cases of attempt to murder, kidnapping and assault, and were even involved in the firing incident outside a restaurant in Dehlon a few days ago.In line with the plan, the gang members conducted a recce of Kuljit’s movement and decided to rob him on August 31. “But, they cancelled the plan on Arjinder’s insistence that Kuljit was not carrying a big amount. On September 1, Arjinder got to know that Kuljit will deposit Rs 2 lakh in the bank. He called Gurpreet and Deepak via WhatsApp and shared the victim’s identity,” the top cop said.While Deepak, Kuntal and Kashish monitored Kuljit’s movement, Himanshu, along with Abhijit and Mudit, drove to the bank on a motorcycle.As Kuljit was about to enter the bank around 11.30am, Abhijit and Mudit snatched his bag containing the cash and also threatened security guard Baghel Singh with a gun when he rushed to Kuljit’s aid on hearing his cries.The duo then fled with Himanshu on the motorcycle and reached Gurpreet’s house, where they distributed the booty among themselves.NABBED ON TIP-OFFArjinder and Deepak were arrested from a police naka near Trikona Park in Miller Gunj following a tip-off on Tuesday. They tried to flee on spotting the cops, but were nabbed after a chase.During questioning, the duo admitted to the robbery and shared the names of their accomplices. All accused are facing a fresh case of robbery.Agrawal said they were looking into the gang’s involvement in other similar unsolved crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/75-year-old-victim-s-co-worker-masterminded-armed-robbery-outside-ludhiana-bank/story-vdxhS28p21nFWl9iFGrpVJ.html
10-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Police form dedicated teams to prosecute those without masks, others to return to crime control||The Delhi Police will constitute a dedicated team in each police station to prosecute those not wearing masks, violating social distancing norms and spitting in public.The other personnel deployed at pickets points on the road as well as patrolling teams will no more be doing this task and will instead focus on their “primary job of crime control”. The dedicated team will be deployed at specific locations within the jurisdiction of each police station from 10am to 6pm daily to prosecute hygiene norms violators.On Tuesday, an order issued by police commissioner SN Srivastava said the dedicated team will have two personnel, overseen by an inspector-rank officer.The order comes just a day after the traffic police were taken off these tasks and told to focus on traffic management and violations, given that vehicular volume has increased on Delhi’s roads with the easing of lockdown restrictions.“Other district police personnel engaged in checking at picket points, patrolling parties and others engaged in crime control should concentrate on the primary job of crime control and law and order management,” the order said. A senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said the decision to cease prosecution at pickets points was taken because of “scarcity of resources”. “Normalcy has returned to the city and people are stepping out of homes more often. So, we have to focus on our core job of preventing crimes,” the officer said.The officer said it was observed that at picket points, it took about five minutes to prosecute each violator. “While the personnel are engaged in this task, a large number of vehicles pass through without any checks. The entire purpose of having picket points was being lost,” the officer said.Since March this year, the Delhi Police have issued a total of 306,693 fines for various hygiene rules violations until Tuesday evening. These include 277,131 for not wearing masks, 27,116 for social distancing violations and 2,434 for spitting in public.During this period, the police also saw nearly 3,000 of its personnel contracting Covid-19 and at least 17 of them had succumbed to the disease.A deputy commissioner of police (DCP), who did not want to be named, said while it is mandatory to have at least one special team for prosecuting Covid rules violations, he has formed three to four such teams in each district. “They’ll be deployed in markets, bus stands and outside Metro stations,” the DCP said. The dedicated team will identify spots where violations are likely to be high and prosecutions shall be carried out in rotation. The primary attention of the traffic police shall be on regulating traffic in view of the near normalcy of traffic on the roads,” the order said. When the lockdown was announced, the traffic police personnel had stopped prosecuting traffic violators. While they returned to their primary task in July, the department is yet to resume prosecution of drunk drivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-form-dedicated-teams-to-prosecute-those-without-masks-others-to-return-to-crime-control/story-I4ffEb5FbabLTrm1pDBe6I.html
10-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro ridership crosses 53,000 as Blue and Pink lines reopen||The Delhi Metro on Wednesday resumed services on the Blue Line (Dwarka Sector 21 to Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) and the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar), which also meant the opening of nine interchange stations that led to an increase in the number of people taking the Metro. The Yellow Line, connecting Huda City Centre and Samaypur Badli, together with the Blue and Pink lines registered a total ridership of 53,400 on Wednesday. Services continued in two shifts, from 7am to 11am and from 4pm to 8pm. The Yellow Line, which was the first corridor to be thrown open to public on Monday, recorded a total ridership of 26,900. The Blue Line saw 22,600 passengers while 3,900 people travelled on the Pink Line in the morning shift. The opening of these two new lines also made available interchange facilities at nine interchange stations. From Thursday, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will also resume service on the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Ballabhgarh), Red Line (Rithala to Shaheed Sthal/New Bus Adda), and Green Line (Kirti Nagar/Inderlok to Brigadier Hoshiar Singh/Bahadurgarh). Also read | Delhi metro tokens might return once the pandemic is over, focus on smart cards: DMRC chiefWith all three lines from the Kashmere Gate station becoming operational, Thursday will also be the first true test of DMRC’s crowd management protocols. “The DMRC will be running 35 trains on the Red Line, which will make 413 trips during the morning and evening hours on Thursday. Similarly, 40 trains will make 344 trips on the Violet Line and 20 trains will make 268 trips on the Green Line,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said. Dayal said, “The number of trips will be increased subsequently, as will the operational timings, as and when the other lines are opened in a graded manner.”  On Wednesday, on the Blue and Pink lines, operations largely remained smooth with passengers self disciplining themselves into wearing masks and maintaining social distancing at stations and on trains. However, there were some glitches. At certain Metro stations, such as New Ashok Nagar and Mayur Vihar Extension, commuters faced issues in recharging their smart cards at ticketing counters. Metro officials were seen pushing back the cards, while asking passengers to get them recharged online. However, card recharge facility was available at all interchange stations. Ajit Kumar Singh, a resident of New Ashok Nagar, said he was turned away from the station by Metro authorities for not having adequate amount on his Metro card. “I had to go to Dwarka from New Ashok Nagar. At the station, I got to know that the amount in my card was not enough. Earlier, there used to be a facility to recharge cards at the ticketing counters but today they turned me away saying recharge was not possible. I had to exit the station and recharge it online,” Singh said. Metro rider Anupama Rastogi said she also faced a similar problem and had to get her brother to recharge her card. “I wanted to take the Metro to reach my office at Mandi House but my card had insufficient balance. The Mayur Vihar Extension station officials said that there was no facility to recharge smart cards at the counter and it has to be done online. I don’t use online payment modes so I requested my brother to do it,” she said. DMRC said that recharge facility was available at customer care counters of all operational stations. However, since the recharge system has switched to digital, there are some teething issues which will be addressed, it said.“Smart card recharge is available at all stations.One can recharge the card by available cashless options be it online or at the customer care centres (using credit/debit card) at the stations. Wednesday’s mights have been some temporary connectivity issue with the POS (point of sale) terminals.These are teething issues which will be sorted out at the earliest,” Dayal said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/blue-and-pink-lines-open-many-face-trouble-in-recharging-travel-cards-at-station-counters/story-mp0oHaOi9IAxxa0vOYIh9O.html
10-09-2020||City||Punjab’s Covid capital Ludhiana grows health wise||The importance of social distancing has finally rung in among Ludhiana residents who until recently could be seen crowding in markets and defying Covid norms. With the district crossing the 12,000 mark in cases, the markets have started wearing a deserted look despite shop timings being extended to 9pm. On Wednesday, the usual hustle and bustle was missing from the main markets of the city, including Chaura Bazar, Pink Plaza market, Ghumar Mandi and Model Town market, among others. Even malls reported a low footfall. Chaura Bazar Shopkeepers Association president Parampal Singh Witty said, “The recent relaxations announced by the government have provided relief to shopkeepers, but the footfall in markets is still low. We are only receiving around 30% of our usual customers.” “Loss of income is also a major reason behind low footfall as many families are struggling to make ends meet amid the financial crisis,” said Witty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-grows-health-wise/story-1GgVLNJmHcLaqVT5N7jPjO.html
10-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt constitutes committee to suggest measures to augment excise revenue||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday constituted a committee under the chairmanship of excise commissioner Ravi Dhawan to suggest measures for augmenting the state excise duty revenue, the Delhi government said.This committee will also suggest measures for simplifying the liquor pricing mechanism in the city and checking malpractices and evasion of duty in liquor trade. “The panel will formulate a policy to generate more jobs in the restaurant and hospitality industry and to boost the business. It will hold consultations with stakeholders and it is also authorised to consider the representations received by the government on the issue. The committee will submit its report within two weeks,” Sisodia said. In a statement, the government said the panel will also look into changes in the excise duty structure that will promote ease of doing business for the restaurant and hospitality industry in Delhi.The members of the committee include deputy commissioner (excise) Sandeep Mishra and additional commissioner (trade and taxes) Anand Kumar Tiwari as members.“The hotel and hospitality industry has been one of the worst affected industries during the Covid pandemic. Millions of people work in this industry and it produces about 8% of the jobs in Delhi. But the pandemic has devastated this industry,” Sisodia said. Build consumer confidence: JainDelhi health and industries minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a “drastic drop” in the average spend of people, and emphasised that there is a need to work towards building consumer confidence to avoid a long-term downward spiralling effect on the industry.Jain also suggested that there may be a moratorium of no or minimal government interference for at least a year to help the industry get back to growth, the Delhi government said in a statement.Delivering the keynote address at the Delhi Business Week session hosted by Confederation of Indian Industry, CII, the minister said, “Delhi government has taken many steps to build consumer confidence by handling the pandemic and retaining key subsidies on essential services like electricity, water among others. There is a need to create demand for and by the industry to survive the Covid pandemic. The pandemic-induced uncertainties and insecurities led to drastic drop in the average spend or demand from the consumers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-constitutes-committee-to-suggest-measures-to-augment-excise-revenue/story-Ii6XIzVnpPXSpMicGKU1iL.html
10-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi schools put in place safety measures, say ready for guidance visits by students||A day after the Union ministry of health and family welfare issued detailed guidelines for “partial reopening” of schools for students of classes 9 to 12 on a voluntary basis from September 21 to seek academic guidance, principals of several private and government schools in Delhi said they are ready to receive students on their campuses after a gap of around six months.According to the Unlock 4 guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs on August 30, schools will continue to remain closed till September 30. At the same time, it stated, “Students of class 9 to 12 may be permitted to visit their schools, in areas outside the containment zones only, on a voluntary basis, for taking guidance from their teachers. This will be subject to written consent from their parents/guardians and will be permitted with effect from September 21, 2020, for which SoPs will be issued by the ministry of health and family welfare.”The health ministry on Tuesday issued the standard operating procedures (SoPs) which include maintaining a physical distance of six feet, sanitisation of school premises with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, 50% strength of teachers and staff members at a time, mandatory use of face masks, utilisation of open spaces for the teacher-student interaction and prohibition of sports and other assemblies, among others. Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, said the school is ready to “partially re-open” for the students of senior classes if they want to visit to seek guidance from their teachers but it has to be with the permission of their parents and if the Delhi government gives a green signal. “As per the government’s guidelines, the students can only visit for guidance and there won’t be full-fledged classes. We are absolutely ready for it if they want to come with their parents’ consent. We have arrangements to ensure social distancing. We have also procured necessary items such as sanitisers and thermal scanners. All the guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare will be followed,” she said.A senior official in Delhi government’s education department said there is no decision on reopening of schools or holding classes. “The Delhi government is still evaluating the situation. We are also discussing with the stakeholders if it will be feasible for us to partially reopen the schools in Delhi as per the Centre’s Unlock 4 guidelines. The government will soon take a decision on this,” said the official. Terming the SoPs “strict as they meant to be”, Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon Schools said, “This partial return of students will be like testing waters for opening schools. We will call students who are willing to visit the school in small groups in a staggered way. We are expecting that students of class 12 might visit seeking help in practicals. The school is prepared in case they want to come.”Principals said they will also have to prepare a separate time table since teachers will also be taking online classes simultaneously. “We will have to make sure that a subject teacher is available at the school for the students who want to visit the campus to take up their queries and doubts. We will also have to procure masks, sanitisers, gloves and thermal scanners. There will be staggered timing for arrival and departure for students at the campus and disinfection of the building on a regular basis,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini.Many schools, including Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, have also installed contactless water taps and sanitiser dispensers at their campus for the safety of the students. “We have also installed cameras in the classes. So, whatever the teacher will be teaching to the students who visit the schools to clear doubts, other students can also watch sitting at home,” said school principal Alka Kapur. Even though the Centre has permitted schools to run transport facilities if required, several principals said that they might avoid it as of now. Tania Joshi, principal of Indian School, said, “Many schools don’t have their own vehicles and they run vehicles on contract. We can’t control children on the buses. We will convince parents to drop and pick the kids to the school.”Officials at government schools said students will benefit if they start visiting their teachers on regularly. AK Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “Students of government schools have limited access to smartphone with sufficient data and if they come to school our teachers can provide them with proper guidance so that they can bridge the learning gap. For the safety of students, every precaution and social distancing method will be followed. Students will be made aware of how to live with coronavirus in the first week then the teaching will go on.”Meanwhile, several teachers said that parents should not hold them responsible in case anything goes wrong. Alok K Mishra, a mentor teacher at government boys’ senior secondary school in Mangolpur Khurd, said, “Schools should be partially reopened with all the precautions. It’s important both from the perspective of education and for the mental and social health of students. But there will always be a possibility of infection amid a pandemic. If any student gets infected the teachers should not be held responsible for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-schools-put-in-place-safety-measures-say-they-re-ready-for-class-9-12-students/story-YAzjFHwB2SrFPm8b4p7kLK.html

According to Wagholi gram panchayat officials, the number of Covid-19 patients had increased significantly in the past three days and an emergency meeting was held in the presence of elected members, district administration and health officials after which a decision of implementing a public curfew was taken.As of September 9, there are a total of 910 Covid-19 positive patients in Wagholi, as per health department officials.Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) director Sanjeev Patil, said, “People must co-operate with the authorities. Most of the virus spread is occurring due to violation of social distancing norms and people’s participation in public events. The situation is getting out of hand and the gram panchayat has ordered a self-imposed public curfew to curb the spread of the virus in the area.”Wagholi health officer Varsha Gaikwad, said, “The Covid treatment centre at Ayurvedic College and BJS College are full to their capacity as patients from villages as far as Shirur have been admitted there. The citizens must adhere to social distancing rules, wear masks and follow the guidelines of the government. Observing isolation alone can lead to breaking of the chain.”As per officials, the virus spread in the area took a turn for the worst after many people attended a marriage ceremony. One family saw 35 members testing positive for Covid and this in turn led to further spread of the virus.Wagholi gramsevak Anil Kumbhar, said, “Earlier, citizens were following the regulations, but now they are breaking all the rules which has led to a rapid spread of the infection in the area. The situation is alarming as people are stepping out in large numbers and not following the norms of social distancing.”Wagholi sarpanch Vasundhara Ubale, said, “Taking into account the number of positive patients found at a single place, the area has been declared as a containment zone and sealed wherein shops have been ordered to shutdown as a preventive measure. The connecting and internal roads of those areas have been barricaded and the area has been sealed as we don’t want to take any chance of further Covid spread. Every Wagholikar must take care of his or her health and stay indoors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/wagholi-gram-panchayat-appeals-for-public-curfew-from-sept-15-17-amidst-rising-covid-cases/story-cOHzlif13CMY5venLqDJRJ.html

Facebook Campus makes it easy to find and start conversations within your college community,” the company said.The service, to be initially available at around 30 colleges and universities in the US, is a dedicated section within the Facebook app, with a campus profile that’s different from the main Facebook profile. Profiles can be created with college email and graduation year. Key features include campus-only news feed and campus directory. Students can also create real-time chat rooms for their dorm or clubs they’re part of within Campus. Facebook began life in 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg started a website called Facemash, aimed at university students, while he was a student at Harvard University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/back-to-roots-facebook-starts-app-within-app-called-campus/story-z2FpTWa3oez7nZ1uxx6afL.html

No information was provided about the individuals whose visas were canceled.People on Chinese social media speculated that the students were likely connected with or graduates of seven Chinese universities and their affiliated schools which are connected with national defense.The cancellations are likely to add to the uncertainty Chinese students face about studying or working in America. The Trump administration earlier vowed to deport all foreign national students if they didn’t take in-person classes during the pandemic, only to withdraw that rule days later, leaving students perplexed and worried about their legal status in the States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-revoked-over-1-000-chinese-visas-over-national-security/story-BmclFOmU76jqpI14CX9pDM.html

It listed Vijay Chauthaiwale, in-charge of the BJP’s department of foreign affairs, as the party official it works with.For the mission and objective of the BJP as the foreign principal, the OFBJP, said in the registration form, “Advocating for welfare social policies, self-reliance, robust economic growth, foreign policy driven by a nationalist agenda, and strong national defence for India.”Adapa V Prasad, one of the three signatories of the registration form, denied that the registration was compelled by a US investigation of the organisation as had been contended by some. “OFBJP has voluntarily registered under FARA with DOJ, he said, adding, “OFBJP is not under any investigation.”A response was awaited from the US justice department to a request from Hindustan Times to confirm or deny that an investigation was underway.Prasad said the members of the organisation learned about FARA regulation “very recently and upon review of the regulation; we thought it best to register voluntarily”. He added, “We haven’t suspended any of our activities. We are fully functional.”The department of justice says, “FARA is an important tool to identify foreign influence in the United States and address threats to national security. The central purpose of FARA is to promote transparency with respect to foreign influence within the United States by ensuring that the US government and the public know the source of certain information from foreign agents intended to influence American public opinion, policy and laws, thereby facilitating informed evaluation of that information.”“Willful violation” of the law is punishable with up to five years in jail and or a maximum fine of $250,000, or both. The punishment for certain lesser violations is a jail term of no more than six months or a fine of $5,000, or both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-affiliate-of-bjp-registers-as-foreign-agent/story-vUFzyF4pYIFVEpy4I9o62L.html

These things happen.”Governments are desperate for a vaccine to help end the Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil, and the WHO had flagged AstraZeneca’s, being developed with Oxford University, as the most promising.However, the drugmaker suspended late-stage trials this week after a participant in Britain suffered from neurological symptoms.“It’s a race against this virus, and it’s a race to save lives. It’s not a race between companies, and it’s not a race between countries,” added WHO’s head of emergencies Mike Ryan.More than 27.95 million people have been reported infected globally, according to a Reuters tally.WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said a combination of factors is helping reduce death rates in Europe, including finding cases earlier and better clinical care.“We are in a better position to prevent the virus from infecting vulnerable populations,” she said, cautioning, however, that the disease’s long-term effects were still not known.WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who on Thursday upped his fundraising plea to $38 billion for the agency’s ACT Accelerator programme to fight Covid-19, declined to comment directly on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had downplayed the virus’s dangers while criticizing the WHO’s response.“What worries me the most is what I have been saying all along: a lack of solidarity,” Tedros said. “When we are divided, it is a good opportunity for the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-pause-a-wake-up-call-says-who/story-hvk0FgVpeT9nuYfeICamBO.html

Netanyahu has stepped up those attacks in recent days, following a pair of TV reports alleging cover-ups by police and prosecutors, including a case of possible conflict of interest by a police investigator.“Is it possible the attorney general didn’t know about this behavior?” Netanyahu told his Likud Party on Wednesday, calling for an independent investigation. “Is it possible the attorney general didn’t approve this behavior?”In a speech last week, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said the trial should take place in the courtroom, not in the “public square,” and warned against attempts to “delegitimize” the legal system. He reiterated his position that Netanyahu can remain in office while on trial, but only if there is a conflict-of-interest agreement that “prevents him from any possibility of influencing his personal criminal issues by exercising his governmental powers.”The Justice Ministry said Thursday that Netanyahu’s legal team was discussing the matter with government lawyers. “In the end, an agreement is expected to be signed to prevent a conflict of interest,” it said.Netanyahu’s Likud Party declined comment.Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving wealthy associates and powerful media moguls.He denies wrongdoing and has repeatedly tried to use the platform of his office to challenge the allegations and turn public opinion against the country’s legal system.Critics accuse him of threatening Israel’s democratic institutions in a politically motivated campaign of self-preservation, even at a time when Israel is dealing with a raging coronavirus outbreak.Channel 12 TV reported this week that police covered up knowledge of an investigator’s romantic relationship with the sister of a key witness and defendant in one of the corruption cases.Netanyahu’s rival and coalition partner Benny Gantz has vowed to support law enforcement, calling Netanyahu’s repeated attacks a “danger to Israeli democracy.”“This is not legitimate criticism; rather, it is purely an attempt to dismantle and to crush,” Gantz said.Thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating weekly outside Netanyahu’s official residence throughout the summer, saying he should resign while on trial and accusing him of failing to address the economic crisis caused by the outbreak.The Likud and Gantz’s Blue and White formed their coalition in May after battling to a stalemate in three consecutive elections in under a year. Under the deal, Netanyahu and Gantz will rotate as prime minister, with Ganz’s official title now being the “alternate prime minister.”There is deep distrust between the sides, and protracted paralysis has prevented the government from making key appointments, such as that of a national police chief.Critics believe that Netanyahu is eager to appoint supporters to these positions in hopes of delaying or even halting his trial, which after beginning with procedural hearings this year is set to kick into high gear in January with its evidentiary stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-benjamin-netanyahu-pressed-to-sign-conflict-of-interest-deal/story-JbkYMn31Q3PT7c4Et4LblJ.html
10-09-2020||World||12 held in Pakistan after woman allegedly raped on highway||Police in Pakistan said 12 men have been detained for questioning after two armed men allegedly raped a woman at gun point in front of her children after her car broke down on a deserted highway. The alleged rape in Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Wednesday night led to outrage in the country, with people from all walks of life demanding the apprehension of the suspects.Inspector-General of Punjab Police Inam Ghani said on Thursday they have obtained “evidence” that will lead them to the culprits. “We have done great work so far in the motorway rape case. We have located the village from which the suspects were from,” Ghani told Geo Pakistan channel.The woman was allegedly assaulted while waiting for help with her car, which stalled as she crossed a toll plaza on the motorway.She got a call from a male relative in the nearby city of Gujranwala, who asked her to call the police helpline for help while he also left from home to reach her. When he reached the location, he reportedly found the woman terrified, with her cloths stained in blood.Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh initially blamed the woman for the incident, for driving on the motorway late at night. Musarrat Cheema, a spokesperson in the eastern Punjab province, said earlier that raids were being conducted to trace and arrest the culprits.Human rights minister Shireen Mazari said her ministry’s regional office has asked for an action report from the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-held-in-pakistan-after-woman-allegedly-raped-on-highway/story-n0vV55HX4inMA33PCS0SNJ.html
10-09-2020||World||China troops from unit involved in India border clash to take part in Russia drills||China is sending troops from a unit involved in border clashes with India for a multilateral military exercise in Russia later this month, from which New Delhi had withdrawn.Pakistan, Iran, Myanmar, Belarus and Armenia are among countries taking part in the Kavkaz-2020 (or Caucasus 2020) strategic military drills to be held in Russia’s Astrakhan region on September 21-26, China’s defence ministry said in a statement on Thursday.The western theatre command (WAC), the unit of People’s Liberation Army involved in the ongoing border friction with India, will be sending troops for the drills, which the ministry said “are not aimed at any third party and are not related to the regional situation,” possibly referring to the China-India tensions.Late last month, India opted out of Kavkaz-2020 due to Covid-19 and consequent difficulties.“There is a decision not to take part in contact exercises in view of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our troops,” officials had told Hindustan Times in New Delhi. The expected presence in the exercise of troops from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, states that aren’t recognised by India, in Kavkaz-2020 was also a factor in the decision, one of the officials who wished to remain anonymous had told HT. With China announcing it’s sending WAC soldiers to the drill, New Delhi has possibly avoided an awkward situation by already pulling out.“The Chinese forces will mainly consist of troops from the PLA Western Theatre Command, which will carry wheeled equipment and light arms and arrive in Russia via China’s latest transport aircraft,” the defence ministry statement added.They will join exercises including mobilised defensive elimination, joint live-fire strike, multidimensional assault elimination and battlefield situation control.The exercises have special meaning for China-Russia ties “at this important moment when the whole world is fighting the pandemic,” the ministry said.Chinese state media questioned India’s withdrawal and speculated about the real reason for doing so.One state media foreign analyst said the pandemic cannot be the real reason.“That theory, however, ignores the fact that India was able to move many times that number of troops around the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China all throughout the summer, so it’s unrealistic to imagine that it can’t fly a few hundred out to Russia for friendly drills,” Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst wrote for the CGTN, China’s official English news channel.For Beijing and Russia, which have a “comprehensive strategic partnership”, the upcoming drills will be another opportunity to strengthen ties.The two powers have cooperated closely on military matters and diplomacy, largely to counter US influence. China has frequently joined Russia’s large-scale drills, the Tsentr-2019 and Vostok-2018. In July 2019, their troops conducted the first joint strategic patrol in northeast Asia, with the Chinese side dispatching two H-6K bombers and the Russian side dispatching two Tu-95 bombers. “In November and December 2019, the two countries also conducted naval drills in South Africa and the Gulf of Oman with South Africa and Iran respectively. In June, PLA honour guards participated in Russia’s Victory Day military parade in Moscow’s Red Square,” Chinese state media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-troops-from-unit-involved-in-india-border-clash-to-take-part-in-russia-drills/story-f8rqut1Asq5CZJowORXmmN.html
10-09-2020||World||In a year of social distancing, Covid-19 pandemic alters 9/11, too||In a year when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged.The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the Sept. 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, while President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden plan to attend a truncated ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania.In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly canceled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar sparked a change of heart. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters.Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to “Never Forget” is fading.“It’s another smack in the face,” says Jim Riches, who lost his son Jimmy, a firefighter.The father is staying home on the anniversary for the first time this year because he doesn’t want to take chances with the coronavirus after a prior illness. But he feels others should have the option of reciting the names of the dead on the memorial plaza, instead of listening to a recording.Memorial leaders said they wanted to avoid close contact among readers, who are usually paired at the podium. But to Riches, a retired fire battalion chief and frequent critic of the memorial organization, the decision sounds like an excuse for sidelining the families’ role in commemorating 9/11.“I wish they wouldn’t forget, but they’re trying to,” he says.But Anthoula Katsimatides sees the differences this year as an effort to ensure victims’ relatives feel comfortable attending — including her mother, who hasn’t left home since March because health issues make her especially worried about the virus. But she is determined to go in honor of her son John, a bond trader, her daughter said.In a year when many events have been called off, “this wasn’t canceled. It’s just been changed in such a way where we still get to pay tribute to our loved ones in a respectful and safe way,” said Katsimatides, who’s on the memorial board. She says the change wasn’t motivated by anything except a public health emergency.“Who expected COVID-19? ... It was completely unforeseen. As was 9/11,” she said.This year’s plans have been a balancing act at the sites where hijacked planes piloted by al-Qaida terrorists crashed on Sept. 11, 2001: New York, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.The Flight 93 memorial near Shanksville is trimming its usual 90-minute ceremony, partly by eliminating musical interludes. Memorial spokeswoman Katherine Cordek said the names of the 40 people killed there would be read, but by one person instead of multiple family members.The Pentagon hasn’t yet detailed its plans for the anniversary.In New York — where the nation’s deadliest coronavirus spike early happened this spring but has since been fairly well contained — leaders of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum said their plan for a no-reading ceremony would honor both virus precautions and 9/11 families’ attachment to being at ground zero on the anniversary.But another 9/11-related organization, the Stephen Stiller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, quickly arranged its own simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying victims’ relatives could recite names while keeping a safe distance.“We need to keep letting America know what happened 19 years ago. And they need to see that emotion of the day, not a recording,” says chairman Frank Siller. He says he may attend both observances to honor the brother he lost, firefighter Stephen.Meanwhile, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told current firefighters in a memo last month that the department “strongly recommends” members not participate in 9/11 observances. The department did hold a limited-attendance ceremony Wednesday to add names to a memorial wall recognizing members who died after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage.Tensions over anniversary plans flared anew when the memorial announced last month it was nixing the Tribute in Light, twin blue beams that shine into the night sky over lower Manhattan. While there’s no official gathering to view the lights, the memorial cited virus risks to the installation crew.The cancellation outraged some victims’ relatives, police and fire unions and politicians, who noted that construction sites around the city were deemed safe to reopen months ago. After the Tunnel to Towers foundation said it would organize the display on its own, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, the memorial’s billionaire chairman, stepped in to keep the memorial-sponsored lights on. (Tunnel to Towers is now stationing lights at the Flight 93 memorial and the Pentagon.)Memorial President Alice Greenwald later said the organization “should have approached this issue differently.”Still, the memorial’s moves fanned mistrust among some 9/11 victims’ relatives who wonder how long the name-reading and other observances will continue.Katismatides, the board member, foresees the ceremony returning to normal next year.Debra Epps has been to the ground zero ceremony every year. She said it means a lot to her to read names and add a few words in tribute to her brother Christopher, an accountant.Still, she thinks the memorial was right to forgo the live name-reading this year. The virus has her concerned enough that she’s not planning to attend.“It really is a hard decision to make, but I know that we’re still in this pandemic,” said Epps, who works in health care.“I will remember my brother, no matter what,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-year-of-social-distancing-covid-19-pandemic-alters-9-11-too/story-nsL1fAhcGUXM8O7j2Adk2L.html

The Lebanese army said the fire is at a warehouse where oil and tires are placed in the duty free zone at the port adding that fighting the blaze is ongoing and that army helicopters are taking part in the operation.Panicked residents — still struggling to get over last month’s catastrophic explosion — cracked open windows and called each other to warn them of the new fire. Local TV stations said the companies that have offices near the port have asked their employees to leave the area. Lebanese troops closed the major road that passes near the port referring traffic to other areas.The August 4 explosion killed more than 190 people, injured around 6,500 and damaged thousands of buildings in the Lebanese capital. The sight of another huge fire a month later created panic among residents traumatized by last month’s explosion.State-run National News Agency said the fire was at a warehouse where tires are placed. It added that firefighters are dealing with the blaze. Army helicopters were taking part in efforts to extinguish the fire.A video circulating on social media showed workers at the port running away in fear as soon as the fire broke out, a chilling reminder of last month’s blast that killed dozens of port employees and 10 fire fighters.Beirut Gov Marwan Abboud and authorities called on people to stay away from roads leading to the port to allow fire engines to move quickly.Police spokesman Col. Joseph Msalam said they have no information about what is happening at the port adding that the facility is currently under control of the army.Asked about reports that the fire was caused by burning tires and oil, he said: “I don’t know. It could be containers. I really don’t know what is there.” It was the second fire at the port this week. On Tuesday, a small fire erupted, also creating some panic, that was quickly extinguished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-fire-breaks-out-at-beirut-port-a-month-after-explosion/story-5LACtnz0YpAJlWn1qzC1LP.html
10-09-2020||World||ByteDance may miss US deadline for TikTok deal||ByteDance Ltd. is increasingly likely to miss a Trump administration deadline for the sale of its TikTok U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.ByteDance probably needs beyond the U.S. executive order ban on Sept. 20 to nail down an agreement with either party because of the regulatory review, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, one of the people said. The officials haven’t been willing to give specific guidance on what kind of deal would work, the person said.Microsoft and Oracle, which had submitted proposals before the Chinese regulations hit, both continue to be interested in buying the U.S. arm of the hit video app and have not been dissuaded by Beijing’s involvement, the people said. The bidders have asked ByteDance to get as much clarity as possible from Beijing on the new regulations, which prohibit the export of certain artificial intelligence technologies that TikTok uses, they said.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s signoff. It’s also possible that ByteDance pulls out of a sale altogether if it determines it can’t satisfy both governments, the bidders and its own shareholders.A company representative offered no immediate comment.ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has been caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. The serial entrepreneur has been reluctant to give up U.S. TikTok from the start because he sees the business as a viable long-term competitor to Facebook Inc. and Google. He came under pressure to cede control when the Trump administration said it would ban the app and his own venture investors pressed for a sale to salvage some value from the operation.The Trump administration is divided over whether to give ByteDance more time or simply proceed with the ban. Donald Trump himself has called the app a national security risk, passing an executive order to ban the service this month and approving a separate decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to force a sale by mid-November.ByteDance has sued in the U.S. to block the executive order ban, arguing that putting it out of business without adequate notice and a fair chance to respond deprives it of its due-process rights in violation of the Constitution. The Beijing-based company has also denied its app represents a security threat and said no data from American users is shared with China.In negotiations earlier this year, ByteDance had attempted to work out a U.S. sale that would allow it to retain a substantial interest in the American operations, but the Trump administration has pushed back on that idea. Zhang would still like a small slice of the operation, the people said. But Microsoft and its partner in the deal, Walmart Inc., want full ownership of the business, one person said, while Oracle’s stance isn’t clear.Analysts and bankers have estimated TikTok’s U.S. business is worth at least $20 billion, although the price would vary widely depending on what is included with the sale. The specific offers from Microsoft, which is teaming up with Walmart Inc., and Oracle, which has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital, could not be determined.China made its 11th-hour entry into the TikTok process the last weekend of August, just as ByteDance had two offers in hand and planned to review them in hopes of making a final decision by the close of Sunday, a different person said. Beijing’s move blindsided the company, this person said.Without any discussion or public announcement, China posted notification of new restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including speech recognition and techniques for personalizing content. The aim of the rules is not necessarily to block a sale of the U.S. operations, but to ensure Beijing is actively involved and to slow down the process, one person said. The review may well push finalization of any agreement beyond the U.S. elections in November, the person said.TikTok’s algorithms are not a big sticking point for the bidders, the second person said. Both Microsoft and Oracle have the technical chops to build their own algorithms and would get data to fine-tune them, the person said.ByteDance’s regulatory team and deal negotiators have discussed whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself.Zhang is still operating from a position of strength. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019.Investment bankers have begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S., and demand for initial public offerings from technology companies in the market is surging. Zhang stands to make billions no matter what happens with Trump and TikTok U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bytedance-may-miss-us-deadline-for-tiktok-deal/story-7mvTf04VtUzMCvpE7acy5K.html

Though such interruptions are common in vaccine studies, the drugmaker and its boss are facing questions about what exactly caused the issue and whether it could be related to the shot.“What we have here is a special set of circumstances where the whole world becomes involved in the conduct of a clinical trial,” Soriot said in his first public comments since the trial was halted. The decision on whether to resume the study is in the hands of a group of independent experts working to understand whether the patient’s illness was a coincidence or a result of the vaccine. “The reality is we all have to be very patient and see how it unfolds,” he said.Astra shares were little changed in London.It’s still not clear whether the patient has a condition called transverse myelitis, a suspected diagnosis, Soriot said.The CEO, speaking at a Tortoise Media event on Thursday, said he can’t evaluate the length of the trial pause. When tests are complete, the physicians will share the data with the safety committee, he said.US National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told a Senate committee on Wednesday the trial had been halted due to a “spinal cord problem”. AstraZeneca is one of several drug companies taking part in the US government’s Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astra-still-aiming-for-covid-vaccine-by-year-end-ceo-says/story-zILwQMP6rzP3j01gICqXRK.html
10-09-2020||World||China bars media coverage of Disney’s ‘Mulan’ after Xinjiang backlash - sources||Chinese authorities have told major media outlets not to cover Walt Disney Co’s release of “Mulan”, in an order issued after controversy erupted overseas over the film’s links with the Xinjiang region, four people familiar with matter told Reuters.Set to open in local theatres on Friday, Disney had high hopes for Mulan in China, but starving it of publicity in the country’s strictly censored media would be another blow to the $200 million production.Starring big-name Chinese actors - Jet Li, Gong Li, Donnie Yen and Liu Yifei - and based on a Chinese folk story, Mulan was tailored to appeal to audiences in China, the world’s second-largest movie market.But mixed reviews online and capacity limits in theatres due to coronavirus prevention measures were likely to weigh on its box office performance, even before major media outlets received a notice telling them to refrain from covering the movie.Three sources told Reuters media outlets had received the notice, two of whom said it was sent by the Cyberspace Administration of China. A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film’s links to Xinjiang.Neither the Cyberspace Administration or Disney immediately responded to requests for comment.Also Read: Human rights groups ask IOC to move Olympics from ChinaPartly shot in Xinjiang, Mulan’s credits included thanks to the authorities there, which prompted calls overseas for a boycott of the movie. China’s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.On Wednesday, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, criticised the backlash against the movie in an editorial in its English edition, describing it as “another manifestation of the extreme ideologies regarding China among US public opinion.”Disney had worked to ensure Mulan tested well with Chinese audiences, and the company’s chief financial officer told investors on Wednesday that it was “very pleased” with the initial results of its release elsewhere.The movie was released on Disney’s streaming service in many markets, rather than in cinemas, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Mulan is likely to be shown on more than 40% of China’s screens on Friday, according to data from Maoyan, a Tencent-backed ticketing platform. Chinese theatres are currently limiting capacity, typically at 50 percent.The film had sold 9.78 million yuan ($1.43 million) worth of tickets as of Thursday afternoon, accounting for 55% of all ticket sales sold across China for Friday’s shows.One analyst, who declined to be named because he said the situation is sensitive, predicted the film would earn a dismal 150 million yuan at mainland box offices, given early audience reviews.The film, which many have already seen online, has received a 4.7 score out of 10 on popular social media site Douban, where users leave reviews of films, books and music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bars-media-coverage-of-disney-s-mulan-after-xinjiang-backlash-sources/story-xYnys8xaAVO8nplOJgc0yM.html
10-09-2020||World||New York to mark 9/11 anniversary amid coronavirus pandemic||With crime on the rise, shops and apartments increasingly vacant and homeless people on the sidewalks, New York on Friday will mark the 19th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and a bitter fight with the White House.The city will hold its annual ceremony in memory of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the bloodiest terrorist attack in US history, punctuated by a minute’s silence at the exact moments that Al-Qaeda jihadists crashed two hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center towers.Instead of reading out the roll call of the dead, this year the families of victims have recorded themselves. But they will still be present at the “Ground Zero” memorial. The site museum will also open for the first time since the novel coronavirus brought the city to a standstill in March. Almost two decades after the attacks, September 11 remains synonymous with New York’s heroism and resilience. City leaders have emphasized the latter in the past months as the Covid-19 infection rate -- which killed 23,00 people here, the early epicenter of the disease in the United States -- has been lowered to under one percent.New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday reminded New Yorkers that their resilience is likely to be tested once again by the social and economic “after-effects” of the pandemic.Offices empty until 2021? Gale Brewer, president of borough of Manhattan, recognizes that the island renowned for its hustle and energy now faces an array of problems.Some of these stem directly from the coronavirus pandemic: almost all the white collar workers, such as bankers, traders and insurance employees, have been working from home since March. This has emptied Manhattan’s business hubs, leaving thousands of small stores and restaurants without customers.Boris Tulchinskiy, a 26-year-old software engineer, misses Manhattan but expects to “keep working from home” in neighboring New Jersey until July 2021.If the more than 60 million tourists who visit New York every year have gone, so too have New Yorkers, fleeing the city by the thousands. At least 35,000 people have moved out of Manhattan, judging by requests for absentee ballots for November’s presidential elections, Brewer said.Many businesses are now shuttered: between 2017 and 2020, the number of vacant commercial spaces has almost doubled, up by 78 percent, she said.Homeless people are now more visible due to the closure of numerous shelters for health reasons, and the transfer of almost 13,000 to live in less contagious conditions in Manhattan’s vacant hotels.The rise in homicides and shootings -- up 47 percent and 166 percent in August, compared with the previous year -- is one of the more striking aspects of the crisis hitting the city.Even if it is still far below the endemic levels of crime that plagued the city in the 1970s and 80s, New York, which prided itself on being one of the world’s safest cities, has now slipped back to 2012 crime levels, the New York Times reported.Trump wants to ‘kill New York’ “I can’t tell you how many phone calls I get from people especially in New York City, who are literally worried about the degradation of New York City,” governor Cuomo said Tuesday.Even as the city shows signs of revival -- which include museums reopening in late August and restaurants welcoming diners inside in late September -- its full recovery could take up to three years, Brewer said, citing the estimates of realtors.In the meantime, and less than two months from one of the most bitterly fought presidential contests in history, the crisis has become the focus of a dispute with Republican President Donald Trump.The native New Yorker, who made his name in real estate, insists that the rise in crime in the Democratic bastion is due to the incompetence of its leaders. On Tuesday he once again accused the mayor and the governor of “destroying” the city.New York officials in turn slammed Trump’s refusal to free up billions in emergency federal funds to help the city through the worst of the crisis.“Trump is actively trying to kill New York City. It is personal. I think it’s psychological,” Cuomo said. “He is trying to kill New York City.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-to-mark-9-11-anniversary-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story-x1VTIgFq6Wv92Lz2gDZWzK.html

State TV said Iranian submarines and drones were being deployed.Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, commander of the annual exercise dubbed Zolfaghar-99, said Wednesday the operation is aimed at “improving readiness in confronting foreign threats and any possible invasion.” Sayyari’s comments hinted at the threat of military conflict amid tensions between Iran and the US, which has sought to extend a years-long UN weapons embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October.Last month, US Central Command published a black-and-white video showing what appeared to be Iranian special forces fast-roping from a helicopter onto the oil tanker MT Wila, whose last position appeared to be off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates near the city of Khorfakkan. Iranian state television later acknowledged the brief seizure, referring to the operation as a routine inspection without elaborating.In July, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard fired a missile from a helicopter targeting a replica of a US aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz in an exercise aimed at threatening the USIn January, a US drone strike killed a top Iranian general at the Baghdad airport and Tehran responded by firing ballistic missiles at American forces in Iraq.Iran’s navy operates in the Gulf of Oman on the eastern side of the strait, through which 20 per cent of all oil shipping passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-military-begins-expansive-annual-exercise-amid-tensions-with-us/story-LeLlZTyRIxBSiDAXyhd3xK.html

Also Read: Govt attaches properties of US-based Sikhs for Justice leader and designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, first under amended UAPAThe report —authored by veteran journalist Terry Milewski, who has tracked pro-Khalistan groups in Canada for decades—says Pakistan’s support for pro-Khalistan group entails leveraging extremists based in Canada, including supporters with ties to terrorism, because of the lack of traction in Punjab. Though the Canadian government has already said it won’t recognise a so-called referendum on Khalistan scheduled for November by groups such as Sikhs For Justice, which was banned by India in 2019, the report warned the move “provides oxygen that fuels extremist ideologies, radicalises young Canadians, wreaks havoc on reconciliation, and usurps legislatures”, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute said. In their foreword to the report, former Canadian cabinet minister Ujjal Dossanjh and Shuvaloy Majumdar, a programme director at the think tank, said: “The Milewski report should be essential reading for any who wish to understand Pakistan’s influence in guiding the Khalistan proposition, its perversion of the Sikh faith, and its ongoing campaign of extremism and terrorism in two of the world’s important democracies.” Also Read: Pro-Khalistan group alleges India disrupted secessionist referendum, Canada rejects theoryThe Justin Trudeau government’s perceived softness towards pro-Khalistan groups in its first stint during 2015-19 was one of the key reasons for a downturn in India-Canada relations. The Liberal Party government in Canada cited freedom of expression as a major reason for allowing the activities of pro-Khalistan groups but this found few takers in New Delhi. The 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada originally cited “Sikh (Khalistani) extremist ideologies and movements” among the top five national security issues for the country, but this was later replaced in a revised version of the report by “extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India” following pressure from an international lobby campaign that advocates for an independent Khalistan, the report said. “The proposition of an independent Khalistan, in truth, is a backward idea from a backward time. It is a proposal without economic or democratic logic, unloved by the very Punjabis whose lives it would most directly affect. It is a fantasy rooted in religious bigotry and chauvinism, kept alive in Canada by thugs and political hustlers unbothered by the innocent lives that have been lost in its name,” Dossanjh and Majumdar said in their foreword. “It is a proposal hostile to Canada’s interest in seeing a united and prosperous India, and in that sense, threatens not just one country, but two. In the service of this cause, extremists animated by Pakistan seek to distort history and betray the vast majority of Sikhs who live in peace and freedom,” they added. Besides tracing the long-standing links between pro-Khalistan terror groups and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency and the way in which Khalistani terrorists were sheltered in Pakistan in the 1990s, the report notes the Canadian security establishment’s failure to prevent the bombing of Air India flight 182, which killed 329 people, a majority of them Canadian citizens. “No matter how low the support for Khalistan sinks in India—and it has sunk very low indeed—the cause still survives in Pakistan, where jihadist groups have made common cause with Sikh separatists against their shared enemy, India,” the report said. “An example is the leading Khalistani figure in Pakistan, Gopal Singh Chawla, who makes no bones about his friendly alliance with the Pakistani jihadist Hafiz Saeed, leader of the feared Lashkar-e-Taiba,” it added. A Canadian citizen, Satinderpal Singh Gill from Surrey, BC, lived for years in Pakistan as a senior official of the International Sikh Youth Federation, which has been banned as a terrorist organisation in India, Canada, the UK and the US, but not by Pakistan, the report noted. The report also highlighted the dichotomy between the harassment of the Sikh minority in Pakistan and the unstinted support offered by pro-Khalistan leaders such as Sikhs For Justice chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, one of the main movers behind the 2020 referendum. Though Panun claims to lead a movement for human rights, he sided with China in its border dispute with India and wrote to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, swearing that, “if India ever attacked Pakistan, the Pro-Khalistan Sikhs will extend full support to Pakistan”. The report also questioned the maps of the proposed Khalistan, noting that they don’t depict even “one inch [of] traditional Sikh lands in Pakistan—not to Lahore, where Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over a Sikh empire two hundred years ago, or even to Nankana Sahib, sacred birthplace of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru”. “It appears, then, that Pakistan wants the Sikhs to be free, but not in Pakistan. The separatists, in turn, clearly know where their patron sets the limits. Even drawing a map which presumes upon Pakistan’s generosity is a step too far—one that could sever the lifeline which has sustained the dream of Khalistan for so long,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-main-force-behind-drive-to-create-so-called-khalistan-says-canadian-think-tank/story-9aLfR6qdxp2RkGedIzTuLM.html
10-09-2020||World||Kim Jong Un told Donald Trump about killing his uncle: Book||President Donald Trump’s comments about the threat from the novel coronavirus attracted widespread attention after excerpts from journalist Bob Woodward’s book “Rage” were released. The excerpts also provide new details about the president’s thoughts on North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, racial unrest and a mysterious new weapon that Trump claims other world powers don’t know about.Some of the other topics covered in the book, which was based on 18 interviews that Woodward conducted with Trump between December and July and with others (excerpts from the book were reported by The Washington Post, where Woodward is an editor, and Woodward wrote that Trump said he was impressed with Kim when he first met the North Korean leader in Singapore in 2018 and that Kim was “far beyond smart.” Trump also said that Kim “tells me everything” and even gave the president a graphic account of how Kim had his own uncle killed.As he engaged in nuclear arms talks with Kim, Trump dismissed intelligence officials’ assessments that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons. Trump told Woodward that the CIA has “no idea” how to handle Pyongyang.Trump also dismissed criticism about his three meetings with Kim, claiming the summits were no big deal. Critics said that by meeting Kim, Trump provided the North Korean leader with legitimacy on the world stage.“It takes me two days. I met. I gave up nothing,” said the president, who likened North Korea’s attachment to its nuclear arsenal to somebody who is in love with a house and “they just can’t sell it.” Kim welcomed Trump’s attention, calling the president “your excellency” in a letter. Kim wrote to Trump that he believed the “deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force.” In June, after federal agents forcibly removed protesters from Washington’s Lafayette Square to make way for Trump to stage a photo opportunity outside a church near the White House where he held up a bible, Trump called Woodward to boast about how he was for “law and order.” “We’re going to get ready to send in the military slash National Guard to some of these poor bastards that don’t know what they’re doing, these poor radical lefts,” Trump told Woodward, who recorded Trump.Later that month, Woodward asked the president if, as a white man, he had a responsibility to better “understand the anger and pain” felt by Black Americans.“No,” Trump replied. “I don’t feel that at all.” As Woodward pressed Trump about discrimination and inequalities suffered by Black people over the years, the president pointed to how the unemployment rate for Black Americans fell before the pandemic.When the two spoke again about race relations on June 22, Woodward asked Trump whether he thought there was systemic racism in America.“Well, I think there is everywhere,” Trump said. “I think probably less here than most places. Or less here than many places.” Asked by Woodward whether racism “is here” in the United States in a way that affects people’s lives, Trump replied: “I think it is. And it’s unfortunate. But I think it is.” In discussions with Woodward about rising tensions in 2017 between the US and North Korea, Trump said: “I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President Jinping) Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody — what we have is incredible.” Woodward writes that sources, who spoke to him on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the US military had a “secret new weapons system.” But the sources did not provide details and told Woodward, according to the book, that they were surprised Trump had disclosed it.Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Fox News’ “Special Report” on Wednesday that the president did not talk about any specific weapon system. “We’re always on the cutting edge and we’ve always got something out there that our adversaries don’t know about,” O’Brien said. Woodward’s book quotes Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, as saying, “The most dangerous people around the president are overconfident idiots.” The book also quotes Kushner as saying that he advised people to think about “Alice in Wonderland” when trying to understand the Trump presidency. The novel is about a girl who falls through a rabbit hole and Kushner, according to Woodward, singled out the Cheshire Cat, whom he said had endurance and persistence, not direction.Woodward’s book also discusses how some top-level administration officials contemplated quitting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-told-donald-trump-about-killing-his-uncle-book/story-xlrYZLV2TErYOG6baiFsVL.html
10-09-2020||World||Russian state hackers suspected in targeting Biden campaign firm: Report||Microsoft Corp recently alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to three people briefed on the matter.The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said. A person familiar with SKDK’s response to the attempts said the hackers failed to gain access to the firm’s networks. “They are well-defended, so there has been no breach,” the person said.SKDK Vice Chair Hilary Rosen declined to comment. A Biden spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The hacking attempts on SKDK come as U.S. intelligence agencies have raised alarms about possible efforts by foreign governments to interfere in the November presidential election.Investigations by former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate intelligence committee both concluded that affiliates of the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and Mueller has warned that Russia was meddling in the current campaign. One of the sources said it was not clear whether Biden’s campaign was the target or whether the Russians were attempting to gain access to information about other SKDK clients.SKDK managing director Anita Dunn was a White House communications director during the Barack Obama presidency and serves the Biden campaign as a senior advisor.The attempts to infiltrate SKDK were recently flagged to the campaign firm by Microsoft, which identified hackers tied to the Russian government as the likely culprits, according to the three sources briefed on the matter. The attacks included phishing, a hacking method which seeks to trick users into disclosing passwords, as well as other efforts to infiltrate SKDK’s network, the three sources said.A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.SKDK is closely associated with the Democratic Party, having worked on six presidential campaigns and numerous congressional races. In addition to its current work for Biden, the firm in 2018 worked on successful governor’s races in Kansas and Connecticut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exclusive-russian-state-hackers-suspected-in-targeting-biden-campaign-firm-sources/story-rOuTmifRfjWWx3B5kYqhkO.html

The wildfire, given the name ‘The North Complex Fire’, has also forced thousands of people to leave their homes.The deaths took place at two separate locations, taking the total number of fatalities due to the wildfire, which has been raging since August 17, to 11. Of the three people who lost their lives, one person was found in a car and apparently had been trying to escape the flames California Highway Patrol Officer Ben Draper told the Bay Area News Group.The North Complex Fire, which started as several separate blazes sparked by lightning, is one of more than two dozen burning in the California. including three of the five largest ever in the state. It has also threatened Paradise, a town devastated just two years ago by the deadliest blaze in state history that prompted a traffic jam as panicked residents tried to escape.Since the middle of August, fires in California have destroyed more than 3,600 structures, burned old growth redwoods, charred chaparral and forced evacuations in communities near the coast, in wine country and along the Sierra Nevada.The U.S. Forest Service, which had taken the unprecedented measure of closing eight national forests in Southern California earlier in the week, ordered all 18 of its forests in the state closed Wednesday for public safety.Also, a power shutoff, effected to prevent electric lines from sparking wildfires, which had caused the Paradise fire, prevented people from getting up-to-date information by internet, TV or their home phones. Residents leaving the town due to the wildfire also created a traffic jam leading out of town.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-dead-as-wildfire-devastates-northern-california/story-xnTSBbOJjxuOZwLYeiwSZL.html
10-09-2020||World||Donald Trump accepts downplaying Covid-19 threat to avoid global ‘frenzy’||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged that he had downplayed the Covid-19 outbreak, repeating and defending an assertion that he first made in American journalist Bob Woodward’s upcoming book Rage. Trump said he wanted to prevent the United States and the world from going into a “frenzy”.Speaking to reporters just hours after contents of the book were made public, on the basis of recordings from Trump’s on-record interviews with Woodward, the US president asserted he had shown leadership by trying to keep things calm and that his administration had done an “incredible job” with the coronavirus pandemic.Also in the book, President Trump talks about a previously undisclosed nuclear weapons system, castigates top generals, says he likes calling his predecessor by his first two names “Barack Hussein”, and gushes about his meetings and relationship with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for the November 3 US election, assailed Trump’s acknowledgement in Woodward’s book. “He knew and he purposefully downplayed it,” Biden said at an election event in Michigan, a battleground state. “Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to our country. For months.”Trump told Woodward that he knew exactly how serious the threat from the virus was, and he said in an interview back on February 7, “This is deadly stuff”. In public remarks though, Trump downplayed the crisis, portraying it as a passing threat in order to insulate his re-election chances.“The fact is, I’m a cheerleader for this country, I love our country, and I don’t want people to be frightened,” President Trump told reporters at a White House event when asked for a response to the book. “I don’t want to create panic... I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy.”Public health experts have advocated a more transparent approach, arguing Americans deserve to know the facts so as to be able to deal with them.The US president is battling mounting criticism of his administration’s response to the pandemic that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans, infected more than 6 million, crippled the economy rendering millions jobless, and left the US isolated in the global search for a resolution.Woodward’s book has cast new light on Trump’s response, or the lack of it, and his muddled approach to the worst health crisis confronting the country in more than 100 years.“This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” US national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump in an Oval Office meeting on January 28, Woodward writes in the book. “This is going to be the roughest thing you face.”Ten days later, on February 7, Trump called Woodward and said, in an on-record interview, “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu... This is deadly stuff,” he had said.But the US president conveyed an altogether different message to the American public then, as now. He said the threat to the US from the coronavirus will be over soon, magically.“I wanted to always play it down,” Trump told Woodward in an interview on March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-accepts-downplaying-covid-19-threat-to-avoid-global-frenzy/story-Lca3C1Wazfk8kVPvHaVfuI.html

He said the city’s coronavirus positivity rate, the proportion of daily tests with positive results, holding steady below 1% was another important factor.The city banned indoor dining in mid-March as the pandemic worsened. Hammered by the loss in business, restaurants looked to takeout and delivery orders to keep them afloat.In June, outdoor dining was approved, and restaurants got creative by putting tables on sidewalks, rooftops and even boats, festooning them with lights, umbrellas and festive decor. A plan to reopen indoor dining in July was delayed due to Covid-19 concerns.Restaurateurs expressed relief at Wednesday’s news. “I was kind of worried it was not going to happen,” said Giovanni Gelfini, the owner of Santa Panza, a restaurant in Brooklyn. “Twenty-five percent is not that much but it’s something where you can do some math and know, more or less, how many customers you can have every day.”At a news conference, Cuomo acknowledged the risk of future outbreaks but also stressed the economic pain the restrictions have caused. He said capacity could be lifted to 50% by Nov. 1.“A restaurant is not just the restaurant owner....There is a whole industry around restaurants,” Cuomo said.The state will expand its task force charged with enforcing restaurant compliance, and New York City will provide 400 additional inspectors to support that effort, he said.Restaurants will have to check the temperature of customers at the door and obtain contact information for contact tracing should there be an outbreak.Cuomo said the state would also establish a system encouraging customers to report restaurants not in compliance.“This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all New Yorkers,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

10-09-2020||World||JPMorgan finds some workers improperly pocketed Covid-19 relief funds||JPMorgan Chase & Co. found that some of its employees improperly applied for and received Covid-relief money that was intended for legitimate US businesses hurt by the pandemic, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The bank discovered the actions, all of which were tied to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, after noticing that suspicious amounts of money had been deposited into checking accounts owned by bank employees, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The findings prompted an unusual all-staff message from JPMorgan Tuesday that puzzled many across the industry for its candid admission of potentially illegal acts by some of its own while not describing what they had done.The Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program had been expanded significantly after the pandemic led to rolling shutdowns across the country, leaving many small enterprises in need of a cash lifeline. Unlike with the Paycheck Protection Program, banks didn’t issue or underwrite the disaster loans and grants. Instead, loans or grants came directly from the SBA.The findings of employee misconduct came in a broader sweep of individual accounts that received business aid, the person said, noting the bank fired people it believes improperly tapped the money. The SBA warned banks July 22 to be on the lookout for suspicious deposits or activity as part of the EIDL program.The agency’s inspector general has since flagged evidence of fraud in the program, saying it identified more than $250 million in aid given to potentially ineligible recipients as well as $45.6 million in possibly duplicate payments. A Bloomberg Businessweek analysis of SBA data last month identified $1.3 billion in suspicious payments.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.The nation’s largest bank sent a memo to roughly 256,000 employees Tuesday in which senior leaders said they were probing whether any staffers helped people misuse aid programs including “Paycheck Protection Program Loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs.” The firm had said it identified conduct by customers that didn’t meet its principles and “may even be illegal” and that some employees had fallen short on ethical standards, too.The firm’s leaders decided to send the memo to highlight the widespread abuse of relief programs they’d found, the person said, and the message asked employees to report any unethical activity they’d witnessed.While the bank has identified rampant misuse of the EIDL program, only a small percentage of it has been tied to bank employees, said the person. The bank hasn’t found evidence of wrongdoing by employees related to the PPP program, the person said.The Small Business Administration has been scrambling to clamp down on abuse of the loan program designed to mitigate business disaster, according to a watchdog report Wednesday. That assessment was based on internal emails obtained by the group, including one that noted “widespread presence of fraudulent applications.”Have a tip about how virus relief funds are used or misused?

10-09-2020||World||Palestinian FM urges Arab states to dismiss Israel-UAE deal||The Palestinian foreign minister has called on Arab states to dismiss a deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to normalise relations, describing the agreement scheduled to be finalised next week as “an earthquake”. The UAE and Israel announced the deal to establish full diplomatic relations on August 13. It reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch-enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians. Most of the Arab world has long rejected diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967. That steadfast support for the Palestinians, however, has begun to weaken in recent years, in large part because of shared enmity with Israel toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. The Palestinians have repeatedly voiced their rejection of the US-brokered Israel-UAE deal as trading away one of the few cards they have in moribund peace talks with Israel to establish their own independent state -- the Arab boycott of Israel. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki told the Arab League in Wednesday’s meeting that the Palestinian Authority called for an emergency meeting following the announcement of the UAE-Israeli deal. He said one Arab League member opposed a Palestinian request to add an item to the meeting agenda, an apparent reference to a Palestinian-introduced draft resolution on the deal. Al-Malki did not name the country. The meeting was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic. Al-Malki described the deal between the UAE and Israel as “an earthquake” that hit the Arab consensus over the Palestinian cause and he urged Arab foreign ministers to reject the deal, “otherwise our meeting will be considered a blessing or collusion with it, or a cover for it”. Hossam Zaki, the Arab League’s deputy secretary general, told a news conference in Cairo that the foreign ministers failed to reach a compromise on a resolution on the UAE-Israeli deal because of differences between the Palestinians and Emirates on the wording of the Palestinian-introduced draft. “A draft resolution needs more time and extensive consultations... we hope in the future to reach an agreed form,” he said. The UAE presented the agreement, which is scheduled to be signed on September 15, as taking Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank off the table. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the pause was “temporary”. Al-Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, rejected the argument, saying that Palestinians’ resistance to and rejection of Israel’s annexation policies were the cause of Israel’s suspension of its plans. He accused the US of pressuring other Arab countries to normalise ties with Israel, which he described as a “colonial and racist occupation”. He was apparently referring to Sudan, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited last month to push its transitional authorities to establish diplomatic ties with Israel.

10-09-2020||World||Official claims pressure to alter Homeland Security intel about Russia||A Department of Homeland Security official said in a whistleblower complaint released Wednesday that he was pressured by more senior officials to suppress facts in intelligence reports that President Donald Trump might find objectionable, including information about Russian interference in the election and the rising threat posed by white supremacists.The official, Brian Murphy, alleged that senior DHS officials also pressed him to alter reports so they would reflect administration policy goals and that he was demoted for refusing to go along with the changes and for filing confidential internal complaints about the conduct.Murphy, a former FBI agent and Marine Corps veteran, was demoted in August from his post as principal deputy under secretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. He is seeking to be reinstated in a complaint filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General.Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, released the complaint, which he said contained “grave and disturbing” allegations. He said Murphy has been asked to give a deposition to Congress as part of an investigation into intelligence collection by DHS related to its response to protests in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.“We will get to the bottom of this, expose any and all misconduct or corruption to the American people, and put a stop to the politicization of intelligence,” the California Democrat said.A Homeland Security spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, said the department generally does not comment on referrals to the inspector general but denied Murphy’s allegations. “DHS looks forward to the results of any resulting investigation and we expect it will conclude that no retaliatory action was taken against Mr. Murphy,” he said.The complaint came the same day that acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who has been nominated by Trump to lead the agency, gave a “state of the Homeland” speech in which he said DHS is working to thwart election interference from any foreign power and all threats regardless of ideology.“DHS stands in absolute opposition to any form of violent extremism whether by white supremacist extremists or anarchist extremists,” Wolf said. “We will continue our daily efforts to combat all forms of domestic terror.”Murphy said in his complaint that he was directed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy DHS secretary, to modify a section of a report to make the threat posed by white supremacists less severe. He was told to play up the threat posed by left-wing groups to echo administration talking points around civil unrest following the protests over the killing of George Floyd.Murphy said he refused to alter the report because doing so would “constitute an abuse of authority and improper administration of an intelligence program.” He was then taken off the project.He said he made a number of reports on Russian disinformation efforts to senior DHS and administration officials between March 2018 and March 2020. The details are classified and not included in the whistle-blower complaint.Then, in July, Wolf told him to hold back any reports on Russian election interference because they “made the president look bad,” according to the complaint. He also said Wolf told him to report on interference by China and Iran, instead of Russia, and those instructions came from White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien. Murphy said he objected and was excluded from future meetings on the subject.Trump has repeatedly resisted claims of Russian interference, including doubting findings by U.S. officials and lawmakers that Russia meddled in the 2016 campaign to help him and sow chaos in the electoral process. He has dismissed reports that Russia is continuing to interfere in the 2020 race, claiming that China is the more pernicious threat, even though a statement from intelligence officials last month said Moscow was directly trying to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.Murphy said that, after he was removed from working on a DHS intelligence report, a draft was leaked to the media in which Russia’s interference was placed on an equal footing as activities by Iran and China in a way that was “misleading and inconsistent with the actual intelligence,” the complaint said.Murphy came to DHS in March 2018 from the FBI, where his career included being assigned to the New York field office on Sept. 11, 2001. In his complaint, he alleged that efforts to manipulate the intelligence he oversaw started under former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.He said Nielsen and her deputies pressed him to vastly overstate the number of migrants apprehended at the southwest border who have confirmed links to any terrorist organization. That occurred as the Trump administration was rolling out tougher measures against illegal immigration. Murphy said he declined to confirm an inflated figure, saying to do so would be not only improper but illegal. The secretary nonetheless provided the incorrect figure to Congress.Cuccinelli, he said, pressed him to change reports on conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as the administration was seeking to halt a surge of people seeking asylum from Central America at the U.S.-Mexico border.“Mr. Cuccinelli expressed frustration with the intelligence reports, and he accused unknown ‘deep state intelligence analysts’ of compiling the intelligence information to undermine President Donald J. Trump’s policy objectives with respect to asylum,” he said in the complaint.Murphy said that over the summer he was instructed by Wolf and Cuccinelli to alter assessments on protests to make sure “they matched up” with Trump’s statements on the involvement of antifa and anarchists in the demonstrations in Portland and elsewhere. He said he told them he would only report accurate information.Shortly thereafter, Wolf reassigned him to the management division. That followed media reports that Murphy’s unit collected information on journalists covering the DHS response to the protests. Murphy said the reports were incorrect and Wolf agreed but said it would be “politically good” to move him while the acting secretary hoped to be nominated to the secretary post by Trump.The complaint, which also asks that officials who retaliated against Murphy be given written reprimands, was filed by Mark Zaid, a prominent attorney who also represented the whistle-blower who spurred the Trump impeachment inquiry.Zaid said in a statement that Murphy “followed proper, lawful whistleblower rules in reporting serious allegations of misconduct” and would cooperate with congressional investigations into the matter, especially in a classified setting.______Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/official-claims-pressure-to-alter-homeland-security-intel-about-russia/story-3mGqZwj8Hfpqp46OTFGScN.html
10-09-2020||World||California wildfire explodes, burning across 25 miles in day||A Northern California wildfire burning for more than three weeks roared to life after being stoked by high winds, spreading at a ferocious rate across an estimated 25 miles (40 kilometers) of mountainous terrain and parched foothills.As thick smoke choked the air Wednesday and cast an eerie orange hue across much of the region, a number of small communities near Oroville were ordered to evacuate. The fire even threatened the town of Paradise that was devastated just two years ago by the deadliest blaze in state history, causing a panic that led to a traffic jam as residents tried to escape.Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the fire had conservatively burned about 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers) in 24 hours.“The unbelievable rates of spread now being observed on these fires — it is historically unprecedented,” Swain tweeted.The North Complex fire was one of more than two dozen in the state, including three of five largest ever as wildfires burned across parts of the West amid gusty, dry conditions. Forecasters said some weather relief was in sight that could help firefighters overwhelmed by the blazes.In Washington, more acres burned in a single day than firefighters usually see all year. Fires also forced people to flee homes in Oregon and Idaho. A blast of polar air helped slow wildfires in Colorado and Montana.Since the middle of August, fires in California have killed eight people, destroyed more than 3,600 structures, burned old growth redwoods, charred chaparral and forced evacuations in communities near the coast, in wine country and along the Sierra Nevada.The U.S. Forest Service, which had taken the unprecedented measure of closing eight national forests in Southern California earlier in the week, ordered all 18 of its forests in the state closed Wednesday for public safety.The fire raging outside Oroville, 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, was burning in the Plumas National Forest after a series of wildfires sparked Aug. 17 by lightning had merged.The fire jumped the middle fork of the Feather River on Tuesday and, driven by 45 mph (72 km/h) winds, leapt into a canopy of pines and burned all the way to Lake Oroville — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) — said Jake Cagle, one of the fire chiefs involved.Firefighters were focused on saving lives and homes instead of trying to halt the fire’s advance, Cagle said.A massive cloud of smoke covered much of California, darkening morning skies and later casting a sunsetlike glow over the northern part of the state.In Paradise, where 85 people lost their lives and nearly 19,000 buildings were destroyed, the sky turned from black to cherry red and ash carried on strong winds rained down in a scene reminiscent from the fateful morning of Nov. 8, 2018, former Mayor Steve “Woody” Culleton said.“It was extremely frightening and ugly,” Culleton said. “Everybody has PTSD and what not, so it triggered everybody and caused terror and panic.”A power shutoff to prevent electric lines from sparking wildfires — the cause of the Paradise fire — prevented people from getting up-to-date information by internet, TV or their home phones, Culleton said. Many of the residents decided to leave and created a traffic jam leading out of town, another scary reminder of the bottleneck where several residents died two years ago.In Southern California, fires burned in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. People in foothill communities east of Los Angeles were warned to be ready to flee, but the region’s notorious Santa Ana winds were weaker than predicted.“We’re encouraged that the wind activity appears to be dying down,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “The rest of the week looks a little more favorable.”Three firefighters injured along the Central Coast on Tuesday when they were overrun trying to protect a mountaintop fire station above Big Sur were expected to make full recoveries and could be discharged by the end of the week, Los Padres National Forest spokesman Andrew Madsen said.The injured firefighters and 11 others had to deploy emergency fire shelters — a last ditch safety measure — when winds unexpectedly shifted, Madsen said.“It’s a really harrowing experience for those who go through a close encounter like that and we’re very grateful that the injuries are such that all three who were hospitalized are going to recover and return to work,” he said.That fire, which had doubled overnight Tuesday and burned terrain that hadn’t seen fire in 40 years, destroyed an office, two fire engines, barracks and all the firefighters’ personal belongings inside.California has set a record with nearly 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) burned already this year, and historically the worst of the wildfire season doesn’t begin until fall.Pacific Gas & Electric was deploying more than 3,000 employees Wednesday to inspect power lines before restoring energy to about 167,000 customers whose electricity was turned off to prevent fires from being started by wind-damaged wires. Some aerial inspections were paused because of smoke limiting visibility, said spokesman Jeff Smith.Only a very small number of customers had power turned off in Southern California.___Melley reported from Los Angeles.

10-09-2020||World||England tightens socialising rules as Covid-19 infections rise||Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions on social gatherings in England on Wednesday, saying there was a clear need to act after a spike in Covid-19 infections.Speaking at a televised news conference, flanked by his top medical advisers, Johnson said groups of more than six people would be banned from meeting, in what he called a “rule of six” that was easier to understand than previous guidance.“I wish that we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives,” he said, stressing that police and other agencies would be enforcing the rules more actively.“I will be absolutely clear. This is not, these measures are not, another national lockdown. The whole point is to avoid a second national lockdown,” he added.He also announced an ambitious “moonshot” plan, which he said was not guaranteed to succeed, in which mass testing that delivers fast results could be used to grant more freedom to those confirmed not to have the virus.“We’re hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring,” he said.The number of cases in Britain has begun to rise sharply again in recent days, prompting Johnson to deliver a news conference in his Downing Street office, just as he and other ministers did on a daily basis during the worst of the crisis.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said Britain’s numbers were following a similar pattern to that seen in France four weeks ago, and risked continuing to rise sharply as they had done there.He cited Belgium as an example of a country that had seen a similar increase in cases but had managed to reverse the trend through decisive action.“This is a clear indication that if you act rapidly and decisively when these changes are happening, there is a reasonable chance, or a good chance, of bringing the rates back down under control,” Whitty said.He said the measures were likely to remain in place for more than a few weeks, and warned that difficult times lay ahead as winter conditions made it easier for the virus to spread.Although testing is more widespread and the number of people in hospital is well below the peak of the outbreak, ministers fear it is beginning to slip out of control, particularly among people in their late teens and their 20s.Prior to the rule of six, the limit on the number of people who could socialise together was 30.The United Kingdom reported 2,659 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 earlier on Wednesday, up from 2,460 on Tuesday. The figures were close to 3,000 on Sunday and Monday - a sharp rise from levels of around 1,000 per day in August, attributed to high transmission among young people.The new rules will not apply to workplaces or schools, and there will be exemptions for weddings, funerals and some organised team sports. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own lockdown policies.

10-09-2020||World||Summer to snow in 24 hours as Rockies ride weather roller-coaster||Summer came to an abrupt halt in parts of the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday as temperatures reaching into the 90s (Faherenheit) plunged by around 60 degrees F (over 15 degree Celsius) in less than 24 hours, with a powerful surge of cold air from Canada unleashing snow and damaging winds in several states.The roller coaster weather ripped up trees by their roots, piled up snow that shut down parts of the scenic road through Glacier National Park and knocked out power to tens of thousands. But the temperature drop gave some relief to crews fighting wildfires in Colorado and Montana that had ballooned in hot, windy weather and forced people to flee their homes.Snow fell in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming and forecasters predicted up to a foot (30cm) in the mountains and temperatures in the teens (-7 Celsius) overnight. “We went from record heat to snow within a matter of 24 hours,” said Evan Direnzo, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Colorado. “Any average person would see this a couple of times in their life.”In Utah, where temperatures dropped by 40 degrees F, wind gusts of nearly 100mph roared through the Salt Lake City area, downing trees and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. Since forecasters began keeping records about 150 years ago, a one-day change in temperature of 55 degrees F (nearly 13 degrees C) or more has occurred two dozen times in Denver, according to the NWS.Six inches (15cm) or more of snow could fall in the northern and central Rockies, with 1 to 2 feet (30-60cm) dropping in the highest peaks, the NWS said. It has issued scattered winter storm warnings and weather advisories from southern Montana to southern Colorado. Freeze and frost warnings also were posted for parts of Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota and Minnesota.The weather was gradually expected to warm up, with temperatures back in the 80s by the weekend in Denver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/summer-to-snow-in-24-hours-as-rockies-ride-weather-roller-coaster/story-wwrQkUwGfbCAK2wAtIJp8I.html
10-09-2020||World||Trump knew exactly how serious Covid-19 is, but downplayed it: Book||President Donald Trump knew way back in January exactly how serious the threat Covid-19 posed to the US was, but always wanted to “play it down”, according to a forthcoming book by legendary investigative journalist Bob Woodward.“This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump during an Oval Office meeting on January 28, Woodward writes in the book, Rage, according to The Washington Post, where Woodward works as an associate editor. “This is going to be the roughest thing you face,” O’Brien had added.Ten days later, Trump called Woodward and said in an on-record interview: “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu,” he said in the interview, which was released on Wednesday and aired by news channels. “This is deadly stuff.” Also read| Trump downplaying Covid-19 is historic national tragedy: Nancy PelosiBut the president conveyed an altogether different message to the American public then, as he does now. He had said that the threat to the US from the coronavirus was ephemeral and will somehow be over magically.“I wanted to always play it down,” the president told Woodward in another interview on March 19.Trump is battling continuing criticism of his handling of the pandemic, with allegations that he deliberately downplayed it and ignored advice of his health experts so as to not negatively impact his re-election chances. His administration’s response has polled poorly with Americans as well.But the president has fought back, claiming he did well by shutting down the country from travellers from China early, ramping up production of ventilators and protective gear for health care personnel. Woodward’s book is based on several on-record interviews with the president, and will join a growing collection of accounts scrutinising Trump’s character and performance in office in the weeks near the November 3 elections.It covers the president’s response to the anti-racism unrest, meetings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and many other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-knew-exactly-how-serious-covid-19-is-but-downplayed-it-book/story-zHbgCxCe8aqqP4SQN7masJ.html
10-09-2020||World||Over 300 civil society groups urge more scrutiny of China on human rights||More than 300 civil society groups including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Service for Human Rights are urging the United Nations to set up an international watchdog to address human rights violations by the Chinese government.In an open letter published Wednesday, the groups say they are seeking greater scrutiny of and response to violations in places like Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as beyond — such as through censorship, development that hurts the environment and the targeting of rights defenders.The call for the creation of an “independent international mechanism” to focus on China’s rights violations adds to recent international pressure on Beijing over its handling of issues like protests in Hong Kong and detention centers — what the government calls vocational or training centers — for Uighur Muslims and others in western Xinjiang region.“China has systematically persecuted rights defenders in reprisal for their cooperation with UN human rights operations – torture, enforced disappearance, imprisonment, and stripping licenses from lawyers,” said Renee Xia, director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, in a statement. “The UN system should no longer tolerate such treatment.”The move follows a call by independent experts who work with the United Nations for a special session of the Human Rights Council focusing on the array of issues around China’s rights record. Advocates insist that no country — no matter how large or powerful — should escape extra scrutiny of their rights records when warranted.The groups also want UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to “take responsibility for publicly addressing China’s sweeping rights violations,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement.The appeal comes ahead of the start of the 47-member-state Human Rights Council’s fall session on Monday. In its summer session, the council held an urgent debate on a rise of police violence against Black people and repression of protests in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-300-civil-society-groups-urge-more-scrutiny-of-china-on-human-rights/story-oQ54TntwfZyuVbk79xZnIN.html
10-09-2020||World||Japanese minister Kono says he’s expecting October polls||Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono said he expects a general election in October, contradicting comments from the man expected to become the next prime minister, who indicated the poll would come later.Kono, tipped as a future Japanese leader, made the comments Wednesday in an online forum hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Speculation over an early election was fueled by a leap in support for ailing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet in polls released in the past week, just as Yoshihide Suga emerged as the favorite to succeed him.Suga, widely expected to be selected as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party next week as Abe steps down for health reasons, said Tuesday the country was not in a situation for a general election, given the virus outbreak. The LDP is expected to use its majority in parliament to elect Suga, the right-hand man to Abe, as prime minister on Sept. 16.Election timing is the prerogative of the prime minister and none need be held for about another year. Polls have shown most people oppose the idea of a vote before the end of 2020.The LDP’s junior coalition partner, Komeito, has expressed caution over the idea of an early election. Party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said earlier this week that dealing with the coronavirus should be the priority, national broadcaster NHK reported.A newly unified opposition party is set to elect a leader Thursday in a bid to offer a more compelling alternative. But the LDP, which has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955, is virtually guaranteed to keep its majority in the next election due to a huge slate of incumbents, strong funding and a public support rate well ahead of the opposition’s.Japan’s second wave of virus cases has been tailing off in recent weeks, with about 500 new infections reported Sept. 9, about a third of levels seen a month earlier. The economic effects have been dire, with the country experiencing its worst contraction on record in the April-June quarter.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japanese-minister-kono-says-he-s-expecting-october-polls/story-DbMyIxgOm2JU2mA8VnGCDK.html
10-09-2020||India||India, Japan ink pact to bolster defence forces||India and Japan have signed a key agreement for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces, which is expected to drive closer military cooperation and contribute to security in the Indo-Pacific. The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) between Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and India’s armed forces was signed by defence secretary Ajay Kumar and Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki in New Delhi on Wednesday. “The agreement establishes a framework such as the settlement procedures for the reciprocal provision of supplies and services between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Indian armed forces,” said a statement from Japan’s foreign ministry. The agreement is expected to facilitate “smooth and prompt provision of supplies and services” between the two sides, promote closer cooperation between Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and India’s armed forces, and enable them to actively contribute to international peace and security, the statement said. The external affairs ministry stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, during a phone conversation on Thursday, welcomed the agreement and said it will “enhance the depth of defence cooperation...and contribute to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific”. It had earlier been expected the pact would be signed during a summit between Abe and Modi this year. However, the summit has been thrown into doubt by Abe’s decision last month to step down on health grounds. The agreement will cover the reciprocal provision of supplies and services during joint exercises and training missions, UN peacekeeping operations, humanitarian relief operations, operations during disasters in the territory of both parties or a third country, and evacuation of nationals of India and Japan from overseas in exigencies. The supplies and services covered by the pact include food, water, transportation including airlift, petroleum, clothing, communications and medical services, use of facilities, spares and components, and repair and maintenance services. The agreement will remain in force for 10 years and will be automatically extended for periods of 10 years unless one of the parties decides to end it. India has similar agreements with the US, Australia, France, Oman and Singapore, and is negotiating one with Russia. During their 30-minute phone conversation, Modi and Abe reviewed the status of ongoing cooperation, including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail project. They agreed the strong partnership between the two sides will play a “critical role in charting the course for the global community in the post-Covid world”, the external affairs ministry said. Abe listed actions taken by India and Japan for realising the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific and the elevation of the special strategic and global partnership between the two countries among the key achievements in bilateral relations, Japan’s foreign ministry said in a readout. The two leaders made it clear the change of leadership in Japan wouldn’t affect the overall arc of bilateral relations. “Both Prime Ministers affirmed that the basic policy of Japan-India-emphasis remains unchanged, and concurred with each other that the two countries continue to work closely in such areas as security, economy, and economic cooperation including the high-speed rail project,” said the Japanese readout. The external affairs ministry said the leaders were confident the strong momentum in the bilateral partnership will continue unabated, and Modi conveyed his intention to work closely with the new government of Japan. Abe and Modi built a good working relationship and helped drive bilateral ties in a number of areas, especially economic cooperation, maritime security and the Indo-Pacific. Abe, Japan’s longest serving prime minister, explained his decision to step down and expressed “gratitude for the friendship and the relationship of trust” built with Modi. He also noted the memories from their mutual annual visits. Modi expressed his appreciation for all the efforts by Abe and recalled the time they spent together, the Japanese readout said. Modi reiterated his appreciation of Abe’s leadership for advancing the relationship between India and Japan. Former navy chief Admiral (retired) Arun Prakash described the logistics support agreement with Japan as a welcome development in the realm of defence cooperation but said there continues to be scepticism as to whether Tokyo can help New Delhi in a war-like situation. “There are three factors at play here – Japan’s fears of China, Japan’s Constitution which allows it to have only self-defence forces and Japanese public opinion. But the signing of the agreement is encouraging as it can be seen as a sign of support and a sign of the convergence of interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-ink-pact-to-bolster-defence-forces/story-xOCacyTP5OIADoqruteQBI.html

Keerthi Jalli, deputy commissioner of Cachar district in Barak Valley region, got married to Aditya Sashikant, a businessman, at her official bungalow in Silchar, the district headquarters. According to reports, the wedding was planned much earlier but had to be postponed due to Covid-19 lockdown. With restrictions on inter-state movement lifted, the couple decided to go ahead with the wedding by organising a simple ceremony following all necessary safety measures. According to reports, the groom flew in from Pune a few days ahead of the wedding and spent time in quarantine before the ceremony could be conducted. Due to Covid-19 measures, only Jalli’s sister could attend the wedding from her family’s side. The wedding ceremony was a very simple affair without any pomp and show and only a few select officials and individuals were present on the occasion. As per existing guidelines, only 50 people can be present at a wedding ceremony. “I was present at the wedding and it was a very low-key event following all safety protocols. There were barely 15 guests. I came to know about the wedding just a day before the event,” said a senior district official who attended the wedding.

The appointments will help the state in management of Covid-19, said officials.The results were published against 4,012 posts, which the general administration department (GAD) had sent to the commission for appointment on July 9 last year.The vacant positions were under extremely backward class (EBC), as only 508 out of 1,033 positions could be filled up. Similarly, 381 out of 682 positions could be filled up under the Scheduled Castes category. In keeping with the state government’s reservation policy, many seats in the general category were taken up by candidates belonging to the reserved category — backward class, extremely backward class, SC and ST — who made the cut, as a result of which seats in EBC and SC remained vacant, said officials requesting anonymity.“These doctors will soon be appointed and posted in district and sub-division hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs),” said Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey in a statement issued Thursday.The notification of appointment and posting of the GDMOs is expected before the announcement of assembly elections.Pandey said this was the first time that the government had completed the recruitment process of so many doctors in one go.The government had last month appointed as many as 929 specialist doctors, holding post-graduate degrees.Pandey claimed that the department had recruited as many as 21,530 health workers, including doctors, during the last three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-3-000-doctors-appointment-cleared-in-bihar-move-to-help-fight-covid/story-tDkXDN7wo9bN7XX7ZeelGM.html
10-09-2020||India||Monsoon revival likely over weekend in Mumbai, IMD issues heavy rain alert||The weather bureau has issued a yellow alert for Friday and Saturday predicting the possibility of thundershowers and heavy rain across isolated areas. After minimal rain activity over the first 10 days in September, monsoon revival is expected from Saturday onwards, said independent meteorologists.According to the rainfall forecast for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar, cloudy conditions with the possibility of moderate rain or thundershowers can be expected in the city and suburbs on Friday, and heavy rain across isolated areas on Saturday.As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), an off-shore trough at the mean sea level runs from the Maharashtra coast to the Kerala coast. “Combined with this, an east-west shear zone over peninsular India and land heating leading to tall cloud formation, will account for an increase in moisture, lower level westerly winds and increase in rain intensity for the west coast, north Konkan including Mumbai in coming days,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Also read: 80 new trains from September 12, tickets available from todayOver the past 24 hours, only light showers were recorded in the city. Between 8.30 am Wednesday and 8.30 am Thursday, the suburbs recorded 5.6 mm rain while 4 mm rain was recorded in south Mumbai.During the first 10 days of September, Mumbai has witnessed only 5.5 percent of rainfall recorded during the first 10 days of September 2019. This month, the suburbs recorded 43.3 mm rain while 56.4 mm was recorded in south Mumbai between September 1-10. Last year, the suburbs had recorded 801.4 mm rain while south Mumbai recorded 464.6 mm over 10 days. However, from September 1-10 2018, only 33.6 mm and 12.4 mm rain was recorded in the suburbs and south Mumbai. “Intra-seasonal variability is there but a specific trend from year-on-year rain for a specific period cannot be established as every monsoon is different. No rain-bearing weather systems had formed over Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea through the first 10 days of this month,” said Mohapatra.The first 10 days of September have also witnessed the least amount of rain as compared to the first 10 days of June, July and August. Independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, Akshay Deoras said under the influence of a few monsoon low-pressure systems, the offshore trough will strengthen, thereby leading to some moisture incursion in coming days. “Most of this activity will be of light to moderate intensity (especially during this weekend), so there is no severe weather threat involved. The monsoon is expected to remain active in the region over the next 10 days,” he said.The city can expect overcast skies again from Saturday with the possibility of heavy rain for Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Pune and ghat areas between Sunday and Tuesday, said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. “Rainfall is expected to be between moderate to heavy at around 70-80 mm over 24 hours during this period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-revival-likely-over-weekend-in-mumbai-imd-issues-heavy-rain-alert/story-dmhtmExCnVJYClSrvPyhNK.html

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army(PLA) has also beefed up its presence in the area where the situation remained very tense. “The external affairs minister will be meeting the Chinese foreign minister shortly where he will be discussing this issue,” Ministry of External Affairs(MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a virtual media briefing in the evening when asked whether the four-month-long border faceoff will be raised by Jaishankar at the talks. Jaishankar and Wang are in Moscow to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. Srivastava reiterated India’s position that it is committed to resolve the current situation through peaceful negotiations. “Both India and China are in regular touch through diplomatic and military channels to resolve the situation. This was the consensus when the two defence ministers met,” he said.Also read: Before PLA took a step back, a 2-hr long video call between NSA Doval and China’s Wang Yi Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held talks with his Chinese counterpart Gen. Wei Fenghe on the margins of another SCO meet in Moscow last Friday, but apparently the meeting did not yield any tangible outcome. The Indian Army on Tuesday said Chinese troops attempted to close in on an Indian position near the southern bank of Pangong lake the previous evening and fired shots in the air, a first such instance of bullets being used along the LAC after a gap of 45 years. The Army said this in a statement after the PLA late on Monday night alleged that Indian troops crossed the LAC and “outrageously fired” warning shots near the Pangong lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-and-his-chinese-counterpart-meet-in-moscow-amid-border-tensions-in-ladakh/story-z6hix66Zfi6Tmt8dr8K7hP.html

The chariot, made of teakwood and used during the procession of the Lord during the festive seasons, was burnt to ashes in the early hours of Sunday.The incident triggered widespread protests from Hindu religious groups, seers of various mutts and opposition parties across the state, demanding an inquiry into the incident.On Thursday, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its alliance partner Jana Sena called for an 11-hour fast in the name of Dharma Parirakshana Deeksha by their respective leaders and cadres. BJP state president Somu Veerraju and Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan demanded that the government order a judicial inquiry into the incident.With pressure mounting from all sides, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday evening decided to entrust the probe to the CBI. He asked Director General of Police Gautam Sawang to take steps in this regard.The DGP, in turn, wrote to the Union ministry of home affairs seeking permission for the CBI probe into the Antarvedi chariot burning incident, an official statement from the chief minister’s office said.“There has been malicious propaganda against the government by certain political forces in the social and mainstream media questioning the sincerity of the state police forces, though they have been going all out to unearth the conspiracy behind the chariot burning,” the CMO release said.The chief minister has already declared that he was ready to order any kind of inquiry into the incident. “Since some political parties have demanded a CBI probe into the incident, he has decided to entrust the case to the CBI for a transparent inquiry,” the CMO release said.The Jagan government had already suspended Antarvedi temple’s executive officer NS Chakradhar Rao and a couple of other temple employees for their alleged negligence in the chariot burning incident. It has also transferred special chief secretary (endowments) JSV Prasad after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-seeks-cbi-probe-into-temple-chariot-burning-incident-at-antarvedi/story-ve7Q95E9xCizVZvQmUNIrN.html

This comes after it had to scrap its previous tender amid allegations of favouring a Chinese firm.The ministry has already begun the induction of the cameras across some zones. The cameras can detect the body temperature of passengers and have helped in detecting symptomatic passengers and prevent them from boarding.“Central railways has begun using thermal cameras already. About two dozen symptomatic passengers were detected through it and were denied boarding. The fresh tender will open on Friday. We plan to induct the AI-based cameras across all zones as more trains begin operations,” an official said.In July, the ministry had scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid-19 surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times had first reported. In June, Railtel, the ministry’s telecom arm, had issued a tender for thermal temperature screening AI-based surveillance cameras for assistance in Covid-19 surveillance.Also read: Fastest ‘Made in India’ electric motorcycle KRIDN to be available in OctoberThe government company soon decided to issue a fresh tender after the controversy. The development in June came in the backdrop of a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh with China.“RailTel has floated an Expression of Interest( EOI ) for finalising partner for provision of thermal scanning solution in customer premises. The EOI is scheduled to be opened tomorrow and the partner will be selected later after due diligence by the nominating committee. In the proposed EOI one partner for each region of RailTel will be identified to offer thermal scanning solution. The selected partner will supply equipment as per purchase orders received from RailTel customers in future,” a spokesperson for RailTel said.Indian firms had alleged that artificial intelligence technology - DeepInMind, which is specified in the tender, is a proprietary feature of Chinese firm Hikvision, a company partly owned by the Chinese government.According to Hikvision’s technology, Network Video Recorder (NVR) has a “mind” of its own and can analyse and classify human and vehicle targets from video streams.The specifications for the cameras include temperature screening with facial recognition and mask detection, simultaneous temperature screening for multiple persons, detecting whether people wear masks and giving timely alarms on people without masks.While the initial tender for these cameras issued on June 9 excluded a crucial specification called “black body” temperature - the ability of the cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to say whether a person has a fever or not - and the DeepinMind technology specification, they were included in the revised tender issued on June 23.On November 10, Hindustan Times had reported the national rail carrier is planning a complete overhaul of its security systems across railway stations through the use of facial recognition technology backed by artificial intelligence.The ministry also plans to link the facial recognition system (FRS) with existing databases such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) to identify criminals at railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-float-tender-for-ai-based-thermal-cameras-to-detect-body-temperature-amid-pandemic/story-PjfldpseCBMWflUnMUTbqL.html

The 41-year-old was accompanied by just one security officer and some villagers when he trekked through passes, difficult mountain terrain to reach Luguthang which falls in his constituency Mukto in Tawang district. The area is close to the McMohan Line that bifurcate Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet Autonomous Region of China. “A 24 km trek, 11 hrs of fresh air and mother nature at her best; crossing Karpu La (16000 ft) to reach Luguthang (14500 ft) in Tawang district. A paradise untouched,” Khandu tweeted on Thursday. With just 10 households and a population of 58 (as per the 2011 census), villagers in Luguthang are mainly engaged in yak rearing. Khandu spent two nights at the village, which is not accessible by roads, and trekked back on September 8. “Has a review meeting with Luguthang villagers to ensure that benefits of every flagship programme reaches the last man standing in forward areas,” Khandu tweeted on Thursday after his return.  Also read: Can count on us, France tells India as Rafale fighters take to the skiesA 24 Kms trek, 11 hours of fresh air & Mother Nature at her best; crossing Karpu-La (16000 ft) to Luguthang (14500 ft) in Tawang district.

10-09-2020||India||Can count on us, France tells India as Rafale fighters take to the skies||On a quick visit to India to join the formal ceremony to induct the Rafale fighter jets into the Indian Air Force, French defence minister Florence Parly on Thursday spoke in glowing terms about the Indian and French strategic partnership. “You can count on us,” she said at the ceremony, recalling how New Delhi “was by our side” when France was going through a critical phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will also be by your side,” she said, underscoring French support for India’s candidacy for the UN Security Council.It is a sentiment that she had underscored well before she landed in India as well, describing India as France’s foremost ally in Asia. Speaking at a glittering ceremony at the Ambala air force station, Florence Parly underlined the “rock-solid” friendship between the two countries exemplified by the deal to buy the fighter jets.Also Read: Strategic Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis gets off to a flying start amid China tension“It takes a lot of confidence, for India, to bet on France; and a lot of confidence, too, for France, to share with India a capability that is so close to the core of our sovereignty,” she said before flying to New Delhi where she met with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.There was no formal statement on the details of her interactions with the Indian leaders. Or if China figured in the discussion. One diplomat said the conversations covered a gamut of issues between“two close friends”.Back in June when 20 Indian soldiers laid down their lives to repel China People’s Liberation Army troopers in Galwan Valley, the French defence minister Parly had made it a point to write to defence minister Rajnath Singh to convey her country’s “steadfast and friendly” support in these “difficult circumstances”.Diplomats said the expression of solidarity over the loss of life over the Ladakh stand-off wasn’t much of a surprise. France has been the most dependable and consistent supporter of India at the United Nations and elsewhere.Like when India carried out the 1998 nuclear tests, France was the only country among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council that did criticise or back sanctions against India. Even Russia had criticised New Delhi’s move though it was not supportive of the United States-led push for sanctions against India. China and the United Kingdom had supported the sanctions.It is a point that Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledges at internal discussions.“This is a relationship that has commercial aspects to it. But it is a strong bond,” a senior government official said.France initiated the strategic dialogue with India in 1998 when much of the world was criticising us, said a diplomat and was one of the early strategic partners that India had. It was the only country that was ready to sell INGPS (Inertial Navigation and Global Positioning System) for India’s Prithvi nuclear missiles that help them land on the targets.In 1999, a retired air force officer recalled, it was the French Mirage 2000s that dropped the laser-guided bombs - in Muntho Dhalo in the Batalik sector and on Tiger Hill in Drass in June 1999 — that is seen as the turning point of the Kargil war.This partnership extends to space as well. France has helped India launch heavy satellites and allowed New Delhi track satellites, and access telemetry data from Reunion island in the Indian Ocean.When the two countries signed a raft of pacts during President Emmanuel Macron’s India visit in 2018, PM Modi had summarised the relationship between the two countries in one line.India and France strengthened their 20-year-old strategic partnership on Saturday, signing an agreement for reciprocal logistics support between their armed forces and unveiling a blueprint to step up cooperation in the Indian Ocean to counter China’s growing influence in the region.“From the ground to the sky, there is no subject on which India and France are not working together,” PM Modi had famously said in 2018. The two leaders met again the next year, weeks after Parliament revoked the special status for Kashmir. France, along with the United States, blocked a China-sponsored attempt at Pakistan’s behest to get the UNSC to issue a statement on the Kashmir move.France and the United States again stood like a wall, as one diplomat put it, when China and Pakistan made desperate attempts to get the UNSC to designate five Indians as terrorists..“While the United States is a key ally, the French relationship is an additional leverage that helps India in countering its global adversaries,” a top diplomat said, recalling how it took the two P-5 members years to break down the great wall that China had erected to stop UNSC from designating Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-count-on-us-france-tells-india-as-rafale-fighters-take-to-the-skies/story-HHdM0kwme56zQQTxpbT04M.html

The war of words between Ranaut and Thackeray’s Shiv Sena had intensified after the Mumbai civic body partially demolished the actor’s office in the city on Wednesday. Ranaut, who landed in Mumbai on Wednesday from Himachal Pradesh, angry and caustic as she took on the Shiv Sena, called her home “Ram mandir”, referred to ‘Bullywood’ and described herself as the daughter of Chhatrapati Shivaji in a series of tweets and a video.Addressing Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray, Ranaut posted a video message saying his “ego will be destroyed” the way her Bandra home was demolished.“Uddhav Thackeray, ‘tujhe kya lagta hai (what do you think)?’ You think you have taken a huge revenge by destroying my house in collusion with the movie mafia. Today my house is destroyed, tomorrow it will be your ego. The wheels of time keep changing,” she said in a video message in Hindi, referring to the chief minister in the informal ‘tu’ rather than the more respectful ‘aap’.Mahant Kanahiya Das, head of the Ayodhya Sant Samaj, accused the Maharashtra government of shielding those who are involved in anti-social activities and warned the Maharashtra CM against coming to Ayodhya. “Now, Uddhav Thackeray is no more welcome in Ayodhya. Why is the Shiv Sena attacking Ranaut? Everyone can understand. It is not a mystery. The Shiv Sena is not what it used to be under Balasaheb Thackeray, founder of the party,” said Kanahiya Das.Ranaut has crossed swords with the Shiv Sena with her remark comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.Meanwhile, the Naga seers of Hanuman Garhi temple in Ayodhya have also extended support to Ranaut. Raju Das, priest of the temple, questioned the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s demolition of Ranaut’s office. “Uddhav Thackeray and Shiv Sena are no more welcome in Ayodhya. Now, the Maharashtra chief minister will face stiff opposition from seers of Ayodhya if he comes here,” warned Das. “The Maharashtra government acted without wasting any time against the actor. But the same government is yet to take action against the killers of two seers in Palghar,” said Das. He was referring to the killing of two sadhus and their driver on April 16 in Palghar, Maharashtra, by an unruly mob. The Naga sadhus and the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) — the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country -- have demanded a CBI probe into the Palghar killings. “The Maharashtra government is acting with a malafide motive against Ranaut. It was not expected from the Shiv Sena to attack a woman and demolish her office without any reason,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson of VHP.“It is very clear that the Shiv Sena is deliberately targeting the actor because she is supporting nationalist forces and has raised her voice against drug Mafiosi of Mumbai,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-shiv-sena-vs-kangana-ranaut-ayodhya-seers-message-for-uddhav-thackeray/story-bo1kzpmSIZdanahqFRpLCL.html

10-09-2020||India||Rare species of orchid found for first time in western Himalayas||After nearly 124 years, a small and very rare species of orchid Liparis pygmaea has been found again in India, in alpine meadows of Uttarakhand Himalayas, said orchid specialist Jeewan Singh Jalal from Botanical Survey of India, Pune. The specialist from Botanical Survey identified the species after it was found by two officials of Uttarakhand forest department’s research wing during their Suptkund trek in Chamoli district at an altitude of 3800 metres in June this year. Jalal said this very species, which grows up to five centimetres and flowers in June, has been reported for the first time from Western Himalayas. “Earlier this species had been reported from Sikkim (1892, 1877) and West Bengal (1896). So, this is a very interesting and exciting finding for us as this species has been found after over a century, which indicates its rarity and stresses upon the need to make efforts for the protection of Himalayan meadows which are still throwing surprises at us with these rare finds,” he said. Around 1250 species of orchids are found in India, of which nearly 250 Orchid species are found in Uttarakhand alpine zone between 3100 to 3900 metres elevation. Three individual samples of this rare orchid species Liparis pygmaea (Malaxideae, Orchidaceae) were analysed by Jalal and another botanist from BSI, who then jointly with two others who found the species, published a research paper on the find in the French scientific journal ‘Richardiana’ on July 30 this year. The research paper titled ‘Liparis pygmaea (Malaxideae, Orchidaceae), a new distributional record from Western Himalaya’ was jointly authored by Jeewan Singh Jalal (from Botanical Survey of India, Western Regional Centre, Pune), Dinesh Kumar (Botanical Survey of India, Sikkim Himalayan Regional Centre, Gangtok) and Manoj Singh, junior research fellow at Forest Research Wing and Harish Negi, Forest Range Officer Uttarakhand. According to the research paper, Liparis is a large genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae), which includes about 320 species, with 48 species representing the genus in India. Of these 48, so far 10 species have been reported from Western Himalaya. Manoj Singh said during their floristic exploration in the Saptkund area in Chamoli alpine meadows, they spotted these rare orchids and took their samples for identification. “We photographed and preserved the samples, one in ethanol and two pressed and then sent them to BSI experts on orchids. Jeewan Singh Jalal from Botanical Survey of India, Western Regional Centre, Pune, dissected it for detailed study and after critical examination identified it as Liparis pygmaea, a very rare Orchid species”, he said Jeevan Lal said scrutiny of available literature on the orchids of this region revealed that “it is the first record of this species from the Western Himalaya. Accordingly, an herbarium specimen was prepared and deposited at BSI. This discovery widens the range of distribution of this species in Himalaya and shows that meadows are in good health and need to be protected to ensure the survival of such rare species” “From Sikkim and West Bengal, it has been observed only once in the last 100 years which indicates its rarity. Present report from Western Himalaya involves less than 10 mature individuals at a single location. Although the species is not known under any commercial exploitation, its habitats are vulnerable to several natural and anthropogenic threats. Unsustainable tourism and developmental activities are in full pace at all the Indian localities. The species has pollination and germination constraints and is also subjected to livestock grazing and trampling,” the paper said. Chief conservator of forests (research wing) Sanjiv Chaturvedi said finding of the rare species by the officials of the forest research wing and publication of the research on the same in the noted French journal is a moment of pride for the Uttarakhand forest department. “Generally, you find academics from various research institutions authoring research papers. But this time, two of our employees have co-authored a paper with experts from BSI helping in identifying the rare orchid species,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rare-species-of-orchid-found-for-first-time-in-western-himalayas/story-Dyc6FyvDOvxm3mAqhSb6cL.html

TV is my first love and I have grown up watching daily soaps and living them! In real life too, if I don’t get drama, I get bored,” the bubby Lucknowite said.The ‘Bepannah’ and ‘Meri Durga’ actor wants to do only TV for now. “It still has better opportunities for newcomers. There is a lot of work and no nepotism! I will love to do OTT series if I get and even a film but won’t run after it! Also, I don’t have unrealistic expectations in my head. I just want to act immaterial of length of character and medium.”After completing studies from City Montessori School, she took admission in Amity University which she left after a few months, because her parents separated.“I wanted to become an actor but I knew my family would not allow it, so I kept that dream somewhere on the sidelines. I wanted to become a fashion designer but my father did not allow me. After this, I thought that I would end up becoming a waitress or something in a fast-food chain.” She landed in Mumbai for a job in a TV channel which she did not get. “Then I thought, let me try what I wanted in life. And, I have been very, very lucky that in three months I got my first show ‘Tedhi Medhi Family’. I believe God has plans for everyone — just trust the process.”Before the lockdown she left ‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay’ and is now shooting for ‘Aye Mere Humsafar’. “I know it’s unsafe but all precautions are being taken. It’s a Catch-22 situation, if one does not work then one will die of hunger, and if one does then can die of corona…so it’s better to die working…I guess!”Urfi relates to her character in the show. “My character Payal is a small-town girl who aspires to be a big star. She is bubbly, full of life, speaks a lot and is always on her phone like me. Difference is that she is simple, innocent and dumb, while I was always clever and street-smart despite coming from Lucknow — which is like a village for many in Mumbai.” Hailing from the city was an advantage for her. “Since I belong to Lucknow, my Hindi and Urdu were always good. This got me good attention at auditions. People have been very nice to me.” During the lockdown she stayed in Lucknow. “We are four sisters and a brother and with mother we are a loving family and we had a lot of fun and drama during my long stay,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-love-drama-in-life-on-tv-says-urfi/story-jQsmWB1XldsmiWfGoZdyjI.html

RK Tiwari, wildlife warden at Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) said, “The NTCA has issued new guidelines for visitors who would be allowed to visit tiger reserves and sanctuaries. Following those guidelines, tourists above the age of 65 and below 10 years will not be allowed to visit the tiger reserve keeping safety of both tourists and animals in mind due to the coronavirus epidemic”. Apart from this, the NTCA has also increased the viewing distance of wildlife in protected areas including tigers. Also read: Cigarette, beedi butts are not toxic, claims study“Usually, tourists were shown tigers from a distance of 50 meters in the past, but now, as per the new guidelines, tigers will be shown from a distance of 500 meters. Many times tourists go too near to the animals, disturbing their privacy and this has led to many attacks as well. So, it has been decided to increase the viewing distance,” added Tiwari. He said that all gypsy drivers in the Corbett landscape are being informed about the new guidelines for safari. The official said that if someone does not follow these rules then a fine of Rs 25,000 will be imposed on them. According to officials, ten cases of attacks by wildlife have been reported from Corbett Tiger Reserve in the past five years when tourists went too close to the animals during safari. Uttarakhand’s Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has the highest tiger density among India’s 50 reserves with a density of 14 tigers per 100 square kilometres. According to the recent All India Tiger Estimation, Corbett has also recorded the highest tiger population- 231 in the reserve and 266 using the reserve - among all 50 tiger reserves in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-above-65-kids-below-10-years-not-allowed-to-visit-corbett-tiger-reserve/story-znIh1Y09eqeKxKb3qAPvfJ.html
10-09-2020||India||This doctor tested Covid +ve in July. A month on, he is positive again||The Uttarakhand government on Thursday claimed that a doctor who was coronavirus positive in July, has again tested positive in an antigen test. The doctor from Dehradun has tested positive in an antigen test, a month after he recovered the first time from Covid-19 infection, informed officials. However, according to medical experts, in cases of suspected Covid reinfection, a genomic test of viral strains is required to ascertain whether the patient has been really reinfected. This has not been done in this case. “This is likely the first time that a case of reinfection of Covid-19 has been reported from Uttarakhand. The person who has tested positive had continued exposure and it could be that they got re-infected because of that,” said Dr Pankaj Singh, state surveillance officer, Integrated Diseases Surveillance Project. The patient, who looks after collection of Covid-19 samples for the health department in Dehradun district, had first tested positive on July 23 and the second test (antigen test) came positive on Monday. “First time I tested positive on July 23 after which I had recovered. Around August 10, my RT-PCR test had also tested negative. Around the weekend, I had slight fever and cough and because I am involved in the sampling process for Covid-19, I thought that I should get myself tested. On Monday, I tested positive again in an antigen test and I isolated myself at home,” said the doctor, who was not willing to be named. Dr Anurag Aggarwal, nodal officer for coronavirus treatment in Uttarakhand from Government Doon Medical College Hospital, said, “When cases were first being reported in the state, certain patients tested negative after around 30-35 days. So that could be the case in this situation, that the virus from the first time is active till 40-50 days from first testing positive. The second situation could be that the person has been reinfected. It is difficult to say if the first condition works on this patient as it has been almost a month testing positive for the first time.” When asked if samples of the doctor have been sent for genome testing to confirm if it is a case of re-infection, Dr Aggarwal said, “We are not clear if a genome test is being done, we have not even received any guidelines on this as of now.” However, the doctor who tested positive said that health officials have taken a sample for RT-PCR test too, through which “they would be studying the viral strain”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-doctor-tests-covid-19-ve-again-a-month-after-recovering/story-x3jOdJVNnDN6OTBA2lxXxL.html

He alleged that there have been increased attacks on Hindu temples during the Jagan Mohan Reddy regime in Andhra Pradesh. He demanded that the state government order a probe by a retired high court judge into the Antarvedi temple chariot fire. “If the government does not act seriously, we shall approach the Centre seeking a CBI investigation into the incident,” the Jana Sena chief said.BJP state president Somu Veerraju, who sat on a 11-hour deeksha at his residence in Rajahmundry in East Godavari district, said the agitation would continue till the state government brings the culprits to book. He said he would petition the Governor over the burning of chariot at Antarvedi temple.Former state BJP president Kanna Lakshminarayana also sat on a 11-hour fast at his residence in Guntur. He alleged that there had been a systematic attack on Hinduism since the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was formed last year.“The burning of chariot at Antarvedi was atrocious and it has hurt the sentiments of Hindus.

10-09-2020||India||Cigarette, beedi butts are not toxic, claims study||Chemical levels in cigarette and beedi butts are lower than the government-prescribed limits and “not toxic to humans and environment”, according to a recent study by Lucknow-based Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR). Cigarette butts are the most common type of litter on earth, with an estimated 4.5 trillion of them discarded annually around the globe.Most of the cigarette butts are discarded in dustbins, roadside, beaches or other public places, posing a major threat to living organisms and ecosystem health. Some studies suggest cigarette butts are toxic to microbes, insects, and fish etc. In April last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to get a study conducted as to whether cigarette and beedi butts fall within the category of ‘toxic waste’. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in October last year between the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research to analyse chemical and elemental composition of various brands of cigarettes and beedi butts (both burnt and unburnt) and to see if they meet the required parameters.Burnt and unburnt butts of 10 cigarette brands and beedi brands were used in the study, according to CSIR-IITR.Except endosulfan (in one brand), the levels of chemicals listed in class ‘A’ of schedule II 2016, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, and cobalt, “were either below the level of detection or many fold lower than the threshold value”, the IITR report said. The levels of chemicals listed in class ‘C’ of Schedule-II 2016, including anthracene, phenanthrene and amines, were also lower than the prescribed limits under experimental conditions with limited sample size, it said. “The analysis reflects that the concentrations detected will not be toxic to human and the environment,” the study said. It, however, said that “data is not available” on cellulose acetate mediated human health risk assessment and toxic responses, and response on microflora in the soil. Cellulose acetate is a major component (95 per cent) of cigarette butts along with the wrapping paper and rayon. The degradation studies carried out on cigarette butts have shown only 37.8 per cent degradation in two years in the soil under ambient conditions; hence it will persist in soil for a longer duration, the IITR said. “The degradation studies under natural environmental conditions and laboratory simulating conditions will be required to conclude the safety/toxicity of cigarette butts to further correlate with human and environmental health risk assessment,” it said. The research institute suggested recycling of cellulose acetate after recovery from cigarette butts as an immediate solution to the problem until the degradation and safety data are generated.The NGT had earlier issued notices to the MoEF, ministry of health and family welfare and CPCB on a plea filed by a doctors’ body seeking prohibition on consumption of tobacco in all public places and proper disposal of related waste. Doctors for You, an NGO working towards cancer care, had moved the tribunal, asking that the Centre be directed to declare cigarette and beedi butts ‘toxic waste’. It had claimed that tobacco was causing major health problems and its ‘cultivation processing, production and disposal was harming the ecology badly’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cigarette-beedi-butts-are-not-toxic-claims-study/story-9hhiyQVSDqZlB9gudJ9cwI.html

Speaking at the virtual ceremony for the presentation of his credentials, Wong noted that Singapore has become the number one investor in India since 2018. Singapore’s cumulative investment in India between 1990 and 2019 amounted to $85 billion. Even amid the Covid-19 crisis, Singapore’s companies have pledged $2 billion in investments in India between August last year and August 2020, and the two sides have a long-standing strategic partnership in defence and homeland security, he said. Kovind expressed his appreciation for the Singapore government’s efforts to address the Indian diaspora’s concerns related to the Covid-19 pandemic and said such mutual cooperation strengthens the ties of friendship and trust between the two countries.

10-09-2020||India||HC questions Arnab Goswami for running parallel investigation in Pushkar death case, asks to show restraint||The Delhi High Court Thursday questioned Arnab Goswami for running a parallel investigation and trial in the Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar’s death case and directed the journalist to be bound by his undertaking on showing restraint and bringing down the rhetoric while covering the matter.Justice Mukta Gupta said the court was not saying that anyone will gag the media but at the same time, sanctity of investigation must be maintained.“Please show restraint. Once the police investigation is going on in the criminal case, there cannot be a parallel investigation by the media,” the judge said and remarked that people must take a course in criminal trial and then get into journalism.The high court referred to December 1, 2017 order in which it was stated that “Press cannot ‘convict anyone’ or insinuate that he/she is guilty or make any other unsubstantiated claims. Press has to exercise care and caution while reporting about matters under investigation or pending trial.” It has been noted in the 2017 order that the counsel for the journalist and channel has assured the court that in future they would exercise restraint as well as bring down the ‘rhetoric’. On Thursday, the judge said, “Defendants (Goswami and his channel) are thus directed to be bound by the statement made on their behalf by their counsel till the next date of hearing.” On the channel’s claim that they have evidence with them, the judge questioned them saying “were you at the spot? Are you an eye witness? There is some sanctity attached to the investigation.” To this, advocate Malvika Trivedi, representing Goswami, said there was evidence from AIIMS, based on which certain broadcast was aired.The judge said it was for a court of law to decide what was evidence in a criminal trial and there are statements from here and there which are not evidence.“Can the media sit in appeal against the charge sheet filed by an investigating agency?,” the judge asked.“It is not a reflection on the Plaintiff (Tharoor) but the investigating agency. Can there be a parallel investigation or trial?.. Would you not like the courts to take their own course?,” the judge said. The high court was hearing an application by Congress MP Tharoor seeking interim injunction against Goswami, Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV, from making defamatory remarks against the leader.Tharoor’s grievance relates to broadcast of the programmes naming him on the TV channel in July and August and in the telecast, the journalist has claimed that they have investigated Sunanda Pushkar case better than the police and that he still has no doubt that Pushkar was murdered.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Vikas Pahwa, representing Tharoor, said charge sheet has been filed by the police in the case and he has been summoned for the alleged offence of abetment to suicide then how can the journalist abuse him and allege that there was a murder.The application, filed through advocates Gaurav Gupta and Muhammad A Khan, sought that the journalist should be directed to report only on matters which are factually correct or established.The high court noted that the Delhi Police has filed a charge sheet in the trial court which has taken cognisance of it and he has been summoned under Sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 498A (cruelty to married woman) IPC in the light of the investigation done by the agency.The high court sought response of the journalist on Tharoor’s application and listed the matter for further hearing on November 20.In the December 1, 2017 order, the high court had said Goswami and his channel have the right to air their stories and the same cannot be curbed, but it has to be tempered and balanced.The court’s 2017 order had come on three different applications filed by Tharoor in his Rs two crore defamation suit against Goswami and the channel for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him while airing news relating to the mysterious death of his wife.Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a five-star hotel in south Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014 under mysterious circumstances. Tharoor has alleged that they continued to engage in “defaming and maligning” him despite an assurance given by their counsel in the court on May 29, 2017.The court had on May 29, 2017 said the journalist and his news channel could put out stories stating the facts related to the investigation of Pushkar’s death but could not call the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram “a criminal”. The Congress leader has sought a direction to them that they should not mention the expression “murder of Sunanda Pushkar” anywhere, since it is yet to established by a competent court whether her death was a “murder”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-questions-arnab-goswami-for-running-parallel-investigation-in-pushkar-death-case-asks-to-show-restraint/story-rW10hoH6YDFc1YcUqKyMLJ.html

10-09-2020||India||Kerala CM calls all-party meet to discuss ways to avoid by-polls amid Covid-19 crisis||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has called an all-party meeting on Friday to discuss ways to reach a consensus on calling off two assembly by-elections in Kuttanad and Chavara, scheduled in November. Earlier, many political parties had expressed reservations over the Election Commission’s decision to conduct by-elections along with Bihar elections in November amid Covid-19 pandemic.They say the newly-elected legislators will get only four-five months in office as assembly elections are due in April next year. They feel it is a sheer waste of time and money and polling will be very low due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Election Commission later made it clear that if there is a consensus, it can call off the by-elections.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has put forward a suggestion that the United Democratic Front (UDF) will be willing if the local body poll, which is also due in October-November, should be postponed by a couple of months. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed it. Later the government has decided to call an all-party meeting to arrive at a consensus.“There is a consensus on by-elections because only a few months will be left for the incumbents. We need to discuss the matter of the local body polls. Hope a consensus will emerge on both,” said CM Vijayan. Both seats fell vacant after the death of sitting members - NCP’s Thomas Chandy in Kuttanad in Alapuzha district and Vijayan Pillai (CMP) in Chavara, Kollam.Also read: Serum Institute pauses Covishield vaccine trials in IndiaThe government also feels that Covid-19 control measures will be affected once local body elections are announced. In the grassroots, local bodies play an important role in virus control management. Similarly, many health experts have warned that cases may peak in the state by the next month. State Health Minister KK Shailaja has also said that going by the present trend, the cases may peak in a couple of months.“It is a fact that we are easing restrictions one after another. All chances are there for cases to go up and the death rate to also see a spike. The present trend shows we have to foresee such eventuality and prepare for this,” said the health minister. As on Wednesday, the state reported 95,860 total cases and more than half of them were reported in just one month. The number of recovered patients of Covid-19 in the state stands at 70,921 while the active cases are at 24,419. Kerala has reported 385 Covid-19 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-calls-all-party-meet-to-discuss-ways-to-avoid-by-polls-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-L7o7Ls5WsukcmScGTPKWnM.html

In his complaint to police, Mane has claimed that in her video, the actor used derogatory and defamatory language for Thackeray and sought criminal action against her. However, the police could not make out any cognisable offence in the complaint and turned it into an NC complaint.“We have registered an NC complaint and have instructed the complainant to approach the court for further perusal of the matter,” said Sanjay Darade, additional commissioner of police (East region).Similarly, a complaint was submitted to the Dindoshi police station by Malad (East) resident Arun Mishra seeking action against the actor. The police have neither registered an FIR nor an NC, confirmed Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner of police (North region).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-supporters-file-police-complaints-against-kangana-for-derogatory-remark-against-cm/story-BKaBCf0H72oqmmQFhQPfEN.html

Describing Kangana as a “brave and courageous” daughter of the country, Akhara Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri said the actor was being attacked by a government in “fear”. “The fearless voice of the actor against nepotism and domination of a particular community in Bollywood besides the nexus existing between the film industry and the drug Mafia has caused ripples. The mafia and state government are both in fear and simply hitting out at her,” said Giri.Lending support, Giri further said all saints and the countrymen are with Kangana in this battle of hers. He also thanked Himachal Pradesh and the Central government for giving security cover to Kangana.The attack on her office - the Mumbai civic body partially demolished her office in Pali Hills for what it said was unauthorised alterations, said Giri was an act of simple retaliation aimed at suppressing her voice.Ranaut has crossed swords with the Shiv Sena, which rules in Maharashtra as well as controls the BMC, with her remark comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.The 33-year-old actor, who returned to Mumbai on Wednesday from her home state Himachal Pradesh, has alleged that the Maharashtra government was targeting her because of her clash with the Shiv Sena.“However, the Maharashtra High Court has given a huge relief to Kangana by granting a stay on the demolition operations. The bravery with which she has faced drug and Bollywood mafia in Sushant Singh murder case has made many people angry and she is being targeted at their behest,” he added.He went on to allege that the law and order situation in Maharashtra was very bad.“Even in the case of mob lynching of the two saints in Palghar, the Maharashtra government has not taken any action. The Akhada parishad has demanded a CBI inquiry in the Palghar case but the state government has failed to act,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-hindu-body-of-sadhus-back-kangana-ranaut-in-political-row-with-shiv-sena/story-DOmQNaOpPCKZIpCDj3TMVO.html

The 4th side would be covered in a way not to allow any public view of idols. There would be no darshan by public/devotees. The size of idols in all such pujas would be less than 4 feet and no public address system can be used. There would be no music or any other entertainment programme,” the order said.The guideline said at any point of time, there would not be more than 7 persons including the organisers, priests and support staff present in the puja pandals/mandaps.“The persons present at puja pandals/mandaps shall follow Covid protocols of social distancing, mask use, personal hygiene and sanitation issued by Central/State government or local administration in letter and spirit,” it said.The festive season is set to begin with Vishwakarma puja on September 16 followed by Mahasthami puja of Goddess Durga on October 16 and Laxmi Puja on October 23. The Kali Puja and Diwali is scheduled on Nov 14.The government also said there would be no immersion procession and all idols will be immersed in artificial ponds created by local administration for the purpose.The orders came on a day when Odisha recorded 3,991 Covid-9 cases, its highest single-day surge so far and 13 deaths.Last month, the Orissa High Court had allowed the Balu Bazaar Puja Committee, the oldest puja committee of the Cuttack city, to organise Durga Puja but without public participation and with strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. It also said that the state government was the best authority to decide on pujas after some businessmen of Cuttack approached the court seeking to organise Ganesh puja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-s-shadow-over-durga-puja-in-odisha-govt-says-no-public-celebration/story-f1CCgHkRK4JkVkw5WsFkbN.html

The SII is manufacturing Oxford University’s Covishield vaccine in collaboration with UK’s AstraZeneca. “We are reviewing the situation and pausing India trials till AstraZeneca restarts the trials. We are following Drug Controller General of India’s (DGCI) instructions and will not be able to comment further on trials,” the Serum institute said.The DGCI issued the notice to the Serum institute for not informing them about AstraZeneca pausing the clinical trials in other countries and for not submitting casualty analysis of the “reported serious adverse events”. An immediate reply from the Serum institute was sought saying else “it shall be construed that you have no explanation to offer and action deemed fit will be taken against you”.“We are going by DCGI’s direction and so far were not told to pause the trials. If DCGI has any safety concerns, we will follow their instructions and abide by the standard protocols,” the Serum institute had said after receiving the notice on Wednesday.The UK-based pharma giant paused the trials of the vaccine on Sept 8 after one of its recipients in the United Kingdom developed an ‘unexplained illness’. In India, out of the 100 volunteers, 34 were from Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and hospital in Pune, who have been administered vaccine shots after trials for phase 2 began on August 26.None of these volunteers have shown any sign of health-related complications, with all their vital parameters appearing normal, doctors at the medical college and hospital said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pausing-india-trials-till-astrazeneca-restarts-them-serum-institute-on-coronavirus-vaccine-trials/story-FbflyAaM0LtekqVii85KRI.html

The petitions were filed as an objection to a media trial after selective leaks were being made to a section of the media by the probe agencies following which the public were being prejudiced against Mumbai Police.The court also sought to know about a lack of mechanism of the government authorities concerned to regulate electronic media and directed the prosecution of more channels against whom the petitioners had raised their objections.Also read: Sushant case probe a campaign issue in BiharAn HC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni, heard the public interest litigations (PILs) filed by the former IPS officials and an activist.The court was informed that even though the HC through its September 3 order had directed media channels to exercise restraint while reporting the investigations in the Rajput death case, some media houses and TV channels had shown scant regard for the order. The petitions urged the HC to take note of the media houses and TV channels’ egregious conduct. Senior advocate Dr Milind Sathe, who appeared on behalf of the eight ex-IPS officials, informed the court that after the September 3 order some channels had become more vociferous in their vilification campaign as far as Mumbai Police was concerned. He placed the transcripts of some of the news channels on record to bolster his argument and submitted that the court should take cognisance and make these channels party to the petitions. Senior advocate Devadatt Kamat, who appeared for activist Nilesh Navlakha, concurred with the submissions of Dr Sathe.Kamat alleged that the parallel trial by a section of the media had not ebbed as information of the investigation was being leaked by the probe agencies themselves. Kamat agreed to the submissions made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that it was not leaking any information to the media.However, he singled out NCB and ED and prayed before the court that they be made a party to the petitions in a bid to ascertain whether information of the probe was being leaked by them to the media.The News Broadcasting Standards Association (NBSA) through advocate Nisha submitted that the body was a self-regulating authority for news channels and had also received complaints from viewers about some news channels going overboard in their reporting of the Rajput case. She submitted that the authority was looking into the complaints and would like to file a counter affidavit putting on record the action taken by them.The court upheld her plea. The News Broadcasters Federation (NBF) also sought to be included in the petitions as many channels were their members but were unrepresented. The court upheld this submission as well. The bench took note of advocate Asim Sarode’s separate petition that had sought directions to the authorities to put in place regulatory mechanisms on the functioning of the media. “We are surprised that there is no regulating mechanism of the state to control the electronic media and are prima facie of the opinion that this body (NBSA) does not have teeth. The state may reply in affidavit and indicate the extent of state control that is exercised in respect of telecasting news which has serious ramifications and other ancillary matters which might come up for our consideration while deciding this matter,” the bench observed.The court directed the inclusion of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Central government as party to all the petitions. The court also directed the NBSA to hear the complaints received by them.“The said pendency of these petitions shall not preclude NBSA to consider complaints that have been received by it and take appropriate actions as per law. Resultant decisions may be included in the affidavit,” it added.All news channels, which have been made a party to the petitions, have been ordered to file affidavits by September 30.The bench will hear the petitions next on October 8. The court again reminded that the media must continue to exercise restraint while reporting on the investigation in the Rajput case in line with its September 3 order in a bid to ensure that the ongoing probe is not hampered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-bombay-hc-asks-why-there-is-no-state-mechanism-to-regulate-content-on-news-channels/story-t4UYoYbs9dIPdpJzoIpJ3K.html

Therefore, she does not want to undertake any journey during these days of pandemic,” her advocate argued in the before the Bombay high court at Goa.The victim had already requested the trial court to examine her through “video device” and had sought the suspension of the bailable warrant “lest the victim, a woman, herself a rape victim, should be subjected to arrest and hardship.”The high court has granted an interim suspension to the bailable warrant that was issued form the woman victim for failing to be present during the trial. The trial court had issued a bailable warrant to the woman to secure her presence in court for the ongoing trial which is currently at the stage of the cross examination of the victim and cannot proceed unless she attends personally or the trial resumes via video conference. She would have to seek ‘bail’ of Rs 5,000 if she could not make herself present. Through her advocate the victim moved an ‘out of turn’ petition before the High Court fearing hardship she will have to undergo should the bailable warrant stand. The trial which resumed in September last year has been plagued by delays owing to several reasons and most recently on account of the cross examination of the woman.The trial, which began in September 2017 was stalled after Tarun Tejpal approached the high court and later the Supreme Court challenging the framing of charges and seeking discharge in the case. The Supreme Court however, in a judgment in August last year, declined his plea and ordered that the trial be completed in six months. The trial is being held in-camera and is not open to media persons or to the public.The Mapusa court framed all the charges levelled against Tejpal in the charge sheet filed on November 30, 2013. These include sections 376 (punishment for rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-in-tarun-tejpal-case-seeks-cross-examination-via-video-conference/story-dcyYyAAFHi5LPqNYglkY6H.html

The states and UTs were also asked to immediately form a monitoring mechanism via a designated officer or team in every district and at the state level so as to follow up on such cases.All states and states and UTs have been urged to urgently establish a monitoring mechanism in every district (via a designated officer or a team) and at the state level to follow up on such cases, the ministry said.

Also read: Close to 1 lakh daily cases push India’s Covid-19 tally to above 4.4 millionThe guidelines of both health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) state that all symptomatic (with fever, cough or breathlessness) negative cases of rapid antigen tests as well as asymptomatic cases that develop symptoms within two to three days of being tested negative should be be retested through RT-PCR tests.“In this background, the Union Health Ministry and ICMR have jointly written to all the states and UTs and urged them to ensure that the all symptomatic negative cases of RAT are mandatorily retested using the RT-PCR test,” the health ministry said. “This is necessary to ensure that such symptomatic negative cases do not remain untested and do not spread the disease among their contacts,” it said.The ministry pointed out that this exercise will also ensure early detection, isolation and hospitalization of such ‘false’ negative cases. Meanwhile, the ICMR has tested nearly 5.3 crore samples for Covid-19 out of which 11,29,756 samples were tested on Wednesday.  COVID-19 Testing Update.

But the question is about transparency and effective implementation. When there is a problem (with the implementation of a scheme), then the rant about it turns out to be hollow and the expenses useless,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana.

At about 0530 hours it was in Mankote sector, at about 1145 hours in Degwar sector and at about 1215 hours in Mendhar Sector in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian army has retaliated befittingly,” defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said in Jammu.Earlier in the day, the Pakistani army acknowledged that one of its soldiers was killed in an exchange of fire with Indian troops across the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir late Wednesday. It alleged that the Indian army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation in Bedori sector along the LoC, targeting Pakistan army posts and the civil population. It claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on Indian troops.“Pakistan Army responded effectively. Reports of heavy losses on the enemy in terms of men and material.

10-09-2020||India||Kangana Ranaut calls Shiv Sena ‘Sonia Sena’, Uddhav Thackeray ‘a dynast’||Actor Kangana Ranaut continued her attack on the Shiv Sena on Thursday, accusing it of diluting its ideology to be in power and even called it “Sonia Sena”. In an indirect reference to Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the actor called him an “example of dynast”. However, so far, no senior leader from the Shiv Sena has reacted to the actor’s statements.Taking to Twitter, the actor launched an attack on Sena and Thackeray and said, “Because of these petty crimes that they do @Dev_Fadnavis ji must have suggested that BJP does alliance with them, one must never succumb to bullies, after loosing elections Shiv Sena shamelessly made milavat sarkar and turned in to Sonia Sena. (sic)”.In her following tweet, the actor added, “The ideology on which Shri Balasaheb Thackeray had built Shiv Sena, today they have sold that ideology for power and have become Sonia Sena from Shiv Sena. Don’t call the goons who broke my house in my absence a civic body. Don’t insult the Constitution in this manner.”In an apparent attack on Thackeray, the actor called him a dynast and questioned how many people will be silenced. “Your father’s good deeds can get you wealth, but you have to earn respect on your own. You can silence my voice, but my voice will multiply in thousands and lakhs. How many people will you silence? How long will you run from the truth? You are nothing but merely an example of a dynast.”Sena insiders said the party leadership has asked leaders to not wade into the controversy. “Only Sanjay Raut will speak on this matter, if required,” a senior party leader said. Raut, who was locked in a verbal spat with the actor for several days now, on Wednesday declined to comment on the ongoing issue. The Sena leader had said, “I was in Saamana office since morning, I am unaware of happenings outside.” In the late afternoon, Raut went to Matoshree, Thackeray’s suburban Bandra residence, for a meeting on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-calls-shiv-sena-sonia-sena-uddhav-thackeray-a-dynast/story-xM7L0d7PqtG6CYkNQdb0IO.html
10-09-2020||India||Serum Institute of India is still testing AstraZeneca’s shot after DCGI halts trials||The Indian company enlisted to manufacture a billion doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine is pushing ahead with its own clinical trial even as safety concerns forced the British drugmaker to halt its tests.The Serum Institute of India said it received a notice from the Drug Controller General of India seeking information on the illness of a person participating in AstraZeneca’s trials in Britain. The regulator asked Serum to demonstrate why its clinical trial license should not be suspended until the safety of the vaccine is established, according to a report from the Press Trust of India.Serum said it was responding to the regulator’s queries, but was proceeding with its own human trials in India in the meantime.“The Indian trials are continuing and we have faced no issues at all,” Serum said in a statement on its official Twitter account. “We were going by DCGI’s direction and were not instructed to pause the trials. If DCGI has any safety concerns, we will adhere to their instructions and abide by the standard protocols.”DCGI couldn’t be reached for a comment.AstraZeneca paused its clinical trials worldwide this week as it investigates whether the illness seen in the participant happened by chance or as a result of the treatment. But Serum’s ongoing trial in India, where coronavirus infections are skyrocketing, illustrate how tradeoffs between caution and speed are in no way settled as companies race to bring a vaccine to market.US National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told a Senate committee Wednesday that AstraZeneca’s trial had been halted due to a “spinal cord problem.” If AstraZeneca’s review finds the adverse event is related to the vaccine, all the doses already manufactured will be thrown away, Collins said.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot told investors on a conference call Wednesday there had been no final diagnosis in the case, according to company spokeswoman Michele Meixell.Serum, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, signed on with Astra in June to produce the shot for low- and middle-income countries, and has been proceeding with its own human trials in India running parallel to Astra’s effort. Serum said it could not comment on the pause in Astra’s trials.The vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has been considered one of the most likely contenders to reach the market in the near term, along with shots being developed by Moderna Inc. and the tandem of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Astra and Oxford are seeking to enroll as many as 50,000 participants for late-stage trials under way in the US, the UK and other countries.Serum has not said how many patients it is seeking for its trials in India, where the number of new coronavirus infections discovered each day continues to grow. India’s outbreak this week became the world’s second-biggest behind the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vaccine-maker-is-still-testing-astrazeneca-s-shot-after-firm-halts-trials/story-X7Bl3nVpMh9yKXMWUYwUMP.html

These threats pertain to the case of a 12-year-old minor from Jodhpur city, who was allegedly left with a non-government organization (NGO) at the age of three by her mother, who, now, wants her custody, 9 years later, against the girl’s wish. “In 2011, a lady handed over her three-year-old daughter to the local unit of child welfare committee (CWC) stating she was incapable of raising her and requested them to take care of her daughter till she turns 18. As per the norms, before taking the custody of the girl, the CWC took an affidavit—signed a year later in May 2012--from the mother, after which, the girl was formally given to Navjeevan NGO to be raised,” said Beniwal. The RSCPCR chief added that the girl was currently studying at a school with the fees being paid by the NGO. “The girl is currently studying in class sixth in a good school, which is being paid Rs 50,000 every year by the NGO for her education,” Beniwal said. Suddenly after nine years, the girl’s mother, who works as a domestic help, returns in February and demands to take back the girl but the minor is refusing, she added. “In February this year, the mother of the girl requested to meet the girl, after which, the lady was granted permission to meet her daughter on a regular basis, but a few days later, the woman started threatening the NGO that it would face repercussions if the girl was not returned to her. The girl, however, refused to stay with her mother, following which, the woman mobilized some caste-based outfits for threatening the NGO guys,” Beniwal said. Also Read: At Rajasthan Congress feedback meet, slogans against minister, posters tornWhen the child body chief intervened, some members of the caste outfit mentioned above started threatening Beniwal through WhatsApp and sms texts and phone calls, saying that if the NGO didn’t hand over the custody of the girl, Beniwal would face repercussions. HT has seen some such messages sent to the RSCPCR chairperson. Beniwal says she is not giving in to threats. “I am not afraid of the threats. The future of the girl is the most important thing for the NGO and me,” she said, adding that she will file a complaint to the police on Thursday afternoon. Also Read: 716 fresh cases push Rajasthan’s Covid-19 tally to over 96,000The minor says she is not comfortable with the idea of returning to her mother. “Also, I am not sure whether my mother, and the man she is living with, would be able to give me the quality education provided by the NGO. Where was my mother for the last several years?” the minor asked. Beniwal has requested the commissioner of police, Jodhpur city to tighten the security for the NGO and the girl. The mother of the girl said she would self-immolate if she doesn’t get custody of her daughter within two days. “I left my daughter at the Navjeevan Sansthan and I need justice. If the custody of my daughter is not given back to me, I would immolate myself,” the lady said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-child-body-chief-receiving-threats-from-caste-outfit-over-custody-of-minor/story-bGq9IkBzT7qIXYUawAtY7O.html

10-09-2020||India||Before big battle for Bihar, a JD-U vs RJD face-off in Delhi next week||Patna: First-time Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Jha is the joint opposition’s candidate for the Rajya Sabha’s deputy chairman elections scheduled next week, setting up a face-off between the RJD and its prime rival in Bihar, Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD-U, people familiar with the matter said.JD-U MP Harivansh, 64, has already been named by the National Democratic Alliance as its candidate for a second term as the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman. Harivansh was first elected to the post in 2018 when he, as a first time MP, defeated the Congress’ BK Hariprasad who fought as the joint Opposition candidate. Over the next two years, the ruling BJP is only stronger than it was, up from 73 seats in the 250-seat house to 87.The opposition’s decision to project RJD’s first-time MP Manoj Jha is seen as an effort to draw support from new quarters and, as one Congress put it, also send a strong message about opposition unity, irrespective of the outcome of the election. Jha entered the Rajya Sabha in Jha in April 2018. The opposition had initially debated fielding DMK MP Tiruchi Siva but later, settled for Jha, possibly with the Bihar assembly elections in mind where the Congress and the RJD are two major constituents of the much-depleted Grand Alliance. Also, there is a hope that some regional parties that may not support the Congress would lean towards the candidate from the party founded by Lalu Prasad Yadav.This would turn the RS deputy chairman post a RJD vs JD-U fight and an all-Bihar affair. Both Harivansh and Jha are RS MPs from Bihar. Manoj Jha, 53, insisted that the election wasn’t just between two parties.“It should not be seen as RJD vs JD-U as there are larger issues at stake relating to the health and well-being of the parliamentary democracy. It is not between two individuals. It is for a larger cause and it should be seen in that context,” said Jha Jha is expected to file his nomination on Friday (September 11), the last date for filing nomination. The election will be held on September 14, the day the monsoon session of the Parliament begins. Harivansh, who held the post of deputy chairman till the end of his term, has already filed his nomination.Manoj Jha’s name was proposed after the Congress decided to try for a larger opposition unity on the election of RS deputy chairman.“This is a good sign that the Congress is thinking of opposition cohesion going beyond its own party with a long-term goal. It will send a positive message to the opposition parties that Congress is ready to walk an extra mile,” said a senior Congress leader.A Delhi University professor, Jha has not completed even half his first stint in the Rajya Sabha, but is widely seen as a sharp critic of the centre and articulate politician, inside the House as well as on social media.“The policies of the Narendra Modi government have hurt the people of all strata across the country and it got further accentuated by the inept handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, the political parties supporting the BJP also have to think and we hope they will during the forthcoming RS election for the post of deputy chairman,” said Congress leader Premchandra Mishra. For Jha to have a chance to scrape through, he would require support of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and YSR Congress, as the NDA with 116 members, is much closer to the majority mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-big-battle-for-bihar-a-jd-u-vs-rjd-face-off-in-delhi-next-week/story-Xtk0Ou4zLmh87xQYkjUgNL.html

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said that the project will allow people involved in pisciculture and animal husbandry to help bring variety and new technologies in the sector. He said that the steps taken by the government will boost India’s aim to become self-reliant.

Highlighting the success of the PM KISAN scheme in the state, the Prime minister said that Bihar’s 75 lakh farmers have received more than Rs 6,000 crore due to the scheme. The project in Bihar envisages investment of Rs 1,390 crore with the central share of Rs 535 crore and the additional fish production target pegged at three lakh tons. During the current fiscal, the Union government has sanctioned Bihar’s proposal costing Rs 107 crore.At present, no digital platform is available in the country for farmers managing livestock including buying and selling of disease free germplasm in all forms, availability of quality breeding services and guiding farmers for animal nutrition, treatment of animals using appropriate medicine.There is no mechanism to send alerts on due date for vaccination, pregnancy diagnosis and calving among other issues and inform farmers about various government schemes and campaigns in the area.The e-Gopala app will provide solutions to farmers on all these aspects.The PMMSY aims at enhancing fish production by an additional 70 lakh tonne by 2024-25, increasing fisheries export earnings to Rs 1,00,000 crore by 2024-25, doubling of incomes of fishers and fish farmers, reducing post-harvest losses from 20-25 per cent to about 10 per cent and generation of additional 55 lakhs direct and indirect gainful employment opportunities in fisheries sector and allied activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-flagship-fisheries-scheme-e-gopala-app-for-farmers-as-part-of-atma-nirbhar-scheme/story-pSuGyzZjMhXwHcfxUXyfIM.html
10-09-2020||India||51 passengers caught with ammunition at IGI airport in 2020: Police||At least 51 passengers who arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport to catch their flights this year were carrying ammunition in their luggage, knowingly or unknowingly, police said. Police said all such passengers faced criminal proceedings under the Arms Act and were stopped from boarding their flights. On Thursday, police issued an advisory reminding passengers that carrying bullets was a non-bailable offence and requested them to thoroughly check their bags before proceeding for security checks.They said that in most cases, the passengers claimed they had borrowed the bags and were unaware of the bullets while packing their luggage. Delhi police records show that every year, there are about 100 such cases of bullets found in luggages. In a similar incident recently, police said, a 41-year old man from Gujarat, who had arrived at the Delhi airport to board a flight to Ahmedabad on Tuesday, was arrested after five bullets were recovered from his luggage. Police said the man had an arms license which was valid only in Gujarat and had forgotten to remove the bullets from his luggage. Deputy commissioner of police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said the passenger was a labour contractor. During his luggage scanning at Terminal 3, police found five bullets and two used bullet shells in his bag.“On questioning, he said he was not aware of the bullets in his bag. He even produced his licence but it was valid in Gujarat only. Hence, a case under Arms Act was registered against him and he was offloaded,” Ranjan said.The DCP said that till date, 51 such cases have been registered under Arms Act at IGI Airport in the current year.“Whenever a bullet is detected in luggage, as per the legal provisions, an FIR is registered against the passenger for illegal possession of ammunition and he/she has to face criminal proceedings before the court of law. He/she is also not allowed to continue with their journey,” the DCP said.Ranjan also exhorted passengers to be very careful while packing their luggage since carrying ammunition at the airport is a non-bailable offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/51-passengers-caught-with-ammunition-at-delhi-international-airport-this-year-police/story-NcUBpRssXLrZcluYqf2FpM.html

There are 51,455 anganwadi centres in Chhattisgarh but those in containment zones will continue to remain closed. The agwanwadi centres resumed functioning on Monday. The National Health and Family Welfare Phase 4 survey has put the malnutrition level in the state at 37 per cent. “The state Women and Child Development department has written to district collectors, divisional commissioners and district programme officers to ensure preventive measures are in place,” an order in this regard issued by the state government stated. “The Aganwadis were closed since March 14 and workers were directly delivering dry ration to homes of beneficiaries. Even international agencies like WHO and UNICEF believe Covid-19 might result in rise in malnourishment and have suggested that effective steps be taken to check it. Taking this into consideration, anganwadis will be opened for a limited period daily to provide freshly-cooked food to children between 3-6 years of age and pregnant women. Besides, immunisation of children and health check-up of pregnant women can also be done,” a senior official said. “All precautions like thermal screening, personal hygiene etc will have to be maintained. Each centre must have just 15 people at one time. If any staff is found coronavirus positive, then the centre will be shut for three days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-reopens-anganwadi-centres-to-curb-malnutrition-among-kids-and-pregnant-women/story-JJyUrIOFsHKllpePmTsTSK.html

10-09-2020||India||Husband of woman who accused Uttarakhand BJP MLA of rape skips police summons, faces action||The Dehradun police probing a case of blackmail and extortion against a 30-year-old woman who has accused a BJP MLA of rape, are considering legal action against her husband for failing to appear before them to record his statement despite several notices, a senior police officer said Thursday. The woman’s husband is a co-accused named in the case in which the woman has been accused of blackmailing and trying to extort Rs 5 cr from BJP MLA from Dwarahat Mahesh Negi last month. The case was registered on the complaint lodged by Negi’s wife Rita Negi. Both Negi and his wife are accused in a rape and criminal intimidation case registered on the directions of a local court on the petition of the woman who allegedly made the extortion bid.Arun Mohan Joshi, senior superintendent of police Dehradun said, “The woman’s husband has been informed several times by the police to come before the investigation officer to record his statement. But he didn’t show up.” “His statements are very important in the ongoing investigation despite that he is not coming to record them. Also, we have come to know that he has left the city to join duty without informing police. We are now thinking of taking action against him as per legal procedure,” said Joshi. The extortion and rape cases which came to light in August has turned into a major political issue between the ruling BJP and Opposition Congress. The woman had accused Negi of raping her for the last two years and also fathering her child. She has been demanding a DNA test of Negi and her child to prove her allegations. Negi has, however, refuted the allegations and termed it a conspiracy against him by Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/husband-of-woman-who-accused-uttarakhand-bjp-mla-of-rape-skips-police-summons-faces-action/story-T47wqhMvhMvG3sUcG1HxRK.html
10-09-2020||India||Maharashtra’s SGNP, Tungareshwar sanctuary to get wireless communication network in 6 months||The Maharashtra forest department has proposed a wireless communication project for its frontline staff to enhance connectivity across Mumbai, Thane and Palghar forest areas.The move is intended to help monitor wildlife movement better and strengthen control of forest patches within the103 sq km Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai, the 85.7 sq km Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWLS) in Thane and Palghar districts, and improve supervision across fragmented forest patches leading up to the 304.81 sq km Tansa Wildlife Sanctuary in Thane district.According to the forest department’s plan, network stations (small control rooms) will be built at the highest point (altitude) mostly atop hills in Yeoor area of SGNP and near Tungar Phata in TWLS. They will be connected to the primary control room at the SGNP, Borivali office. Additionally, every beat officer and forest guard would be equipped with hand-held wireless handsets.The project is likely to be executed within the next six months, said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife-west). “The idea is to have one integrated system to connect each and every part of the national park which is currently inaccessible or does not have a mobile network. A survey is currently underway to determine the cost of the project and quantity of wireless devices required,” he said.Currently, a conventional system using mobile phones are used by the department to communicate and coordinate cases of wildlife crime, tree felling, encroachment, setting up of illicit alcohol breweries as well as control attacks on frontline officers inside forests but owing to negligible network inside forest ranges, the deployment of support staff or other provisions swiftly across problem areas leads to operation inefficiencies, said forest officers. “There have been several issues in protection due to the present system (using mobile phones) and there is a need to strengthen it,” said G Mallikarjun, chief conservator of forest, SGNP.“Similar to the joint communication (JC) strategy implemented by the Mumbai police, our attempt is also to relay information and data on wildlife movement, status of water bodies, poaching incidents etc. not just within forest ranges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region but connect to the Tansa valley landscape for overall corridor connectivity,” he said.All major tiger reserves in Maharashtra as well as Tansa and Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuaries already have the wireless communication project in place. “In some cases in SGNP and TWLS, forest officers have to rush from the scene of the incident to find a major road to find a network for reporting details. There have been isolated incidents of attacks on forest officers over the years as well, and this system will help increase their safety,” said Limaye.In May, the forest department began an exercise to monitor forest areas using drones in TWLS. The project is yet to be replicated across SGNP and peripheral areas. During the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, over 1,500 litres of illegally produced alcohol in barrels and units were destroyed in Yeoor range and destruction of close to 45 encroachments (illegal shanties) was carried out across SGNP-TWLS, the forest department said.According to environment group Vanashakti, petitioners in wildlife and habitat protection around SGNP before the Bombay High Court, close to 100 acres of forest patches within SGNP (Mumbai region) fell prey to encroachments, tree felling and other environment violations between March and June. “This system will bolster forest monitoring and empower frontline staff to keep poachers out. The lack of connectivity is being used to kill wildlife and destroy the habitat at the moment. This will clearly help eliminate such major issues,” said Stalin, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-sgnp-tungareshwar-sanctuary-to-get-wireless-communication-network-in-6-months/story-TSwoQvKLBO2bLLO5VIzvdK.html
10-09-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths crossed 75,000 in India; around 1,000 fatalities each day in September||India has been consistently reporting around 1,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) deaths a day since the beginning of September and the cumulative death toll in the country due to the viral infection breached the 75,000 mark on Wednesday. According to data from the HT dashboard, 75,055 Covid-19 patients have died until Thursday.The case fatality ratio (CFR) – the fraction of deaths among those who have tested Covid-19 positive – has stayed at 1.7%, despite the increase in the number of daily deaths because of the contagion.Also read: Covid-19 kills 24 police personnel in Bengal; nearly 8,000 test positive so farThe casualty figure is much lower than the global CFR of 3.2%. Countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) have reported a CFR of 11.7%, followed by Mexico (10.6%). “We do not know why the number of deaths in India is low. However, various theories abound. It could be because of previous infections of other coronaviruses or it could be due to universal immunisation that uses the BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) vaccine. Or, it could be because we have a higher proportion of younger people. The scientists are still looking for these answers,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. However, Dr Gupta believes that the CFR is unlikely to rise. “The number of deaths – and hence the CFR – is unlikely to go up. This is because the doctors now understand the disease better and have also standardised a treatment protocol,” he said. It is not just the number of deaths, but the number of cases and tests has also been increasing consistently. With over 1,600 laboratories across the country approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct the test, the country has been daily testing over one million swab samples consistently, except for weekends. On Thursday, India reported over 94,000 new Covid-19 cases. According to the data shared by the Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), 60% of the total Covid-19 cases reported so far have been in only five states – Maharashtra (21.6%), Andhra Pradesh (11.8%), Tamil Nadu (10.8%), Karnataka (9.43%), and Uttar Pradesh (6.37%). These five states also account for 61% of the total active Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-crossed-75-000-in-india-around-1-000-fatalities-each-day-in-september/story-1gYDLHQzbdHL3Yyh9Xc6vO.html

The presentation was made through video conferencing by Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj.According to government officials, during the meeting, Modi said the master plan for Badrinath shrine development should not be based on tourism but on its spiritual legacy. Under the master plan, to be implemented in an area of around 85 hectares, Devdarshini spot in the Badrinath shrine area will be developed along with construction of a museum and an art gallery and setting up of a light and sound show to showcase the ‘Dushavatar’ (or ten incarnations). The PM was told that the master plan was prepared keeping in mind the hilly terrain and target for its completion has been set for 2025. The Badrinath master plan was prepared after Modi requested the state government, in June this year, to plan Badrinath Dham’s development keeping the next 100 years in mind. In July, during another meeting to review the progress of Kedarnath reconstruction and development works, CM Rawat sought time from the PM to present the master plan for Badrinath.During the video-conferencing on Wednesday, PM Modi insisted on maintaining the religious and spiritual legacy of Badrinath shrine while implementing the master plan. He also said that a mini-smart spiritual city should be developed in the area. Prime Minister Modi also asked for developing home stay facilities in the area, linking the shrine with other nearby religious spots and special lighting arrangement at the entrance of the Badrinath shrine, in line with its spiritual character. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said the locals were extending their cooperation for the development works at Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines.“Work is on for developing home stay facilities in nearby areas. Keshav Prayag, the confluence of Saraswati and Alaknanda rivers would also be developed. Vyas Gufa has special importance in Badrinath shrine area. Pilgrims would be informed about its religious and mythological importance,” he said. Also Read: SVANidhi Yojna gives new identity, opportunity: PM Modi to Madhya Pradesh street vendorsRawat added that availability of land won’t be a problem for implementing the Badrinath master plan. “Like in case of Kedarnath, work on development projects will be taken up for all 12 months of the year in Badrinath area,” he said State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said that the work on Char Dham road project and Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail line was in full swing. These projects, when completed, will make the pilgrimage to Char Dham shrines much easier, he said.

He apprised the PM that the work on Aastha Path on Saraswati Ghat had been completed and the ongoing work on the two meditation caves near Kedarnath shrines would be completed by this month-end. Badrinath and Kedarnath, along with Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, are one of the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year.

10-09-2020||India||6 BJP workers in Indore booked for violating prohibitory orders amid pandemic||The Madhya Pradesh police lodged three first information reports in Indore on Wednesday against six BJP workers including the party’s district chief for violating prohibitory orders by taking out processions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The police action came after video clips went viral on social media in which a large number of women were seen participating in ‘kalash yatras’ purportedly organised by BJP workers in different parts of Sanver assembly constituency in the past few days. Sanver is one of the 27 assembly constituencies where bye-elections are due by the end of November.Minister for water resources Tulsi Silavat is expected to contest bypoll from Sanver to retain his position as the minister as he is not a member of the state assembly.Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Indore Harinarayanchari Mishra said, “One of the FIRs was lodged by Sanver police station against Rajesh Sonkar and Bhagwan Singh, another by the same police station against Subhash Chaudhary and Vinod and the third FIR was lodged by Chandravatiganj police station against Satish Malviya and Antar Dayal.” Rajesh Sonkar is the BJP district chief in Indore.The DIG said, “There is a ban on procession, gathering and all kinds of public programmes in view of Covid situation. The FIRs were lodged under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, no arrest has been made so far in this connection.” Earlier, police had lodged an FIR earlier against 34 Congress workers on September 2 for organising a rally in the same constituency, under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life). State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “The police and administration should act in an impartial manner. They should take action against BJP workers and leaders in the same manner in which they acted against organisers of other programmes. The organisers of Kalash Yatra in Sanver should be booked under the National Security Act.” The BJP denied that it organised the kalash yatra.“BJP didn’t organise the Kalash yatra. It was organised by local people,” Sonkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-bjp-workers-in-indore-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders-amid-pandemic/story-boLTt9I9zaXFrAY6ktW87N.html
10-09-2020||India||Heavy to extremely heavy rain warning for Kerala and coastal Karnataka||Extremely heavy rain is likely over many places in coastal and south interior Karnataka on Friday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned. Very heavy rain is also likely over Kerala, coastal and south interior Karnataka between Thursday and Saturday.An off-shore trough—an area of low pressure —is running between coastal south Maharashtra and north Kerala. The east-west shear zone, which denotes a change in wind direction and velocity, is running across peninsular India and a cyclonic circulation is lying over east-central Arabian Sea off coastal Karnataka.Also Read: Extended monsoon likely this year: IMDIMD is expecting heavy rains in peninsular India for the next three-four days due to these favourable conditions. The weather bureau has issued an orange category warning for parts of Karnataka and Kerala, Assam and Meghalaya on Thursday and Friday. The warning implies that disaster management authorities should be prepared for any heavy rain-related disasters such as flooding.The monsoon trough is lying to the north of its normal position (from Rajasthan’s Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal). A cyclonic circulation is also lying over Gangetic West Bengal and neighbourhood in the lower troposphere. Also Read: New generation of locusts may attack crops in UP after monsoonWidespread rain with thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over the north-east and adjoining eastern India. Heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places over sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next five days and over most north-eastern states during the next four-five days.A low-pressure area is likely to form over west-central Bay of Bengal off Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast around September 13. The weather phenomena will lead to rainfall distribution and the intensity is likely to increase over Odisha, coastal AP, Yanam in Puducherry, Telangana, Vidarbha and adjoining areas from September 12 onwards.In September, rainfall is likely to range between normal and above normal, as the four-month-long south-west monsoon prepares for a retreat, IMD had said on Monday. Rainfall is likely to be deficient at least until September 13 in most parts of the country, including north-west and central India, before intensifying after September 17, according to the IMD’s extended range forecast. Usually, the retreat of monsoon is slated to begin from September 17 when rain begins reducing across the country until a complete withdrawal by October 15.However, this year IMD’s extended range forecast shows extensive and heavy rains along the west coast between September 11 and 24 and then until October 1 over several parts of central India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-to-extremely-heavy-rain-warning-for-kerala-and-coastal-karnataka/story-9YoMuDBrj3LWHvRB5tViZP.html

10-09-2020||India||India inches closer to 100,000 daily Covid-19 case mark||India added 95,950 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, data compiled by HT from across the states showed, setting yet another grim record and taking the nation closer to the 100,000 daily cases benchmark that no other country in the world has ever come close to crossing. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe latest numbers put total cases at 4.46 million and 1,152 new casualties recorded over the past 24 hours took the death toll to 75,062.

10-09-2020||India||Officials suspect OIL engineer working at Baghjan well could have died due to electrocution||An Oil India Limited engineer, working at the Baghjan natural gas well site which has been on fire since June 9, died on Wednesday. Officials suspect that he died due to electrocution. The deceased engineer was identified as Arnab Kishore Bordoloi, 25. “Bordoloi, who was working with some equipment at the well site, suddenly fell down and lost consciousness. He was provided emergency health care at the site and was taken to Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh where he was declared dead,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarikia said. “The reasons of the death will be known after post-mortem. This is a very tragic incident and has created a pall of gloom in OIL. A team from OIL is carrying out inspection at well site to find out possible reasons for this accident,” he added. Another OIL official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the reason for the death is most likely electrocution as the incident took place when an electrical cable was being tested after connecting to a generator set to provide power for welding job at the well head. The gas well in Assam’s Tinsukia district had a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9. While the well was capped last month, efforts to douse the fire have failed so far. This is the third casualty at the site. On June 9, two OIL firefighters who were attempting to control the blowout died when the well suddenly caught fire. On July 22, three foreign experts engaged by OIL to control the blowout had sustained burn injuries at the well site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-engineer-working-at-baghjan-gas-fire-site-dies-electrocution-suspected/story-AeQ5irrjAYk1hDd6Zxf0vL.html
10-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Maharashtra is the state, province, or region worst affected by Covid-19 in the world. The western Indian state, the most industrialised in the country, home to India’s commercial capital Mumbai, saw 943,772 cases of the coronavirus disease till Tuesday night, according to the HT dashboard. If it were a country, Maharashtra would be at No 5 in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases.But it isn’t the sole Indian state in a listing of the top provinces by cases. Andhra Pradesh, with 517,094 comes in at #6; Tamil Nadu, with 474,940 cases at #7, and Karnataka, with 412,190 cases at #9. Uttar Pradesh, with 278,473 cases is just outside the top 10, at number 11.India is now adding more cases a day (even when a seven-day average is taken) than any other country — more cases a day than China has seen in the entire run of the disease, although that country’s numbers are inexplicably low and the pandemic’s run there remarkably different from its trajectory in every other country in the world. Geographical area and population link the three countries worst affected by the coronavirus disease, the US, Brazil, and India. And it is inconceivable that China, which is third in terms of geographical area, and first in terms of the population, and where the viral infection began (in Wuhan), has seen only 85,000 cases. A previous edition of this column (Dispatch 119, published on July 31) looked at some possible answers to this mystery.But we don’t need to go as far as China for a mystery. This writer, for instance, needs travel only around 30km for one — Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with 225 million people. If it were a country, it would be either the fifth or the sixth most populous one in the world. It has conducted almost 30,000 tests per million — which means it has tested around 3% of its population, a proportion that is not insignificant. Yet, it has seen only 278,483 cases of Covid thus far (till Tuesday night). Its overall positivity rate is 4.11%. Its case fatality rate is 1.45%, lower than India’s. And this is a state with among the worst social indicators in the country.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt isn’t that Uttar Pradesh’s positivity rate (number of people testing positive to number of tests) has reached this level after traversing the usual curve this metric does — it has pretty much stayed at the same level. The highest it ever reached on a seven-day average (since it started testing at least 1,000 samples a day) was 6.4%, and the lowest 2.1%.Interestingly, the trend seen in Uttar Pradesh isn’t very different from that in many African countries (most have social indicators comparable to the Indian state). Africa’s relatively low number of cases and deaths, experts say, can only partly be explained by under-reporting of cases, or gaps in death registries. Scattered antibody tests that have been carried out around the continent show that there has been significant exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus in many African countries — with a test in Kenya highlighting a prevalence of around 20%.Two theories are doing the rounds as possible explanations for Africa’s remarkable numbers. One revolves around the continent’s relatively younger population. The median age in many African countries is in the early 20s. The median age in Uttar Pradesh is also in the early 20s, among the lowest in India. The other is that populations in many African countries may have been exposed to other coronaviruses, even other infectious diseases, giving them greater immunity to Sars-CoV-2. The same can be said of Uttar Pradesh’s population. There is, of course, a third theory. That Africa’s numbers are just a temporary aberration and that, eventually, countries in the continent will start seeing Covid-19 infection curves similar to those seen in Europe, the US, and Latin America. That could be true of Uttar Pradesh as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-IC02roMQoqgypwribieY5O.html
10-09-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: ED interrogates Kerala CPI(M) secretary’s son for 11 hours||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday grilled Kerala CPI (M) secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri for more than 11 hours in connection with the sensational gold smuggling and Bengaluru drug haul cases. He was let off after the marathon interrogation but officials who are part of the multi-agency probe said he was not given a clean chit and will be summoned again. When he was summoned, Kodiyeri sought a week’s time but the ED has turned down his request and asked him to be present before it immediately. Trouble began for Kodiyeri after Bengaluru drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad gave a statement to the Narcotics Control Bureau in which he mentioned his name. He said Bineesh Kodiyeri, second son of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had helped him a lot in his “business venture”. His name also figured prominently in the call list of Mohammad. A day before his arrest (August 28) both had talked several times, the leaked call list showed. Later, Bineesh admitted that he knew Mohammad and helped him in opening a hotel in Bengaluru, but he was not aware of his alleged drug dealings. But later the ED found that two shell companies floated by Kodiyeri, “B Capital Solutions” and “B Capital Forex”, were allegedly involved in many shoddy deals. Floated in 2015, both firms had failed to file tax returns and other formalities and the ED suspects these firms were floated for alleged money laundering and hawala transactions. During investigation, the ED has also found that there is close link between the smuggling and psychedelic drug cases. Earlier in the day opposing the bail application of three other accused in smuggling case the ED said there was a close link between the two cases. It also said it needs to question 20 more people including some influential personalities in connection with the gold smuggling. There are reports that Mohammad allegedly played a key role in smuggling drugs like LSD and MDMA into Kerala and he was close to many film actors. Officials now suspect that he was also instrumental in bringing Russian musician Vasily Markelov aka Psykovsky who was arrested from a star hotel in Kochi in 2015 during a rave party. The musician was allegedly found possessing a psychedelic drug named “Russian Secret,” believed to be a concoction of substances like hashish and marijuana. Later, the NCB found that the sample seized from the musician was tampered before it was sent to chemical examination. The seized drug later turned out to be “milk powder”. There were also reports that a person who gave a statement to the police mentioning Mohammad’s role was later forced to change his statement. The music event was conducted by a Bengaluru-based event management group. Many names cropped up then but later the case was hushed up. Meanwhile, the NIA has raided a gold ornaments manufacturing unit in Coimbatore in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and detained its owner J Nandagopal. It also seized gold ornaments and cash from the unit. Some of the arrested had told the agency that a portion of the smuggled gold was brought there to convert into ornaments, a senior official said. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment in the name of the United Arab Emirates consular office in Thiruvananthapuram. And the drug surfaced on August 28 after the arrest of Anoop Mohammad and two others. Now the investigating agencies feel there is a strong link between the two cases. A rape and cheating case is pending against Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s elder son Binoy Kodiyeri in Mumbai. A former bar dancer in Dubai hailing from Maharashtra had filed a police compliant against him alleging rape, cheating and breach of trust. A court in Mumbai had ordered him to undergo a DNA test to prove the woman’s charge that he fathered her child. When this case cropped up the party came to Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s rescue saying “parents can’t be blamed for a grown up’s doings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-ed-interrogates-kerala-cpi-m-secretary-s-son-for-11-hours/story-fjWwGIwiQrOn96czqSdImI.html
10-09-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan to dial Uddhav Thackeray over oxygen supply issue||Madhya Pradesh chief minister (CM) Shivraj Singh Chouhan will dial his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray over the latter’s decision to limit the outsourcing of oxygen outside the state.In view of the increasing number of Covid patients, the Maharashtra government, in its order dated September 7, has directed the oxygen production units in the state that 80% of their production will be used only for medical treatment and it will be supplied to hospitals within its territory, said an official. As per the order, the production units in Maharashtra can divert only up to 20% of oxygen generated to industrial use, said the official. He said at least 15 districts of Madhya Pradesh, including Indore and Bhopal, have oxygen supplied from oxygen production units in Maharashtra besides the local supply.Indore and Bhopal are big Covid hotspots and the number of patients is increasing by the day across the state. Maharashtra government’s decision came when the state government in Madhya Pradesh was considering increasing 3700 beds with oxygen and 564 ICU beds in the state. Home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will talk to Maharashtra CM in regard to supply of the oxygen.”State home minister said plants in Madhya Pradesh will be told to increase capacity, underscoring coronavirus patients will not suffer.“Treatment of the Covid patients will not be affected. We will ensure there is an increase in production of oxygen in the plants in MP by increasing their capacity and we may consider reducing the use of oxygen in the Industrial sector to meet the demand if need arises,” Health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-to-dial-uddhav-thackeray-over-oxygen-supply-issue/story-wmEutAiOOzy9vFkeDOudDP.html
10-09-2020||India||Another testing high as Covid-19 cases breach 200k in Delhi||Delhi on Wednesday conducted a record number of daily tests for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and consequently reported its highest single-day cases as the tally of infections in the city crossed 200,000, making it the only city in India to breach this mark.The Capital – the first Covid-19 hot spot city in the country to control the spread of the virus, but which has seen an increase in the number of cases in the past two weeks – reported 4,039 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of infections to 201,174.The Delhi government conducted a record 54,517 tests for Covid-19 on Wednesday. This was the sixth time in seven days that the city set a new record for daily tests, a statistic that highlights the magnitude of the increase in testing. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith 11,101 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the most accurate method of diagnosing Covid-19, Delhi also set a record for the highest number of single-day RT-PCR tests. The previous record was set a day ago, when Delhi conducted 9,944 such tests. Delhi’s resurgence of cases had prompted Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 26 to announce the ramping up of testing to 40,000 daily samples to track, and isolate as many cases as possible. As of Wednesday, the Capital has reported nearly 40,430 more infections than Mumbai, which has the second highest number of infections and 56,579 cases more than Chennai on the third spot. In total, Mumbai has reported 160,744 cases and Chennai has 144,595 infections till Wednesday night. All figures are according to the health bulletins issued by their respective state authorities. At the same time, however, Delhi has tested 100,198 per million of its population as compared to 40,032 in Maharashta and 73,252 in Tamil Nadu (updated individual figures of Mumbai and Chennai are not available).These three metropolitan cities, which were the initial hot spots of the virus in the country, remain the ones with the biggest concentration of infections (and deaths).To be sure, the district of Pune has more cases (212,563), than these three cities. However, only 119,291 of those are from the city of Pune and the remaining are from surrounding areas such as Pimpri-Chinchwad that fall outside of city boundaries.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet on Tuesday: “Today, Delhi reported the highest number of cases – 4,039. But it also conducted the highest number of tests – 54,517 against 15,000-20,000 tests till last week. If we were conducting the same number of tests (as last week), today’s cases would be fewer than 1,500. So, don’t be scared by the number of cases.”On the back of the increased testing, the positivity rate in the city has again started dropping. Of the tests conducted on Wednesday, 7.4% came back positive. The average positivity rate, which had dropped from a peak of 31.4% in mid-June to 5.7% at the end of July, had been climbing again and was at 9% on September 1. In the past week, this has dropped to 8.2%. Overall, 10.6% of all tests done in Delhi have come back positive.Experts said the dropping positivity rate is a good indicator for the city despite the rise in cases.“A good indicator to see if a government is testing enough is to look at the positivity rate in the city. If the positivity rate is increasing then that means that there is increased transmission of the virus in the community. In Delhi’s case this has been going down recently, which is a good sign. I will be happy if this drops below 5% for a period of two week, which is what the World Health Organization said is the threshold to show that the transmission of the virus is under control,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-testing-high-as-cases-breach-200k/story-TVCECTiXaHTNa5X4wO55sJ.html
10-09-2020||India||India bulks up amid provocation by China’s People’s Liberation Army||The Indian Army has rushed its front-line tanks and infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) to strategic heights held by its soldiers on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, in response to intimidating military moves by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the theatre, where conflict is below the threshold of a shooting war but could take any trajectory, top government officials told HT on Wednesday. The PLA is parading its tank squadrons, mechanised infantry squads, and thousands of soldiers in the area in a show of strength to threaten the Indian Army after it swiftly occupied key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on August 29, the officials said, requesting anonymity. The Chinese PLA has deployed 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers in the area, and the armed forces are fully prepared to deal with any contingency, they added.Also read: Bridging the power gap with China“The PLA lines up 20-30 tanks, ICVs and thousands of soldiers almost on a daily basis in the Spanggur area. It’s nothing but posturing and we would be concerned if the military elements were not visible and hidden in the undulating folds of the land,” a top official said. China has deployed sizeable military assets in the eastern Ladakh theatre, including 50,000 troops, 150 aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems, with India matching the neighbour’s every move. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, the officials said. “Indian soldiers are barely a few hundred metres from Chinese troops on Finger 4,” they said. “If the military capabilities were to be measured, the combat ratio is 1:1. If China brings in more reinforcements, so will we. The Galwan Valley skirmish showed them that they have to pay a price for their actions. If China wants to start a war, there will be a price to pay on both sides,” the officials said. “A shooting war doesn’t erupt overnight. A lot of actions happen before that — war of words, firing, skirmishes, smaller conflicts and other pinpricks. We haven’t reached that stage yet. While we don’t think China wants to start a war, nowhere are we underprepared,” the officials said.The movements come at a time when Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on Thursday to seek a diplomatic resolution for the impasse.The Indian Army on Tuesday said Chinese troops fired into the air on September 7 to intimidate its soldiers holding dominating heights near a strategic mountain pass in eastern Ladakh during a failed attempt to close in on a forward position controlled by India, with bullets flying at the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) for the first time in 45 years. The last recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when the PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead. Twenty Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of PLA troops were killed on June 15 in a seven-hour conflict in Galwan Valley, but no shots were fired in that deadly skirmish.Experts said the situation along the LAC was volatile and things could go bad. “The key to how things will go forward from here is whether there is a breakthrough in the talks. While both sides don’t want a shooting war, local dynamics on the ground sometimes have a life of their own. That is the real danger when thousands of soldiers are facing off,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the most significant heights being held by India on Rezang La and Reqin pass where the PLA is making desperate attempts to regain lost ground. The army has marked the perimeter of the positions held by it with barbed wire and it would not hesitate to retaliate if the PLA attempts to cross that red line, the officials said. “During talks, the PLA stresses there should be no night movement and mountain manoeuvres but does exactly the opposite on the ground. What is happening in the Ladakh theatre is being controlled by their top leadership and cannot be attributed to the exuberance of local commanders,” the officials cited in the first instance said. In the northern bank of Pangang Tso, before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are eight km apart. The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4. Top Indian and Chinese commanders are likely to hold a meeting soon to reduce military tensions in eastern Ladakh. Both sides are currently working on finalizing the date for the meeting between corps commander-ranked officers who have met several times but failed to break the deadlock. “We want talks at the military and diplomatic talks to succeed. The sense we got from the recent meeting between the Indian and Chinese defence ministers in Moscow was that the Chinese don’t want a war...But why are Chinese opening so many fronts, we don’t understand,” the officials said. The latest tensions in eastern Ladakh come days after defence minister Rajnath Singh asked China -- in a face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe in Moscow -- to strictly respect the LAC, not make attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, and work with India for complete disengagement from all friction areas in the sensitive sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bulks-up-amid-provocation-by-pla/story-cIuI9efmjTlErTkUlpNrkN.html
10-09-2020||India||Delhi’s Covid-19 cases cross 4k for first time but drop in positivity rate||On Wednesday, Delhi tested over 54,000 samples for Covid-19, setting a new record for the highest number of tests in a single day in the national capital, as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the day sought suggestions from state government hospitals on increasing the number of beds, especially in intensive care units.With 4,093 new infections on Wednesday — the highest single-day spike ever recorded in the city, the total number of cases in the city also crossed the 200,000-mark.In Wednesday’s meeting with state health officials, Kejriwal also took stock of the city’s testing strategy, after which the state health department issued an order that removed the need for a prescription to get tested for Covid-19. He urged all government officers, doctors and health care workers to encourage as many people as possible to get tested. As per Wednesday’s daily health bulletin, 54,517 samples were tested for Covid-19. Of these, 11,101 tests were conducted using the RT-PCR method — a record number for tests that are considered ‘gold standard’ for Covid-19.“If any hospital is experiencing any issues, they can directly reach me and I will extend all possible help in this regard,” Kejriwal told medical superintendents of Delhi government hospitals during the meeting, according to an official familiar with the matter.He directed all medical superintendents to further improve facilities in government hospitals. “Increasing the number of beds in hospitals was also discussed. But, it was concluded that there was no immediate need to augment the number of dedicated Covid beds in Delhi since over 8,500 beds were vacant as on Wednesday. To be sure, the chief minister has asked all medical superintendents to suggest ways in which beds can be increased — with a focus on ICU and ventilator beds,” a senior government official, who asked not to be named, said on condition of anonymity.Click here for full Covid-9 coverageOf the 14,212 Covid hospital beds in the city as on Wednesday evening according to the Delhi Corona app, over 8,500 were vacant on Wednesday. However, over half the Covid-19 ICU beds in the city were occupied. After the meeting, special secretary (health) Udit Prakash Rai issued an order simplifying testing in the Capital, and encouraging more people to get tested. “In continuation of various measures undertaken by the Delhi government to augment Covid-19 testing and to ensure that it is more accessible than ever, it has been decided that henceforth there will be no requirement of a prescription from a qualified medical practitioner for Covid-19 testing in Delhi,” the order read.Cases in Delhi rose rapidly through May and June, and started dropping by the end of June. After a steady drop in cases for around three weeks (the seven-day average of daily cases dropped to 983 as on August 4), new cases hit an upward trajectory mid-August. As on Wednesday, there are 201,174 cases in the city. Delhi had, as on Wednesday, recorded an average 3,086 cases a day over the past seven days.Kejriwal on Wednesday also directed heads of all private labs in Delhi against denying anybody a Covid-19 test. He also directed ambulance services that no calls from patients be refused and that patients be transferred to hospitals if needed, as soon as possible. “The Corona app should display all information regarding the number of beds and ventilators well-within time to prevent panic among patients. Officers should ensure that all state and central government SOPs be enforced strictly, and there should be no complacency regarding the same,” the chief minister said at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cases-cross-4k-for-first-time-but-drop-in-positivity-rate/story-yPedtZX1NjCCpBYyKwBOFP.html
10-09-2020||India||Supreme Court sends Maratha quota matter to larger bench||The Supreme Court on Wednesday imposed an interim stay on quotas in jobs and education to Marathas and referred the matter to a larger bench that is likely to examine if the controversial 2018 law, which breached the 50% apex-court mandated cap in caste-based reservation, was legal. The three-judge bench order, which evoked sharp reactions from political leaders in Maharashtra, said admissions under the quota in post-graduate courses will remain unaltered. The matter will now be placed before Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, for constitution of a larger bench. The decision came on petitions challenging the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act (SEBC Act) of 2018 that fulfilled a decades-old demand by the dominant community after a state government panel found the Marathas socially and economically backward. The law originally provided 16% quota but in June 2019, the Bombay high court trimmed the quantum of the quota to 12% in education and 13% in jobs, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission. In its order, the high court upheld the legislation’s constitutional validity and said the 50% cap can be breached in exceptional circumstances, and if the quota was based on quantifiable data. Soon after, petitioners moved the top court and contended that the law breached the 50% reservation threshold prescribed in the 1992 Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case. As that case was decided by a bench of nine judges, various parties sought reference of the case to a bench of 11 judges to conclusively settle the issue. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, said, on August 26, that the case will have to be heard by a Constitution bench as it involved substantial legal questions relating to reservation threshold. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for an applicant supporting the law, had also demanded an 11-judge bench. “The matter has to go before a 11-judge bench. 50% criterion was evolved through judicial decision making. 85 percent (people) in Maharashtra belong to backward classes,” Sibal told the bench on August 26. He also submitted that reservation in 28 states exceed the 50% threshold after the Parliament introduced 10% reservation to Economically Weaker sections (EWS) by amending the Constitution in 2019. In Maharashtra, many politicians said they were taken aback by the decision. Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan said the decision was “unexpected and shocking”. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called it a “black day” for Marathas. “The MVA [Maha Vikas Aghadi] could not ensure the reservation held ground before the Supreme Court,” state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil told reporters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sends-maratha-quota-matter-to-larger-bench/story-BUUNZwMrVyRj3SJj0BLf5N.html
10-09-2020||India||Telangana govt introduces bills to simplify land deals, seeks to revamp revenue administration||The Telangana government on Wednesday introduced landmark legislations in the assembly, seeking to overhaul the revenue administration by simplifying agriculture and non-agricultural land transactions, preventing land encroachments and eradicating corruption at the grassroot level. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao introduced the Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Bill 2020 and the Telangana Abolition of the Posts of Village Revenue Officers Bill 2020, and state municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao introduced the Telangana Municipal Laws Amendment Bill 2020 and Panchayat Raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao introduced the Telangana Panchayat Raj Amendment Bill 2020. “The overall philosophy of the four bills is to bring about revolutionary reforms in land administration, though first two bills are related to the revenue department and the others are concerned with municipal administration and panchayat raj departments,” the chief minister said. Making an elaborate presentation on the bills in the House, KCR said the state government had taken up a comprehensive survey of available lands in the state, including agriculture lands, government lands, forest lands, private lands and lands assigned to the landless poor. “Every inch of the land will be surveyed and digitised along with longitudes and latitudes in the newly created Dharani portal of the state government, so that there is no possibility of one person encroaching the other’s lands. The details of all government lands and assigned lands will be locked in the portal and will not be unlocked for registrations and mutation by individuals who try to encroach them,” he said. He said an estimated 90 lakh properties in local bodies had already been digitised to carry out transactions digitally in Dharani portal. The entire land or property data will be available online and thus, preventing unauthorised or illegal transactions,” he explained. For safety and security of the database in Dharani, the state government would install multiple servers at multiple places as part of a backup mechanism and disaster management technology, he said. The chief minister said the discretionary powers of officials in registering the land and properties had been removed in the new legislations. “As many as 590 tehsildars (block revenue officials) across the state will hereafter function as joint sub-registrars as well and do registration and mutation of agriculture lands at the same time. The registration and mutation of non-agriculture lands will be done by existing 141 sub-registrars,” he said. The entire registration process will be carried out digitally and people can visit the offices of the tehsildar-cum-sub-registrar only for once. “The entire registration process will be completed within an hour after submitting necessary documents and land records will be updated on the portal real time,” he said. The chief minister said people won’t have to run around offices for certificates like encumbrance certificates, income certificates or caste certificates, which could be downloaded from the portal straightaway. The government was also contemplating incorporation of family tree details of every household in the portal so as to avoid disputes in deciding the legal heirs of properties. KCR further announced that there would be no revenue courts hereafter and all the magisterial powers of tehsildars, revenue divisional officers and joint collectors to deal with the land disputes would be withdrawn. “If at all there is any land dispute, people could go to civil courts. As of now, around 16,000 cases are pending before these courts. They will be settled by fast-track tribunals,” he said. The new legislations also seek to abolish the posts of Village Revenue Officers (VROs) and Village Revenue Assistants (VRAs), the chief minister clarified that about 20,000 VRAs will be given scale posts in different government departments as per their qualification. Similarly, about 5,480 VROs will be accommodated in different departments, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-introduces-bills-to-simplify-land-deals-seeks-to-revamp-revenue-administration/story-DVCG0TQqdaNJk6tgAYcUYP.html

10-09-2020||India||BJP, Shiv Sena lock horns over support to Kangna Ranaut||After the Mumbai civic body demolished parts of an office owned by actor Kangana Ranaut, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) backed the film star in the midst of a raging political debate on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena said the BJP’s support to Rananut was a conspiracy against Mumbai as well as the state. Sharad Pawar, a leader of Sena ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), said there was no need to take Ranaut seriously.Devendra Fadnavis, a former chief minister and a BJP leader, termed the Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s action against Ranaut’s office as “state-sponsored terrorism”. “While one cannot support the statement made against Mumbai police or Maharashtra (by Ranaut), one cannot support such action by the government...Until yesterday, this construction was legal. You take action and point to illegalities only because someone spoke about you. Then what about other illegal constructions in the city?” he asked in a video message.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Pawar said he had no information about the legality of the construction in question. “I read about it only in the newspapers. It won’t be appropriate to comment on this without having proper information. Illegal work is not a new thing in Mumbai. However, BMC’s action in the backdrop of the ongoing situation (when Rananut is locked in verbal spat with the Sena) allows people to raise doubts over it. BMC officials have their own rules and may have found it appropriate to take the action,” he said.“We are giving too much importance to the people making such statements. One must understand the impact of such statements on the people at large,” Pawar added.The Sena, meanwhile, took on the Union home ministry for providing Y-plus security to actor Ranaut two days ago, calling it an insult to Mumbai and its police. In an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Wednesday, the party alleged that the BJP’s support to the actor looked like a “conspiracy”.“There is always a danger to Mumbai because those who support disrespect to ‘Mumbadevi’ are sitting in Delhi and in Maharashtra’s assembly…First, defame Mumbai, then weaken it. Make Mumbai completely bankrupt and then, one day, separate it from Maharashtra. It is clearly seen that these steps are being taken again,” the Saamana editorial said.The Sena mouthpiece added that the Maharashtra unit of BJP should not have supported the ones who referred to the chief minister in a disrespectful manner.Vivekanand Gupta, an advocate and a BJP leader, said: “BMC cannot demolish any property in view of the Covid-19 situation.” He added that the Bombay high court, on March 26, put a restriction on carrying out demolition drives during lockdown and that the scope of the order was extended till September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sena-lock-horns-over-support-to-actor/story-qb2nC3vgqngCBEuTcTnj9M.html

10-09-2020||India||Kangana-Shiv Sena face-off escalates with BMC demolition||The Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday demolished parts of an office owned by Kangana Ranaut, who then hit out at Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray in a rare confrontation between a member of the film industry and a political party that also unfolded in angry street demonstrations and a courtroom battle. The drama began around 10am after a team of 30 workers and officials of the BMC reached Ranaut’s office in Bandra’s Pali Hill and began the demolition of some areas inside and on the exterior of the premises, which the agency said was built illegally. A lawyer representing the 33-year-old actor, whose run-ins with the Maharashtra government in the aftermath of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June have taken an acerbic turn this month, approached the Bombay high court challenging a BMC notice that gave her 24 hours to reply to allegations of zoning law violations.Also read: Kangana Ranaut hits out at ‘Fancy feminists, Bullywood activists’, says ‘You deserve the treatment you get from me’The court ordered the demolition to stop. “The manner in which BMC proceeded to commence demolition work prima facie does not appear to be bonafide (in good faith) and smacks of malafide (dishonest intentions),” a division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla said after a 55-minute hearing over video conference.By then, much of the demolition had already taken place. Section 354A of the MMC Act, 1888, authorises BMC to demolish an illegal construction if a response is not satisfactory. Ranaut, who had sought seven days to respond to the BMC’s notice, denies any illegal construction.Throughout the day, Ranaut directed a tirade at the state government, first in a series of tweets likening the demolitions to “fascism” and “death of democracy” as she took a flight from Manali to Mumbai, where hordes of angry Shiv Sena workers protested at the airport. Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Shweta appalled at demolition of Kangana Ranaut’s office: ‘What kind of gunda raj is this?’“My home was demolished today; your arrogance will crumble tomorrow. Remember, this is the wheel of time. It keeps changing,” the actor said in a video message addressing Thackeray late in the afternoon. In the video, she also said she realised the pain of Kashmiri Pandits, who had to leave their homes, after the demolition drive on her premises. “Not only on Ayodhya, I will also make a film on Kashmir,” she said. Arvind Sawant, Shiv Sena parliamentarian and party spokesperson, denied commenting on Ranaut’s video clip. “Only Uddhavji, or if required Sanjay Raut, or will speak on this matter,” a senior party leader said. Raut could not be reached for comments. The acrimony between the government and the actor stems from her criticism of the Mumbai police and the state’s handling of the Rajput death investigation. The remarks prompted Raut to advise the actor not to return to Mumbai, prompting a series of tit-for-tat responses that at one occasion involved the MP using expletives for the actor, who in turn referred the country’s financial capital as “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir” and “Pakistan”.The controversy has taken larger political tone, with the Congress accusing her of carrying forward the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s political agenda. Ranaut got Y-plus security from the BJP-ruled Centre two days ago in the midst of her spat with Sena leaders, a decision that the Maharashtra government termed “surprising” even as the actor thanked home minister Amit Shah on Twitter.On Tuesday, the state ordered a probe into allegations that she consumed drugs. The building at the heart of the fresh controversy is Manikarnika Films Private Limited office, located in Bungalow Number 5, a ground plus two-storey structure, in the plush Bandra area. Ranaut bought it in 2017 for Rs 200 crore.According to civic officials, it has existed in their records since the 1970s and Ranaut made illegal alterations to it. The row first broke out on Monday after a BMC team visited Ranaut’s office and carried out an inspection. The next day, BMC issued pasted the show-cause notice on the gate of the property. According to Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiqui, BMC officials on Wednesday carried on with the demolition work, which finally ended around 12:30pm, even as the court hearing was underway. The HC was expected to take up the matter again on Thursday afternoon. “We carried out demolition work over structural violations...After the demolition process, further action will be taken legally,” said Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s H west ward covering Bandra. Another BMC official, who did not want to be named, said, “We have taken the action legally, and we will inform the court on Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-shiv-sena-face-off-escalates-with-bmc-demolition/story-CXGtvPoCfQiVSpg9n0pRoK.html
10-09-2020||India||Amid border row, India’s Jaishankar to meet his Chinese counterpart today||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi are set to come face-to-face at least three times in Moscow on Thursday, with the focus on a bilateral meeting that is being seen as key to reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Jaishankar and Wang will participate in a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Thursday morning, to be followed by a luncheon meeting of foreign ministers of the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping. The day will be capped by the bilateral meeting, the first between Jaishankar and Wang since the standoff in Ladakh sector began in May. The two leaders spoke on phone on June 17, two days after the deadly clash in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. Ahead of his departure for Russia on Tuesday, Jaishankar emphasised the need for political contacts to reduce tensions and end the stalemate in the disengagement process along the LAC. The standoff goes against all understandings on border management dating back to 1993 and the serious situation calls for “very deep conversations...at a political level”, he said. Also read: Bridging the power gap with ChinaWang will hold bilateral meetings and attend the luncheon meeting for the Chinese, Russian and Indian foreign ministers, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a news briefing in Beijing. Asked specifically about the bilateral meeting between Jaishankar and Wang, he declined to go into details. “During [the SCO] meeting...Wang Yi will discuss with foreign ministers of other member states of the SCO cooperation amid Covid-19 and exchange views on major international and regional issues,” Zhao said. The RIC meeting between Jaishankar, Wang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov assumes significance as Moscow has pushed for dialogue between New Delhi and Beijing to ease the border tensions. Given its good ties with India and China, Russia also doesn’t want to be forced into taking sides, experts said. Roman Babushkin, the Russian deputy chief of mission, said on Tuesday his country wasn’t directly mediating between India and China but was “focusing on the creation of a positive atmosphere through SCO, Brics and RIC for practical cooperation”. He added: “Any kind of dialogue would be better than escalation.” The SCO charter has no scope for discussing bilateral disputes, though the grouping is a “comfortable platform” for building common ground and mutual trust, he said. Babushkin noted that defence minister Rajnath Singh had met his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe on the sidelines of another SCO meeting in Moscow last week. Russia, he said, will encourage outcomes that give impetus to further de-escalation and disengagement. “We are very hopeful that, sooner rather than later, India and China would find a mutually acceptable solution for the border crisis,” he said. The latest face-off on the south bank of Pangong Lake, during which shots were fired along the LAC for the first time in 45 years, have complicated efforts to lower the temperature along the disputed border. The Chinese side has been rattled by India’s proactive action of taking a string of strategic heights since the weekend. India has said Chinese troops tried to close in on a forward position on Monday and fired in the air when they were dissuaded. The Chinese side pushed back again on Wednesday, with people familiar with developments saying Indian troops had “illegally” crossed the LAC, “made provocations” and were the “first to open fire without justified reason”. Experts believe the meeting between Jaishankar and Wang is unlikely to result in an immediate breakthrough, though it could set the stage for further political engagements to end the standoff. Jaishankar is the longest serving Indian envoy to Beijing, where he served for four-and-half years from 2009, and has known Wang for a long time. Wang Dehua, a South Asia expert at Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said: “After Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh’s meeting in Moscow, the meeting of the foreign ministers is of great significance as it is conducive to ease the tension along the border while helping to reset relations. Perhaps, it will prompt an early meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-india-china-meet-today/story-py91GfZdwUaFMZNsfsDJfL.html
10-09-2020||India||Global CO2 emissions to fall by up to 7% in 2020 due to Covid-19||Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to fall by 4% to 7% in 2020 due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown and associated slowdown, according to a United in Science 2020 report released by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres on Wednesday.During the peak of Covid-19 lockdown in early April, the daily global CO2 emissions dropped to 2006 levels falling by 17% compared to 2019. By early June however daily fossil fuel CO2 emissions returned to within 5% below 2019 levels.The exact decline in CO2 emissions this year will depend on the trajectory of the pandemic and government responses to address it, the report said.The Energy Review 2020 by the International Energy Agency released in April also had similar estimates. It had said that global CO2 emissions are expected to decline by 8%, or almost 2.6 gigatonnes (Gt), to levels of 10 years ago due to massive fall in energy demand and economic shock this year. Such a year-on year reduction in CO2 emissions would be the largest ever, six times larger than the fall recorded after the 2008 financial crisis and twice as large as all previous reductions since world war II.But this dip in CO2 emissions hasn’t made any impact on global CO2 concentrations. Independent experts said the Covid-19 lockdown should be a learning for the world on how it could reduce emissions in coming years but ensuring that the economy is not disrupted.The world is set to see its warmest five years on record and is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement targets to keep global temperature increase well below 2 degree C or at 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels, the report drafted by multiple agencies including World Meteorological Organization, Global Carbon Project, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission said on Wednesday.Atmospheric CO2 concentrations made new records in 2020. For example, benchmark stations in the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) network reported CO2 concentrations above 410 parts per million (ppm) during the first half of 2020, with Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) at 414.38 ppm and 410.04 ppm, respectively, in July 2020, up from 411.74 ppm and 407.83 ppm in July 2019.“Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise. Meanwhile, large swathes of Siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heatwave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic climate change. And now 2016–2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. This report shows that whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,” said WMO Secretary-General, Professor Petteri Taalas.The Emissions Gap Report of 2019 referred to by the United in Science report has said that the cuts in global emissions required per year from 2020 to 2030 are about 3% to meet the 2 degree C target and more than 7% per year on average to meet the 1.5 degree C goal under the Paris Agreement.The average global temperature for 2016–2020 is expected to be the warmest on record, about 1.1 degree C above pre-industrial levels and 0.24 degree C warmer than the global average temperature for 2011-2015, the report added.The Covid 19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the global observing systems, which, in turn, have affected the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services, the report said.“This has been an unprecedented year for people and the planet. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted lives worldwide. At the same time, the heating of our planet and climate disruption has continued apace. Never before has it been so clear that we need long-term, inclusive, clean transitions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve sustainable development,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said in the foreword of the report.Climate scientists said a temporary fall in emissions will not make a difference to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. “Carbon dioxide has a long life-time. So even if we stop all emission right now, the CO2 in the atmosphere will remain for several hundreds of years. Around 40% of the CO2 emitted now will remain even after 100 years, and 20% will remain even after a thousand years. This is why a temporary reduction in daily emissions has not changed the climate scenario. The damage is already done. What we are trying to do is stop it from worsening further,” explained Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“Covid-19 led lockdowns across geographies resulted in temporary reduction in emissions, which will have very little impact on long term CO2 trajectory. We should take this period as a learning and continue to keep the emissions down over coming years under the slower than expected demand and through aggressive transition to cleaner and sustainable forms of energy such as renewables,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-co2-emissions-to-fall-by-up-to-7-in-2020-due-to-covid-19/story-MqZbfdpC7VR9mAfr3wXmvO.html
10-09-2020||India||First Indira Gandhi Chair for environmental sciences set up||The Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust on Wednesday set up the first Indira Gandhi Chair in Environmental Sciences in collaboration with Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies to commemorate two of the former prime minister’s passions — ecology and science. “I recall that she (Indira Gandhi) established the ministry of environment in November 1980 and she remained its cabinet minister until her death four years later,” Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said at the launch. “All through her tenure in this position distinguished scientists served as secretaries in the ministry.” Sonia Gandhi also added that Indira Gandhi was drawn to the natural habitat. “Throughout her life Indira Gandhi was fascinated by and drawn to Nature in all its aspects. ..The Silent Valley decision is perhaps the most telling example,” said Gandhi, referring to a decision by the former PM in 1983 to call off a hydroelectric project in the national park in Kerala. She also emphasised the personal commitment of Indira Gandhi to protect wildlife, preserve forests and combat air and water pollution. “A number of conservation programmes for endangered species, in which we now take pride, were conceived of and launched because of her personal concern and involvement. And when the world had not yet discovered the value and virtue of environmental protection, she was the only Prime Minister to address the first ever UN Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in June 1972,” Sonia said. “Today, more than ever before, we need that courage and resolve,” she added. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also present at the launch. “Her years as Prime Minister are peppered with path-breaking initiatives in the realm of science and technology. While ISRO was already in fledgling existence and the cooperative milk movement had started earlier, it was she who pushed the space programme and the white revolution to new heights. Who can forget the moment when Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut, told her that from outer space, India appeared to him as “sare jehan se achcha”,” he said. He added that environmental sciences were “gaining in urgency as we witness global warming and numerous environment-related challenges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-indira-gandhi-chair-for-environmental-sciences-set-up/story-FAJDGlU6Er0GedRHq9zJ5H.html
10-09-2020||India||RBI seeks exemption from data protection law||The Reserve Bank of India has sought exemption from the country’s proposed Personal Data Protection Law for its regulatory, policy, and supervisory functions, and also does not want financial data of individuals to be classified as sensitive personal data, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the law is yet to be finalised. “We would request that the monetary, regulatory and supervisory functions of the RBI as well as its role as the operator of payment systems may be exempt from the purview of the Bill,” the central bank said in a note, the contents of which have been reviewed by HT. And treading financial data as sensitive personal data may may have a “dampening effect” on India’s efforts at financial inclusion, it added. Both are in keeping with international norms.For instance, the UK and Europe’s data protection laws exempt central banks from their purview, and also do not classify financial data as sensitive personal data; only biometric and health data, and such things as sexual orientation, religious beliefs, union membership and political opinion are classified as sensitive personal data in these countries. The latter require special and extra security while processing. Indeed, in its note, RBI has cited the exemption provided to the Bank of England from the UK’s personal data protection act and a similar exemption to the central bank in Malaysia: “We would request that the monetary, regulatory and supervisory functions of RBI as well as its role as the operator of payment systems may be exempt from the purview of the Bill.”A banker said that RBI routinely deals with lots of data on banks and financial institutions in its role as a regulator and supervisor. It has data on senior bank employees; it has data on the clients of banks; and much of this is needed to ensure compliance, prevent frauds, and ensure the smooth running of the system, this person added, asking not to be named. The banking regulator has also gone a step further and suggested that instead of the Central government, “sectoral regulators be given the power to classify personal data as critical.” Any critical data, according to the proposed act, can be processed only in India. Objecting to classification of financial data as sensitive personal data , RBI’s note maintained that this would lead to higher compliance and explicit consent, which “would translate to increase in costs for providing services to customers. Financial inclusion efforts rely on lower service charges for offering basic banking services. The increase in costs would compel banks to increase the charges associated with offering banking services.”RBI’s note also pointed out that countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy do not make such a classification. Privacy experts said the RBI cannot legally claim an exemption from the obligations that stem from the 2017 Supreme Court ruling as the Puttuswamy judgment, which upheld privacy as a fundamental right for Indian citizens. “What the bill does is flesh out that right in terms of the actual actions that need to be done. Even if the PDP (personal data protection) bill does not apply to them, they can still be held liable under the Puttuswamy judgment,” said Rahul Matthan, partner-lawyer at the law firm Trilegal and author of Privacy 3.0.“Provisions of the PDP bill are clarificatory in nature to explain principles of minimisations and proportionality,” he added.The Personal Data Protection bill, introduced in Indian Parliament in 2019, aims to create the first legal framework to protect privacy of the country’s citizens after it was held as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in 2017. In the digital landscape where data is the key asset, the bill lays down the obligations of entities or data fiduciaries handling personal data and the rights that the owners of the data (termed as data principals). In the bill, financial data, in addition to biometrics and information about health, gender, genetics etc, is defined as sensitive personal data on which certain strict rules on consent, processing and storage apply. For instance, any entity dealing with sensitive personal data has the onus to prove that consent was obtained in an informed manner and that it will have the legal obligation in case the consent is withdrawn by the data principal. The banking regulator underlined that the data retention period mandated by the bill is not in alignment with the RBI circulars on data storage. These mandate that if processing is done abroad, payment data should be deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India within 24 hours.“For cross-border transactions, RBI has allowed storage of copy of payment data abroad. In case of banks, especially foreign banks, RBI has also allowed storage of banking data abroad. But the provisions of the bill do not enable such storage,” the note said.Pointing out that Clause 33(2) empowers the Centre to classify personal data as critical and mandate its processing exclusively within India, RBI argued, “This will take away Reserve Bank’s power to say what data can be stored and processed in India.”Seeking exemptions for its functions from the proposed legislation, RBI pointed out that it works towards the grater objectives of ensuring monetary and financial stability, strengthening banking and non-banking system and regulating payment process. “The personal data collected by RBI is incidental to the functions and not for deriving any commercial gain,” it said.It also said that data is collected by regulated entities and not directly by RBI and as “data fiduciaries, the entities themselves would have met the obligations towards data principals.”It further stated that as the owner and operator of RTGS and NEFT, India’s key payment routes, “it would not be practical for RBI to give notice, obtain consent etc, in carrying out the payment system actively.” RBI has suggested that clauses may be amended to exclude regulatory statues such as RBI Act, the Banking Regulation Act, Payment and Settlement System Act from the overriding reach of the data protection law.The bill does have exemptions that allow personal data to be processed for protecting national security, pursing investigations and complying with court orders, and for journalistic purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-seeks-exemption-from-data-protection-law/story-kwQzNs614s0C56VK6HTCJP.html

When the man came to meet the woman on Monday night, her family caught hold of him and locked him up in a room, the police added.The ‘sabhasad’ (representative of the ward) is among those taken into custody, superintendent of police (Kushinagar) Vinod Kumar Mishra said.“A video of Hata area of the district went viral on social media which shows that a woman and a man were made to wear a garland of shoes and with blackened faces they were paraded in the village. Police have taken cognisance of the matter and 12 people, including the ‘sabhasad’, have been taken into custody,” he said.“Police are interrogating them. Strict action will be taken against the culprit,” the SP added.The representative of the local ward Hamid Ansari allegedly directed his associates to beat them, blacken their faces and forced them to march in the lanes of the locality. During interrogation, Ansari gave information about his associates and local residents involved in parading the couple, said station house officer (Hata police station) Gyanendra Kumar Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couple-in-love-garlanded-with-shoes-paraded-in-up-village-cops/story-wqAythdOh4I4aQOw0AKLAP.html
10-09-2020||India||Pick Lok Sabha deputy speaker, says Opposition||A day after the Congress proposed fielding a joint opposition candidate for the post of the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson, opposition parties have started demanding that the Lok Sabha fill the post of deputy speaker, a position lying vacant since the Narendra Modi government came to power for its second term in May 2019. Congress Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Chowdhury wrote a letter to speaker Om Birla and Trinamool Congress’s Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien penned a blog criticising the Modi government for not appointing a deputy speaker. “According to constitutional mandate the seat of the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha should be filled either by election or consensus as early as may after a new Lok Sabha is constituted,” Chowdhury wrote in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT. Chowdhury noted that the Rajya Sabha is on the verge of electing a deputy chairman, emphasising that it was an “opportune moment” to elect the deputy speaker of the lower house.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government has not yet indicated if it wants to appoint a deputy speaker during the monsoon session that begins on September 14 with a packed schedule of legislative business and debates. O’Brien attacked the government for the delay in the appointment. “What does one say when a government with a comfortable majority has managed to do something which hasn’t been done since 1952 – take 450 days to elect a Deputy Speaker? That is six months more than what has ever been taken,” he wrote in his blog. O’Brien pointed out that the post of deputy speaker “usually is given to the principal opposition party in the Lok Sabha.”“This trend started in the 6th Lok Sabha of 1977 when the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai of the Janata Party offered the post to the Opposition, making Godey Murahari of the Congress the Deputy Speaker. The post has also been given out to allies in the 7th Lok Sabha of 1980 and the 8th Lok Sabha of 1984,” O’Brien pointed out.The Trinamool leader also lashed out at “the BJP’s aversion to letting the Opposition create any space for itself in parliament.”“It gets worse with every passing session. Question Hour has been cancelled with sloppy excuses being made. Zero Hour in the forthcoming monsoon session has now been reduced from 60 to 30 minutes (might as well rename it Zero Half Hour!). Many other parliamentary practices and precedents have been set aside by an arrogant government which is slowly weakening every great institution,” O’Brien wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pick-rs-dy-chairperson-says-oppn/story-pGnpUjgEIXWa9Mkc3fofGL.html
10-09-2020||India||To enhance combat potential, IAF to formally induct Rafale jets in Ambala today||The Indian Air Force will formally induct the Rafale fighter jets at the Ambala air base on Thursday in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Florence Parly, the IAF said in a statement on Wednesday. Five Rafales of the 36 ordered by the IAF arrived at the Ambala airbase on July 29, ending the IAF’s agonizing wait for new fighter jets to sharpen its combat potential. While IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and other senior officials welcomed the Rafales and the pilots on their arrival, a formal induction ceremony is being held now. These Rafale jets are part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the ‘Golden Arrows’. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, defence secretary Ajay Kumar and Defence Research and Development Organisation chief G Satheesh Reddy are among the dignitaries attending the ceremony. Dassault Aviation chairman Eric Trappier will also be present. Rafales are manufactured by Dassault Aviation. “At Ambala, the programme will include ceremonial unveiling of the Rafale aircraft, a traditional ‘Sarva Dharma Puja’, air display by Rafale and Tejas aircraft as well as by the Sarang helicopter aerobatic team,” the IAF statement said. After the ceremonial events, the Indian and French delegations will hold a bilateral meeting, it added. The next batch of three to four Rafale jets is expected to reach Ambala from France in October followed by a third batch in December, officials said. All deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a government-to-government deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. India’s new Rafale fighters will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the air force and prove to be a game changer with their advanced weaponry, high-tech sensors, superior radar for detection and tracking of targets and ability to carry an impressive payload, experts previously told Hindustan Times. The Rafale weaponry includes Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles --- weapons that allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-enhance-combat-potential-iaf-to-formally-induct-rafale-jets-in-ambala-today/story-xAqd6K0n7pX2BNlogvcSWL.html
10-09-2020||India||Kashmir poised for a saffron surge||As the monsoon recedes over North India, the flatlands in Pampore, the picturesque part of South Kashmir ringed by the Khrew mountain range, buzzes to life with farmers readying their fields for the saffron crop that flowers by mid-October. Their hopes for a high yield and better prices are already blossoming this season thanks to the state-of-the-art Spice Park at Dusoo in the saffron hub of Pulwama district. The centre will receive its first lot of fresh flowers from the fields this season. The produce will be put through a cold chain for scientific drying, processing and grading before the centre facilitates farmers to e-trade their geographical indication or GI-tagged produce on a pan-India portal. The newly commissioned facility is the first of its kind in Asia and marks a ground-breaking shift for Kashmir’s centuries-old saffron trade in which the harvest was traditionally sun-dried at home by farmers and sold in markets through middlemen. CHANGE IS IN THE AIR Pulwama, the land of saffron, annually produces 80 quintals of high-quality produce with a turnover of Rs 120 crore-Rs 140 crore. As the most expensive spice, the market price of one gram of top grade saffron can vary between Rs 250-Rs 300. Typically, a grower gets half of that as the middlemen control the market. This April, Jammu and Kashmir got the GI tag for home-grown saffron. The GI tag is a code given to a certain product that has a specific geographical location or origin. Come November and Kashmir’s saffron trade will change radically. “The GI-tag will put a stamp of originality on Kashmiri saffron and significantly enhance the farmer’s marketing reach and fetch them a far better price in the national and international markets,” says Pulwama deputy commissioner Dr Raghav Langer. Farmers too are looking forward to the change in the offing. “The GI-tag and e-auction will be a game changer,” says Abdul Majeed, chairman of the J&K Saffron Growers Development and Marketing Cooperative Association, an umbrella body representing 37,000 families into saffron cultivation. “It will benefit both farmers and consumers.” IT’S ADVANTAGE FARMERS The Rs 40-crore park has been set up as part of the National Saffron Mission, a centrally-funded Rs 410-crore project launched in 2010 to rejuvenate saffron cultivation in Kashmir. Abdul Rashid Illayee, the project manager of Spice Park, says Kashmiri saffron is considered best because of its colour, aroma and flavour. “Before the GI-tag, the saffron from Iran and Spain used to be sold under the Kashmir brand to the disadvantage of local farmers,” he said. The Spice Park can store two metric tonnes of flowers for 48 hours. After the flower’s stigma, which forms the saffron, is separated, the farmers’ produce will be coded, dried scientifically and tested in the laboratory on eight quality parameters. So far, 250 saffron growers have registered for the e-auction of their packaged GI-tagged produce to pan-India buyers. SEAL OF AUTHENTICITY The Spice Park has applied for accreditation to provide farmers access to international markets. “The traditional drying methods at the farmers’ end invariably caused contamination and loss of quality but all that will now change for the better,” says Illayee. “Saffron growers will now be able to directly sell their produce through the e-auction portal that fetches them a much better price. The GI tag is a seal of authenticity,” says Dr Inam-ur Rasool, in-charge of the e-auction. Officials say that the J&K government will fix the base price for the bidding. “Even after bidding, the base price can go up and brokers who used to take growers for a ride, will get eliminated,” says Dr Rasool. FROM RED TO SAFFRON Prior to the National Saffron Mission, Pampore’s signature crop was in the red. The rain-fed saffron belt has seen a steady decline from 5,000 hectares to 3,000 hectares in the last two decades. The reasons range from recurring droughts, absence of an irrigation system, growing urbanisation and commercial pressures on the prime saffron land on the Srinagar-Jammu highway. Due to slump in profits, many farmers switched from cultivating the delicate crop to apple orchards. Over the past decade, the project has focused on standardisation of seed (bulbs), scientific packaging and subsidised drip irrigation. This has helped rejuvenate the saffron crop and increase the area under cultivation to 3,700 hectares. Pulwama alone accounts for 3,200 hectares. BETTER YIELD EXPECTED Majeed, one of the big saffron cultivators, says most of the work under the mission is complete. “We are awaiting the testing of drip irrigation. The pipes have been laid and 104 bore wells dug, however, the irrigation system hasn’t been connected with the supply line. Once that’s done, production will increase manifold and drought won’t impact this crop,” he says. Pulwama chief agriculture officer Mohammad Qasim Ghani says that the National Saffron Mission has been extended for two years. The results are tangible in terms of the yield. “Last year, Pulwama produced 12 tonnes of saffron. This time, due to good rainfall last month, it is likely to touch 16 tonnes,” says Ghani. All eyes are on the Spice Park as Kashmir’s saffron is poised to reap rich dividends on the back of new paradigms of quality and marketing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-poised-for-a-saffron-surge/story-6Lkfur36bLOnMX2D3UcX4H.html

10-09-2020||Editorials||The battle in Indian finance||A key structural issue behind the slowdown, and now the contraction, in the Indian economy is the crisis-ridden financial sector. The challenge has only become bigger over the past decade. As pointed out by former chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, what was initially a twin-balance sheet crisis — encompassing banks and infrastructure companies — became a four-balance sheet crisis, including non-banking financial companies and real estate firms. The pandemic’s shock has made matters worse. According to the report of the KV Kamath Committee, set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to look into the restructuring of loans after the Covid-19 shock, almost 70% of banking sector debt has been affected by the shock of the pandemic.In this backdrop, the Centre’s credit guarantee scheme for micro, small and medium enterprises and RBI’s moratorium on payment of existing loans were crucial relief measures. Both these measures, however, cannot go on forever. Banks will eventually need to recover their capital. The longer this takes, the larger will be their forgone income and accumulated losses. But if the economy does not recover soon — and most experts do not believe this is unlikely to happen — businesses might not be in a position to start paying back these loans if the moratorium is revoked immediately. A rush to invoke bankruptcy proceedings against defaulters could lead to destruction of firms and, therefore, productive capacity of the economy. This policy dilemma is currently playing out in the Supreme Court. The apex court has asked banks to not declare accounts as non-performing assets until a final order is passed. The court will resume hearing on the issue on September 28. The entire issue looks like a zero-sum game at the moment; either banks or debtors will emerge victorious. However, the larger economy will continue to suffer, irrespective of which party bears the burden right now. The only meaningful resolution is to expedite an economic recovery. This will rejuvenate revenue flow and facilitate timely payment of debts. This newspaper has consistently argued that a fiscal stimulus is essential to give a boost to the economy. At the same time, RBI and banks need to make sure that due diligence is exercised while separating genuine borrowers who hold promise in the future from those who will perish in keeping with the market’s logic of creative destruction. 4||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-battle-in-indian-finance/story-NdGVsg35axZGEgBeVO2AeO.html
10-09-2020||Editorials||The evidence against Donald Trump | HT Editorial||Covid-19, which has killed at least 200,000 Americans, may still claim the presidency of Donald Trump. A new book by journalist Bob Woodward, Rage, on the Trump administration quotes the president admitting that he deliberately played down the pandemic and that he knew it was much more lethal than seasonal influenza. The book adds to other unflattering revelations about Mr Trump’s disdain for men in uniform, his belief in dictatorship and the dysfunctionality of his family in articles, interviews and books written by his former lawyer, his niece and others who have worked with him. The question is whether any of this will make a difference to his re-election campaign.Mr Trump commands the blind loyalty of about 40% of the electorate. They believe he has been good for their livelihoods. They believe he has taken on the Washington “establishment”. They also believe in his not-so-discreet White supremacist politics. But this is not enough for him to win the elections. There is a broad consensus that a middle bloc of suburban women, Hispanics and educated conservative White men — many of whom support Mr Trump on policies but dislike his personality — will determine the final result. Mr Trump’s blatant attempts to play on racial and class fears aim to bring this group back into his fold. But many, especially women, are more concerned about the pandemic. These women voted for Barack Obama, turned against Hillary Clinton, and are now leaning towards Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Mr Woodward’s revelations and the growing number of Covid-19 cases in heartland America could just tip an election that is on a knife’s edge — or the point of a hypodermic syringe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-evidence-against-donald-trump/story-L1bQudGAIJwkc8q1ZryH3I.html
