15-09-2020||News||The invisible health crisis in organisations||A plummeting economy is not the only sickness that corporate India has been battling for some time now. In 2011, a Gallup survey, conducted across millions of employees in 142 countries, revealed that less than 20% of the workforce was actively engaged in their organisations. Over 60% were disengaged and approximately 20% were actually damaging their companies. While that number may not be true for all organisations, specifically, actively engaged employees are routinely outnumbered by disengaged ones in most. Project delays, cost overruns, cumbersome processes and safety violations are all manifestations of the core reason — employee disengagement.In addition to that, experts point out that an alarming one in six Indians suffer from some form of mental health issue, with a high skew towards urban metros, where most corporates function. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India will lose $1.03 trillion between 2010 and 2030, because of mental health conditions. Indian corporates and society were inefficient and sick well before this pandemic. But here is why the two “co-morbidities” of disengagement and mental health pose an existential threat to economic recovery.There are multiple reasons for disengagement and mental health problems, and many of them are common. A lack of a sense of purpose or relevance, hyper-competitive or an intimidating work environment, multiple layers of hierarchy and a sense of helplessness are some reasons for disengagement. Lack of security, apprehensions about the future, loss of agency and overall pessimism are some causes of anxiety and depression. And these are the very aspects exacerbated by the pandemic, the economic decline, its implications and a cynical social narrative.Until recently, mental health, employee engagement and work-life balance were rolled into one “nice to have” initiative with most leaders paying lip service to it — while they created a dog-eat-dog environment in the workplace. Most organisations manage their employees by controlling their physical presence, rather than their emotional engagement. That is why being late to work is punished but being listless is not even measured. This suboptimal state might have been tolerable during good times. But in a crisis, the morale of the organisation is an existential ingredient. Disengaged and depressed troops are useless, no matter how brilliant the revival plans are. If we have to come out fighting from this economic body blow, leaders must remember that organisations are built and run by humans, not automatons. It is the morale of the employees and their active engagement which will provide the foundation of a revival — not just the latest management fad or technology platform.Steering through crises and rapidly-changing situations requires agility, the ability to innovate, and creativity. But these qualities need an environment of psychological safety. Corporates, however, have traditionally relied on “punitive” methods which deny a promised compensation, in an eventuality of failure, creating an environment where it is unsafe to fail, take initiative, be innovative or creative. As General Eisenhower famously observed: “You don’t lead by hitting people over the head. That’s assault — not leadership”. Scared troops are demoralised troops and the demoralised cannot innovate, be creative or agile.Navigating through volatility requires leaders to follow three cardinal principles, the first of which is to have as accurate a picture of the overall situation as possible. That accuracy depends on the level of candour or dissent the leader allows. A vulnerable leader gets more information, opposing views, out-of-the-box ideas and strategies that question convention. A “know-it-all” leader will be told what she wants to hear and, therefore, arrive at an incorrect situation analysis.The second step is to formulate a plan. Once again, employees operating in a psychologically-safe environment will contribute with ideas, tribal knowledge, collaborative strategies whereas those in an intimidating atmosphere will prioritise their parochial interests rather than organisational ones.And last, the plan must have the flexibility to deal with volatile changes in the ground situation, which needs a high degree of empowerment, requiring front-line leaders to have a sense of security. They need a mindset of “hope for success”, rather than a “fear of failure”.These three cardinal steps of leadership during a crisis necessitate the leader to be vulnerable, compassionate and caring. A telling example is the comparison of how countries with empathetic and vulnerable leaders fared during the pandemic compared to those with “strong” leaders.And that perhaps should be the silver lining emerging from this pandemic. A long-overdue social and professional acknowledgement of the two most debilitating and rapidly growing sicknesses of modern times — disengagement and depression and the realisation that creating an environment of psychological safety and optimism is a fundamental prerequisite to any economic recovery plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-invisible-health-crisis-in-organisations/story-xmiAGQRGvlUOjjLnlMW8LI.html
15-09-2020||News||Zhenhua Data case: How to think about Chinese surveillance||In coordinated disclosures, multiple news organisations around the world reported on Monday what they described as a widespread surveillance operation by a Chinese company.Zhenhua Data, the reports claimed, put together a database with the personal information of over two million people of public interest — politicians, celebrities, business leaders, prominent military officials and academics. In India, according to The Indian Express, these included the president, the prime minister, the Congress president and several chief ministers.The company describes its activities as “hybrid warfare” and counts among its clients, the Chinese military and intelligence. It has sold “services for military, security and foreign propaganda” to “domestic institutions” in China, including the government and security services, The Daily Telegraph noted. The data, purportedly trawled since 2017, includes biographies, family maps, and records of social media posts.The nature of this information and the way in which the company described its activities feed into larger concerns about Chinese surveillance operations on adversarial countries and their citizens. These have, at least in India, led to the banning of popular mobile apps such as TikTok and PUBG in recent months.Zhenhua Data’s activities, however, appear to be less novel or damaging than the adjectives used to describe it. Such operations are known as OSINT (open-source intelligence) gathering and analysis. The data in OSINT operations is publicly available. The novelty of the practice is in digging this data out, drawing linkages and contextualising it. Journalists have used it, famously, to nail the culprits behind the downing of civilian aircraft (flight MH17 over Ukraine and PS752 in Iran), fake news and disinformation operations, even identify military deployment. OSINT operations by intelligence agencies are usually hidden from public view.To put it simply, Zhenhua’s database is akin to putting together a dossier on a person with publicly available data. Such dossiers are not uncommon in security establishments. By nature, these dossiers are meant to include information that is not in the open, information that can compromise an individual, an institution or an establishment. A security analyst who follows surveillance told me that, by contrast, Zhenhua’s database was “not all that worrying”.What does appear to be new is the increasing frequency with which adversaries are drawing attention to China’s cyber operations. The Daily Telegraph noted that Zhenhua Data’s database was leaked by a company insider and first obtained by the Five Eyes intelligence network of the United States (US), the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It was from this network that the information made its way to the press. Earlier this summer, a US Senate report released in July accused China of surveillance and censorship through its tech. A month before that, Australia disclosed a “large scale” cyber attack. While Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not name any suspects, the country’s security establishment told local journalists that the blame likely lay with groups in China.The larger threat stems from China’s position as a hardware and software powerhouse as it exports technology that is often at a more lucrative price point than alternatives. Overtly, this emanates from the country’s cyber security law, which legally mandates that all Chinese tech companies hand over data (stored in Chinese servers) if requisitioned by security agencies. Covertly, this emanates from software and hardware that foreign intelligence agencies have long suspected of having backdoors to allow interception as information streams across mobile networks, internet routers and server farms.Essentially, yes — China is watching. But Zhenhua Data is likely to have contributed only a small portion of its peripheral vision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-is-watching-how-to-think-about-chinese-surveillance/story-iJaKHBMD3KG65ZpITwVtSO.html

Every time we ask from the management about our due salaries, they come up with excuses. We have been working non-stop without any monetary compensation for months now. We have various responsibilities but without being paid, we suffer daily. Some of us have to send money to our families in our home towns as well,” said, requesting anonymity, a plumber who works in the society.The maintenance staff, comprising at least 15 members, resumed work in the afternoon after the agency responsible for the management of the society assured them about being paid soon. “However, if we don’t get at least a part of the due amount within 24 hours, we will go on strike again. We will have no other option left,” the plumber said.The builder has, however, alleged that the issue regarding non-payment of salaries dates back to only two months, and will be resolved soon. “Residents of the society owe more than ₹2 crore in maintenance costs. We co-operated with them during the lockdown and but they are also required to pay the money to us,” said Kulbhushan Bajaj, director, la Residentia.Residents said they were concerned with the state of affairs in the society. “During the lockdown, our security and housekeeping staff had also gone on strike over non-payment of wages. Today(Tuesday) all our electricians, plumbers, gardeners, and other maintenance staff refused to work. It was after a lot of requests and assurances that they resumed work. Because of reduced activities amid the pandemic, most residents are dependent on the maintenance staff for help, and if they go on a longer strike, we can face a lot of problems. If there are issues regarding maintenance dues, notices should be sent to those who have not paid them, but all of us should not be made to suffer,” said Sumit Basoiya, a resident of the society..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/high-rise-staff-go-on-strike-over-non-payment-of-salary-in-greater-noida-west/story-SBuwbYtZsHgTNy1czQjDfL.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 toll goes past 30,000 with 515 new deaths; tally 1,097,856||Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 515 Covid-19 deaths, most in a day as well as first in excess of 500, as the toll went past 30,000 to 30,409. State officials said 302 deaths were from the past 48 hours, 116 were from last week and 97 were from before that period.A day after a relative drop in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra posted 20,482 infections on Tuesday, taking its case count to 1,097,856. Except on Monday, the state has recorded over 20,000 new cases on each day of the past week, which has led to a rise in active cases — 291,797 — accounting for 26.57% of the total. In 15 days of this month, the state has recorded over 3 lakh cases (3,05,243 cases) and average number of daily cases comes to 20,349.The high number of casualties continues to be a concern for state authorities as it is still the highest in the country. Figures show that the state’s contribution in total Covid-19 casualties is around 37.64%, with 80,776 deaths reported across the country.In the past fifteen days, average number of deaths a day of the state went up to 371. The situation appears to be getting difficult with every passing month as the average is constantly on the rise. In August, average number of deaths a day was 309, while in July, June, May and April, they were 282, 187, 59 and 14, revealed statistics.In August, the state reported a total 9,589 deaths, the highest in a month. The state has recorded 5,569 deaths in 15 days of this month, indicating that maximum Covid casualties are going to be reported in September.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 2.77% on Tuesday and comes at third position after Punjab and Gujarat. The CFR of Punjab and Gujarat were 2.95% (with 2,424 deaths) and 2.81% (with 3,227 deaths) on Monday, according to statistics shared by the state medical education departmentPublic health expert Sanjay Pattiwar said the state seems to be moving towards herd immunity, but at a big price in terms of large number of deaths. Besides, the health infrastructure in rural areas, where Covid-19 is spreading rapidly, is still too weak to deal with the situation. “We seem to be looking at herd immunity by way of natural infection and not through vaccination. In such a case it is going to be difficult to control the situation and have to pay a heavy price by losing the lives of a large number of people to Covid-19,” Pattiwar said.There is also no guarantee that vaccines that are being developed will give life-long immunity from virus as against polio vaccine, he said. “Polio vaccine gives us life-long protection whereas in this case there is no such guarantee. We even don’t know the level of protection coronavirus vaccine is going to give and for how many days. The reason is that the polio vaccine was evolved over a period of 30-40 years. In contrast, this vaccine has not been tested for more than three-four months. Thus, the coronavirus vaccine is going to be a temporary phenomena and all stress needs to be given on following social distancing norms,” he said.Pune city continues to contribute the highest number of infections to the daily caseload as it recorded 1,889 cases on Tuesday. Its tally stood at 131,983 cases.Mumbai recorded 1,586 cases as the second highest contributor, taking its tally to 173,596. Of them, active cases were 30,938. The city’s recovery rate is 77.33% and fatality rate is of 4.74%. Nagpur city has occupied third position in the list with 1,422 cases and its tally went up to 41,405.The surge in infections is a result of easing restrictions and the festival season that saw a large number of people getting out of their houses. Besides, with removal of restrictions on inter-district and inter-state travel, new hotspots with a significant number of cases are being reported in semi-urban and rural areas. Currently, the major hotspots in the state are Pune district, Satara district, Nashik city, Pimpri-Chinchwad city, Sangli district, Solapur district, Ahmednagar district and Jalgaon district, where fresh cases recorded were 1,302, 1,117, 1,029, 871, 618, 557, 536 and 504 respectively.In a bid to tackle the surge in Covid -19 cases and deaths, the state government launched its door-to-door survey ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ on Tuesday. The state-wide programme aims to check 2.25 crore families for symptoms of Influenza Like Illness (ILI), Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and co-morbidities. The idea is to effectively curtail the spread with necessary care and also reduce the number of Covid-19 casualties.While launching the campaign, the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray virtually interacted with 28,000 village sarpanchs and asked for their active participation in the campaign. He requested them to monitor the campaign and ensure it is done as expected.Under the campaign, health workers will conduct door-to-door surveys during which they will check residents’ body temperature and oxygen levels, besides other symptoms, including tiredness, throat pain, dry cough, diarrhoea, and loss of smell and taste, officials said.“Those with Covid-19 symptoms will be recommended a swab test. People with ailments such as diabetes, heart and kidney disease as well as obesity will be referred for treatment. Besides, health workers will also impart health education to people, especially on Covid-19,” said a health official.Each team comprising a health worker and two volunteers will survey each and every family of the state twice in over a month. The state is also assigning one doctor to five teams. The first phase of the survey is starting Tuesday. The volunteers are expected to complete it by October 10. The second phase will be conducted between October 12 and 24.On Tuesday, the state has conducted 87,944 tests and the total number of tests conducted till date are 5,409,060.On the other side, the state has also recorded 19,423 recoveries, highest in a day so far and total number of recovered patients reached 775,273.The recovery rate recorded was 72.62%, against the national average of 78.28%, with 80,775 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-toll-goes-past-30-000-with-515-new-deaths-tally-1-097-856/story-jC7td98W5OHwvK0DNLAHWN.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||3-judge HC bench to decide on bail for prisoners found with phone in jail||A three judge bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court will now decide whether a prisoner found using phone inside the jail will be disentitled for parole or bail only upon conviction by a court. The reference in this regard has been sent by high court bench of justice S Muralidhar and justice Avneesh Jhingan as it came across conflicting judgments of different division benches.“While a decision rendered by the coordinate benches will be binding on the subsequent benches of equal strength and if there is a conflict, the only way in which such conflict can be resolved is to refer the issue of the correctness of contrary views of coordinate benches to a larger bench,” the division bench recorded, while referring the matter to the chief justice to constitute a full bench comprising three judges. The reference has been raised in a plea filed by one Kulwant Singh from Haryana, who had sought three weeks parole. The bail/ parole are granted under Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 1988. While one view was that a prisoner found to have either used or be in possession of a mobile phone/SIM card is enough to disqualify for parole or furlough. While the other view was that unless such a prisoner is convicted by a court for such offence, which is punishable under the Prisons Act, 1894, the prisoner will not be disentitled to consideration for temporary release on parole or furlough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-judge-hc-bench-to-decide-on-bail-for-prisoners-found-with-phone-in-jail/story-0k9nFafj3jwTCT8KCEm4bO.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||DDA to auction 25 sites for weddings and other functions||With the festive and wedding seasons set to start from October onwards, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), for the first time, has decided to auction 25 of its sites for holding weddings and other functions. DDA officials said this move is aimed at protecting DDA land from encroachments, especially during the festive season.The 25 sites, each measuring more than an acre, are located in Rohini, Dwarka, Shahdara, Kalkaji and Saket, among others. Until recently, anyone could book these sites online by paying the booking amount, which varies as per the location of the site. But DDA officials say there were several problems with that. Often times, tent owners misused the online booking option and kept these spaces booked for a long period of time and also erected illegal semi-permanent tents on DDA lands.To combat this, last year, the DDA decided to auction its sites in order to regulate the use of its site and also earn revenue. With no bookings happening due to the Covid-19 pandemic, auctioning will help the land owning agency earn revenue.There are over 100 to 125 such sites of which DDA will only auction 25. The other sites can be booked online by residents. R Subu, commissioner (land disposal), DDA, said, “This decision was taken before the pandemic, but we couldn’t implement it until now. It is aimed at streamlining the process so that common man can benefit from it. The site will be auctioned for a period of 10 months. When the site is auctioned, the cost of constructing temporary structures will get divided (between the wedding parties). This will benefit people.”The festive season will start from October (Dussehra and Diwai being the main ones) followed by the wedding season of November and December. Although there are restrictions on the number of people at a gathering, banquet hall owners and tent houses are optimistic that the government will allow at least 50% of the venue capacity.Tent house owners say DDA should auction the site for a longer period, but with restrictions and riders so that no other event can be held there. “Auctioning is a good move, as there are several problems with the DDA’s current policy allowing booking of open spaces. But the duration of the lease period should be at least three years. Also, the DDA must restrict the use of the site to wedding functions only; else any event management firm can book the site and block it for an entire year,” Pankaj Shokeen, general secretary, Delhi Tent Federations, said.Purshotam Kalra, a resident of Paschim Vihar, who has been complaining against illegal tents being erected on government land, said, “Auctioning is not a good idea, as this will only lead to more harassment of the public by tent house owners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-to-auction-25-sites-for-weddings-and-other-functions/story-82UVub3ow5HBdHuo5Dpb3N.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Gurugram land release probe: CBI seeks sanction to prosecute three former town and country planning officials||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought sanction from the Haryana government to prosecute three former officials of the town and country planning (TCP) department for their alleged role in facilitating grant of real estate development licenses on land released from the acquisition process in Gurugram. The officials are former chief town planner JS Redhu, former assistant town planner Satish Arora and former deputy superintendent Rajbir Singh. The CBI, which is investigating the case pertaining to release of about 95% of 1,407 acre under acquisition land in Gurugram during the Congress rule in 2009, had in January 2019 registered a case against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, an official and 15 real estate developers in the matter. The probe was ordered on directions of the Supreme Court. ‘TCP officials made back references to builders’ The three TCP officials have been accused by the CBI of making “back references” to real estate developers who had submitted applications for grant of licenses. The “back references”, sources said, allowed the developers to rectify the deficiencies in the applications. Haryana advocate general BR Mahajan, from whom the department had sought advice on the issue of grant of sanction, said he has told the department that sanction to prosecute should be granted. “If the CBI has found something tangible against these officials during its probe, then there is no reason why the department should not go ahead with the sanction to prosecute. Eventually, it is for the trial court to decide the merits of the findings,” he said. Though these officials have retired from the service, as per the amended Prevention of Corruption Act, previous sanction of the state government is required for prosecuting even a retired public servant. CBI’s status report found satisfactory by apex court While it is not clear which way the CBI probe has gone so far, the central agency had on August 25 submitted a status report pertaining to the investigations in the Supreme Court. After perusing the status report, the apex court had said no further monitoring (by the SC) is required in this case since the bench is satisfied that substantial investigation has been done. “We have perused the report filed by the CBI. We are satisfied that the substantial investigation has been done. Let CBI take appropriate steps which may be required in accordance with law in view of its final conclusion. No further monitoring is required in this case,” said a three-member apex court bench. The apex court on December 2, 2019 had expressed its displeasure over the manner in which the central agency had investigated the case. Ordering a CBI probe in November 2017, the SC had said the entire purpose of acquisition stood defeated due to illegal release of 95% land. BOXUNDER PROBE:The Congress government in June 2009 issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 1,407 acres for developing residential sectors 58-63 and commercial sectors 65-67 in Gurugram by HUDA. While issuing the declaration under Section 6 on June 2, 2010, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. Finally, the award dated May 29, 2012 was passed for 87 acres only. The SC had said about 1,300 acres was released in favour of private builders. The CBI in its preliminary enquiry had prima facie established irregularities in the release of land from acquisition process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurugram-land-release-probe-cbi-seeks-sanction-to-prosecute-three-former-town-and-country-planning-officials/story-y1Q41LovtoLPxFUf0Ns36J.html
15-09-2020||City||Forest department serves notice to hospital for illegal felling, pruning of trees||New Delhi: The Delhi forest department has issued a show-cause to Escorts Hospital in south-east Delhi’s Okhla for ‘illegal felling, heavy pruning and heading back’ (removing of terminal branches) of at least 15 full-grown trees in its compound without any permission. According to forest officials, a tree officer from the department inspected the hospital compound on Friday after a Delhi-based environment activist filed a complaint. Some of the trees at the entrance of the hospital have been left with either a sparse canopy and just stumps of removed branches while a few others have their trunks exposed, the officials said, adding the act violates sections of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA), 1994. The hospital denied any illegal felling. “No notice has been received yet...no illegal felling/pruning of trees has been done...Only some pruning work was undertaken as part of routine maintenance of green belt and driveway area of hospital for safe and clear movement of ambulances in emergent situations,” Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said in statement. “We will submit all required details to the forest department whenever called upon to do so....”Deputy conservator of forest (South) Amit Anand said the notice was served on Monday. “Officials from the hospital management have been summoned to appear for a hearing in the matter on September 24. As per an initial assessment, around 15 trees have been damaged within the compound.” “Heavy pruning, ‘heading back’ and felling of trees without permission is an offence under the DPTA. Appropriate action will be taken after necessary proceedings,” Anand said. Verhaen Khanna, the activist on whose complaint the inspection was carried out, said even for light pruning, any agency, public or private, has to seek the forest department’s permission . The compound mostly has ficus species such as peepal, about 20-30 feet tall, which have been heavily pruned with heavy green branches being cut. There are some jamun and neem trees as well. “A tree cover is most essential for a hospital, which helps to cut down on air pollution levels. Besides, reducing the foliage will affect the birds and insects that live on the trees. The trees have been damaged and no permission was sought from the relevant authorities,” said Khanna.Any public or private entity wanting to get trees pruned in its premises has to seek permission from the forest department. After getting the nod, the task is carried out by the horticulture department of the land-owning agency such as the municipal corporation or any other department. C R Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said, “Heading back is taken up only when a tree has grown too large and can cause damage by falling on the immediate surroundings. Besides, ficus species can survive heavy pruning and pollarding, as new shoots grow into it.” “However, it is done only when the crown of the tree becomes too heavy and there is a fear of it being uprooted at any time, for which a prior assessment has to be done by a tree officer. In case of native trees such as jamun, the tree may get damaged in this process,” said Babu. This the third such instance of trees being damaged in the capital in the last two months. In August, the forest department issued several orders to the Station Area, Indian Army, at Delhi Cantonment for damaging over 40 trees along Ring Road while constructing a boundary wall. Earlier this month, the department issued ‘stop work’ order to the public works department for concretising around 30 trees at Meera Marg, Lodhi Colony, while constructing a drain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-department-serves-notice-to-hospital-for-illegal-felling-pruning-of-trees/story-eJpdtROuMTWjF0qyERcVjK.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Stir against Centre’s agriculture ordinances: Haryana farmers’ unions to protest in Delhi today||Irked over the Centre’s refusal to withdraw the three farm sector Bills introduced in the Lok Sabha, Haryana farmers’ unions on forefront of the agitation have decided to protest in New Delhi on Wednesday.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni has refuted reports about cracks in 17 farmers’ unions protesting under the BKU umbrella in Haryana. He claimed that not only farmers in Haryana but also various farmers’ unions of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan will descend on the national capital to hold a day-long protest near the Parliament on Wednesday. To break the logjam, the farmers leaders, including Charuni, were invited to meet BJP MP Dharambir Singh and then Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday. “The objective of inviting us for talks was to hoodwink the farmers. We boycotted the talks after we were told that the government will not withdraw the ordinances,” Charuni said.Meanwhile, Haryana BJP chief Dhankar led a delegation of “farmers” along with state agriculture minister JP Dalal and three MPs to meet Tomar. Dhankar said they submitted a memorandum to Tomar which includes eight demands/suggestions regarding the agriculture ordinances. Dhankar had deputed three party MPs— Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and Hisar MP Brijendra Singh—to meet farm union leaders to allay their fears on the ordinances.“The procurement of produce under MSP will continue. There will be no change whatsoever about the MSP and the grain markets. The ordinances have been drafted to protect the interests of the farmers,” Dhankar said. However, Charuni said: “The farmers union leaders who met Dhankar and then Tomar are not participating in the current agitation in Haryana. How can they speak on behalf of agitating peasants? Hours before meeting Tomar in Delhi on Tuesday, Charuni had said that farmers of the state want the Centre to give an undertaking that foodgrain procurement will continue under the minimum support price (MSP). “We want the Centre to give an undertaking that foodgrain procurement will continue under the MSP. Let private players buy foodgrains from farmers, but it must be guaranteed that they will not be allowed to procure the produce below the MSP decided by the Centre,” Charuni said. He, however, dismissed as an eyewash the efforts of a panel of three BJP MPs to reach out to the state’s farmers over the weekend. “The primary objective behind setting up the three MPs’ committee was to throw dust into the eyes of agitating farmers. This panel was set up to mislead the farmers and defuse the crisis,” he said. Farmers protest in various parts of state Meanwhile, farmers staged protests at various places in the state on Tuesday, demanding withdrawal of the three agriculture ordinances. Farmers associated with BKU reached the district headquarters in Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal and Kaithal districts and staged the Kisan Bachao-Mandi Bachao protest from 10:00am to 4:00pm. Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja, who was in Karnal on Tuesday, has accused the BJP government of turning a blind eye to the problems faced by farmers. Selja said the anti-farmer laws framed by the government have forced the farmers to take to the streets. Farmers in Jind, Hisar, Bhiwani and other districts also held protests and shouted slogans against the government.Bablu Shehrawat, Hisar district president of Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said, “The government has brought these ordinances to bring corporate dominance in agriculture. The farmers will be dependent on the big corporates if these bills are passed in the Parliament. If the ordinances are not revoked, we will ban the entry of BJP-JJP leaders in villages,” he added.Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu also addressed a press conference in Rohtak, where he trained guns at chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for ‘not raising’ farmers’ issues before agriculture minister Narendra Tomar.“The CM had also taken part in a meeting during which the plan on the three ordinances was discussed. However, he did not raise any objection to it. He has failed to save farmers,” Kundu said.In Ambala, several farmers gathered outside the deputy commissioner’s office to stage a protest against the recent police action against farmers at Kurukshetra’s Pipli rally and also the farm ordinances.

The survey included 257 people who had tested positive for the viral infection with an RT-PCR test and 79 of them did not have the antibodies in their blood samples. This finding has been reported in a technical report on the serological surveillance by researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College. “This was an incidental finding. We have reported this in the technical report that was submitted to the Delhi government about 10 days back. One of questions in the survey questionnaire was whether any of the people had tested positive for Covid-19 using RT-PCR and we found that some of them did not have the antibodies. However, there is not time frame for when they had tested positive for the infection. Studies from some other countries have shown that there has been a decline in the level of antibodies after a few months,” said one of the researchers working on the serological survey. “There is a need for a longitudinal study to find out the variation in the antibody levels over time in the population. The current tests that are done for the serological survey does not measure the level of antibodies, it just says whether one has the antibody or not,” the researcher said. The second round of serological surveillance in Delhi was conducted between August 1 and 7 whne 15,000 blood samples from a population representative of Delhi was collected. It had sound that an estimated 29.1% of the population had developed an antibody response to the virus. The prevalence of antibodies was higher among women – with 32.2% of women and only 28.3% of the men having the antibodies. The third round of sero-survey was conducted in Delhi between September 1 and 5 where 17,000 samples had been collected ward-wise. The results are likely to come in this week. “The result of the third sero surveillance will likely be released within this week,” said a Delhi government official. The first round of sero-survey had been conducted in Delhi between June 17 and July 10 with help from the National Centre for Disease Control, when 20,000 samples were tested. The study had estimated 22.6% of the population had antibodies to the infection. “The antibodies for Covid-19 disappears over time. Even at our hospital, a couple of the doctors who had tested positive, even donated plasma, did not show any antibodies after a month. This means, the prevalence of antibody in the city might go down and we might not be able to say that herd immunity could be protective,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said, “In case of any infection, some people do not develop antibodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sero-survey-2-0-30-of-covid-positive-patients-in-august-did-not-have-antibodies/story-6TFKUpeUEoyhsRSamTKktL.html

The application was filed in a petition filed by law student Prateek Sharma, who wanted better facilities for physically disabled students during examinations.Prof Sanjeev Singh, head of the DU’s computer branch, informed the bench that since the students had the double option of emailing the answer sheets and uploading them on the portal, there had been a lot of duplication. The computer cell has engaged 40 people on contract to integrate the answer sheets of all students.“By now, about 30% integration has taken place. About 50% of the answer sheets sent on the OB portal have been evaluated,” he said.The court said the varsity should take all steps to expedite the results as many students have to secure admissions in universities in India and abroad.During the hearing, the varsity also undertook to declare the results of final-year postgraduate students, who had requested their outcome on or before September 28 as they are seeking admission in foreign universities.The court said the results will be uploaded on Delhi University’s portal by September 28 morning on the university letterhead and will be digitally signed by an authorised official, without any riders that the results are provisional.“The students will be at liberty to download the results from the web portal of Delhi University,” the bench said.Prof DS Rawat, acting dean (examination), assured the court that the letter with regard to final-year UG students, containing their provisional results, will be sent directly to the foreign universities concerned , depending on the cut-off date for compliance as mentioned by students in their e-mails.He said an e-mail will also be sent to students, informing them about it so that they apply for a visa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-asks-du-to-fast-track-results/story-WhVi4lEoB9GDlZvXYy8cbK.html
15-09-2020||City||Homebuyers raise questions over Rera’s ‘progress report’ on projects||The Real Estate Regulatory Authority of Uttar Pradesh (UP-Rera) on Monday has come out with ‘Progress Report 2020’ that contains details of new initiatives, its achievements and the status of ongoing housing projects. The regulatory authority has put up the progress report on its website so that homebuyers both existing and new can use the report to make informed choices. However, homebuyers were sceptical and said the UP-Rera has not gotten the status of ongoing housing projects verified by an independent agency before publishing the details in the 60-page progress report. In the progress report, UP-Rera also claimed as its achievements in past one year the introduction of e-courts in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic; development of a mobile application for site inspections of housing projects; virtual workshops’ dispute resolution via conciliatory forums’ and awareness workshops on buyers’ rights. But not all buyers are happy with the report. “If the information provided by the promoter is not factually correct, then how can it benefit existing or new homebuyer? We have observed that many promoters give wrong information about the status of the project thereby misleading buyers. We are writing to UP-Rera to remove the unverified housing project details immediately as these will only confuse buyers,” Manish Kumar, vice-president, Noida Extension Flat Owners’ Welfare Association, said. The UP-Rera said there are a total of 2,800 housing projects registered across Uttar Pradesh of which at least 50% belong to the eight districts of the National Capital Region, falling in Western UP. The UP-Rera publishes this progress report annually to spread awareness about its initiatives so that buyers can be empowered and use the law if and when the need arises, said UP-Rera officials. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, had come into force on May 1, 2016 putting in place institutional infrastructure to protect consumers’ interests and promote the growth of the realty sector in India. “The UP-Rera is trying to protect the interests of buyers and are taking decisions on cases in relatively lesser time as compared to other courts. But the problem is that action on UP-Rera’s orders, particularly with regard to recovery of refunds from developers, are not happening as they should,” said Sachin Sharma, a homebuyer. The UP-Rera chairman Rajive Kumar said they will take action against promoters if they are found to have given wrong information about the status of projects. “We have had many achievements in past one year when it comes to addressing homebuyers’ grievances and helping the sector grow. We conduct inspections on site and verify the information given by a promoter. But we have not inspected all sites of all projects. We believe that the promoters give correct information about their projects so that homebuyers can make use of the same. But if any promoter gives wrong information, then there are provisions to act against them as per the law. As far as the issue of compliance is concerned, particularly on the matter of refunds, we are working on that and it will be dealt with,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/homebuyers-raise-questions-over-rera-s-progress-report-on-projects/story-5TYeBkcbqphUZflWe4sLCP.html

The strike call has been given by the Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), which has been raising the issue of delay in grants to 12 Delhi government-funded colleges.Mahaveer Genwa, who teaches Chemistry at Deen Dayal Upadhyay College, said he last received his salary in April. “All our backup and savings have been exhausted. Teachers have used their fixed deposits or taken personal loans for their everyday expenses,” he said, adding he will participate in the strike from Wednesday.Eight DU teachers have also approached the Delhi High Court, seeking directions to the authorities to pay pending salaries to around 1,500 teaching and non-teaching staff in these colleges. The petition is likely to come up for hearing on September 17.“Funds have been released to six (out of the 12) colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government. However, there have been complaints of financial irregularities in the remaining six, because of which their accounts are currently being audited. Serious financial irregularities have surfaced in the audit process. Without the completion of the audit, more funds from the public exchequer cannot be released to these colleges,” the Delhi government said in response to queries sent by HT.Jaskaran Bindra, a second-year undergraduate student at the college, said, they are supporting the teachers in the strike. “They deserve their salaries for working so hard during a pandemic. Even our online learning gets affected since many teachers do not have high-speed internet,” he said.Genwa, president of the staff association at the college, said, “Expenses have been piling up with no relief in sight. Many of us have school-going children who haven’t been able to pay their fee or our rent. Our landlords have threatened to evict us. We don’t have any hope from the strike but there is nothing else we can do,” he said.DUTA treasurer Abha Dev Habib said around 2,000 such employees and their families “are suffering for no fault of theirs”.In August, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said around 23% of the funds allocated for 2020-21 had been released. He said the “inability of Delhi government-funded DU colleges to pay staff salaries despite a 70% increase in budget allocation in the last five years indicated corruption” – a claim denied by the DU administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teachers-in-delhi-govt-funded-du-colleges-plan-strike-over-salaries/story-4MMz0M3EFfBhbS6NDW6WaI.html

A sanitary supervisor, Pawandeep, suffered serious injuries on the head and has been admitted to the hospital.Following this, Pawandeep’s group staged a protest against the councillor for allegedly planning an attack on them. Police reached the spot and tried to pacify the protesters. Pawandeep’s younger brother, Dharminder said,”Pawandeep has been the sanitary supervisor (lambardar) of the ward for around 12 years and 40 sweepers work under him. The councillor wants to divide the work between two sanitary supervisors even after the residents have supported Pawandeep. Kaler asked us to visit his office on Tuesday evening to resolve the matter and when we moved out of the office, the other group attacked us due to which Pawandeep suffered serious injury on head and has been admitted to a hospital.”Kaler however denied the allegations and said he has nothing to do with it. “I was inside my office and had called up both parties so that a consensus can be reached. Another sanitary supervisor is required in the area so that work could be done properly. However, Pawandeep left the meeting in between and moved out. He and other employees of his group started raising slogans against me and the other group. When the other group moved out of the office, both the groups entered into a clash,” Kaler said. Station House Officer, Shimlapuri police station, Varunjit Singh said,”Two groups had clashed following which police was deployed at the spot.

The EPE connects Kundli with Palwal, both places in Haryana, via Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts in Uttar Pradesh. The expressway helps long-distance travellers between the two states to bypass Delhi, thereby reducing their travel time.“The outer side of the EPE is bound by iron railings, which is about 30-40 metres away from the main carriageway. There are instances of people cutting off the grilles so that their vehicles can access the expressway from the nearby villages. Such vehicles include tractor-trolleys and two-wheelers -- two categories that are not allowed on the EPE,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. “This has resulted in several accidents. We have also deployed guards but still people drive two-wheelers and tractor-trolleys forcibly on the expressway,” he said.Apart from accidents, thieves flee with the iron installations, solar panels, streetlights and even damage installations on the expressway. The “short-cuts” are also used to avoid toll booths.To discourage all this, the authority has launched a the pilot project near the Dasna interchange danger signboards will be put up.“We are putting up red danger signboards every 100 metres for a distance of 10km,” he said. “We are hopeful we will be able to secure the iron barricades and also prevent unauthorised entry to the expressway.” If the project is successful, the NHAI will expand it over the entire 135km stretch. “The boards will be put up at places where there are more chances of trespassing. Such boards imply that the intruder is being monitored and there could be repercussions for him/her,” said colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, who was part of the army’s engineering corp, said.As per norms, the speed limit for cars/jeeps on the expressway is 120kmph while that for commercial vehicles is 100kmph. According to records, there were 74 accidents in 2018 on the EPE, while there were 144 in 2019 and 83 accidents till date in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhai-putting-up-danger-signboards-on-eastern-peripheral-expressway/story-TEI3muTPJsqZrDAvhqXiMM.html

A newly constructed call centre building at 66 KV GIS substation in Chaura Bazar was inaugurated by DPS Grewal, director distribution.A Venu Prasad, CMD, PSPCL said that it is a major expansion of the already 24x7 running electricity call centre at Janta Nagar, Ludhiana, which has been in operation since 2009. He added that with this expansion as many as 180 persons have got employment.He said that due to heavy rain/storm, especially during paddy season, manual lines become faulty because of which consumer complaints increase, leading to heavy load on lines of the existing call centre. “Most of the lines become busy and it becomes difficult to cater to the demand of consumers to register their complaints. Therefore, 60 additional lines are added to the system”, he added.While inaugurating the new building, Grewal said, “This facility at Chaura Bazar will now double the existing electricity call centre capacity from 60 to 120. Now, 120 incoming call channels shall be available to customers for registration of complaint through ‘1912’ in place of the existing 60 channels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-expands-its-call-centre-for-lodging-complaints/story-yDjGDWMXuSoAwcyWaGghlO.html

In Ludhiana, protest marches were organised in different parts of the city on cars. Protesters displayed posters slamming the state government’s decision and raised slogans. They also got into a heated argument with the police at Samrala chowk. The members rued that over 10 lakh people, who are involved in the business directly and indirectly, are struggling to make ends meet due to the pandemic, but the government is not paying heed to the problem. The members said they will hand over a memorandum of their demands to MLAs of their respective constituencies.Punjab general secretary Shiv Shanker Rai, said, “Apart from 8,000 tent dealers across the state, caterers, decorators and Djs have also extended their support to the protest and kept their shops closed. If the Union government has allowed 100 people to gather from September 21, why can’t the state government do so?”Raj Aggarwal, president of the Ludhiana Tent Dealers Welfare Association, said, “Tent owners have made no money in the last over five months and are struggling to make ends meet. A large number of employees have lost their jobs as owners are not able to bear fixed charges. The government should take note of the problem and gathering limit should be increased to 100 people to bring some relief.” Surinder Singh, owner of Bagga tent house in Dugri, said, “Tent dealers have been forced to change their vocation. I have started working as a property dealer to make ends meet. While some are selling vegetables, few have become drivers. The residents are not booking tents and caterers due to restrictions on gathering and the future seems dark if the government fails to announce some relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tent-dealers-move-on-roads-seeking-extension-in-gathering-limit-protest-marches-organised-in-city-on-cars/story-CdqlP6mTes1AHH0A4W4rdK.html

As per MC officials, there are approximately 50,000 buildings in the city that house labour quarters and out of these, at least 80% have illegal water connections. The field staff has started its survey and recovery notices would be served to the owners soon. Most of labour quarters are situated in Giaspura, Haibowal, Barewal road and adjoining areas. The officials said that a penalty of at least Rs 20,000 will be imposed on the owner, if illegal water connections are caught by the MC team. The penalty will include regularisation charges, a fine and fixed amount of monthly bill for the last three years.Additional commissioner, Rishipal Singh said, “The MC has already begun a survey after property tax for residential rental properties, including labour quarters was increased to 7.5% of the annual rent.

15-09-2020||City||Industrial waste continues to be dumped, burnt in Greater Noida’s green belts||Industries set up in Ecotech 1 in Greater Noida continue to dump waste in green areas in the city unchecked in the absence of a policy aimed at collection of such waste, environment activists and residents have alleged.According to the residents of villages around Ecotech-1 industrial area, factories often dump and burn waste along various green belts in the city creating problems for common people. “Dumping of industrial waste is so unabated and unchecked that a number of green belts have been completely like a dhalao (dumping site). We often see cables, tyres and other waste dumped by the industries on the roadside being burnt. Last year, such burning lead to a mass fire and the smoke filled our village and people were forced to flee out of their houses,” said Rohit Adhana, a resident of Kasna village that is situated near the industrial area.Local residents asserted that while they had been filing complaints with the Greater Noida authority, the pollution control board and even the chief minister’s integrated system for grievance portal—Jansunwai Samadhan since last year, waste dumping is a perennial issue with only small pauses in between.Seeking a permanent solution to the issue, Adhana added that complaints only provide a temporary solution and in many cases no even that. “We often see smoke rising from green belts in Ecotech 1 where garbage from nearby factories including some liquor factory is dumped At times, the smoke enters the villages along this industrial area. We have been raised complaints multiple times, but the issue persists,” said Ramveer Tanwar, a social and environmental activist and resident of Dadha village (which is near the industrial area).Villagers said a number of rag pickers and scrap dealers can be often seen burning cables dumped by industries for extracting copper.According to city environmentalists, while residential waste gets attention from authorities, collection of industrial waste, which can be far more dangerous, is pushed to the back burner. “The issue of industrial waste is old and least addressed often leading to contentions between authorities, industrial bodies and residents. It’s the responsibility of the development authorities to either collect the industrial waste or continuously monitor how industries are handling it. It’s strange that when development authorities allot land to industries, they are not concerned about the waste generated. Imposing penalties alone can’t resolve the issue of industrial waste, and we need a comprehensive policy on collecting such waste from factories,” said Vikrant Tongad, a city-based environmentalist.The industrial area falls under Greater Noida authority. While it’s illegal for industries or scrap dealers to dump garbage in green belts, the authority is not responsible for collecting waste from factories, senior officials of the authority said.Meanwhile, the state pollution watchdog inspected the area on Tuesday and found various violations.“A team was dispatched to inspect the area and found that the garbage was being dumped and burnt openly along the roadside as well as the green belts. Since the area falls under Greater Noida authority, we are sending a letter to them to act against the violators and impose penalties,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional head, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Greater Noida.Washing off hands from the responsibility of collecting the waste, Greater Noida authority said it will issue fines to the violators. “It’s not our responsibility to manage the bulk industrial waste generated, and it’s rather the industries which are supposed to manage their waste themselves. However, it’s illegal to dump waste in green areas, and we have slapped penalties on the industries for such violations in the past. Even in this case (for areas around Ecotech 1) , we will act against the violators. The scrap dealers have been impanelled by the authority to retrieve the waste and sell it further, but even they are not supposed to throw it on the roadside,” said Deep Chandra, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industrial-waste-continues-to-be-dumped-burnt-in-greater-noida-s-green-belts/story-RRH11VOv2TXK0jqDnri7DJ.html

The accused, who is a neighbour of her parents, befriended her and even introduced her to his mother. In March when the lockdown started, he invited her to his house. On reaching there, she found that he was alone at home. He offered her a cold drink. After drinking it, she fell unconscious following which the accused raped her and even clicked objectionable pictures of her.The woman said that the accused then used these pictures to blackmail her and forced her to establish physical relations with him. He even told her that he had links with some drug peddlers and would get them to murder her family if she revealed the incident to anyone. She finally confided in her mother, who then took her to the police station to lodge a complaint. Assistant sub-inspector Daljit Singh, who is investigating the case, said a case has been registered under Sections 376 (rape) and 417 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

15-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Anti-corruption team investigates irregularities in issuance of fire safety approvals||A team from the Bareilly anticorruption unit of the state police arrived in Gautam Budh Nagar on Tuesday to investigate alleged irregularities pertaining to the issuance of no-objection certificates (NOC) from the fire department in 2019. The matter came to light in September 2019, when a fire station officer was arrested by the Noida Police for allegedly accepting a bribe of ₹80,000 for issuing an NOC to a private hospital in Sector 48. A probe in the matter revealed that a number vendors supplying fire safety equipment to commercial and residential establishments in the district were obtaining fire NOCs on behalf of applicants. After this information came to light, the Noida fire department filed as many as seven FIRs against at least 13 fire safety equipment vendors for using their personal contact information to obtain NOCs on behalf of their clients.While the matter was being initially investigated by the Noida police department under the tenure of the last district SSP, Vaibhav Krishna, it was later handed over to the anticorruption unit of the state police.A team from the Bareilly anti-corruption unit, led by deputy SP, Abdul Razzaq, visited the Sector 2 Harola fire station on Tuesday morning, before meeting the district fire chief.“The investigation has been going on for a while. We filed complaints after irregularities were found in the process of NOC issuance. The vendors would use their personal contact information to obtain these certificates on behalf of applicants. The team today visited a few spots and spoke to fire personnel and others as a part of the ongoing probe,” said Arun Kumar Singh, the district’s chief fire officer.Statements were taken and inquiries were made, while documents related to the alleged irregularities were also seized, said officials. Singh added that the investigating officials also visited the spots, whose NOCs were found to be questionable in the initial probe. The team spent over five hours in Noida, carrying out their investigation. Fire department officials said that the probe will continue and action will be taken against all those who are found to be involved in the irregularities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-anti-corruption-team-investigates-irregularities-in-issuance-of-fire-safety-approvals/story-neY5vFazHQ31QRfgVELckN.html

The forest department installed new signboards, urging visitors to maintain social distancing.The sanctuary was closed in March, in the wake of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic when a nationwide lockdown was announced to stop the spread of the virus.“We are only letting visitors in with masks and thermal screening. There was a total of 14 visitors on the first day. This is not surprising because it is presently the off-season. The period from November to March usually receives the highest number of visitors. As a precautionary measure, we have installed signboards, along the trails, urging people not to take off their masks and to maintain social distancing,” said Arvind Mishra, range forest officer of Okhla Bird Sanctuary.The sanctuary is spread over an area of 400 hectares, of which about 60% is covered by a water body.

The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and several people had also made videos that were widely shared on social media, prompting the police to arrest the man on Tuesday. Police said the arrested man has been identified as Sunil Chaudhary, the neighbour of the victim woman. The woman’s family gave a complaint at the Kavi Nagar police station on the basis of which the police booked Chaudhary under the IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation). “The man has been arrested. The family in their complaint said Chaudhary often harassed them and beat the woman up on Saturday when she objected to his behaviour. The incident was also captured by CCTV cameras in the area,” Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city), said. Police said the incident took place around 5.15pm Saturday when the woman was on her way to the local market and Chaudhary made some offensive comments about her. When she objected to this, videos on social media purportedly show Chaudhary landing multiple punches and kicks on the woman and beating her up mercilessly even as the public remained mute spectators. The videos also show him picking up a metal chair and hitting the woman with it till she fell unconscious. Chaudhary then leaves the spot and another man helps the woman up. He make her sit at a nearby shop before leaving. Police said the initial medical examination of the woman indicated six different injuries to her chest, head and the upper portion of her body. In his complaint, the woman’s husband mentioned that the suspect would often abuse his wife and their 26-year-old daughter. He said this has been going on for a year and a half and the family had once complained to Kavi Nagar police and twice to the local police post. The woman’s son said, “The man made abusive comments about my mother, and when she objected, he severely beat her up. The police have not levied appropriate sections in the FIR as my mother has injuries to her head and chest.” Verma said the police have sent the woman for further medical examination and have for now levied the IPC sections on the basis of complaint given by family and the initial medical report. “Further medical examination will be taken up and appropriate sections will be added to the FIR if reports indicate other injuries. The FIR is lodged as per the complaint given by her family. In case the family wants to add more charges, these will be made part of the ongoing investigation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/neighbour-thrashes-woman-in-public-view-after-video-of-incident-goes-viral-he-s-arrested/story-KB6pfJk9FvkeLxNrAvMZlK.html

The rate for RT-PCR test will however remain at ₹1,600,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “The rates for the RT-PCR test was dropped as there were some reagents whose costs had also dropped. So, it is possible that the drop in rates for the reagents used for TrueNat may not have come down, hence the state officials decided to give increase the rate slightly,” he added.TrueNat testing is used for speedy confirmation of true negative status of patients who arrive for non-Covid medical interventions like in case of trauma, surgeries or in case of pregnant women among others.Apart from three machines in private labs in the district only one government-run facility (MMG District Hospital ) in Ghaziabad the facility for testing throughTrueNat machines. The TrueNat machine available at the district hospital is not operational these days, added the CMO.The TrueNat testing, was largely used for pregnant women who needed to be tested for Covid-19 before their deliveries, had stopped since September 10 at the district hospital.“We have informed the concerned authorities about the requirement for TrueNat kits and the officials have told us that the kits are on their way. We are expecting the delivery of kits in the next three days,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG District Hospital.Till September 14, Ghaziabad district had tested about 245,132 samples, including 8500 through TrueNat machines.

But the recent spike has led the tally to reach 3,027 cases during the first 15 days of September. According to the state control room records of September 15, the district currently has 1,858 active cases, taking the overall tally of Covid-19 cases to 11,335.“We have 100% occupancy in our Covid-19 department, which has a total of 105 beds. All of them are occupied. We have been observing an increase in the number of patients over the past 10-12 days,” said Dr Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital, Nehru Nagar. The other branch of the hospital at Kaushambi has 45 beds — all of which were found to be occupied on Tuesday. “The occupancy is 100% and the number of patients has increased drastically in September. Apart from a steep hike in occupancy we have also observed the severity of Covid-19 cases has also increased. Earlier, we were receiving patients with very mild symptoms but now patients, who require L2 or L3 categories of treatment,are being admitted” said an officer from Kaushambi branch of the hospital. Representatives of Max Hospital in Vaishali had the same story to share. The hospital has 49 Covid-19 beds- all of which were occupied till Tuesday. “All of our 55 functional Covid-19 beds are full and even the ventilators are occupied. There are number of enquiries which are coming in for admission, but we have no other option but to deny,” said Dr Mahesh Chaudhary, director (operations), Navin Hospital at Vaishali. The health department officials said that the overall occupancy in private hospitals is about 75-80%. A total of 2,676 cases were allowed home isolation, of whom 843 patients are still recuperating.A total of 833 cases have been discharged so far. “The occupancy in private hospitals is high and many of them have 100% occupancy. As a result, more beds were added to private hospitals, taking the total number of beds in such hospitals to 663. We are also planning to rope in more hospitals in cases more beds are needed. On the other hand, beds in our L1, L2 and L3 are lying vacant. We have a total of 200 patients, as against an availability of 1,466 beds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “A facility allocation for about 200 patients is pending and will be completed. We are expecting more hospitals to join the paid Covid treatment facility that will take the total number of beds in private hospitals to 750 this week,” he added. However, despite the drastic rise in the number of fresh cases, the district has also reported a high recovery rate. Of the 11,335 total cases till September 15, the total number of discharges stood at 9,404 — which roughly corresponds to 82.96% of overall cases In order to effectively deal with the surge in cases, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari on Tuesday issued directions to state officials to ensure that order for medicine supplies, manpower and oxygen is placed, keeping in mind the requirement for the coming weeks. “Patients must be randomly checked over the phone and their feedback must be taken. For this, the district control rooms will be required to send reports to the state level control room, which will keep a check on contact tracing and testing,” Tiwari said in his directions. He also stated that a comprehensive health status of very mild and asymptomatic patients in home isolation should be taken and, if required, they should be referred to Covid hospitals. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-spike-in-covid-19-cases-most-private-hospitals-in-ghaziabad-report-100-occupancy/story-P62i9xNjoL1SDjrBnXIAvL.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||MHA officials want UT admin to focus on critically ill Covid patients||The Central government on Tuesday reiterated that the UT administration had to renew focus on care of critically ill Covid-19 patients as well as those suffering from other ailments.Appreciating the administration’s efforts to step up Covid-19 testing in the city since their last meeting on September 4, ministry of home affairs (MHA) officials, including the Union home secretary, said in a virtual meeting on Tuesday that while the UT had been successful in keeping mortality rates down, it had to ensure that the toll did not go up even as positive cases increased.According to UT adviser Manoj Parida, “We have increased testing and expanded the bed capacity in the city. We have been asked to strengthen the contact tracing mechanism and monitoring of home quarantined (patients).”FOCUS ON NON-COVID PATIENTSWith public health care facilities largely closed for non-Covid patients, the MHA asked UT officials to ensure timely treatment for them even while managing the Covid pandemic. The outpatient departments of all Chandigarh hospitals were shut down after the first Covid case was detected in March. Now, however, even as tele-consultation is being provided to patients, emergencies are open only to those requiring immediate intervention.RE-VALIDATE ANTIGEN TESTS IF NEEDEDWith doubts being raised over antigen testing results, the MHA officials directed the UT officials to revalidate the results of the antigen test with RT-PCR tests if required.“For the first contact family members of Covid patients we are already conducting RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, considered the gold standard in Covid-19 testing) tests. In other cases too we will follow up the antigen tests with RT-PCR tests on a random basis to check their efficacy. Also, if some patient raises questions about the antigen tests we will conduct RT-PCR tests,” said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mha-officials-want-ut-admin-to-focus-on-critically-ill-covid-patients/story-ab56i7344IhYnnOu6TxYzI.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Focus on contact tracing, testing: Central team to Chandigarh admn||The two-member medical experts’ team constituted by the Centre to help the Chandigarh administration in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic is learnt to have suggested better contact tracing, more testing capacity and preparations to increase hospital beds amid a surge in cases. The team that was deputed here on September 4 has also asked the UT administration to improve its real-time data management while appreciating coordination between field teams and use of geographic information system (GIS) mapping for identifying clusters and demarcating containment zones.Better contact tracingThe UT has been told to include more staff from the health department in contact tracing exercise, with one team catering to a maximum of 25 active cases. The contact tracing team, in turn, should coordinate with its corresponding zonal testing team in a streamlined manner and ensure that no family member or contact of positive cases is missed out. Currently, there is a duplication of work, as the health department carries out contact tracing for testing and the municipal corporation teams for quarantining. Increase testingThe administration has been told to increase testing capacity at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, as maximum number of cases are surfacing in southern sectors, which also have more containment zones.Also, there is recommendation to start antigen testing at the emergency ward of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research to ensure those diagnosed with Covid can be immediately isolated from other patients admitted there. At present, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method is used, which takes time to provide test results, leading to chances of spread of infection.Clear testing data on timeIt was noted that the number of Covid-19 tests increased manifold due to the inclusion of negative samples that were not counted on day of testing and are now being updated in bulk. The team said that real-time data entry should be facilitated to address this backlog at the PGIMER level. It was suggested that test results should be communicated to people on priority.Be prepared to increase bedsThe expert team has also called for better coordination between all three government hospitals in the city to streamline referrals, besides asking PGIMER and GMCH to be prepared to increase the number of beds in case of a further surge.The team has recommended that the staff from all specialties should be trained for managing at least moderate Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, it has been suggested that all family members of those testing positive should be contacted by doctors within 24 hours to take a call on whom to be home isolated or shifted to Covid care centre or hospital, and for quarantining high-risk contacts with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/focus-on-contact-tracing-testing-central-team-to-chandigarh-admn/story-KfjixL0PWewGkDrsFTZx6N.html

People can submit their suggestions/ objections in the MC commissioner’s office from September 16 to September 25.The MC will implement the rules after the approval of the administrator. Some of the elements have already been incorporated in the MC waste segregation process, others will be implemented with this notification.As per the draft rules, “Every plastic waste generator will have to segregate the waste at the source and plastic wastes shall be stored separately from other kinds of wastes within the premises of the waste generator. This responsibility shall fall upon the occupier or manager of the premises. The aforementioned entities shall hand over such segregated plastic waste to the collection agency designated/authorised by the MC.”Every person responsible for organising an event in open space, which involves service of foodstuff in plastic or multi-layered packaging, will have to segregate and manage the waste generated during such events following the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, or the amendments from time to time.Waste generators will even have to pay plastic waste management user fees as stipulated by the MC from time to time.Special drives will be conducted by the MC for bulk generators of solid waste such as cinema halls, hotels, educational institutions, shopping halls, hostels, and schools.The door-to-door segregation started by the MC last year in October had come to a grinding halt after the Covid pandemic spread in March this year.

The farmers first blocked the Doraha Neelo Road thereafter marched towards Khanna where they were joined by arhtiyas and other labour organisations. The farmers blocked the NH-44 for two hours, allowing only emergency vehicles to pass. However, the police swung into action and eased traffic jam on NH-44. Cars and other LMVs were diverted towards slip roads and other alternate passages. Congress MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli also joined the protesting farmers and extended his party’s support. Addressing the gathering, Rajewal said, “While the entire sector has witnessed a decline, it is the farming sector which is a saving grace. Punjab had initiated a green revolution in the country and the state’s water and soil were abused for filling the grain godowns of the country. Now, the ruling BJP has backstabbed the farmers and planning to sell the farming sector to the big cooperates by establishing parallel markets (open market).” “Sadly, there will be no check on these markets, and taking legal action too would be a tough task. Small farmers will be reduced to slavery if this ordinance comes into effect,” said Rajewal. He said that representatives of 11 farmers’ unions from Punjab and 31 from Haryana will visit Delhi to register their protest against the ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protesting-agri-ordinances-lay-siege-to-nh-44-in-khanna/story-edZSyLsHMzooR6T5fDazfK.html

15-09-2020||Chandigarh||After Punjab, Chandigarh may do away with quarantine posters as well||Following Punjab’s lead, the UT Administration is mulling to discontinue the practice of putting up posters outside the houses of Covid patients under home isolation or quarantine.Of the 2,991 active cases in Chandigarh as of Tuesday, more than 1,000 patients are in home isolation.Currently, the administration follows the policy of affixing posters outside the houses of Covid-19 patients to make locals aware of infected people in their surroundings.But, the administration has been flooded with requests by the patients to discontinue the practice. “Patients are calling up or texting officials that they should not be made to suffer the fear and stigma of social isolation resulting from the posters affixed at the entrance of their residences. There is a social stigma attached to pasting of posters and patients feel psychologically traumatised because of it,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named.Notably, Punjab government had recently revoked its earlier decision regarding similar posters.CONTAINMENT ZONES SET TO CROSS 50 MARKThe number of micro-containment zones in the city is set to cross the 50 mark with the Area Affected Committee recommending that 29 more areas be given the tag.It was on September 8 last when UT had notified 24 micro-containment zones in the city.Chandigarh was declared containment-zone free in June with perimeter controls being removed from the Bapu Dham Colony. But, after sharp increase in the Covid-19 cases thereafter, the UT administration formulated the micro-containment policy for demarcating even three to four houses as containment zones.However, the policy was not employed on a large-scale. This changed with the central government officials on September 4 asking the administration to step up creation of the containment zones to restrict the spread of the virus in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-punjab-chandigarh-may-do-away-with-quarantine-posters-as-well/story-ACjmQblRYTRsuFvWuZ7OzI.html

Syndicate member Ashok Goyal said, “It seems that the vice-chancellor is only posing to be inclined to holding the meeting. Majority of the syndicate members have already informed in writing that it will not be possible for them to attend any online meeting and have requested for a physical meeting.”“Instead of appreciating the concerns of the syndicate members, the vice-chancellor preferred to be adamant in calling an online meeting again on Tuesday,” Goyal said.The agendas of the meeting included ratifying the decisions of the coordination committee regarding the conduct of final semester examinations and other exam-related issues.The Goyal group has been at loggerheads with vice-chancellor Raj Kumar ever since the senate polls were postponed on August 15 in view of the pandemic. Another syndicate member, Rajinder Bhandari said, “There is confusion among members with regards to the online meeting, so we did not attend it. We did not find it appropriate to take part in the meeting in such an atmosphere.”V-C Raj Kumar was not immediately available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/members-skip-online-pu-syndicate-meeting-second-time-in-a-row/story-AGtuavjK0pRQLAtTJb0wwM.html

15-09-2020||Patna||PM lauds Bihar govt, launches projects worth ₹ 541 crore||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the NDA government in Bihar was striving to usher in inclusive growth in the state by ensuring basic amenities to its people and setting the stage for a self-reliant Bihar (Atmanirbar Bihar). “Bihar suffered a lot in the past due to misplaced priorities, vested interest and scams of the past governments. As a result, rural areas were put on backward trend, while urban infrastructure became irrelevant for want of upgrade as per the growing population,” Modi said in an apparent swipe at the RJD-led dispensation. The PM was speaking after inaugurating and launching work infra projects worth ₹ 541 crore, which included operationalisation of two sewerage treatment plants (STPs) along with network at Beur and Karmalichal in Patna, costing Rs 152 crore, through video conferencing. He also laid the foundation stone of river front development in Muzaffarpur and unveiled water supply schemes at Chapra and Siwan. He said that the joint efforts of the Centre and the state government had resulted in qualitative change in urban infrastructure to ensure basic amenities to all. The PM said that about two crore houses were to be connected with tap water supply under the Centre’s Jal Jivan mission in last one year. “In Bihar, about 12 lakh households would get supply water once the undergoing schemes are complete. Currently, 6 lakh families have tap water supply in their houses under AMRUT scheme. Unlike the previous government, the Nitish Kumar government worked with commitment and finished the projects on time,” said Modi, adding that the dolphin conservation project being developed from Patna to Bhagalpur stretch of Ganga would benefit the state in many ways. During his address, Modi sought to connect the people by invoking the most popular Chhath puja saying that renovated Ghat at Muzaffapur would let women celebrate the festival in its traditional spirit. He also lauded role of migrant workers, who returned to Bihar due to Covid outbreak, saying they contributed a lot for timely completion of water supply schemes in Bihar. This is third time in the last one week that the Prime Minister laid foundation stones of or inaugurated various schemes in the state in the run-up to the elections. On Sunday, he launched three petroleum projects in Bihar, costing Rs 900 crore. He had on Thursday unveiled projects worth ₹294.53 crores related to agriculture and animal husbandry in the poll-bound state. Chief minister Nitish Kumar said the water resources department was devising plans to use treated water from the SPTs for agriculture purposes, instead of releasing it in Punpun river. While welcoming the Centre’s gesture to help the state government achieve a holistic growth, Kumar urged the people to abstain from misusing supply water and put avoidable strain on ecology. Earlier, deputy CM Sushil Modi said the operation of STPs under Namami Gange project would help the government’s drive to stop discharge of untreated wasted in Ganga, which is currently highly polluted. “Efforts are on to check flow of waste water, chemical and industrial affluent in the river to make it pure,” said the Dy CM. Reacting to the string of launching events lined up for the PM in Bihar, Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra said Modi had stepped in steer the poll campaign after he realised that Nitish Kumar alone would not be able to counter the burgeoning anti-incumbency against the ruling dispensation. “BJP’s internal survey also hints at serious depletion of credibility of Nitish Kumar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/pm-lauds-bihar-govt-launches-projects-worth-541-crore/story-3oRD0iDBGeb47klm8QuJuI.html

According to the report, the panel, comprising UILS director and three other members, in its meeting on September 9 resolved that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, PU will not be able to conduct the entrance test for over 7,000 candidates.Varsity’s August 11 decision to scrap the law entrance in view of Covid-19 outbreak was challenged by two aspirants Navya Raj and Saurav Rao. They had argued that the premise not to hold the entrance was not valid when PU was conducting exams for other courses. Class 12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course will neither be reasonable nor reliable, they had contended.Panel’s observationsThe panel observed that there were approximately 7,000 applications for admission to the BA/BCom-LL.B (Hons) 5-year integrated course. Therefore, it will be difficult for the university to find an agency in a short span of time to conduct the entrance test with social distancing and precautionary measures as prescribed by the Government of India.As such, the panel members unanimously resolved against holding the exam in the interest of the students.Besides, the members also concurred that holding the exam online was not technically feasible due to unavailability of technologies and solutions that can ensure transparency and fairness in the examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/five-year-law-course-pu-not-to-conduct-entrance-exam-this-year/story-4Wvk7DZR6JIYhuQlRvyKQN.html

Kaur’s conduct during the investigation too was non-cooperative, he argued, adding that she could hamper investigations.There were chances of her trying to influence the material witnesses, he said.After hearing both parties, the court observed that Kaur, who had been in custody for 53 days, deserved the concession of regular bail.She was ordered to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh with one surety in the shape of immovable property.Kaur was also asked to not leave the country without prior permission of the court or try to influence the prosecution witnesses.In case of non-compliance of any of the imposed conditions, the CBI can move an application for cancellation of bail.On June 29, the CBI booked Kaur, then SHO of Manimajra and middleman Bhagwan Singh, on the complaint of Manimajra resident Gurdeep Singh that she had asked him for a bribe in lieu of not registering a cheating case against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/suspended-manimajra-sho-jaswinder-kaur-gets-bail/story-XSyVYYhGo5N0v1wB5CDXbM.html

As the same party is also heading the civic body, it was misused to carry out the demolition, she added.Ranaut has been at loggerheads with the state government since she criticised Mumbai police’s handling of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death investigation. She referred to Mumbai as “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir” and “Pakistan” and triggered a political controversy. The state’s ruling alliance has accused her of carrying forward the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s political agenda. Ranaut got security from the BJP-ruled Centre amid her spat with Sena leaders.Also Read: ‘Out of control’: Kangana Ranaut, slammed by Jaya Bachchan, gets it from Sena againThe petition said the presence of BMC staff and police officials outside the premises on September 9 even before civic authorities rejected her response to the stop-work notice showed the action was premeditated and taken with “malafide intentions”.The actor said the BMC’s claim, in reply to her petition challenging the demolition, was without proper evidence and arbitrary. She added the civic body’s claim that it found 14 alterations and additions to the property during the inspection on September 7 was not substantiated by proper evidence. Ranaut dismissed the notice as “illegal” and “wrongful” and added it deserved to be set aside.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut hits back at Jaya Bachchan, asks if her stance would change if Shweta, Abhishek were targeted insteadThe petition said her lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, visited the premises on September 9 to give the officer present there a copy of her petition and to inform him that it was to be heard. It added the officer locked the gate from inside and continued with the demolition.Ranaut said valuable property like chandeliers and rare artworks were damaged. She sought interim relief to take steps to make the property “capable of use” after the demolition.The Bombay high court on September 9 stayed further demolition of the actor’s alleged unauthorised structures hours after the BMC started the exercise. It said the BMC’s action “prima facie did not appear to be bonafide and smacked of malafide”.

15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers’ leader wants Centre’s undertaking on MSP for foodgrains||Hours before meeting Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Delhi on Tuesday, Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said that farmers of the state want the Centre to give an undertaking that foodgrain procurement will continue under the minimum support price (MSP). “We want the Centre to give an undertaking that foodgrain procurement will continue under the MSP. Let private players buy foodgrains from farmers, but it must be guaranteed that they will not be allowed to procure the produce below the MSP decided by the Centre,” Charuni said. He, however, dismissed as an eyewash the efforts of a panel of three BJP MPs to reach out to the state’s farmers over the weekend. Haryana BJP president OP Dhankar had deputed three party MPs to meet farm union leaders to allay the fears of agitating farmers on the agriculture ordinances. Dhankar, state agriculture minister JP Dalal, the three MPs, namely Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and Hisar MP Brijendra Singh, and farmer representatives are calling on Tomar on Tuesday. “We will hand over a report based on the feedback and suggestions given by the farmers to the Union agriculture minister,” Dhankar said. Charuni, who has been invited for the talks, said, “The primary objective behind setting up the three MPs’ committee was to throw dust into the eyes of agitating farmers. This panel was set up to mislead the farmers and defuse the crisis,” said Charuni, who hails from a village near Shahbad. “What is the locus standi of this committee? This is an eyewash. Is this MSP issue only confined to Haryana? It pertains to farmers of the entire country,” he said. FARMERS IN PROTEST MODE Farmers, who have been in protest mode and were prevented from holding a rally at Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra against the Centre’s recent agriculture ordinances, were lathicharged last week, putting the government on the backfoot. On Monday, the three MPs’ panel handed over is report to Dhankar in Delhi. By evening, Charuni, who has been leading the farmers stir in Haryana, was invited to hold talks first with BJP MP Dharambir Singh and then Union agriculture minister Tomar on Tuesday. While the ruling BJP in Haryana has accused the opposition, particularly the Congress, of trying to politicise the issue and creating a doubt in the minds of farmers about the three agriculture ordinances. Dalal clarified that the ordinances introduced by the Centre has only given an option to farmers that if a private agency wants to buy grains from outside government mandis at a price higher than the MSP then farmers can sell their crop at a higher price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-leader-wants-centre-s-undertaking-on-msp-for-foodgrains/story-oaj3ptcGtjrNjlLlOQgaTI.html

The child was brought to Aditya Birla Hospital’s flu clinic with complaints of high grade fever (more than 102F every 8-12 hours) along with sore throat, malaise and nausea since the past five days with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR report. There were no complaints of cough and breathlessness, as per the hospital authorities. Her course of treatment was planned in a way that both her medical conditions of dengue and Covid-19 could be treated. Dr Vrushali Bichkar, a consultant at the hospital, said, “She was examined on an immediate basis. Her initial physical examination revealed a temperature of 103 F with tachycardia, a condition that makes one’s heart beat more than 100 times per minute. There was no respiratory distress with her oxygen saturation (spO2) levels being 98% on room air, but she had comorbid condition of overweight (BMI – 25.6). Her outside reports suggested leucopoenia, a condition where the number of white cells reduce in the blood and her chest X-ray report showed bilateral infiltrates.”She was immediately admitted to the isolation ward. Her laboratory tests were conducted and initial screening reported worsening of leucopoenia, with normal platelets, deranged liver enzyme and raised inflammatory markers, according to hospital authorities. On the second day of her admission, the child developed erythematous maculopapular rash (abnormal redness and rash of both flat and raised lesion) on trunk (torso) and extremities. Her lab tests revealed that the WBC count had further reduced along with her platelets count.“We conducted tests for NS1 and anti-IgM dengue, the results of which came positive. The patient was admitted on August 12 and we followed her up till two weeks to make sure that it was a primary dengue infection in a Covid-19 patient,” added Bichkar.“It is important for paediatricians and physicians to be increasingly aware of the phenomena of co-infection,” added Dr Rahul Kallianpur, associate director, department of Neonatology and Paediatrics.Repeat Covid RT-PCR test results turned out to be negative. The WBC and platelet count had normalised. Patient was discharged on oral vitamins in healthy condition.However, Dr Pradeep Suryavashi, working with Bharati hospital, paediatric ward, said, “This is not a rare case because we have reported two such infections in children too. The viral antigens of both Covid-19 and dengue are similar and so they may test positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/city-hospital-treats-10-year-old-with-paediatric-co-infection-of-dengue-and-covid-19/story-YSbfNqbmiKVPxysXgWVaBM.html

On Tuesday, the court of district and sessions judge Summeet Malhotra in Faridkot allowed the special investigation team’s (SIT) application seeking pardon to inspector Pardeep, the then reader to former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma, to make him approver. Last week, SIT member IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had told the court that the then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal were main conspirators in the Behbal Kalan firing episode.District attorney Rajnish Goyal said the court had allowed the application moved by SIT under Section 306 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). “On August 25, Pardeep requested to be made an approver, as he is willing to disclose full and true facts. We argued that the disclosure by the Pardeep would unfold the genesis of the crime, which would be helpful in the success of the case against the main accused,” Goyal said.The court order states that Pardeep had recorded a statement before the duty magistrate on September 3. “The sealed envelope was opened in court on September 10 and a copy was supplied to the SIT to seek assistance, so as to find out whether the accused is disclosing full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances...as envisaged under Section 306 of the CrPC, one of the SIT members, IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, have expressed satisfaction regarding the disclosure,” the court stated.“Such kind of offence is generally committed in complete secrecy and as such it is very hard to prove the offence, especially due to lack of appropriate evidence. In these circumstances, that the grant of pardon to an accused, who participated in the crime and also privy to all necessary information and evidence becomes necessary to bring home the guilt of the main accused,” the court added.“The request of the prosecution is accepted and the accused inspector is granted pardon, subject to the condition that he will disclose true and correct facts in the court, while deposing as prosecution witness. If at any subsequent stage, it is found that Pardeep has not deposed about true and correct facts and violated the conditions of grant of pardon, he shall be tried again as an accused,” the order added.Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village were killed in police firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib. Many were seriously injured.Besides Pardeep, the SIT had named former Moga SSP Sharma, SP Bikramjit Singh, former Bajakhana SHO Amarjit Singh Kular, Faridkot-based lawyer Sohail Singh Brar and Moga-based car dealer Pankal Bansal as accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/accused-cop-turns-approver-in-behbal-kalan-firing-case/story-QCxL6bS3NIp1JHeC8SO6nI.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||2 Mumbai plots shortlisted for 5,000-bed hospital for infectious diseases||With the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to light the inadequate health facilities in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has shortlisted two land parcels in Mulund and Bhandup to set up a 5,000-bed hospital for infectious diseases. Civic officials are now making field visits to finalise one of these two land parcels that are spread across 20 acres each. Even though Mumbai currently has jumbo Covid facilities, the proposed hospital will cater to the city as well as areas of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including Thane, Palghar and Raigad. Currently, the city has Kasturba Hospital at Chinchpokli, the only dedicated infectious diseases hospital, which has just 125 beds. During the initial phase of the pandemic, there was a huge crisis of Covid beds in the city, which left patients struggling to find a bed and led to loss of lives. Following this, BMC involved private hospitals to reserve beds for Covid patients and constructed make-shift jumbo facilities dedicated for Covid treatment. Currently, BMC has a bed capacity of 16,063 in dedicated Covid hospitals and jumbo hospitals, and 23,673 beds in Covid Care Centre-2 (for patients with mild symptoms). Also, there are 46,589 beds in CCC-1 facilities where high-risk contacts are quarantined. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (health), told HT on Saturday, “We have shortlisted two places in Mulund and Bhandup. The land will be acquired through the acquisition process. I am awaiting reports on the basis of field visits that are to be submitted.” In a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in July, it was decided to construct a new dedicated hospital for infectious diseases and locate it centrally. In the last week of July, the civic body had invited expression of interest (EOI) from landowners and developers for acquisition of the land parcel for construction of the hospital. As per the EOI conditions, the land parcel to be acquired should be around 20 acres which should be close to the Western Express Highway and Eastern Express Highway, and should have a 90-foot wide accessible road development plan for direct access to the hospital. The EOI also stated that the land should have a clear title and be free of any disputes. A senior civic official said, “It is imperative for the city to have a large hospital which is well-equipped and can also cater to patients from the MMR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-mumbai-plots-shortlisted-for-5-000-bed-hospital-for-infectious-diseases/story-6Dj3BXf1ZPRmg6zYDro2zJ.html

The administration must depute additional manpower and keep testing facilities open on all days of the week so that employees get weekly offs, but at the same time, PMC is able to test many people. Even though private labs are conducting tests, citizens believe that PMC testing facilities give accurate results.”Meanwhile, the NCP on Monday started a Covid-19 help desk in all the assembly constituencies. The Covid brigade of the NCP will work as a helpline and inform citizens about testing facilities, bed situation in the hospitals and also counsel patients.Minister of state for forest Dattatray Bharne inaugurated the Covid-19 help desk at Parvati assembly constituency on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/keep-testing-facilities-open-on-sunday-public-holidays-ncp-s-tambe/story-wkYm6UebK8Ct5N9GZy41RO.html
15-09-2020||Pune||Bajirao road residents see footpath dwellers as potential super spreaders; police promise action||The lockdown had been implemented to ensure that the chain of the virus spread is broken, however, there were many whose lives had been uprooted because of the pandemic. Among them were 50 homeless individuals who moved to the footpaths near Maharana Pratap Garden to get daily supply of ration from the food packets distributed there during the lockdown. Now, they call it their permanent home as they get daily meal packets and it is source of constant fear for residents of Bajirao road who believe that without masks, proper hygiene and social distancing, these homeless individuals living off the footpath may become super spreaders of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. (Super spreaders are potential carriers of the viral infection who could infect a large number of people coming in their contact.) Residents have raised the issue with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and also the police department, but no action has been taken so far. Ashish Mahadalkar, PMC assistant municipal commissioner and Kasba Vishrambaugwada ward officer accepted the possible threat of the virus spread among the locals due to the homeless individuals. “I have personally written twice to the local police station to take action against them. We have also received complaints from citizens and as a precautionary measure we sanitise the footpath and nearby areas regularly, but these homeless individuals need to be shifted. There is a risk of spreading the infection,” said Mahadalkar. As on September 13, Kasba peth ward, which covers Bajirao road, had 96 active Covid cases. According to Mahadalkar, these 96 cases were spread across the ward with some cases reported from the area around Maharana Pratap garden. The area has a garden, a bus stop, a telephone office, a small snack centre, one restaurant and several other shops, which makes it crowded throughout the day. “I board the bus for my office from the bus stop near Maharana Pratap Garden daily and see these homeless individuals on the footpath with their belongings. They eat and sleep here and the entire footpath lacks hygiene. Police should immediately take action and PMC should clean the footpaths,” said Archana Pathak, a resident. Kalpana B, president of Subhashnagar senior citizens group, which is close to this spot, said, “Citizens living in the area are afraid of crossing the road because of the fear of virus spread. The Covid cases are rising here, the civic administration needs to take action against them. We have filed a complaint with the local police station and are awaiting their action.” Bharat Jadhav, senior police inspector at Khadak police station, under whose jurisdiction this area comes, said, “These homeless individuals came here from different parts of the city during the lockdown to get food. NGOs still continue to give them food packets daily, so they made the footpath their home. We have received complaints from residents and this week, we will take necessary action. All of them will be taken to government shelter homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bajirao-road-residents-see-footpath-dwellers-as-potential-super-spreaders-police-promise-action/story-O1pO2qWFKTrdASXIeRWEjP.html

The Sikh activists started an indefinite protest on Monday at the main gate of the Teja Singh Samundri Hall, the headquarters of the apex gurdwara body that is facing flak from the community over the missing saroops. Besides criminal cases against the negligent SGPC functionaries, the activists want the saroops located. Overnight, SGPC employees raised iron barricades at three points to isolate the activists on protest and blocked the entry to the Golden Temple from Gurdwara Baba Atal Rai Sahib and Manji Sahib Diwan Hall. Due to the blockade, the activists, including the injured nihang, could not join the agitating activists outside Sri Guru Ram Das Serai. “They were sitting peacefully when the SGPC task force planned to disperse them. They snatched their lathis and started hitting the protesters with them to disperse them. The turbans of two activists fell down and a nihang was injured,” an eyewitness said. After an hour, more activists gathered at the spot and the situation became tense. Visitors to the holiest shrine of the Sikhs were facing inconvenience due to the blockades put up by the SGPC. Mediapersons covering the incident also came under attack by SGPC employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tension-outside-golden-temple-after-sgpc-uses-force-to-disperse-sikhs-protesting-against-missing-guru-granth-sahib-saroops/story-YuDakkoeT3HqDkGl3ynTgO.html

15-09-2020||City||Covid-19: As numbers rise, Rajasthan to conduct sero survey||The Rajasthan government will conduct sero survey to ascertain the extent of coronavirus infection. The decision came amid the admission that the state had entered the mild community spread stage. Serological survey helps the government in estimating the proportion of the population that might have been exposed to the virus. This is done by checking for antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in blood samplesConducting sero survey in the state was one of the suggestions by country’s top doctors in an open dialogue with state’s political and bureaucratic leadership on Tuesday. Three of country’s top doctors – Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director of Medanta-The Medicity; Dr Devi Shetty, chairman of Narayana group of hospitals; and Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences – spoke about the current Covid scenario, lauding Rajasthan government’s proactive approach in checking the spread and urging people to use mask. The experts recalled the Bhilwara model of containment as an effective early stage management protocol and use of 80,000 ‘swasthya mitras’ as effective corona warriors. MPs, MLAs, panchayat elected representatives and common people connected themselves with this dialogue through online platforms like Facebook and YouTube. Officials said around 200,000 people were logged in to the dialogue. The doctors stressed the need to follow health protocols to fight the pandemic and said the Covid-19 graph will start declining in four weeks if people wore masks properly. “Pandemic is fought on the ground, by people, not in hospitals. If the state government can strictly implement ‘no mask, no entry’ policy at all public places, the rate of infection will drop significantly,” said Dr Sarin. He said Covid-19 was a type of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and he had expanded it to S for samaj (society), A for aap (you) and RS for Rajasthan Sarkar. “These are three pillars of fighting Covid,” he said, “and the most important pillar is you, the people. The more careful we are with using masks, the earlier it will go.” “Covid is out of control not because of inactivity of government, but because of indifference of people,” said Dr Shetty, adding that mask use can bring down Covid spread significantly. “The country must go back to work but with protection. Remember, every asymptomatic carrier can infect at least three people,” he added. Dr Trehan said the fight against coronavirus had to be fought by three components – government, doctors and health workers, and people. “Governments have been proactive in checking the spread and doctors are fighting the pandemic in hospitals but people have become careless,” he said. Earlier, state’s principal secretary of medical and health Akhil Arora gave an overview of the infection in Rajasthan and said the state had entered the stage of mild community spread. He said the state’s efforts had led to lower infection and death rate than the national average. “Recovery rate in Rajasthan is 82.16%, higher than the national average of 78.29%; and the death rate in state was 1.2% against the national average of 1.64%,” he said. Minister of state for health Subhash Garg said the state government will follow suggestions of doctors of conducting antibody survey and following the ‘no mask, no entry’ policy. Earlier, chief minister Ashok Gehlot welcomed the three doctors and health minister Raghu Sharma spoke about the state government’s efforts towards fighting the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-as-numbers-rise-rajasthan-to-conduct-sero-survey/story-pTa5JBOgxvGCLYOmpUHuvM.html
15-09-2020||City||Missing saroops: Sikh outfits launch stir outside SGPC office; SAD (Democratic) protests in Sangrur||Members of Sikh organisations, owing allegiance to the Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, launched an indefinite morcha (agitation) outside the Teja Singh Samundri Hall, headquarters of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), on Monday. They say that they are seeking justice in the case of missing saroops of the Guru Granth Sahib and want a criminal case registered against dismissed SGPC staffers. On August 27, the SGPC executive had resolved to file criminal cases against its staffers dismissed for their role in the misappropriation of saroops. A week later, it had taken a U-turn. Monday’s development came after members of Sikh organisations were denied entry to the Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in the Golden Temple complex for conducting a meeting on the issue of the saroops. Sikh activists had reached the premises of the Golden Temple about 9.30am. The SGPC, however, had locked its doors. On its outer gate, cops were deployed in civvies. After being denied entry, they sat in the front of the hall. Later, the SGPC sent its officials, including Sukhdev Singh Bhoora and Mahinder Singh Ahli, requesting the protesters to vacate the space, citing the maryada of the shrine. They, then, shifted to the main gate of the Teja Singh Samundri Hall to launch an indefinite morcha, which was continuing till the time of filing of this report. A meeting between representatives of the Sikh bodies and the SGPC remained inconclusive. Senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta, Ahli, Bhoora represented the SGPC in the meeting. Protesters said they want the culprits in the missing saroops case to be booked under a criminal case, and the whereabouts of the missing saroops to be ascertained, but the SGPC did not give an assurance. Source said the SGPC may convene an executive committee meeting on September 18 to review its decisions. In a late evening statement, the SGPC said the agitation had hurt the sentiments of devotees visiting the shrine. “We heard the Satkar Committee respectfully, but its act has hurt the sangat’s sentiments. This kind of attitude suggests that these protesters want to defame the SGPC deliberately by cornering it on this issue. They don’t want to resolve this issue with talks,” added Mehta.DELEGATION MEETS LONGOWALMembers of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) on Monday held a protest at Longowal village in Sangrur district over the saroops (copies) of Guru Granth Sahib that went missing from the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) printing house in Amritsar. A party delegation led by former minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan, ex-deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh and former MP Paramjit Kaur Gulshan met SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal at his residence and demanded that the findings of the panel constituted to look into the matter should be made public. Bir Devinder said Longowal was responsible being the head of the gurdwara body. He said that the case should be sent to an independent investigation agency instead of the Akal Takht. Longowal said the protest by SAD (Democratic) was held with a political motive. “The SGPC has taken action against the guilty. It was a religious issue and after taking the opinion of various scholars, we decided not to hand it over to the police,”he added. “The panj pyare (the five beloved ones), who were asked by the protesters to lead the delegation, told me that the SAD (Democratic) members violated the Sikh ‘maryada’ and ignored them. The outfit should apologise for this,” added the SGPC chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-saroops-sikh-outfits-launch-stir-outside-sgpc-office-sad-democratic-protests-in-sangrur/story-SDXMtlZG4cJ6bkc7rlaYwK.html

During the hearing, which was live streamed for the media, Chadha said, “Facebook India’s refusal to appear before the committee is an attempt to conceal crucial facts regarding the social media firm’s role in the communal riots in north-east Delhi in February. This non-cooperation shows that Facebook India wants to hide its role in the riots,” Chadha said.Also read: ‘Politically-sophisticated’ attempt to influence Delhi elections on Facebook before it was taken down, says ex-employeeHe said that instead of appearing before the committee, the company sent a letter to the panel. In its reply to the committee’s notice, Facebook said Parliament, which has exclusive rights, is looking into the issue and the Union government has the law and order rights over the national capital.Chadha cited the response as contempt of Delhi’s two crore residents because legislators are elected representatives.“State legislative functions are independent of the parliamentary functions. Facebook India has said the issue is under the jurisdiction of Parliament. This is totally wrong,” he said. “Since this issue is sensitive in nature and is related to Delhi’s peace and harmony, we have decided to issue a last warning to Facebook India under the principle of natural justice. We want to give the opportunity to every accused to be heard. We are giving a last chance to appear before the committee.The panel will send another notice to Facebook India. It will also explain to the company about the privileges of the Delhi assembly panel,” he added.A reaction from Facebook India was not immediately available.The Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee had on September 12 issued a notice to Mohan in connection with complaints about the social media company’s alleged “deliberate and intentional inaction to contain hateful content” in the country.The notice was issued after the committee, in its second hearing on August 31, had said prima facie it had found that Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the north-east Delhi riots in February, which had left 53 people dead and over 400 injured.The committee is investigating the matter after it took cognisance of “several complaints” received from the public based on an article published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.The report titled, ‘Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics’, had stated that the company’s officials, especially Ankhi Das, the public policy director for India, south and central Asia, allegedly cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate-speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the country.The bid to invoke hate-speech rules were allegedly glossed over, despite concerns were flagged internally.India is the biggest market for the social media company, which is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, United States of America (USA). There are over 290 million Facebook users in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/facebook-gets-delhi-assembly-panel-s-warning-as-official-fails-to-appear-before-it/story-5jijlxuddz7zvE8dGsoJcL.html

15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court grants former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini interim protection from arrest in 1991 case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted interim protection from arrest to former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in the 1991 alleged murder case of a junior engineer, Balwant Singh Multani. A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah sought response from the Punjab government on Saini’s plea challenging the Punjab and Haryana high court order refusing to grant him anticipatory bail in the case. During the hearing, the bench questioned senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the Punjab government, that what is the hurry in arresting Saini after 29 years of the case. Luthra replied that the former DGP having Z-plus security is absconding. The bench posted the matter for hearing after four weeks and said that Saini is not to be arrested till further orders and he shall cooperate in the investigation. On September 8, the high court had dismissed Saini’s two pleas, including the one on anticipatory bail, observing that the same cannot be allowed as there is every likelihood of him stifling fair investigation and trial. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi represented Saini, a 1982-batch Indian Police Service officer, who was booked along with six others on May 6 at Mataur police station in Mohali for the alleged kidnapping of Multani. The murder charge was invoked in August after two of the accused policemen turned approvers. Multani worked with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) and was picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, who was then Chandigarh senior superintendent of police. Saini was injured in the attack and three policemen were killed. Saini retired in 2018 after 36 years of service. ‘POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CONSPIRACY’ Saini claims that the case against him is an example of “politically motivated conspiracy” by the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab. He says he was granted bail by the trial court after the registration of the FIR, hence, it should continue. In 2008, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also registered a case against him that was later quashed by the Supreme Court. This is another argument put forward by Saini who added that when Covid-19 was at a peak, under “a politically motivated conspiracy, an FIR was registered against him on the same facts by the state machinery”. Saini was part of the then director general of police KPS Gill’s team that helped eliminate terrorism in the state. His bail petition mentioned his outstanding service record. The petition also said that after abatement of terrorism in Punjab, the applicant has been involved in unearthing scams and scandals. He served as head of the state Vigilance Bureau from 2007 to 2012 and during his tenure “a number of criminal cases were registered against members of the political party, which is now in power in the state of Punjab”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/supreme-court-grants-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-interim-protection-from-arrest-in-1991-case/story-0kVpksWcxa6BX1AspRALeO.html

After the meeting, Sharma said, “The law should treat everyone the same way.

Gupta said following the inputs, the police launched a drive to ensure thorough checking of all those entering the state from various parts of the country, thus leading to the arrest of Harjeet Singh, alias Raju, and Shamsher Singh, alias Shera, both residents of Mianpur village in Tarn Taran district. Six sophisticated weapons (a 9mm pistol, four .32-calibre pistols and one .32 revolver), eight rounds of ammunition, mobile phones and an internet dongle were recovered from the duo, who were arrested at the checkpost near Hotel Jashan on the Rajpura-Sirhind road by a police team, comprising ASI Gurdarshan Singh, head constable Jora Singh and Punjab Home Guard Pritpal Singh. A case was registered under Sections 212, 216, 120-Bof the IPC besides Sections 25/ 54/ 59 of the Arms Act, r/w Sections 13, 16, 18, 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act. GOT WEAPONS FROM MP, HARYANA The accused admitted that they received four weapons from Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh, and two arms from Safidon in Jind district of Haryana, the DGP said. Gupta said that the duo is also wanted in an attempt to murder and Arms Act case registered at Sarai Amanat Khan police station in Tarn Taran district. The two men were planning a terror attack in Punjab in connivance with five criminals, namely Shubhdeep Singh of Cheecha in Amritsar, now lodged in Amritsar jail; Amritpal Singh Baath of Mianpur in Tarn Taran district, wanted in 12 cases of murder, attempt to murder, Arms Act in Tarn Taran and Amritsar Rural districts; Randeep Singh of Chheharta, Amritsar, wanted in drug cases in Amritsar, along with Goldy and Ashu, both from Karnal district in Haryana. WERE IN TOUCH WITH JAILED KZF MILITANT Sharing details about Shubhdeep Singh, the DGP said he was an active militant of Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), who was arrested by Punjab Police in September 2019 with the recovery of a China-made drone from Mahawa village in Amritsar district. In April last year, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had filed a chargesheet against him along with eight others, including Akashdeep Singh, Balwant Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Balbir Singh, Maan Singh, Gurdev Singh, Sajanpreet Singh and Romandeep Singh before the special NIA court in Mohali. This case is related to information that Pakistan-based KZF chief Ranjeet Singh, alias Neeta, in connivance with Gurmeet Singh, alias Bagga, a Germany-based KZF operative, had smuggled arms, ammunition, explosives and fake indian currency notes (FICN) into India via drones from Pakistan. Randeep Singh is wanted in a case of attempt to murder, drug smuggling and Arms Act since 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khalistan-terror-module-busted-with-arrest-of-two-men-from-punjab-s-tarn-taran/story-uLSdEmiIAQ4mG4KSPEqo0J.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra orders probe into 2016 attack by BJP MP on ex-army man||The Maharashtra government has ordered a police probe against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Parliament member Unmesh Patil for allegedly assaulting a retired army man in 2016.“In 2016, the then BJP legislator and his accomplices had attacked former army man Sonu Mahajan. The then BJP Government did not give him justice. Since I have received various petitions in this regard, I have asked the Police officials to investigate this matter,” tweeted Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.The move came after the Congress, which is a part of the Maharashtra government, on Sunday raised the issue as the BJP hit out at ruling Shiv Sena workers for allegedly assaulting former navy officer Madan Sharma last week for forwarding a social media post mocking chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Mahajan was assaulted in Maharashtra’s Chalisgaon when Patil was an assembly member.The BJP called the probe against Patil an act of revenge. “They can open any case and get it investigated as this is their right. But then, why were these people silent from 2016 when this incident occurred,” said BJP spokesman Madhav Bhandari. “The problem is that the state government has failed on all fronts and hence is indulging in the politics of vengeance.”The BJP last week called the attack on Sharma “state-sponsored terrorism” and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh even spoke to him.The Shiv Sena has distanced itself from the attack saying it is not right to drag the party into this issue. “The workers did not take permission from us. However, at the same time, it was wrong to provoke people as they have high respect for their leaders,” said Shiv Sena lawmaker Sanjay Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-orders-probe-into-2016-attack-by-bjp-mp-on-ex-army-man/story-Zxf84AFCm9EehBKDArp8MI.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||Social media being used to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday claimed social media platforms are being used systematically to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra.Since the last five to six years, disparaging comments are being made on social media in the name of gossiping and there is no restriction on it, the Shiv Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.Maharashtra and the Marathis are experiencing such a situation for the past some days, it said.“Social media is being used systematically to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra. But if anyone retorts to such gossiping in their own style, then concerns are raised about one’s (the users) freedom of speech,” the Marathi daily said without mentioning any incident.It also referred to Supreme Court judge N V Ramanas recent comment where he said “judges are now becoming victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media postings as they restrain themselves from speaking in their own defence”.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said what Justice Ramana said is true and applies to almost all sectors with its degree varying.The Shiv Sena’s remarks came against the backdrop of its workers recently roughing up a retired Navy officer in Mumbai for circulating on social media a cartoon lampooning Maharashtra Chief Minister and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.The party was also recently engaged in a war of words with Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, who in a Twitter post likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The Shiv Sena, which is in power in Maharashtra along with the NCP and Congress, also said some machineries have to face “false criticism” helplessly due to government obligation, but that does not mean social media users take disadvantage of it.The party also wondered if social media users will show the maturity of understanding what Justice Ramana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-media-being-used-to-defame-mumbai-and-maharashtra-shiv-sena/story-HCY4ht369rw4rJixO2n40N.html

15-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra to survey 2.25 crore families door-to-door from today||In a bid to tackle the surge in Covid -19 cases, the Maharashtra government will kickstart its house-to-house survey ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ from Tuesday. The statewide programme aims to check 2.25 crore families for symptoms of Influenza Like Illness (ILI), Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and co-morbidities. The idea is to effectively curtail the spread with necessary care and also reduce the number of Covid-19 casualties.Under the campaign, health workers will conduct door-to-door surveys during which they will check residents’ body temperature and oxygen levels, besides other symptoms, including tiredness, throat pain, dry cough, diarrhoea, and loss of smell and taste, officials said.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally closer to 5 million, but daily case count drops to 83,809“Those with Covid-19 symptoms will be recommended a swab test. People with ailments such as diabetes, heart and kidney disease as well as obesity will be referred for treatment. Besides, health workers will also impart health education to people, especially on Covid-19,” said a health official.Each team comprising a health worker and two volunteers will survey each and every family of the state twice in over a month. The state is also assigning one doctor to five teams.The first phase of the survey is starting Tuesday. The volunteers are expected to complete it by October 10. The second phase will be conducted between October 12 and 24. Also Read: Coronavirus pandemic: When will there be a Covid-19 cure? The body is still the best virus-killer“Maharashtra is the first state across the country to undertake such an extensive survey in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a senior official from the state health department, requesting anonymity. “The first phase will get us the health status of each and every family in the state that will help in early detection and treatment of the infectious disease, whereas the second phase will be a follow-up to check if other members of the families have developed symptoms. This will enable us to break the chain and reduce its spread. It will further help us bring down the number of Covid-19 deaths,” he added.In his address to the state, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked citizens to participate in the survey. “I want citizens who love Maharashtra to share responsibility and participate in the campaign,” Thackeray said on Sunday.In a meeting called to review the health crisis on Monday, Thackeray emphasised that all elected representatives from the gram panchayat to members of parliament irrespective of their political affiliations must participate to make the campaign successful. “The positivity rate in the districts is now going up. We have erected all facilities, in the last five to six months we have worked day and night, but our challenge is not over yet. We were able to control this (Covid-19) wave during the lockdown. But now we are gradually restarting activities. Looking at the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, we will have to impart education on how to live with the virus through this campaign. The mantra for people will remain to not get infected with the disease,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-maharashtra-to-survey-2-25-crore-families-door-to-door-from-today/story-53Efd79YSNMo9MwbCNeIvM.html

He must think twice before saying anything,” said Kanahiya Das. “Uddhav Thackeray and Shiv Sena are no more welcome in Ayodhya. Why is the Shiv Sena attacking [actor Kangana] Ranaut? The Shiv Sena is not the same what it used to be under Balasaheb Thackeray, the founder of the party.”The saints are angry over the face-off between Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena and Ranaut. The Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation last week demolished parts of Ranaut’s office. Ranaut has hit out at Thackeray and the face-off has triggered demonstrations and a legal battle.“Champat Rai’s statement cannot be accepted. Ayodhya has given too much respect to Rai and he must not take this for granted,” said Raju Das, a priest at Hanuman Garhi. “Champat Rai is not VHP. We are not opposing the VHP. But we are opposing Rai.”Das said Rai must confine himself to activities of the Trust, which has been formed to oversee the construction of the Ram Temple. “He is not a saint. Now, he has started playing divisive politics by dividing saints of Ayodhya like what Britishers did in India.”Das said Thackeray and Shiv Sena are no more welcome in Ayodhya. “Now, the Maharashtra chief minister will face stiff opposition from seers of Ayodhya if he comes here.”Mahant Dharamdas of Nirvani Akhara also condemned Rai’s statement. “Saints of Ayodhya will not be intimidated by Champat Rai. We will continue to oppose Uddhav Thackeray,” said Dharamdas.Rai did not immediately respond to a request for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ayodhya-saints-at-loggerheads-with-champat-rai-for-comment-on-shiv-sena-chief/story-HY3s2dxSSWsAmmKBrbrwRO.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||Using demonetisation ruse, man, 55, cheats Delhi trader of Rs 2 lakh||A 55-year-old man was arrested for allegedly cheating a food grain merchant of Rs 2 lakh after tricking him into believing that the government is demonetising Rs 2,000 currency notes and has already launched new Rs 1,000 notes. The alleged cheat offered to exchange Rs 2,000 notes with the Rs 1,000 notes by claiming that he has managed to procure bundles of the new Rs 1,000 notes, the police said on Tuesday.The conman, identified as Ajay Sharma, was arrested from his home at Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad on Sunday, a day after the food grain merchant from north Delhi’s Lahori Gate Naya Bazar filed a cheating complaint at the local police station, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.“Sharma committed the cheating because he had lost several lakhs of rupees in gambling and was in need of money. We have recovered the complainant’s Rs 2 lakh from Sharma and a scooter he used in the crime,” said Alphonse.On September 11, the police said the complainant was at his shop when around 3 pm an unknown man came there and was talking to someone on his cellphone regarding discontinuation of Rs 2,000 notes by the government of India. The man further claimed that he had bundles of newly published currency notes of Rs 1,000. He asked the person on the other side whether he wanted to buy new Rs 1,000 notes.The complainant, who was listening to the conversation, asked the man if the new Rs 1,000 note had been launched by the government. The man confidently confirmed it and tricked the businessman into believing that the Rs 2,000 notes would soon be demonetised.The businessman showed interest in exchanging Rs 2,000 notes worth Rs 2 lakh. He gave the amount in a bag to his staff member Vishnu Dutt, who left with the man on his scooty. After covering some distance, the man took the bag from Dutt and asked him to go inside a building and collect new Rs 1,000 notes of the same value from his associate, Sunil, the police said.Dutt did not find anyone inside. When he got out, he found the man was missing too. Dutt informed his employer, who filed a case the next day. During the probe, the police found CCTV footage in which the suspect’s scooter registration number was visible, said DCP Alphonse.“We found that the scooter’s owner was Ajay Sharma. His house in Sahibabad was raided. He was arrested along with the money,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/using-demonetisation-ruse-man-55-cheats-delhi-trader-of-rs-2-lakh/story-KVmy79KFNPtkKwJqGwXMBK.html

CBI has registered a case against RB Educational Trust, by an educational trust run by Singh, , who had quit the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in 2018, and others including the then DC Kathua (J&K), the then Tehsildar, then Naib Tehsildar, the then Girdawar, the then Patwari and other unknown persons on the allegations of having facilitated the trust to possess land much beyond the ceiling limit, and submitting false affidavits in support of the trust, causing losses to the State exchequer.Singh had resigned from the party following a row over the rape and murder of an eight-year-old nomadic girl at Rasana in Jammu’s Kathua district in 2018.Searches at nine locations ( three in Jammu and six at Kathua) including at RB Education Trust, the residence of its chairperson and other accused persons are underway.On June 25, CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against RB Educational Trust to probe into the allegations of illegal gratification and extraneous consideration by the revenue and forest officials of Kathua district in allowing the sale and purchase of forest land. The PE alleged that false certificates of the land, which comes under exempted category of Jammu &Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976 were used by the educational trust in its alleged land-grabbing activities. The PE claimed that the trust, a beneficiary of such alleged illegal acts, has in its possession huge tracts of land in gross violation of the ceiling prescribed under the Act.It also alleged that erroneous information was submitted in the Jammu & Kashmir high court (HC) on June 9, 2015 as public interest litigation (PIL) in a bid to favour the trust, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbi-raids-former-j-k-minister-lal-singh-s-premises-in-rajbagh-kathua/story-9tmBe81shumTnpXQ5Z99PJ.html

15-09-2020||Environment||Covid-19 waste: Maharashtra pollution body asks BMC to enhance abatement measures||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has issued a notice to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) private contractor treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and associated biomedical waste to enhance air pollution abatement measures.SMS Envoclean Private Limited, which is located at Govandi (East), is Mumbai’s only biomedical waste treatment facility appointed by the BMC to deal with the city’s Covid-19 waste.The contractor was told by MPCB to boost their scrubber technology to reduce black smoke emitted from its chimney after burning the biomedical waste.Also Read: 70% rise in Mumbai’s pollution levels during first week of SeptemberMPCB said black smoke was being generated from burning a voluminous amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits daily but the unit was not violating emission norms for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). “Plastic contents in the PPE kit when burnt release the black smoke in the vicinity of the unit. As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms, these PPE kits have to be incinerated on the same day they are collected,” said Anant Harshvardhan, regional officer, (Mumbai), MPCB. “Emission levels of SMS Envoclean are being monitored by MPCB and CPCB daily through an online mechanism. The unit has not violated the 80 microgram per cubic metre (μg/m³) 24-hour safe limit for NO2, the major pollutant after the burning of waste. However, based on complaints, we have directed the unit to increase its air pollution control scrubbers to further curb the emission of black smoke.”Also Read: Environment ministry allows virtual public hearings, email submissionsAn air quality researcher, requesting anonymity, pointed out that MPCB was not measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, xylene, toluene, and styrene that are all hazardous to health and are a major by-product from the burning of waste materials. “Besides benzene, CPCB has no standards for other VOCs. Industries measure their own VOCs. But there is no such measure undertaken by MPCB for smaller industrial units,” the researcher said.MPCB authorities confirmed that they do not measure VOCs.MPCB’s direction is based on a September 11 legal notice signed by 100 residents from Govandi, Mankhurd, Deonar and surrounding areas. The notice, issued by advocate Saif Alam to MPCB, cited repeated complaints sent between July and September went unnoticed, nor was there any investigation by the authorities concerned. The notice alleged ignorance by the pollution regulator that residential and slum areas in the vicinity of SMS Envoclean were allegedly breathing poisonous air that are leading to skin ailments. One of the adjoining slums to SMS Envoclean had reported 8.9% Covid-19-related deaths, the notice pointed out. “There has to be a stringent action against this unit. Ignoring such complainants or delaying action will only create more damage to the residents, who are suffering from tuberculosis (TB) and asthma,” said Alam, a local resident and a patient of allergic bronchitis. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, the risk factor has doubled,” he said.In 2018, MPCB had issued a closure notice to SMS Envoclean after it had failed to meet safety standards under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.However, the unit managed to obtain a stay on the order from the Bombay high court (HC). “Later, they refurbished their air pollution control system in full compliance as per the norms,” said Harshvardhan.HT had reported on August 29 that Mumbai’s Covid-19 waste had reported a 104% rise over three months, and the waste incineration unit had run out of storage space at its one-acre plant. SMS Envoclean said biomedical waste quantity rose from an average of 12,200 kilograms (kg) per day in June to 24,880 kg per day on average since August.“Our capacity for incineration is 24,000 kg per day across four chambers that can withstand a maximum temperature of 1,200 degrees Celsius (C). Each unit is lined with bricks to control temperature. However, burning PPE kits is raising the temperature significantly by melting the lining of bricks. As a result, we had to function on either two or three incinerators per day, sparing time for maintenance of overused chambers,” said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean. “However, as far as air pollution control is concerned, we have a detailed procedure (see box) for abatement, and every incineration chamber is fitted with scrubbers working to their optimal capacity. Safety limits have never been violated,” he added.In August, MPCB had granted permission to SMS Envoclean for sending excess biomedical waste weighing up to 5,000 kg per day to another unit in Taloja in Navi Mumbai called Mumbai Waste Management Limited on the condition that the contractor would bear the cost at Rs 97 per kg. “So far, we have received a bill in excess of Rs 1 crore for outsourcing excess incinerated waste,” said Nilawar. Harshvardhan said this mechanism would also help curb any excess emission from the plant’s Govandi (East) unit.Contrary to MPCB’s claim, Alam has called for shutting down the unit as it violates safe air quality standards. “Since this matter concerns the health of citizens, we will move the Supreme Court (SC) if necessary, to ensure this unit is dismantled,” he said.However, BMC said they did not have an alternate option for Covid-19 waste incineration in Mumbai yet. “We have asked the local ward office (M East) to check with SMS Envoclean about pollution- related concerns raised by the local residents. Parallel talks are in progress with MPCB to ascertain these allegations,” said a BMC official.HOW MUMBAI’S WASTE INCINERATOR SAYS IT IS CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTIONSMS Envoclean said they had built a mechanism to ensure minimal emission, as around 25,000 kg of Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste are being incinerated daily at the private waste treatment centre.“We follow a process of second combustion through scrubbing and water sprinkling to remove hazardous pollutants. Initially, the waste is incinerated in a chamber and the resultant hazardous smoke is transferred to another chamber, where it is burnt for the second time ridding the air of harmful pollutants. Later, it is sent to a third chamber, where the air is filtered using a scrubber. Finally, it is sent to a fourth chamber, where a water sprinkler using chemicals further purifies the air before residual steam is released from the chimney. The chimney is located at a height much above the peripheral residential area and the almost colourless steam disperses quickly into the air. No black soot or smoke is visible,” said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/covid-19-waste-maharashtra-pollution-body-asks-bmc-to-enhance-abatement-measures/story-lzr9LvpSqnFJV1dLaeKlvJ.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi sero survey: Results of third round expected this week||The results of the third round of the serological surveillance in Delhi is likely to be released within the week, with the team of researchers having analysed all the 17,000 samples that had been collected during the first five days of the month. Also read: India’s Covid-19 recoveries highest in the world, data shows“The result of the third round of sero survey will likely be out within this week,” said one of the researchers. The serological survey helps the government in estimating the proportion of the population that might have been exposed to the virus causing coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and developed immunity to it. This is done by checking for antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in blood samples. After the first round of the serological survey was conducted from June 27 to July 10 with assistance from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the Delhi government decided to conduct the surveys at the beginning of every month to map the actual spread of the infection. The first round of sero survey in Delhi had revealed that an estimated 22.6% had antibodies against Covid-19, which translates into about 4.5 million people in Delhi having had the infection. At the time, Delhi had reported just over 100,000 positive cases through testing. A representative sample of 20,000 people had been tested by the government for the study. The second round of sero surveillance, headed by the Maulana Azad Medical College, was conducted between August 1 and 7 when 15,000 samples were collected district-wise to check the burden of disease. For this survey, 29% of the total samples had antibodies against Covid-19, which translates to about 5.8 million of Delhi’s 20 million population. Through testing for the infection using nasal swabs, just over 142,000 positive cases had been detected. The results for the third round of sero survey, for which 17,000 samples had been collected ward-wise – will show whether Delhi is close to achieving herd immunity. “Many people with Covid-19 are asymptomatic and hence do not go to a healthcare facility or get tested. Sero survey helps to estimate the true burden of disease and what percentage of the cases were asymptomatic. There are some studies which show with 40 to 60% of the population being infected, the transmission goes down,” Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Indian Institute of Science had told HT earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sero-survey-results-of-third-round-expected-this-week/story-9LLeFJU0skRYi0G4EP7QoL.html

It was mainly because energy consumption in 2013-14 was unusually high and energy consumption in 2018-19 was unusually low.An official of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) said an effective curb on power pilferage in Kanpur was responsible for negative or slow growth in power demand in the city during the last decade. “The power consumption in the city dropped after a check was put on pilferage,” the official said.The report said the energy requirement in Kanpur may grow at a faster pace as there may not be further sharp reduction in line losses that had already dropped.In Agra, the peak demand, as per the report, is expected to see CAGR of 4.49% up to 2024-25 and will reach 929 MW in comparison to 746 MW in 2019-20. It is expected to reach 1122 MW in year 2029-30 with a CAGR of 3.85% after 2024-25.In Agra also, the energy requirement growth in the recent past was found negligible and the city observed CAGR of 0.38% during the period from 2013-14 to 2018-19.“The decline in energy requirement growth was primarily on account of reduction in T&D losses that fell from around 47% to 20.78% during the same period,” the report pointed out. Industry load low in UP’s mega citiesIn what is indicative of low industrialisation, it is not the industry but the domestic sector that was the biggest user of electricity in UP’s mega cities in 2018-19.As per the EPS, domestic sector or residential consumers alone had as high as 58% share in the total power consumed in Lucknow followed by commercial users (markets, malls etc) with 15% share while industry’s share was a mere 9% which was the lowest of all the four mega cities.Once known for its industries, Kanpur also had the domestic sector as the biggest consumer of electricity (49%) followed by industrial (32%) and commercial (13%).In Agra, domestic sector was the biggest consumer of electricity (39%) followed by industrial and irrigation at 20% each.Similarly, the domestic sector was the biggest consumer of electricity (35%) in Varanasi too followed by industrial (27%) and commercial (25%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-to-record-highest-power-demand-growth-in-up-in-next-decade/story-DSdceKjC6zgieHaCWtuuzO.html

The farmers started laying siege to the Harike bridge connecting Majha and Malwa, the Beas bridge on Amritsar-Delhi highway and the Hargobindpur bridge in Gurdaspur around 12:30pm. Though the police in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts had already diverted the traffic in the morning, hundreds of commuters were left stranded for several hours. The protest continued till filing of the report in the evening. Addressing the protesters at Beas bridge, Kisan Sangharash Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “The Centre should immediately revoke the three agriculture ordinances, which are anti-farmer as well as anti-people. Similarly, the Electricity Amendment Bill should also not be passed in Parliament.” He said, “Our protest is not only to awaken the Central government, but also to the opposition parties which should strongly oppose the three ordinances. There are more than 200 MPs from the farming communities. They should also support the farmers’ concerns. If these ordinances are not revoked, we will not allow any MP or leader to enter the villages.”He said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) should take a tough stand on the issue. “Also, the Punjab government should also exert pressure on the Centre to revoke the ordinances. People are coming out on the roads and the situation will worsen if the Union government does not roll back its decision,” he said.At the Harike bridge, Sangharsh Committee’s Punjab president Satnam Singh Pannu said they were appealing to the people of various communities to support the farmers’ concern.At Hargobindpur bridge, farmer leader Kuldeep Singh said, “Despite our repeated protests against the ordinances, the government didn’t pay heed to our concerns and now we are forced to block the roads. The protests will be intensified in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-protesting-centre-s-agri-ordinances-lay-siege-to-3-bridges-for-hours/story-UqmivWsqv1ayC5PbjXAKzJ.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Never backed Centre’s agri ordinances, says Punjab CM||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday rejected the Centre’s claim that the state was taken on board before the promulgation of farm-related ordinances presented in Parliament and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to go ahead with the legislation. Amarinder was reacting to a statement of Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Raosaheb Patil Danve in Parliament. Danve had said a high-powered committee on agriculture had decided on the ordinances after due consideration by all member states. The CM said at no point did Punjab endorse any such move. Pointing out that Punjab was initially excluded from the committee set up by the Centre in July 2019, Captain said it was only after his government’s protest the state was included in the panel in August 2019. By that time, the committee had already held its first meeting, he said. In the second meeting, on August 16, 2019, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal represented Punjab, and only certain fiscal issues related to agriculture were discussed, he said. Subsequently, the draft report of the committee was circulated for comments and Punjab had again made its stand clear, strongly opposing any move to dilute the farmer-friendly laws, the CM said. “The central government did not address Punjab’s comments and, in fact, there was no meeting or discussion at all thereafter. Instead, the Centre chose to promulgate the ordinances in June 2020,” he added. Amarinder also announced that he will lead an 11-member Congress delegation on Wednesday to submit a memorandum against the ordinances to the governor. Besides the chief minister, the delegation will comprise Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, ministers and MLAs, an official spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/never-backed-centre-s-agri-ordinances-says-punjab-cm/story-ke4kHHEpkIcyRUdswC1WNK.html

The police suspect that the accused, Rameshwar Harijan, has committed similar offences earlier, too. According to senior police inspector Bhardak Pawar of Borivali GRP, Harijan boarded the train without a valid permit. Local train services in Mumbai are suspended for common citizens and only essential service workers are allowed to travel after showing a valid permit. The incident occurred on Friday around 10.30pm between Borivli and Kandivli stations when the 22-year-old nurse was on her way for night shift at a government hospital from Goregaon. Harijan boarded the train when it halted between Kandivli and Borivli stations. He allegedly molested the nurse and continued his journey, said the police. The nurse got off at Borivli station and approached the GRP. The officers said Harijan was caught on CCTV while alighting the train at Dahisar. Based on a tip-off, GRP officers laid a trap at Dahisar station and arrested Harijan. Officers said that Harijan was seen on CCTVs at several other stations on all the three suburban railway lines in the city and is suspected to have committed similar crimes. “We are now verifying the complaints and trying to cross-check Harijan’s face with the CCTV recordings that we have in the other molestation cases” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/borivli-grp-arrests-24-year-old-for-molesting-nurse-on-mumbai-s-local-train/story-i7TcmeZfXwj2qmKe9Ve6oI.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||Notice for fashion designer Manish Malhotra is ready, not issued yet: Mumbai municipal corporation clarifies after action against actor Kangana Ranaut||A week after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) inspected the bungalow of fashion designer Manish Malhotra – actor Kangana Ranaut’s neighbour at Bandra’s Pali Hill – over alleged structural violations, the civic body on Monday clarified that while it has prepared a notice related to the alterations, it has not served it yet.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called BMC’s “approach towards illegal structures selective ”, stating that structural violations at Ranaut’s office were demolished within 24 hours.The notice generated by BMC (a copy of which is with HT), names Malhotra under section 351 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act. The notice states illegal construction/commencement of work and mentions four violations – contrary to the section 342 and 346 of the MMC Act. It mentions that there is unauthorised change of user from residential to commercial office and addition and alteration by way of constructing partitions/cabins on the first floor; unauthorised construction of structure with brick wall and shed with sheet roof on the second floor terrace. The notice asks Malhotra to show sufficient evidence for the construction and alterations, failing which, the said work will be pulled down and BMC could take action against him under section 475A of the MMC Act, which includes punishment of imprisonment and fine. Vinayak Vispute, additional municipal commissioner, H-West ward, which covers Bandra, said, “We have not issued any notice to Malhotra yet. There is no question of demolition of any illegal construction at his house yet. There is some construction adjoining bungalows of both Ranaut and Malhotra. However, Ranaut’s matter is in court, and we do not want to exercise any contempt of court.”Malhotra’s spokesperson was not available for a comment. Ranaut was issued a notice under section 354 (A) of the MMC Act by BMC on September 8, giving her 24 hours to explain the alleged illegal construction or face action. The next day, BMC went ahead with the demolition, citing that her explanation was not satisfactory. Ranaut then approached the court, which put a stay on the matter till further hearing. The actor has been involved in a bitter war of words with Maharashtra’s ruling party Shiv Sena, which also controls BMC, after she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “Why has the BMC not served the notice for illegalities despite generating it? It is clear that the notice and the subsequent demolition at Ranaut’s house was an act of revenge by singling her out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/notice-for-fashion-designer-manish-malhotra-is-ready-not-issued-yet-mumbai-municipal-corporation-clarifies-after-action-against-actor-kangana-ranaut/story-8ayNfT7IXPJXREoPnCM1lK.html
15-09-2020||City||Actor Kangana Ranaut leaves Mumbai; political parties in Maharashtra slug it out||As actor Kangana Ranaut left Mumbai for her hometown in Manali on Monday, political parties in Maharashtra continued to fight it out. While the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) criticised her, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned the state government for allowing her to leave. Ranaut, in her tweet while leaving Mumbai, said that she was leaving the city “with a heavy heart”. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant questioned why Ranaut was still not revealing the Bollywood drug mafia nexus. “When she says she has the information on Bollywood drug mafia, she should have ideally gone to the Mumbai Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) office and recorded her statement. Instead, she is going back to Manali,” rued Sawant. Sawant says there are just two inferences that can be drawn from her departure. “One, she is not disclosing the nexus which is a crime or she just made up a story,” he said. The Shiv Sena was caustic in their remark saying some external forces were behind the scene. “That’s alright. She has only this work now [to make statements against Mumbai]. People can clearly see her love for Mumbai through these statements. Mumbaikars will now decide whether she can live in Mumbai or not after she equated Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. She has got a dual personality. She’s an actor too. Whatever script she’s given, she will say those lines... journalists should investigate who is giving her the script,” Sena minister Anil Parab said. The NCP criticised Ranaut on the grounds that she was driving her personal agenda. “As far as Kangana is concerned, she is defaming Mumbai for her personal agenda of joining politics. However, it is sad that she is defaming the city which has given her everything,” said NCP minister Nawab Malik. The BJP however blamed the state government. “Home minister Anil Deshmukh had said the state police will investigate the allegations that Ranaut used to consume drugs. Was she investigated? How come the state government allowed her to leave Mumbai without questioning her,” asked BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/actor-kangana-ranaut-leaves-mumbai-political-parties-slug-it-out/story-q16ghsP4QEgbFDG32uhEnJ.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai puts out second circular to solve doubts on MCQ format for final-year exams||After releasing a circular with details of this year’s end-of-term final year examinations, the University of Mumbai (MU) released another circular on Monday to clarify the multiple choice question (MCQ) format and the role of lead colleges. In Monday’s circular, MU stated, “The concept of a lead or cluster college is to bring together a group of affiliated colleges in a given geographical region offering similar programs and facilitate the synchronisation and coordination with respect to execution of various academic and examination work.” The circular, signed by controller of examination Vinod Patil, reiterated that MCQs will be based only on what was taught in colleges until March 13 this year. For those appearing as repeater candidates, the exam will be on the complete portion. Lead colleges have the responsibilities of coordinating with affiliate colleges and encouraging involvement of teachers of all colleges of a particular subject to formulate a comprehensive bank of questions for MCQs. “Inter-cluster support in order to facilitate preparation of a large base of MCQs will also be encouraged,” says the circular. MCQs will make comprise 25-40 questions, depending upon the requirement of the subject, and the one-hour paper will be of maximum 50 marks. Some teachers complained the question bank drastically increases their workload. “We have been asked to put together a question bank of 250 questions for every subject, and I alone teach four subjects across two departments. So the total workload is immense for the time we have in hand before exams for repeater candidates begins,” said a professor of a suburban college on condition of anonymity. Some teachers have suggested colleges in each cluster should divide work on every subject and pile the MCQ question bank together to avoid repetition of questions. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges, representing non-government colleges, has approached MU vice chancellor Suhas Pednekar on Monday requesting that autonomous colleges and cluster universities form one particular cluster and then follow MU guidelines as mentioned in the two circulars. “Autonomous institutes can work in tandem,” said T Shiware, chairman of the association.As per MU’s schedule, practical exams for repeater candidates will begin on September 15 and theory exams will start from September 25. Exams for new candidates will take place between October 1 and 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-puts-out-second-circular-to-solve-doubts-on-mcq-format-for-final-year-exams/story-wM2tH2EOKn3WOKeNkRRJuN.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government approaches UGC, seeks extension to complete final-year exams by October 31||The Maharashtra government has approached the University Grants Commission (UGC), seeking extension till October 31 to complete final-year exams for professional and non-professional courses. Most of the universities have preferred multiple-choice question (MCQ) format for holding the exams and students will also be given a question bank, two days prior to the exams, the officials said. Following the Supreme Court (SC) ruling that the students cannot be promoted without giving exams and can seek extension the September-end deadline set by UGC to complete the process, the state had decided to seek an extension. “After taking approval from the state disaster management authority, an official request has been sent to UGC, requesting UGC to provide an extension till October 31 to complete the exam process,” said a senior official from the state higher and technical education department. He said that they are expecting to get the permission soon. The extension was sought following the recommendations made by the vice-chancellors’ (V-C) committee – headed by Suhas Pednekar, who is the V-C of the University of Mumbai (MU) – formed to suggest the state on conducting the final-year exams, keeping the safety of students in mind. The official said that there will be no universal format for conducting exams in the universities. “In its guidelines issued on July 6, UGC has clearly stated that the universities can choose the exam format of their own choice and thus varsities were given the freedom to decide the format. Majority of them preferred the MCQ format but some have also opted for optical mark recognition (OMR),” he added. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said that most of the universities, including MU, have decided to hold exams in MCQ format. “The V-C’s committee has suggested four options — OMR, MCQ, offline or assignment-based exams — in their report, following the state’s request that students should not be forced to step out of their homes, considering the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. Most of the universities have chosen MCQ over the other options. Considering the concerns raised by the students, it has also been decided that they will be provided a proper question bank two days prior to exams by their respective universities,” Samant had said on Sunday. “We have also directed the local authorities such as district collectors to provide all the necessary help to universities so that exams are conducted smoothly,” said another senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-approaches-ugc-seeks-extension-to-complete-final-year-exams-by-october-31/story-KRkqL15FQe51PEd2sYaXKL.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Peeved over ‘indiscipline’, Jammu GMCH principal opts for VRS||Even as the Covid-19 pandemic rages in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), internal conflicts among senior doctors and with the administrative staff at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Jammu - the major referral hospital in the region - has caused patient care to be relegated to the sidelines. Peeved over the ‘indiscipline and chaos’, principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra has sought early retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) on Sunday evening. In a two-page letter to lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, Digra said he was choosing to opt for VRS because of interference of ‘extra-institutional officials’ in the working of the hospital. Saying the chair of the principal was being demeaned, Digra alleged, “A few extra-institutional officers, one or two heads of departments and few faculty members are bypassing departmental hierarchy and approaching the administrative department in technical, professional and administrative matters.”  On being contacted, he refused to name the officials in question but hinted that he might disclose the names in the near future. “Let us wait and watch,” he said. Digra said interferences in the internal working of the principal’s office will cause anarchy, indiscipline and demean of the office. “It will also allow GMC employees to create nuisance and go scot free with the help of the administrative department,” he wrote, adding that the work culture and inter-personal relationships in the hospital had deteriorated. Patient care compromised Amid the internal conflicts, patient care at the hospital has suffered. Since Friday, two patients - a four-year-old boy from Janipur and a 24-year-old woman from Karan Bagh, have died due to the alleged negligence of the doctors. The minor succumbed to a head injury while doctors allegedly insisted on shifting the boy to an isolation ward while the woman died 10 minutes after she was administered an injection. Jammu district commissioner Sushma Chauhan has ordered a magisterial probe, to be conducted by a three-member panel within seven days, into the woman’s death. Hospital on verge of bursting at the seamsDespite the administrations’ tall claims regarding arrangement made to combat the novel coronavirus, six months on GMCH seems to be ready to burst at the seams. Reports of shortage of oxygen cylinders at the hospital have sparked panic among patients and their family members. “Due to spike in Covid patients, the demand for oxygen has increased manifold and the oxygen plant at GMCH is not enough to meet the requirement,” a doctor requesting anonymity. To cater to the increasing demand, GMCH authorities were compelled to purchase nearly 500 cylinders. Senior doctors of the hospital said community spread of the deadly virus had started peaking in Jammu. Reacting to Digra’s letter, JKPCC chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma questioned the circumstances that forced a senior and committed doctor to opt for VRS and asked the L-G to immediately intervene as the issues raised by the head of the institution need to be taken seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/peeved-over-indiscipline-jammu-gmch-principal-opts-for-vrs/story-6nN1m3I7Bi7KK53UjohzVN.html

We had also detained a few persons who have indicated the involvement of the two Mandapura residents. Both persons are likely to be arrested soon and following their interrogation, we will close in on other suspects and the likely location of the exotic species,” said D Chavan, inspector (crime), Nagpada police station.Chavan added that a first information report (FIR) was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.Orangutans —a species of the great ape — are native to Indonesia and Malaysia. They are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), wherein international trade of any kind is forbidden. In July, the forest department and PETA India had inspected a suspect’s house in Agripada and confirmed the orangutan’s presence before it was moved. The suspect had fled before he could be apprehended. PETA India later received a complaint about a family from Bandra that had posted pictures of the orangutan on social media. In August, PETA India had offered a reward of up to ₹1 lakh for any information regarding the animal. At the time, the group received a tip about one of the suspects who had posted videos and photos of various exotic species, including the orangutan, on social media. The suspect was interrogated by the forest department and Bandra police, and a video of some people surrounding and abusing the orangutan was recovered from the suspect’s phone. However, no action was taken against the person. Last month, the case was transferred to Nagpada police station.“This highly intelligent ape needs to be urgently taken back to his/her native country, and not held captive and exploited,” said Dr Rashmi Gokhale, manager, veterinary services, PETA India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-booked-for-illegally-trading-baby-orangutan-in-mumbai/story-02W7ZfHio9Ez8cxraoHS0N.html

Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said 85% of the deaths took place due to acute diabetes and hypertension, and the patients developed respiratory problems after contracting Covid-19. The other ailments include lever infections, kidney failures, cancer, cardiac arrest, bypass surgery and asthmatic and respiratory problems.Dr Singh further said that as far as diabetes and hypertension were concerned, it was not only the senior citizens, but also people from other age groups. “Apart from this, a 96-year-old male is the oldest person to have succumbed to coronavirus in Mohali and an 8-month-old baby girl was the youngest.”Nodal officer-cum-district epidemiologist Dr Harman Brar said, “The 96-year-old had diabetes and could not withstand the virus. The case study for the 8-month-old baby is yet to be made, but we believe that infants do not have proper lung functioning and once infected with the virus, it worsens leading to death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-citizens-with-comorbidities-made-50-of-all-covid-deaths-in-mohali/story-4qZSWP3JbXjpBycMJl1t4N.html

She added that the whale had washed ashore at an isolated beach in Theronda. “There are no residential areas within a five-kilometre radius so nobody is affected by the carcass’ stench,” she said. Marine biologist Harshal Karve said tissue samples collected will help identify the species, probable length and time of death. “Based on photographs we think it’s a Bryde’s whale but there will be more clarity after scientific analysis,” he said. This is the sixth whale to have washed ashore a Maharashtra beach since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/whale-carcass-at-alibag-tissue-samples-collected-for-dna-analysis/story-XuEXunZJS71dTkKghnvTcP.html

15-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court rejects bail plea of Pune man accused of raping business partner’s 17-year-old daughter||Observing that “rape is just not a forcible intercourse, it means to inhabit and destroy everything,” the Bombay high court (HC) last week refused bail to a 34-year-old man from Pune who was booked for raping the 17-year-old daughter of his business partner. The court held that the man had taken advantage of the “fiduciary relationship” shared with the survivor and put her in a “vulnerable situation” and hence did not deserve bail. The bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the bail application of the Pune resident, was informed by advocate Venkatesh Shastry that the survivor and his client were in love and though she was only 17 years old, she was mature enough to know what she was getting into. Shastry, however, denied that his client had raped the girl on three occasions, as alleged by her in her police complaint. The survivor’s complaint stated that the man, who was a family friend and business partner of her father, had started contacting her through WhatsApp since October 2019. He sought sexual favours from her through the messages, which she refused, stated the police complaint. On December 6, 2019, the accused asked the survivor to meet her alone as he wanted to discuss an important family issue. The next day when they met, the man took her to a farm house. There, he threatened to end his life, if the minor did not give in to his sexual overtures, stated the girl’s complaint. The survivor submitted to him but not disclose about the incident to her family, as she was threatened by the man that it would have an adverse effect on the business if she did so. However, the man again blackmailed the girl for sexual favours at his home on January 1, she revealed everything to her parents, following which a complaint was lodged against him on January 30. Shastry opposed the claims on the grounds that the survivor went through the incident thrice and the complaint was lodged belatedly, hence, it could be because the survivor’s father wanted to take advantage of his business partner. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “The applicant has taken advantage of the fiduciary relationship, which he shared with the victim girl and put her in a vulnerable situation. Assuming but not accepting that the victim girl consented for maintaining the physical relationship, her consent is not a free consent. The penal code does not recognise the consent by a minor girl to be consent in the eyes of law and in the present case, in the backdrop of narration by the victim, her consent can naturally be said to be induced by fiduciary relationship which she shared and on that count also, it is not a free consent.” The court further added that considering the gravity of the accusation levelled against him and the testimony of the victim, it was not inclined grant the accused bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consent-for-sex-by-minor-in-fiduciary-relationship-can-t-be-considered-free-will-bombay-high-court/story-CtgwVW5Jxk339U5OpMLsVL.html

Sinha said a committee had been formed to assess trade in the region and they had come out with a report, which is under the government of India’s consideration. “It will be revealed in a week’s time. I can say that such a package has never been received by J&K,” he said, adding that not just the business community but everybody will be covered in the package.The Jammu and Kashmir administration last month had constituted a five-member committee to work out modalities for the economic revival in the Union territory in the backdrop of the incessant restrictions and lockdowns since August 5 last year. The committee, headed by his advisor Kewal Kumar Sharma, was framed after representatives of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) had met the LG Sinha at Raj Bhawan. The committee was tasked to work out modalities for economic revival and propose measures for extending support to the business community.He said experts will frame an integrated programme for the development of Srinagar and Jammu cities along with its water bodies. “Experts all over the country are working to develop an integrated programme not only for Jammu and Srinagar but also for Dal Lake and Wular; on how to revive them,” he said.Sinha said the administration has zero-tolerance towards corruption and discrimination between Jammu and Kashmir divisions. Asked about the innumerable barricades that were hampering vehicular movement, Sinha said the issue will be evaluated.On the alleged Shopian fake encounters, Sinha said a probe was being held on two levels and the families will get justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lg-says-j-k-to-get-economic-package-soon/story-K7vnohMylfOwH9t8oihyYN.html

Rakesh Mohan Joshi as the registrar in view of his opinions posted on social media.The petition, signed by students, alumni and faculty of TISS, expressed concern over the appointment owing to ‘problematic and Islamophobic’ social media posts by Joshi. They have demanded an immediate rollback of the appointment and an inquiry into the appointment.“We demand that the decision to appoint Col RM Joshi as the Registrar at TISS must be immediately rolled back, and the governing board and administration at TISS must give due space to concerns of the students and initiate inquiry into the same,” said the petition.“Since the appointment of Joshi, many students and faculty have been holding discussions regarding the problematic opinions that have been shared by the newly-appointed official on various social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. The posts clearly point at Islamophobic tendencies and a complete contempt for affirmative action implemented for marginalised sections. His posts also indicate his aversive views against social activism, protests and social movements of the oppressed sections. It is shocking to find that the governing board has agreed for such an appointment without (or after) checking into the background of such an official,” it added.The petition, started on September 1, was sent to the governing board of the institute on Monday. HT reached out to Joshi, director Shalini Bharat, dean of student affairs, Asha Banu, and dean of academic affairs, PK Shajahan, but none responded to calls or messages. Emails, too, remained unanswered.In August, the institute appointed Joshi to the post of registrar, which was held by CP Mohankumar until then. The decision immediately drew flak from students, alumni as well as faculty members. On August 31, a student group — the Progressive Students’ Forum (PSF) — wrote to the chairperson of the governing board expressing concerns over the appointment.In the letter, PSF president Asika VM and general secretary Ramadas KS referred to some posts allegedly shared by Joshi that vilified the Muslim minority community in the wake of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation as well as posts against anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protestors.Rishabh Anjankar, a 2020 graduate of TISS, said, “A person having extremely bigoted and hateful views towards critical democratic students has been appointed as registrar of a social science institute known for engaging and promoting critical thinking and intellectualism. This appointment is severely going to impact the nature of discussions, debates and dissent in the institute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/current-and-former-tiss-students-sign-petition-to-revoke-registrar-s-appointment-in-mumbai-over-social-media-posts/story-XKaz2fENXl9DDKlTSSyFTP.html

Rajendra Jadhav, a senior inspector from Nerul police station, said, “Locals informed that he was seen playing in the water. After climbing the footpath, he started walking backwards and suddenly fell into the manhole. The locals tried pulling him out, but due to water pressure, they failed to do so. The fire brigade team searched for him for two days. On Sunday evening, fishermen at Sarsole jetty finally located the body.”Assistant police inspector Swapnil Ijjapawar said, “Residents told us that the drainage was always covered. On Friday, the incessant rainfall had led to heavy currents in the water, following which the lid came off.”However, the boy’s family has alleged negligence by the civic body. Shalu Singh, the victim’s cousin, said, “The corporation is responsible for Aniket’s death. We are yet to decide on our course of action.”Former mayor Jaywant Sutar from Shirawane said, “The drainage lid may have come off due to heavy water currents. There were some wooden logs blocking the drainage, which probably fell during the rain itself.” Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) chief Abhijit Bangar said, “On the day of the incident, I had sent my team there. Unfortunately, the boy couldn’t be found then. As per the investigations and panchnama report, the lid was always there, but it came off due to the strong currents of stormwater. The lid is made of fibre-reinforced plastic. I have asked for a detailed report. We will then decide if we should use concrete lids.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-of-8-year-old-who-fell-in-open-chamber-in-nerul-found-in-creek/story-PeIcQC0K8CXpF4GyqWpshJ.html

15-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Showik Chakraborty’s bail plea rejected as he may alert others involved, says NDPS court||The special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, while rejecting bail plea of Showik Chakraborty, brother of actor Rhea Chakraborty, observed that he has revealed names of several other people, and if released on bail, the accused may alert them.The special court on Monday released the detailed order on bail plea of Showik. While rejecting the plea, the court observed, “According to the prosecution, the accused have taken the names of other persons. The investigation in respect of those persons is in progress. If the accused is released on bail then he will alert those persons and they will destroy the evidence. There is a possibility of tampering of the evidence.”The siblings have reportedly mentioned names of several Bollywood celebrities who either have worked with Sushant Singh Rajput or were involved in consuming narcotic substances. The agency has also claimed that the siblings might have had arranged drugs for them too along with Rajput.The agency has booked the two under section 27A of the NDPS Act which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders. Their lawyer had claimed that the charges are not applicable on the two and at the most, they can be booked for the consumption of narcotic substances. Further, the two had alleged that no narcotic substance was recovered from them.The court, however, rejected their contentions and observed, “From the record, it is seen that the accused Rhea and late Sushant Singh Rajput were in a live-in relationship. Showik allegedly procured drugs from accused Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit, for Sushant Singh Rajput on the instructions of accused Rhea. NCB has recovered WhatsApp chats and other electronic evidence.Further in the present case commercial quantity of contraband i.e LSD is recovered from accused Anuj Keshwani. Hence, at this stage from the available record, it cannot be said that there are no reasonable grounds to connect the accused with the alleged crime.Further the court while rejecting the bail pleas referred the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act which provides for the conditions for granting bail to an accused booked under section 19 (Punishment for embezzlement of opium by cultivator) or Section 24 (Punishment for external dealings in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in contravention of section 12) or section 27A of NDPS Act.While citing the provisions of Section 37, the court noted that ‘there are stringent provisions of bail under section 37 of the NDPS Act. As per subsection (2) of section 37 of the NDPS Act, no person accused of an offence punishable for an offence under section 19, 24, or 27A and also for an offence involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his personal bond unless the public prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release and where the public prosecutor opposed the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.’Further, the court said, “In all these sections legislature has not described any specific quantity of the drug. In view of rigour (SIC) of section 37 of NDPS Act, the court has to record the finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that accused is not guilty of an offence. It is also to be kept in mind that the court has not to consider the material as if it is pronounced that the judgment of acquittal or recording finding of not guilty.”The court further held that “as discussed above considering the allegations against the accused there is a bar to release the accused on bail under section 37 of NDPS Act. The investigation is at a preliminary stage and if the accused is released on bail then he will tamper the prosecution evidence.”Meanwhile, the special court in its order refused to consider the allegations of Rhea’s lawyer claiming that her statement was recorded forcibly and no lady officer was present at the time when she was being interrogated. “Admittedly, the statement of the accused was recorded on September 6, 7 and 8, 2020. The prosecution revealed the role of the accused based on said statement, and thereafter she was arrested in the crime. Therefore, at this stage, when the investigation is at a preliminary stage, it cannot be said that statement of accused was forcefully recorded and inadmissible in evidence,” reads the order of the special court rejecting bail plea of Rhea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-showik-chakraborty-s-bail-plea-rejected-as-he-may-alert-others-involved-says-ndps-court/story-v2in6LQvrzaRFF9fitjITK.html
15-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to get second biodiversity park in Sikanderpur||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) are jointly working on setting up a second biodiversity park in the city, in Sikanderpur, said officials privy to the matter on Monday.GMDA officials said that the establishment of the park is part of a larger project of restoring a natural pond in the Sikanderpur area that used to exist till 1976. The new park, once constructed, will act as a catchment area for rainwater and will prevent south Gurugram from floods every monsoon season.As per MCG officials, around 3,500 illegal shanties have been removed from Sikanderpur during multiple demolition drives in July and August this year. Around 300 acres of encroached MCG land has also reclaimed in the process. The new biodiversity park would come up on 150-200 acres of this reclaimed land, said GMDA officials.The MCG has already started fencing the reclaimed land to prevent future encroachment. “Following multiple demolition drives over the last two months, encroachments on the MCG land in Sikanderpur have been largely removed. The reclaimed land has been handed over to the GMDA, while the MCG is also fencing the area to prevent future encroachment,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.MD Sinha, additional chief executive officer of GMDA, highlighted the importance of the new biodiversity park, which would have trees, plants, and shrubs native to the Aravallis and would act as a catchment area for accumulating rainwater and channelising it towards the pond. He further said that the new park will come up right opposite the existing biodiversity park, with the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road dividing them.In December 2018, the GMDA had released a concept paper titled “Revival and Habitat Eco-restoration of Sikanderpur Ghosi Waterbody.” The concept paper stated that, based on the 1976 survey of India’s topographic maps, a deep gorge could be seen between Nathupur Bundh and Chakkarpur-Wazirabad Bundh that used to carry run-off rainwater from the Aravallis to the Najafgarh lake. A large pond in the foothills of the Aravallis in Sikanderpur, which the GMDA is currently reviving, used to form the convergence point of the three streams.The paper further highlighted the importance of this pond, which used to accumulate run-off rainwater flowing from the foothills of Aravallis and prevented areas in south Gurugram from flooding while also simultaneously recharging the underground water table.As per the concept paper the “habitat restoration of the watershed would determine the success or failure of the entire project.”Sinha said increasing the green cover, in the form of a park, is vital as it will act as a watershed area of 150-200 acres for augmenting the flow of rainwater.“The objective is to restore the Aravallis to its pristine state and also restore the lake. We are also proposing the construction of a pipeline along with a treated water tank. When rainfall ends, we can fill up the pond with treated water. Once the pipeline is constructed, we will have to create an artificial wetland for treating this recycled water by introducing specially cultured bacteria and enzymes,” said Sinha.Sinha added that the revival of the pond and the park is a long-term project. “This is not an engineering project and, hence, no specific timeline can be projected for it. It will take several years of continuous work for the restoration work to be completed. Currently, a large part of encroachment has been removed and fencing has been carried out by the MCG. After the end of monsoon season, we will start identifying patches of land where in-situ moisture conservation work can be done to improve the moisture retention of soil. Simultaneously, we will also be planting native vegetation,” said Sinha.GMDA officials said that construction of natural embankments and check dams will help in moisture retention and reduction of soil erosion while planting natural vegetation would help in recharging groundwater.Sinha said that the work of establishing a new park and restoring pond are being done separately, in two different parts.“In the first part, which involves the restoration of the pond, work has started with the help of corporate social responsibility(CSR) funds with IamGurgaon. In part two, which involves the establishment of a new park, removal of encroachments is largely over and now landscape designing work would start in consultation with the MCG,” said Sinha, adding that until earlier this year, the GMDA was singularly involved in this project. However, now the MCG has also been roped in.Sinha said that IamGurgaon, a non-profit organisation, has been roped in to work for part one of the project. He, however, said that a final decision on whether the GMDA and MCG themselves would handle part two of the project or whether the work would also be handed over to a third-party is yet to be decided.Both the MCG and IamGurgaon have been jointly maintaining the original 370-acre Aravalli biodiversity park ever since it opened in June 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-get-second-biodiversity-park-in-sikanderpur/story-EiUpFV37N3ug8xqUjbOkcI.html

Following the strategy of doing RT-PCR and rapid antigen in 60:40 ratio, Yadav said that samples are now being sent to PGIMS, Rohtak. “The current capacity of RT-PCR lab in Civil Hospital, Sector 10, is 1,200 samples a day. On Monday, remaining 500 samples were sent to PGIMS Rohtak. As the sample collection increases further, samples will be given to private labs too,” said Yadav. As per the district health bulletin, at least 974 antigen tests were done in the government set-up and only 78 in private facilities. On Monday, 336 new cases were reported, taking the total tally to 15,585. Of these, 2,317 are active and 13,119 have recovered.

Before leaving for Chandigarh after undergoing treatment at a private hospital, thereafter four-day stay in PWD rest house, Khattar said, “Last month, from August 16 to 18, I met many people which led to exposure to coronavirus. It is difficult to say how and when we can contract the coronavirus. Therefore, it is crucial to follow dos and don’ts.” Citing that in many cases all the family members are turning out to be positive if one gets infected in the family, Khattar asked people to follow the relevant guidelines to keep infection at bay and follow social distance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-conducts-record-4-016-tests-in-a-day/story-8YPWYlNtvxdTlAGyc7IDjP.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmer protests against agri ordinances politically motivated: Shanta Kumar||Former Union minister and BJP leader Shanta Kumar on Monday termed the protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana against the Centre’s three agriculture ordinances as politically motivated.The veteran leader said the recommendation made by the high-level committee on Food Corporation of India (FCI) restructuring, which he chaired, had made recommendations to bring radical changes in the system that would have revolutionised the farm sector. “I can say with guarantee that in India there is highest-level of corruption in the FCI,” he said.Shanta Kumar said an expert committee of the then planning commission had also found that the government spends ₹3 crore on transportation, storage and delivery of foodgrains worth ₹1 crore. “Therefore, we had recommended Direct Benefit Transfer to the farmers. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna which has been implemented by the Centre was part of that report,” he said.“Other key finding in the recommendation was that agriculture was not a remunerative profession but no country can do without it. Therefore, almost all countries give direct income support to the farmers. The system we had proposed would help save ₹40,000 crore, which could be given to the farmers as direct income support,” he said.Besides, the committee recommended that the procurement for the buffer stock should be done by the states. “In a way, we intended to provide benefit worth ₹70,000 crore to 9 crore farmers. One recommendation was to restructure the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by providing PDS rations to the needy,” he said.“People have grossly misunderstood the recommendations of the report and there will be no effect on the MSP,” he said, adding that the farmers are being mislead for political interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmer-protests-against-agri-ordinances-politically-motivated-shanta-kumar/story-gmpipE7NJjPxp5cKOQYIrK.html
15-09-2020||City||Gurugram: District admin asks private hospitals to increase Covid beds from 25% to 35%||Gurugram: With the district recording a spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, the district administration on Monday issued an order directing all private hospitals to raise the Covid bed capacity from the existing 25% to 35%. “The bed capacity is being increased to 35% due to a surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner. Under the Epidemic Disease Act and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Khatri issued the order. “There is a surge in Covid-19 cases in the district. Effective health services and ensuring its effective management is of utmost priority for the district administration. Therefore, it has been decided to reserve sufficient number of beds at designated private hospitals for Covid-19 patients,” reads the order. In June this year, the administration had issued an order reserving 25% beds in various private hospitals for patients infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus. Based on that, currently 1,541 beds are reserved across 42 hospitals, including two government facilities (58-bed ESIC Hospital in Sector 31 and 22-bed Polyclinic in Sector 31). Besides, 50 beds are reserved for Gurugram patients at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jhajjar. These reserved beds include 199 ICU beds and 94 with ventilators. At present, 129 ICU beds and 53 ventilator beds are occupied by critical patients.“Data shows that bed occupancy in the hospitals is increasing and we are reaching the limit reserved. Therefore, reserved beds for serious patients have been increased now,” said Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital management, who is also the estate officer of Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). On Monday, Gurugram reported 336 new cases, taking the tally of positive cases in the district to 15,585. Now, the district has 2,317 active cases.The city hospitals are catering to seriously ill outstation patients too, occupying more number of beds than Gurugram residents. The officials, however, said there will be no separate reservation of beds for Gurugram or Haryana residents.On Monday, the number of hospitalised Covid patients from Gurugram reached a count of 201. Till August 25, 88 Covid-19 patients were undergoing treatment in various hospitals. Besides, Covid patients from other districts of Haryana and other states are also admitted in Gurugram. Currently, the total number of outside patients admitted in the various private hospitals is 372. These patients include 57 from Delhi, 144 from Uttar Pradesh and 96 from other parts of the country. “The increased bed capacity does not reserve beds for Gurugram or Haryana residents especially,” said Khatri. According to the order, the per day occupancy of the bed will be displayed at oneMap Gururgram mobile application, developed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which would help in planning and establishing systemic surveillance at the district level. Khatri also emphasized on utilizing isolation facilities set up in hotels since most of the patients are asymptomatic. Presently, there are two government-paid and seven self-paid isolation facilities for people who cannot be isolated at homes due to lack of space. He said that Covid-19 patients staying in these facilities are regularly monitored by the health department. In each of the facilities, a doctor and a paramedical staffer have been deployed. In the self-paid facilities, one can choose rooms from Rs 1,200- Rs 3,500, which include three times meal. Currently, there are 36 patients in government paid facilities. Khatri said that if required, isolation beds can be increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-district-admin-asks-private-hospitals-to-increase-covid-beds-from-25-to-35/story-iTRXbussYvzIt6wHkkr5KO.html
15-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram mall sealed over violation of environmental regulations||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Monday sealed the premises of a prominent mall on MG Road, which is among the city’s most recognised commercial hubs and retail destinations. Officials said that mall authorities have repeatedly violated anti-pollution norms under the Air Act (1981) and Water Act (1974) that forced the pollution control board to take action. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Gurugram, HSPCB, said, “We had received a tip-off in 2018 that the mall was not adequately treating its sewage before discharge. In November 2018, we took samples from the sewage treatment plant and found that all contaminants were present in excess of the wastewater discharge standards prescribed in the Water Act. Following this, we had sent the mall authorities a notice and slapped a fine of ₹2.5 lakh as well, which has been collected.”Despite this initial word of caution, HSPCB officials said that the mall continued to discharge its wastewater without rectifying the operational deficiencies in the STP. “We then sealed the STP itself, but mall authorities continued to operate it in violation of our notice,” Singh added. In February this year, a second laboratory test using samples from the mall’s STP was conducted at the HSPCB’s laboratory in Gurugram, by a team of HSPCB staffers from other districts, appointed by the headquarters in Panchkula. The results showed, once again, that the proportion of contaminants in the discharged sewage were not adhering to the stipulated limits. “Action would have been taken earlier, but sealing a property requires administrative clearances which could not be processed due to the lockdown,” Singh explained.A team of environmental engineers from the HSPCB’s regional office, including Neha Saharan and Ujjwal Kumar, arrived at the site at 7:30am on Monday and sealed the premises in the presence of duty magistrate Kartar Singh, who was appointed by the district administration. In a statement released on Monday, the HSPCB’s regional office stated, “The violators will be fined again, and prosecuted under relevant provisions of the Air Act and Water Act. A petition will be filed with the district environmental court in Faridabad in the coming days.” Two administrative staffers of the mall, with direct knowledge of the alleged violations, declined to comment on the matter, saying they were not authorised to speak with the press. Despite repeated attempts, the developer of the mall could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mall-sealed-over-violation-of-environmental-regulations/story-w0iRZRqf1zh5TJIySWVSML.html

15-09-2020||Delhi||Why no action against ruling party leaders, ask former top cops||Nine retired IPS officers have written an open letter to Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava, saying they were pained at the police implicating those who spoke and joined protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) but letting off the hook those who instigated violence and are associated with the ruling party. The letter was shared on social media platforms a day after the Delhi Police arrested former JNU student Umar Khalid in connection with the Delhi riots. Prominent among the nine who have written the letter are AS Dulat, former OSD on Kashmir, Prime Minister’s office; Shafi Alam, former director general of the National Crime Records Bureau; K Saleem Ali, former CBI special director; Amitabh Mathur, former special secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat and PGJ Nampoothiri, former director general of Gujarat Police. Commenting on the investigation, the nine retired officers in their letter wrote, “ ....Such investigation will only make people lose faith in democracy, justice, fairness, and the Constitution. A dangerous thought that may ultimately shake the pillars of an orderly society and lead to breakdown of law and order. We would therefore request you for reinvestigation of all riot cases fairly and without any bias based on sound principals of criminal investigation to provide justice to the victim and their families and for upholding the rule of law.” In their letter to Shrivastava, the nine officers, said they endorsed the recent letter that former Mumbai police commissioner Julio Ribeiro had written, questioning the police investigation into the riots.Though the letter did not mention any names, BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma were criticised at the time for speeches and slogans ahead of the Delhi elections. Verma declined to comment on the allegations of hate speech. Besides the officers, senior advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan also criticised the police. Sharing a video of Khalid, in which he is speaking about peaceful protests, Bhushan tweeted: “This is Umar Khalid who has been arrested for instigating riots in Delhi. People like Kapil Mishra who incited violence have not been arrested.”Mishra, a Delhi BJP leader, has been named by several anti-CAA protesters of orchestrating the riots, a charge he has denied in his previous statements to the press. On the afternoon of February 23, a day before violence erupted in parts of north-east Delhi, Mishra had led a group of CAA supporters near Jafrabad Metro station, and shouted slogans against the anti-CAA group. Standing next to a senior police officer, Mishra had said that he has given the police three days’ ultimatum to clear the road and remove the anti-CAA protesters, failing which they would not even listen to the police. The riots started the following day. Delhi police have not charged Mishra in any riots case. JNU students union president Aishe Ghosh tweeted that people such as Mishra who said “Goli Maaro saalo ko (shoot the traitors)” were spared while anti-CAA protesters were arrested. “Safeguarding Constitution and democracy has officially become a crime in our country,” she tweeted. In response to the growing clamour for his arrest, especially after Khalid’s arrest, Mishra tweeted a video, saying, “People like Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar, Apoorvanand carried it (riots) out after careful planning. This was a terrorist attack just like 26/11 (in Mumbai). These terrorists, murders should be hanged. I congratulate Delhi Police for nabbing these people.“ The Delhi BJP also defended Mishra. “Those asking for Mishra’s arrest should know that the police didn’t find anything against him. The arrest of people like Umar Khalid and Tahir Hussain is a different matter. Police found proof of their involvement in the riots and this is why they were arrested,” said Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta. Commenting on the letter by the former IPS officers, Delhi police spokesperson, Anil Mittal said, “Delhi police has investigated all riots cases professionally and meticulously. The matter is subjudice. Any grievance in this regard has to be raised at appropriate platform. With regard to the letter, the matter has been adjudicated by Delhi HC and prima facie it found nothing wrong in issuing directions by the senior officer. “ Mittal was referring to the nine officers writing about a media report that one senior Delhi police officer had issued a controversial order to influence the investigation. The high court had ordered that prime facie the top cop’s order did not cause prejudice and cleared the officer of the alleged charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-no-action-against-ruling-party-leaders-ask-former-top-cops/story-bqxtlXjrPtrrz1Qrp4bwbP.html

15-09-2020||Delhi||Charge sheet in ‘conspiracy’ case in Delhi riots will be filed by Sept 17: Police chief||Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava Monday said a charge sheet will be filed by Thursday in connection with a “conspiracy” case in the northeast Delhi riots as the force is approaching towards the final league of investigation.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwaha also said the riots were result of a “planned conspiracy” because during the investigation, the police found a common pattern the anti-CAA protesters followed: block the road traffic. “It was the first indicator that there was a conspiracy due to which it all started,” he said. Also read: Delhi Police get 10-day custody of Umar Khalid after his arrest under anti-terror lawThe two officers spoke at a webinar, where Srivastava also said that some of the people police are probing have a very good social media presence and they are trying to take “away the sheen from the investigation”.  “As we are approaching towards the final end of investigation, Umar Khalid (former JNU student) has also been arrested. So, there is more and more sort of a cry, especially in the social media and also on the TV channels. (They) are trying to take away the sheen from the investigation. “You know that people whom we are investigating, many (of them) have a very good social media presence,” the Commissioner said.Khalid was arrested Sunday under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots.The Commissioner said the Delhi Police has registered altogether 751 cases and conducted its investigation in a very fair and impartial manner.Out of the 751 cases, 340 have been solved, while the police has not got much lead in the remaining cases, he said. Also read: Filmmakers Saba Dewan, Rahul Roy called for questioning in connection with Delhi riots  “Out of 751, one case is basically regarding the conspiracy, and this has been registered by the Crime Branch, but was transferred to the Special Cell because it required detailed investigation. They are required to file the charge sheet by September 17,” Shrivastava said. The webinar was organised by the Delhi Police Retired Gazetted Officers Association where Shrivastava also tried to put to rest all “false accusations” and claims made against his force in connection with the riots and reasserted that all actions taken by the police were in absolute compliance of the law.  “The other 59 important cases were given to the three SITs which were formed under the Crime Branch and out of the 59 cases, 46 were solved and in all these, the charges sheets have been filed and we are still filing the supplementary charge sheets,” he said. Remaining few cases are with the district police and they are also doing a good job to ensure that all the evidences are collected properly and presented in a proper manner, the police commissioner added.On his part, Kushwaha said, “When we started investigating the Delhi riots, we first saw all the sites and found a common pattern that traffic jam was started at all the sites simultaneously. It was the first indicator that there was a conspiracy due to which it all started.” There were 25 protest sites and most of them were formed in trans-Yamuna area, Kushwaha said. It also came in notice that the people who were sitting on protest sites were led by those who came from outside. “They were not locals.” People kept on going to the protest sites again and again and they talked about CAA-NRC so that more and more people would come there and it would look like a CAA-NRC protest was going on, the DCP said. On February 11, when it was announced that US President Donald Trump will visit India, suddenly the tone and tenor of the protest got changed, he said. On February 22, the protesting leaders and women sat on road under Jafrabad metro station and blocked the road, Kushwah said. Following that pattern, the other sites in northeast Delhi were also suddenly traffic-jammed, stone-pelting started at Maujpur where the pro and anti-CAA and NRC protestors were sitting, he said. Suddenly, the stone-pelting turned into a well-planned riots, the DCP said. The protest sites were formed with a planned conspiracy to show that children and locals were agitating, and traffic jam and stone-pelting happened, the DCP said. “Acid bottles and petrol bomb were used. Even firing took place in which one head constable Ratan Lal died. There was a huge slingshot inside the Rajdhani School which was pre-installed. “A narrative is being created that pro-CAA/NRC people were involved in it, but it has not come into the investigation yet,” he said. Besides 11 Special Public Prosecutor that were hired by the force, the Commissioner stated that six more SPPs -- including the solicitor general of India, two additional solicitor of general of India and three more senior lawyers -- have been roped in so that the cases are defended and taken up well in all courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/charge-sheet-in-conspiracy-case-in-delhi-riots-will-be-filed-by-sept-17-police-chief/story-GfcYmn5yfu2UvKx7IXNesK.html

The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that discussions were underway to implement the court’s August 31 order but ruled out the immediate eviction of the residents. “I assure all the slum dwellers that until your son, your brother is alive, your homes will not be demolished. We will ensure pucca houses to all 48,000 slum dwellers before they are moved. Even if I have to touch someone’s feet, even if I have to struggle, I will provide a house to you,” he said.

The DUSIB’s slum rehabilitation policy talks abut in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellers, he said. “I assure you that either the central government will give you a permanent house or else the Delhi government will do that. I am happy with the affidavit filed by the Central Government in the Supreme Court today, where they have said that the Delhi Government, Railways and Urban Development Ministry will jointly find a solution to the problem in the next four weeks. The central and Delhi government will work together so that our 48,000 Delhiites can get their legal rights,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal said slum dwellers play a very important role in improving Delhi’s economy and life. “If all the leaders and officers of Delhi stop working for a day, even then Delhi will keep on functioning but even for a day if the people living in slums will stop working, then Delhi will come to standstill,” Kejriwal said.The resolution on slum dwellers, which was passed by the House by voice vote, stated that there should not be any eviction during the pandemic and rehabilitation should precede any such action. It also stated that both the Centre and Delhi government agencies must work together to protect the interests of the slum dwellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-welcomes-centre-s-affidavit-on-slum-eviction/story-uJ7uumLd8WhcGk8AGLYwfL.html
15-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Over 200 CCTV cameras not functioning in residential areas||Gurugram: In their efforts to curb street crimes in Gurugram, the police have decided to identify non-functional closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras across the district and get them fixed at the earliest. The police said on Monday that more than 200 CCTV cameras have not been functional in residential areas across the district for the past three months. The teams from crime investigation agency (CIA) and various police stations submitted the data to the commissioner of police, KK Rao, on Monday, with all the details of the crime prone stretches and the total number of CCTV cameras installed. The police said about 1,900 CCTV cameras will be installed across the district to strengthen the surveillance system. Rao said that they have assigned a task to the police stations to keep a check on all CCTV cameras installed in their respective areas. “We have also asked the 43 station house officers to keep the inventory of CCTV cameras ready and to check them while investigating any street crime which has been untraced in the recent past. We will also request resident welfare associations (RWAs) to install CCTV cameras for their safety and to help the police curb crime,” he said. According to the police, the recent vehicle lifting and snatching cases in Palam Vihar, Sector 5, South City 1 and Sushant Lok 1 brought forth that there were only a few CCTV cameras installed and most of them were found to be non-operational. The police in July had identified 147 spots in the district that reported most street crimes, such as burglary, theft and snatching. Rao said in many cases the police could not get any lead as there was no footage to identify the suspects, which took longer to solve the cases. “It was observed that miscreants are mostly targeting areas without CCTV cameras and even where they were not operational. The gangs conduct reconnaissance and they check the police deployment, distance from the police station and how well the area is covered under surveillance,” he said. The police are using the Integrated Control And Command Centre (I-CCC), developed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) under the smart cities mission.According to the police, a total of 1,926 CCTV cameras will be installed at 358 places across the district in different phases. The police said their aim is to cover the entire district with CCTV cameras and it will take maximum a year to complete the project which is taken care of by GMDA. Once the project is completed, these devices will help police crack major crime cases, they said. Presently, there are 350 CCTVs which are monitored by the police teams through I-CCC, said the police. Varinder Singh Kundu, chief executive officer of GMDA, said that the process of installation of CCTV cameras is underway. “There are some challenges at a few locations such as power connection and row junction development works. We are working on all the challenges, and the work is being monitored keenly,” he said. Besides, there are nearly 2,000 CCTV cameras installed in residential societies, commercial hubs and in open spaces across the district. The RWAs say they are ready to cooperate with the police to curb the criminal activities. “In DLF II, we have six entry/exit gates, and all the gates are equipped with CCTV cameras. Whenever any incident has been reported, the videos have been shared with the police. However, we feel that we should have CCTVs in all lanes. RWA of DLF II is making constant efforts to get this into a reality,” said Gaurav Wahi, former president, RWA of DLF II.Amit Jindal, owner of a petrol pump in Sector 89, said, “We have installed CCTV not only for our internal operations, but also to track movement of the vehicles on the main road. This not only helps us, but also acts as a great surveillance tool for local administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-over-200-cctv-cameras-not-functioning-in-residential-areas/story-4mvaodAWJDVJ1ZI2w9fTrN.html
15-09-2020||City||Over a month after man ends life, two held for abetment||Gurugram: More than a month after a man allegedly died by suicide, the police on Sunday arrested two people on charges of abetment in the case. The police said a probe had revealed that the suspects held a grudge against the victim after the latter had lodged an FIR against them last year and the matter was sub-judice. According to the police, on the night of August 4, the victim, who worked with a political party, had died by suicide at his neighbour’s plot. Six days later, his wife had filed a police complaint alleging that before his death, her husband had sent his recordings to his colleagues over the phone mentioning that he was under duress and had named six people who were allegedly threatening him. On the statement of his wife, the police had registered an FIR under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Palam Vihar police station. In the complaint, the wife had said, “My husband passed away on the night of August 4. A few days later, his senior colleague told me that my husband had sent him some recordings before his death in which he had named several people. In the clip, he said that the suspects had beaten him up and were conspiring to kill him and his family. In 2019, after a fight, he had lodged an FIR against the suspects at Palam Vihar police station and they held enmity since then. In the clip, he also appealed to his friends to take care of our children after his death.” The police said the crime branch of Sector 31 arrested the two suspects in the case. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The accused duo have said that the deceased and his wife are their relatives. Last year, after a family dispute, a case was registered against them, which is sub judice. There had been enmity and tension within the family regarding the same. We are conducting the probe and trying to trace the other suspects named in the complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-a-month-after-man-ends-life-two-held-for-abetment/story-ihIBwU2MEEmaH9Kd1Uy5gI.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||CM hails Delhi’s Covid-19 model, says it worked due to teamwork||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Monday hailed the Delhi Model of treatment and containment of Covid-19 and said the aggressive testing being done in the national capital is unmatched not just in the country, but also in the world. In a first, Kejriwal also revealed that over 1.15 lakh people have been treated under Delhi’s home isolation programme so far, of whom 30 have died.The chief minister was addressing a special one-day session of the Delhi Assembly. He began by recalling the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, after the first case in Delhi was reported on March 2. He said Delhi, like Mumbai, was badly hit as 32,000 people returned to the capital from other countries. Also read: AIIMS doctor succumbs to Covid-19“And you can perceive, most of these people must have already been infected. There were 5,000 to 6000 cases in Delhi when the pandemic started,” he said.Hailing the Delhi Model, Kejriwal said the strategy of ‘test, treat, track and isolate’ worked “because of the two crore people of Delhi”. “Today, the maximum number of tests, across the world, is conducted by Delhi. Around 60,000 tests are conducted daily, which is 3,000 tests per million people...while the national average is 819,” the chief minister said. Kejriwal went on to compare Delhi with other countries and claimed that no other state or city in the world has tested 10% of its total population. “We have tested around 2.1 million people in Delhi until now, which is 11% of Delhi’s two crore population,” he said. He said it was the Delhi government which “introduced” home isolation and also opened the “world’s first plasma bank” at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.

Only 30 people have died (among those in home isolation),” he said. Opposition leader and BJP MLA from Badarpur Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said after Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia made panic inducing statements that Delhi would hit 5 lakh cases by July, Union home minister Amit Shah was forced to take charge of Delhi’s Covid management. “Shah arranged for 20,000 new beds, provided ventilators, oxygen cylinders, oximeter PPE kits etc. to Delhi government hospitals. The Centre provided for door-to door testing, and antigen testing was made available at 169 places. The cost of testing and treatment in private facilities was reduced,” he said.Bidhuri said Prime Minister Narendra Modi provided 72 lakh poor people in Delhi with free food rations for the past three months. “And the Delhi government is pasting Kejriwal’s photo on these kits and distributing them to people calling them ‘CM’s relief package’,” Bidhuri said. Kejriwal responded with, “I always say, the credit is yours and the responsibility mine. Whenever Delhi faces trouble, the responsibility would be mine. Delhi’s Covid story is the result of teamwork. I want to thank the Centre for helping us whenever we needed them. They gave us PPE kits, oxygen cylinders and testing kits. No government can handle it all alone. Society came forward to help us; the two crore people of Delhi; many social organisations and doctors’ associations helped us,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-hails-delhi-s-covid-model-says-it-worked-due-to-teamwork-delhi-s-people/story-reRqxvttILVCpzETAxahQM.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||State, Centre did little to stop SC order on removal of slums along railway tracks: Maken||Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken on Monday slammed the AAP government in Delhi and BJP-led Centre for doing little to stop the Supreme Court’s recent order to remove 48,000 slum dwellings on railway land within 90 days.Maken hit out at both the Central and state governments and asked why they didn’t inform the SC about the protocols laid down for rehabilitation of slums dwellers in Delhi, after a high court judgment in March 2019.Also read: Delhi slum eviction: 11 slum dwellers file plea to join proceedings in Supreme Court case“The state and Central governments are just issuing statements, but none of them have taken steps to address the issue. When the matter was being heard by the SC, why didn’t the Delhi government and the Centre inform the court about the protocol in place for the rehabilitation slum dwellers,” said Maken, who had filed a petition challenging the SC’s August 31 order. The former Delhi Congress chief also said that those impacted by the order, the slum residents, were not even represented when the court had ordered removal of their dwelling units.Maken also hit out at the Delhi government for delay in allotting vacant houses constructed for those belonging to the economically weaker sections. Maken, a former Union urban development minister, said that between February 2007 and June 2013, the Centre had sanctioned funds for the construction of 67,784 flats. “Under JNNURM and Rajiv Awas Yojana, close to R1,300 crore was given to the Delhi government. There are 35,000 flats lying vacant and 16,000 flats are under construction, which should have been ready long back. They (the AAP government) have not been able to allot these flats. It has been seven years, the 16,000 flats should have been ready by now,” said Maken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/state-centre-did-little-to-stop-sc-order-on-removal-of-slums-along-rly-tracks-maken/story-M8ZiLXeQza7NRlef8ay4fO.html
15-09-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal monsoon session: Congress walks out of House over police inaction against BJP workers||Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri on Monday raised the issue of police inaction against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, who allegedly barged into the hotel premises of Kullu legislator and Congress’s state general secretary Sunder Singh Thakur.Thakur has been sitting on a dharna at the superintendent of police office in Kullu for the last three days after BJP activists agitated outside his hotel alleging land grab. Thakur alleged that the protest was staged by his political adversary and BJP MLA Maheshwar Singh. Agnihotri said the party was concerned about the security of Sunder Singh Thakur since no action has been taken by the police yet.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the matter of land encroachment was subjudice. He also said that the superintendent of police office in Kullu was sealed after a police officer tested positive for Covid-19. The CM said Sundar Thakur along with 10 other Congress workers went inside the SP office and sat on a dharna demanding the arrest of former MLA Maheshwar Singh. However, he said, after the ASI at the police station tested positive, the legislator was asked to end the dharna. “It is wrong to equate the Kullu episode with what happened to actress Kangna Ranaut in Mumbai,” the CM added. Dissatisfied with the CM’s clarification, the opposition resorted to sloganeering in the assembly, which was countered by the MLAs of the ruling party. Later, members of the opposition walked out of the House amid the pandemonium. While addressing the media, Agnihotri alleged that the government had deliberately sealed the SP office in Kullu. “As per the orders of the chief secretary, the office should not be sealed if only two cases are detected. Instead, the SP office should have been sanitised,” he said, adding that an action should be taken against Kullu SP. CPIM MLA Rakesh Singha also expressed solidarity with Sunder Singh Thakur. He said police inaction is a threat to the representatives of democratic institutions. “Today, it has happened to one MLA, tomorrow it will happen to another,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-monsoon-session-congress-walks-out-of-house-over-police-inaction-against-bjp-workers/story-0cDExo9wcZ0L72I24471WI.html

15-09-2020||Delhi||New cases in Delhi dip below 4k as testing slows over weekend||The number of fresh Covid cases reported in the past 24 hours dropped to below 4,000 for the first time in five days in Delhi on Monday, with the city recording 3,229 new cases.The dip in number of cases, however, was a direct result of fewer tests being conducted in the city over the weekend. On the five days that Delhi reported over 4,000 cases, between 54,000 and 60,000 tests were conducted – the highest being on September 11 when 60,580 samples were tested. On an average, over 51,000 tests were conducted each day during last week. The positivity rate – fraction of people who test positive among those tested – remained almost constant at just over 7%. The seven-day weekly average positivity rate recorded in Delhi is 7.37% during the last week. Also read: Manish Sisodia Covid-19 positive but rapid tests miss 2 MLAs“The number of cases in Delhi is slowly stabilising and the positivity rate is coming down. Even with about 60,000 tests, some 4,000 people turn out to be positive. During the June surge, about 3,900 positive cases were reported with just 15,000 tests. The Delhi model is great because many asymptomatic people are getting tested, especially those coming in to hospitals to seek treatment for other ailments. This helps in identifying and isolating more people, thereby preventing further spread,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and the head of the first committee set up by the state government to tackle Covid-19. The city reported 26 deaths due to the viral infection on Monday, taking the total death toll of Covid-19 in Delhi to 4,770. The absolute number of deaths have increased over August – on average 15.5 deaths were being recorded each day in August as compared to 23.3 deaths on average being recorded in September. However, the case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of people who die of the infection among those who test positive – has been on a decline, with the seven-day daily average CFR at 2.24%, higher than the national average of 1.6%. The CFR over the last seven day has just been 0.52%, indicating that most of the deaths in the city were recorded during the previous surge in cases in June. With the number of cases on the rise in the city, the number of hospitalisations has also touched a record high of 6,592 cases. With hospitals running out of intensive care unit beds, the Delhi government during the weekend ordered 28 big private hospitals to ramp up capacity by reserving 80% of its total ICU beds for the management of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/new-cases-dip-below-4k-as-testing-slows-over-weekend/story-zGLWdFKPZTN1bU6CskR4YP.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro: Snag on first weekday but jump in ridership||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Monday — the first weekday after the entire network was made operational after nearly six months -- reported a 63.48% jump in its ridership compared to last week, but the day began with a technical snag on the Yellow line, affecting services for more than two hours.On Monday, 249,884 people took a ride on the Metro network compared to 152, 845 people last Saturday. Though there was not much rush, people were seen standing in long queues at some places such as Rohini West, Mayur Vihar Phase-I on Monday morning, waiting for their turn to enter the station. At Mayur Vihar, the queue extended till the main road between 8 am and 9 am. “There was no rush, but the queue was till the main road as people were asked to maintain distance,” said a Metro police official at the station.Suman Kumar (30), who works at a government office in Connaught Place, said she has been driving to work for the past three months from Uttam Nagar. “It is a big relief that the metro services resumed. Taking a bus was a lot of hassle. There are no fixed timings and they often don’t stop if they are full. I had no option but to drive. Though it is taking longer than usual, it is very comfortable to travel in the Metro. The train is nearly empty,” Kumar said.Also read:Delhi Metro resumes all services: Monday morning starts with a glitchTo manage the rush, DMRC had to run eight trains from in-between stations on the Blue line (Dwarka sector 21 to Noida Electronic City), which was the busiest corridor on the entire network on Monday.DMRC officials said nearly 76,000 people travelled on the Blue line on Monday.“With a large number of people boarding the train from Dwarka and subsequent stations, it was decided to run trains from Uttam Nagar East to manage the crowd. Seven trains started from Uttam Nagar East towards Noida/ Vaishali. One train started from Anand Vihar instead of Vaishali. All this was done to manage the morning peak hour rush,” said a DMRC official.Though the ridership has increased, stations and trains were relatively empty on Monday. There was not much rush at Rajiv Chowk, Hauz Khas, Kashmere Gate, which are important inter-charge stations.But the day started with a technical snag on the (Samayapur Badli-HUDA City Centre) Yellow line. One track of the corridor between Rajiv Chowk and New Delhi had to be closed for train movement due to urgent track repair. This affected movement between Rajiv Chowk (one of the busiest inter-charge stations) and Vishwavidyalaya for nearly two-and-a-half-hours, causing inconvenience to people.DMRC tweeted, “Delay in services between Rajiv Chowk and Vishwavidyalaya due to track repair work between Rajiv Chowk and New Delhi stations.”According to a DMRC official, train service between Samayapur Badli and Vishwavidyalaya metro stations ran normally. Normal services resumed after nearly two hours.Gearing up for more crowds, especially during peak hours, DMRC has started putting markings inside trains for people to stand while maintaining social distancing. According to DMRC officials, these markings on the train floors have been done in 800 coaches.Nitesh Kapoor, who works with a private firm in Lajpat Nagar, said, “It is good they have put these markings. It will help people maintain distance. This way, more people can travel.”Nearly 2,000 people have been deployed to ensure social distancing norms are followed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease. The DMRC penalised 182 people for not following norms til now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-metro-snag-on-first-weekday-but-jump-in-ridership/story-ud7l2nlby2aUKCxArGuxyK.html
15-09-2020||Mumbai||23 residents of Mankhurd children’s home in Mumbai test positive for Covid-19||Around 23 specially-abled residents of the Mankhurd Mentally Deficient Children’s Home (MDCH) and three staff members tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. In July and August, 43 residents and staff members tested positive, were treated at Covid hospitals and discharged. However, according to MDCH officials, of the 43, 13 tested positive again on Monday.Recovered Covid patients can often test positive again due to harmless ‘residual virus’ which remains in the body for a few weeks. Alternatively, the result could be a false positive.An official at MDCH told Hindustan Times that on Saturday, 35 residents and three staff members at the children’s home underwent testing as part of a regular drive.“On Monday, the test results revealed that 23 residents and three staff members, including the only doctor at the facility, Dr Jayesh Vasule, were Covid-positive. They have been shifted to the Covid care centre at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) for treatment. Thirteen of these 23 residents and the doctor had tested positive earlier and had received treatment for the Covid infection,” said the official.Among the infected, 10 specially-abled residents and two staffers tested positive for the first time. One new patient also has tuberculosis and has been admitted at Sion hospital for treatment.“We are not sure if it is just an error of the testing method, as none of the ‘repeat’ Covid patients has any symptoms. All of them are asymptomatic and otherwise completely fine. Doctors and experts would now look into the matter,” said Vijay Kshirsagar, chief officer of Children’s Aid Society that runs the MDCH.All the residents at the children’s home have undergone Covid testing at least twice in two separate phases since July. The institute run by the Children Aid Society and funded by the state, houses 268 specially-abled individuals, ranging from minors to 70-year-olds.HT had first reported the spread of the infection among the MDCH residents in its July 26 edition. It is suspected that the disease spread at the children’s home from one of the staff members who resides at the staff quarters located on-site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/23-residents-of-mankhurd-children-s-home-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-uvIXkmTYzHzXxm1DdcjNfK.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||Six months after, patrons return to near-empty gyms in Delhi||Exercising with masks or face shields, stickers cautioning customers to maintain a six feet distance, hand sanitiser dispensers, booking by slots -- it was a completely different experience for people who visited gyms that reopened on Monday after remaining shut for nearly six months due to the coronavirus pandemic.“I am visiting the gym after six months. This is a new experience for me to exercise with a face shield. These are desperate measures we had to take as it is a new normal now. I am happy with the sanitisation and precautions taken by the management,” Ritika Mehndiratta, a psychologist, who is a member of Anytime Fitness Gym in Malviya Nagar said.The reopening came as a sigh of relief for gym owners, who are hoping for a revival of the fitness industry after months of closure. Gyms, fitness and yoga centres, spas were closed in the second week of March. Only a few gymnasiums resumed services on Monday morning because owners either were making sanitisation arrangements or were unaware of the reopening as the order was issued late Sunday night.Facilities such as sauna, shower, body massage and spas, however, will remain shut until further orders. Gymnasiums were seen making arrangements to ensure sanitation, hygiene and social distancing as per reopening norms to prevent any spread of the contagious disease. Chirag Sethi, vice-president of the Delhi Gym Association, said only about 30% gyms and fitness centres resumed services on Monday because the government order came late on Sunday night. Sethi urged the government to waive off fixed electricity fixed charges for at least six months. “Although reopening was delayed by over 45 days, the decision has come as a relief for a workforce of around 1 lakh. We would like to request the Delhi government to waive off fixed charges on electricity for six months instead of just two (April and May). We are in no position to pay these charges,” Sethi said.There are more than 6,000 gyms and fitness centres across Delhi that employ around 100,000 people.In a late-night order on Sunday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed gymnasiums and yoga institutes to reopen with immediate effect on condition that they strictly follow all Covid-19 safety protocols. Sethi said the SOPs issued by the Central and Delhi governments will be strictly followed. The gym association also issued guidelines, which include thermal scanning for all clients and slot-based entry. Only asymptomatic clients will be allowed to enter, he said.“There will be a gap of at least 20 minutes between two batches and sanitisation practices will be carried out every hour. Face mask or face shield will be mandatory for members. They are requested to carry their own water bottles and yoga mats. Social distancing will be maintained. No shower, steam or sauna will be allowed. Gyms will prefer the use of individual AC units over centralised units,” Sethi said.Sunil Kumar Tonk, owner of Black’s Gym, which has 16 fitness centres across Delhi-NCR, said he will need three days to reopen. “The order came late on Sunday night. On Monday and Tuesday, I will hold meetings with heads of my fitness centres to ensure all safety measures are in place. We will reopen after taking all precautions,” he said.Spartan’s Gyms and Aerobics centre at Vikaspuri, which reopened at 5 am, saw at least five members trickle in by 8:30 am. Lucky Wasan, owner of the gymnasium, said, “We have sanitised our premises and equipment. Everyone is wearing a mask while working out. However, our changing rooms are shut for now.”Aditi Rai, a gym enthusiast, said the Delhi government’s decision came as a big relief for her. “Working out is like meditation for me. For all these days, I somehow adjusted with home workouts, but there’s nothing like sweating it out in the gymnasium. However, high-intensity workout gets difficult with wearing masks,” she said.The SOPs for gyms issued by the Centre on August 3 restrict workout sessions to activities that do not require trainers to touch members. Not more than 10 people per 1,000 square feet of space are allowed.Face masks are mandatory at all times within gymnasium and yoga centre premises and these institutes must ensure a minimum distance of six feet between individuals.Nikhil Kakkar, CEO of Gold Gyms India, which has 18 centres in Delhi-NCR, said fitness centres are following guidelines issued by the government. “We are not allowing more than 30 members at a time. Earlier 70-80 members used to work out. Our members can book their slots for a time period between 60 minutes to 75 minutes. We are ensuring a gap of 15-20 minutes between two batches for deep cleaning and sanitisation,” Kakkar said.The Central government under its unlock 3 guidelines issued on July 29 had allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to reopen across the country from August 5. But the DDMA, headed by lieutenant- governor Anil Baijal, did not allow these services in the national capital due to a spike Covid-19 cases.On August 6, the Delhi government had sent a file to the L-G’s office to reopen hotels, weekly markets, gymnasiums and yoga centres in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-months-after-patrons-return-to-near-empty-gyms-in-delhi/story-IMOqQJQ9e7NBwWh5109OgL.html
15-09-2020||Delhi||Couple sell month-old daughter for Rs 30,000 in Welcome, arrested||A couple in north east Delhi’s Welcome sold their one-month-old daughter to a childless neighbour for R 30,000 on Saturday and filed a complaint with the police alleging that their baby had been stolen during a funeral procession, Mohammad Akhtar Rizvi, additional deputy commissioner of police (north east), said that the incident came to light after investigators found contradictions in the statements of the complainants and the CCTV footage that was scanned. Police said a total of six people — the couple who allegedly sold their baby, the childless couple and two others who facilitated the process — have been arrested in the incident. “Since the child is just one-month-old and needs her mother’s care, she will be staying with her mother in jail,” said the officer. Police said that the baby’s 27-year-old mother is a homemaker and father a tailor and the couple was struggling to make ends meet, said Rizvi. The couple has two other sons. Police said that incident took place after the childless couple, who lived in the same Welcome neighbourhood, got in touch with the 27-year-old woman. “A couple of months ago, the childless couple happened to speak to the 27-year-old woman about wanting a child. They said that they were willing to even spend money if that helped them in ‘procuring a child’,” said a second investigator involved in the probe. At that point, the 27-year-old woman was already eight months pregnant. “She later discussed with her husband and struck a deal with the childless couple. If it was a boy, he would be sold for Rs 2 lakh and if it was a girl, the price was set at Rs30,000,” said Rizvi. Since the expecting couple’s joint family knew about the pregnancy, it wasn’t possible to simply handover the child. So, they allegedly planned to portray the incident as that of kidnapping. “On Saturday, the 27-year-old’s mother-in-law passed away. The same evening, the woman approached us with a complaint that stated that while accompanying the funeral procession, she needed to visit the washroom and handed over her baby to an unknown young woman. When she returned, she found that the child was missing,” said Rizvi. The police registered a kidnapping case and began speaking to the missing child’s family. “There were discrepancies in the statements of the husband and wife. First we were told that it was the mother who was carrying the child, then we heard that it was the father who was carrying the baby,” said Rizvi. When the police checked the CCTV footage of the area, they found that it was the baby’s mother who had casually handed her daughter over to an unknown woman. “The way the child was handed over came across as fishy. When we questioned the couple further, they spilled the beans,” said the officer. The child was later recovered and the police went on to arrest her biological parents and the childless couple. The police also arrested a man who had facilitated the sale and another woman to whom the baby was handed over during the funeral procession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/couple-sell-month-old-daughter-for-rs-30-000-in-welcome-arrested/story-mfaJbAJXQLxzKllB0eQZVO.html

Senior officers said the driver had gone missing last December. The three men had hired his cab from Sarai Kale Khan, killed him near Jewar toll plaza and dumped his body in Agra, police said. They were arrested last week and have been identified as Rajender Maajhi, Ashfaq Beg and Ram Dhar, all hailing from Madhya Pradesh.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj said the cab driver Kripa Shankar Tiwari was reported missing on December 2. The investigation was transferred to the crime branch in March and since then the teams had been keeping a tight surveillance on suspects and efforts were on to to track Tiwari’s phone and car, Bhardwaj said.“Earlier this month, we received information that Tiwari’s cellphone was active in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh. It was being used by arrested accused Rajender Majhi. On this information, our team searched the identified address and Majhi was arrested. Tiwari’s phone was recovered from him,” the DCP said.She said, during questioning, Majhi told police that the phone was given to him by one Ashfaq Beg. “When we inquired about Beg, we found that he was already in Shivpuri jail in another case of robbery. We got his production warrant and arrested him on September 4. When questioned about the phone and Tiwari, Beg admitted that he, along with Ram Dhar from Gwalior, had hired Tiwari’s cab from Sarai Kale Khan on December 2 and took him toward Agra,” Bhardwaj said. Beg told them that after reaching Jewar, they strangled Tiwari. “He then took his phone, cash and car and dumped his body near Birai chowk in Agra. On Beg’s information, Dhar was arrested on September 6. Further probe revealed that Agra police had conducted inquest proceedings after they recovered his body. Pictures of the body were shown to Tiwari’s family who identified it as Tiwari’s,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-men-held-for-killing-cab-driver-after-robbing-him-of-valuables-dumping-body-in-agra/story-gybgR8ciNDYsdhrXxo8koJ.html

The issue came to light when Dr Bhooshan Shukla, psychiatrist (child and adolescent) who stays in one of the societies, vented out his anger via tweet which read: “Overflowing dams in the whole district notwithstanding, Housing societies on Baner-Pashan link road in Pune continue to buy tanker water since Thursday. Two consecutive years of good rain must have been a disaster for the tanker mafia.” The residents in this area get civic water supply around 7 pm every day. HT found out that sixty residential societies in the area are not getting civic water supply and one water tanker is costing Rs 1,000. Most of the societies need at least four tankers daily. Residents, who chose to remain anonymous, complained that the water supply department is yet to provide relief. “We can understand that supply can be affected for one day on account of maintenance and other reasons. It is the sixth day (Monday) and we are forced to rely on water tankers even when four dams which provide water to Pune are full,” said one of the society members requesting anonymity. “The response was dull from the water supply department and every day we were hearing the same words from them that it is happening due to low pressure and we are working on it. It has not been resolved till afternoon (Monday),” said another society member. Amol Balwadkar, corporator, Baner-Balewadi-Pashan said, “Water supply in the city was disrupted on September 10 after an air bubble developed in the pipeline. A bridge work going on the Pune-Bengaluru highway near the area was another reason for no water supply. The repairs are completed today and residents will get normal water supply from evening (Monday).” However, residents said that they are yet to receive water supply till 10 pm on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dams-filled-to-capacity-60-housing-societies-on-pashan-baner-link-road-in-pune-living-on-tanker-water-for-six-days/story-8myIyZPTRoQ4ISwrJYz78I.html

15-09-2020||Pune||216 IMA emails will ask Maharashtra govt to run pvt hospitals today||The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, will now ask the government to run all private hospitals, in protest against the government’s decision to fix rates at the said hospitals. An indefinite strike is not off the table if the government does not sanction the various demands made by the doctor’s body. In a statement released on Tuesday, IMA said, “The unaffordable rates forced by the government for Covid hospitals has made it increasingly difficult to meet the sky rocketing expenses to run small and medium-sized private hospitals. Around 25,000 mid-sector hospitals are on the verge of closure.” With Pune reporting one of the highest Covid case counts in the country and Mumbai’s case count on the rise again, Maharashtra is now the worst-affected state in the country. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, state president of IMA said, “We will send emails to the CM, HM and chief secretary and appeal to them to take over all the hospitals and see how difficult it is financially, and staff-wise, to run the hospitals. All 216 branches will send the emails at 3pm on Tuesday.” The letter states: “The government had decided to increase the rates for the ICU and give concessions for biomedical waste disposal charges and electricity bills. The government had also agreed to cap the rates of PPE kits and masks for doctors, and the rates for medical oxygen used by the hospitals were also to be reduced as per central government regulations. This was to be finalised in a proposed meeting with the IMA, before September 1, 2020. However, the government unilaterally came out with the new rates on August 31, 2020, and made the previous rates more stringent.” The IMA has alleged that the government is not listening to their issues despite doctors raising their voices against various issues. The association has raised protests in various forms. The IMA protested the notification in an emergency state council meeting on September 4, 2020, and began an agitation on September9. All 216 branches paid tribute to the doctors in Maharashtra who died treating Covid patients on September 10. All branches have also handed over statements to all district and taluka -level administrators on September 11 and medical council registrations were burnt in protest. On September 15, private hospital owners who are IMA Members will submit copies of their hospital registrations to IMA branch offices. These branches will appeal to the government of Maharashtra to have the government itself run the hospitals as they cannot afford to run the hospitals with the rates decided by the state. Next line of treatment? Doctors’ strike A meeting was conducted between 14 different medical organisations, including ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani and dentistry, on September 12, 2020. All these branches of medicine have supported the IMA and decided to form a joint action committee to work together. The consensus was, “If the government does not sanction the demands of doctors in the next seven days, IMA doctors in Maharashtra will stop working indefinitely”, read a statement issued after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/216-ima-emails-will-ask-maharashtra-govt-to-run-pvt-hospitals-today/story-ihcZ7IRrnoqexhyFS7YDEM.html
15-09-2020||Jaipur||Jaipur: Man surrenders after killing wife, mother-in-law||A 39-year-old man from Jaipur city, Rajasthan, allegedly murdered his wife and mother-in-law by slitting their throat on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. Then, he went to the police station with his three children and surrendered to the police. Preliminary probe revealed that the man killed his wife because he doubted her character. The accused has been identified as Ramkishan Saini and the two deceased were Manju Saini (35) and Gaura Devi (57). Also read: Wife of Calcutta High Court lawyer pronounced guilty of murdering him in 2018Saini told the police that the family lived in his in-laws’ house in Shivam Colony on Chandlai Road. Around 1am on Monday, when everyone was asleep, Saini said, he slit the throats of Manju and Devi. “The accused reached Chaksu police station from where he was taken to Shivdaspura police station where he again confessed in front of his children after which a first information report (FIR) under section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code was registered. A team from the police station was rushed to the spot to verify the information,” said Manoj Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), South. When the team reached the spot, the two bodies were recovered after which the accused was detained and a team of forensic science laboratory and dog squad were sent to the spot. Later, the accused was arrested. “Saini claims that his wife was having an extra-marital affair and his mother-in-law supported her. He said the two women were conspiring to kill him and would have done so had he not killed them. We are yet to verify his claims,” added Kumar. A police official who didn’t wish to be named said that the accused is a native of Chaksu town and was jobless since lockdown. Before that he used to work at a stone and gems workshop. “He had no guilt about the murders and kept saying he did it to survive. He was upset his wife’s alleged relationship outside the marriage and his mother-in-law’s alleged jibes,” the official said. The family members of both the sides have reached the spot and looking after the three children.

15-09-2020||World||UAE, Bahrain sign US-brokered diplomatic pacts with Israel||Declaring “the dawn of a new Middle East”, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday presided over the signing of historic diplomatic pacts between Israel and the Arab states of UAE and Bahrain, which he hopes will lead to a new order in the Middle East and cast him as a peacemaker ahead of the November 3 election. The deals, denounced by the Palestinians, make UAE and Bahrain the third and fourth Arab states to take such steps to normalise ties since Israel signed peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.As the ceremony was underway at the White House lawn, two rockets were fired from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip into Israel, the Israeli army said.The signing of the deals, called the Abraham Accords, capped a dramatic sequence of events when the UAE and Bahrain agreed to reverse decades of ill will towards Israel without a resolution of its decades-old dispute with the Palestinians.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined Emirati foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah Al Nahyan and Bahrain’s foreign minister Abdullatif Al Zayani for the signing ceremony.Meeting Netanyahu in the Oval Office earlier, Trump said, “We’ll have at least five or six countries coming along very quickly” to forge their own accords with Israel. But Trump did not name any of the nations involved in such talks.The agreements were signed in three languages: English, Arabic and Hebrew. Trump is expected to use the signing of the pacts to bolster his image at home to seek a second term, fending off a stiff challenge from Democratic candidate Joe Biden.“Together these agreements will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive peace across the entire region, something which nobody thought was possible, certainly not in this day and age, may be in many decades from now,” Trump said before the signing of the agreements.He added: “For generations, the people of the Middle East have been held back by old conflicts hostilities lies treacheries so many things held them back… These agreements prove that the nations of the region are breaking free from the failed approaches of the past.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-bahrain-sign-us-brokered-diplomatic-pacts-with-israel/story-n8tKsa9p3hm0MHEa3YVhyK.html
15-09-2020||World||Alexei Navalny says ‘amazing’ to breathe unaided, eyes Russia return||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Tuesday he was able to breathe unaided in his first public comments after his suspected poisoning, while his aide said he planned to return from Germany once recovered.“Hello, this is Navalny,” he wrote in a post on Instagram that has racked up more than 1 million “likes” in a few hours. Supporters saluted what they said was the 44-year-old’s return from the dead.Taking to social media for the first time after he fell seriously ill in Siberia on August 20, Navalny posted a picture, appearing with his wife and two children in the Berlin hospital where he was flown for treatment.Wearing a hospital gown and sitting up in bed, he looked gaunt and barely smiled, while his wife Yulia beamed next to him.The outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin collapsed on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow after a trip to support opposition candidates in local elections.German experts say there is “unequivocal evidence” that Russia’s most prominent opposition figure was poisoned with Novichok, a potent nerve agent. Moscow has dismissed the findings, saying its doctors found no trace of poison.“Yesterday I was able to breathe on my own all day,” Navalny wrote.“It’s an amazing process and underestimated by many. I recommend it,” quipped Navalny, who has 1.8 million followers on Instagram.“I miss you,” he told his supporters.The anti-corruption campaigner’s suspected poisoning has sparked sharp condemnation from Western leaders, who have called for a thorough investigation and for those responsible to be brought to justice. Germany said Monday that French and Swedish labs had independently confirmed findings by doctors in Berlin that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok.‘Back from the dead’Navalny’s allies say the use of the banned chemical weapon means that only the Russian state could be responsible.Throughout the day, supporters greeted Navalny on social media. “Navalny has come back from the dead. He deserves to be Russia’s president,” one post said on Twitter. Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said separately that the opposition leader planned to return to Russia.“No other option has ever been considered,” she told AFP.Russia has dismissed Germany’s findings, saying its doctors found no trace of poison when Navalny was first taken to hospital in Siberia. This week, Putin dismissed “unsubstantiated claims” over his critic’s illness.The director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Naryshkin, on Tuesday reiterated that Russian doctors had found no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.“Therefore, we have many questions for the German side,” Naryshkin told reporters.Medics in the Siberian city of Omsk had carried out robust tests and saved the opposition leader’s life, he said.He added that Russia had destroyed stockpiles of Novichok, a Soviet-designed nerve agent, and that allegations Russia stored the chemical weapon amounted to “disinformation”.Despite international calls for Russia to carry out a transparent investigation or risk sanctions, it has not opened a criminal probe.‘Navalny refuses Russia probe’Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to cooperate with German doctors, but that medics in Berlin had not yet shared Navalny’s test results.“For some reason, we haven’t received a response from our German counterparts,” Peskov said.The New York Times, citing German officials, said Navalny had refused to cooperate with a Russian request to investigate the case together with Germany. His spokeswoman Yarmysh declined to comment on the report.The case has heightened tensions between Russia and the West, and sharpened calls for Germany to abandon the nearly completed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.Navalny’s post came a day after his allies claimed symbolic victories in local elections held throughout Russia’s regions on Sunday, with opposition candidates claiming seats on city councils in Tomsk and Novosibirsk.Russia has been accused in the past of poisoning critics. Novichok was also used in the 2018 attack on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-says-amazing-to-breathe-unaided-eyes-russia-return/story-ECcVjG5oYDrMFK8qbnIEiP.html
15-09-2020||World||Israel-Gulf normalisation moves follow years of failed diplomatic initiatives||Israel’s normalisation accords with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to be signed on Tuesday follow a history of peace efforts between Israel, the Palestinians and their Arab allies that have failed to overcome decades of distrust and violence. Most Arab nations have not recognised Israel or had formal diplomatic or economic relations with it because of what they regard as Israel’s thwarting of Palestinians’ aspirations for a state of their own.Here are the main Middle East peace initiatives undertaken since a 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights:1967 - U.N. Security Council Resolution 242After the Six-Day War, U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 calls for the “withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict” in return for all states in the area to respect one another’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.The resolution is the foundation for many peace initiatives, but its imprecise phrasing - is the reference to all territories or just some? - has complicated efforts for decades.1978 - Camp David agreementIsrael’s Menachem Begin and Egypt’s Anwar Sadat agree on a framework for regional peace that calls for an Israeli withdrawal in stages from Egypt’s Sinai and a transitional Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza. 1979 - Israeli-Egyptian peace treatyThe first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country sets out plans for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai within three years. In 1981, Sadat was assassinated by Islamist revolutionaries opposed to the deal.1991 - Madrid summitRepresentatives of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) attend a peace conference. No agreements are reached but the scene is set for direct contacts.1994 - Israel-Jordan agreementJordan becomes the second Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. But the treaty is unpopular and pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread in Jordan.1993-1995 - Declaration of Principles/Oslo AccordsIsrael and the PLO hold secret talks in Norway that result in interim peace accords calling for the establishment of a Palestinian interim self-government and an elected council in the West Bank and Gaza for a five-year transitional period, Israeli troop withdrawals and negotiations on a permanent settlement. 2000 - Camp David summitU.S. President Bill Clinton convenes Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David. They fail to agree. Another Palestinian uprising ensues.2002-2003 - Bush Declaration/Arab peace initiative/Road MapGeorge W. Bush becomes the first U.S. president to call for the creation of a Palestinian state, living side by side with Israel “in peace and security”.2002 - Saudi Arabia presents Arab League-endorsed peace plan for full Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and Israel’s acceptance of a Palestinian state in return for normal relations with Arab countries. The United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia present their own road map to a permanent two-state solution to the conflict.2007 - Annapolis summitPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert fail to reach a deal at a U.S.-hosted summit. Olmert says later they were close to a deal but a graft investigation against him and a Gaza war in 2008 scupper any agreement.2009 - Netanyahu’s Bar-Ilan addressIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would be prepared for a peace deal that includes the establishment of a demilitarised Palestinian state. He also sets another condition: Palestinian recognition of Israel as the “state of the Jewish people”.2013-2014 - Washington peace talks/negotiations collapseU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry coaxes Israelis and Palestinians to resume talks. They fail and are suspended in April 2014.June 2019 - Trump economic plan announcedPreliminary stage of Trump’s Mideast Plan launched in Bahrain by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. He takes an “economy first” approach, calling for a $50 billion investment fund to boost the Palestinian and neighbouring Arab economies. Palestinian leaders dismiss it.2019Netanyahu says he intends to annex West Bank settlements, and much of the Jordan Valley if elected. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo effectively backs Israel’s claimed right to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank by abandoning a four-decade-old U.S. position that they were inconsistent with international law. Most countries still regard them as illegal.January 2020 - Trump unveils his full Mideast plan in Washington, alongside Netanyahu. It offered U.S. recognition for Israel’s sovereignty over its West Bank settlements and required Palestinians to meet difficult conditions for a state. Palestinians reject it as de facto annexation, saying it would leave them a fragmented “Swiss-cheese” state. Israel’s far-right settlers also reject the plan, opposing any form of Palestinian state.Aug. 13, 2020 - Trump announces surprise deal to normalise relations between Israel and the UAE. Emirati officials say the deal puts an end to West Bank annexation. But Netanyahu says it only meant Israel had agreed to “temporarily wait”.Sept. 11, 2020 - Bahrain struck an agreement to normalize relations with Israel, saying it would “increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region” in a joint statement with Israel and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-gulf-normalisation-moves-follow-years-of-failed-diplomatic-initiatives/story-QkatJtumdNoTcSJYg5E7KO.html
15-09-2020||World||India wins three elections to key UN bodies||India has scored a hat-trick of election wins at the United Nations ahead of the General Assembly’s 75th session, which will be held virtually due to Covid-19 pandemic.India beat China to win a four-year term on the UN’s Commission on the Status of Women (CWS), a prestigious wing of the world body’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). India also won a seat each, through endorsements, to two other ECOSOC bodies — the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) and the Commission on Population and Development (CPD). Terms will begin 2021 when India will also start its two-year stint on the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.“India wins seat in prestigious #ECOSOC body!” T S Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, announced in a tweet on Monday. “India elected Member of Commission on Status of Women #CSW. It’s a ringing endorsement of our commitment to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in all our endeavours.”Elections to the two other bodies were announced in a follow-up tweet by the K Nagaraj Naidu, the deputy permanent representative, on Tuesday. “India gets elected to three #ECOSOC bodies,” he wrote. India, Afghanistan and China were in the fray for the two seats to the CWS from the Asia-Pacific group. With all 54 members of the Economic and Social Council voting, Afghanistan and India were elected with 39 and 38 votes respectively. China ended with 27, one short of the cut-off tally of 28.Others who also went through were Argentina, Austria, Dominican Republic, Israel, Latvia, Nigeria, Turkey and Zambia.The CWS is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It was established in June 1946 as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council.The CPC is the main subsidiary organ of the ECOSOC and the UN’s General Assembly for planning, programming and coordination. The CPD describes itself as a functional commission that assists ECOSOC in the implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development.The General Assembly started its historic session on Tuesday, but the general debates, which are scheduled to start on September 22, will be held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic. New York, where the UN is headquartered, was the hardest hit city anywhere in the world, though things are far better now.Leaders of member states will address the assembly through pre-recorded videos, which will be presented at the debate by their respective delegations. Other meetings of the world body will follow the same format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-wins-three-elections-to-key-un-bodies/story-KVeuBoVBNGlyLypVQ3q0xL.html
15-09-2020||World||Govt must change how economies work after pandemic, says OECD report||The Covid-19 pandemic requires societies to make critical choices about the kind of economies countries wish to rebuild, and change the way current levers of the economic structure works, a new report released on Tuesday has said.Commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and written by Sheffield University professor Michael Jacobs, it said the pandemic has raised serious challenges, coming on top of the financial crisis, climate change and inequalities of the last decade.Governments must change the way the economy works in the wake of the pandemic, said the report based on inputs by an international advisory group, calling on countries to go ‘beyond growth’ and radically reorient economic policy.The report warned that the dominant patterns of economic growth in OECD countries have generated ‘significant harms’ over recent decades – including rising inequality and catastrophic environmental degradation. It called for a paradigm shift in the way developed countries approach economic policy – so that instead of focusing on gross domestic product (GDP), they prioritise environmental sustainability, improving wellbeing, reducing inequality and strengthening economic resilience.These goals should be built into the structures of the economy from the outset, rather than hoped for as a by-product, or added after the event, it said. The report argued that this will require a new role for the state, with governments becoming more entrepreneurial, seeking to shape markets and steer the process of economic change, not simply correcting market failures. This “new kind of social contract” would transform the relationship between the state, business, civil society and citizens, said the report, titled ‘Beyond Growth: Towards a New Economic Approach’.Jacobs said: “The Covid-19 crisis needs to lead to a major reset in economic policy. Before the crisis, Western economies were already experiencing financial instability, environmental breakdown and rising inequality, so a return to the status quo would be disastrous.”“Just as in the 1940s and 1980s major economic crises led to paradigm shifts in economic thinking and policy, so today we need to rethink how we define and measure economic success. As governments spend unprecedented sums to rebuild their economies after the pandemic, they must look beyond growth alone to prioritise the needs of people and planet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/govt-must-change-how-economies-work-after-pandemic-says-oecd-report/story-ev83kwSZBCALUotJPPjBYP.html
15-09-2020||World||Japan PM Abe, Cabinet set to resign ahead of new leadership||Outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Cabinet are set to resign Wednesday morning, clearing the way for his successor to take over after parliamentary confirmation later in the day.Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, announced last month that he was stepping down because of health problems.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, long seen as Abe’s right-hand man, was chosen Monday as the new head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, virtually guaranteeing his election as prime minister in a parliamentary vote Wednesday because of the party’s majority.Suga, a self-made politician and the son of a strawberry grower in the northern prefecture of Akita, has stressed his background in promising to serve the interests of ordinary people and rural communities.He has said he will pursue Abe’s unfinished policies, and that his top priorities will be fighting the coronavirus and turning around an economy battered by the pandemic. He gained the support of party heavyweights and their followers early in the campaign on expectations he would continue Abe’s line.Suga has been a loyal supporter of Abe since Abe’s first stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007. Abe’s tenure ended abruptly because of illness, and Suga helped him return as prime minister in 2012.Suga has praised Abe’s diplomacy and economic policies when asked about what he would like to accomplish as prime minister.Suga, who does not belong to any wing within the party and opposes factionalism, says he is a reformer who will break down vested interests and rules that hamper reforms. He says he will set up a new government agency to speed up Japan’s lagging digital transformation.Suga said he will appoint “reform-minded, hard-working people” to the new Cabinet, to be launched later Wednesday. Media reports say some key ministers, including Finance Minister Taro Aso, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto, will stay.Compared to his political prowess at home, Suga has hardly traveled overseas and his diplomatic skills are unknown, though he is largely expected to pursue Abe’s priorities.The new prime minister will inherit a range of challenges, including relations with China, which continues its assertive actions in the contested East China Sea, and what to do with the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed to next summer due to the coronavirus. And he will have to establish a good relationship with whomever wins the U.S. presidential race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-abe-cabinet-set-to-resign-ahead-of-new-leadership/story-urUu2FS1X6XePCrevYJYgO.html
15-09-2020||World||‘Unwanted references’: Pak rejects US-India statement asking it to act on terror||Pakistan rejected what it called “unwarranted references” against it in a joint US-India statement on terrorism, saying it was important that partner countries, a reference to US, should refrain from one-sided positions. The Pakistan foreign office was reacting to the statement at the end of the 17th meeting of the US-India Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and the third session of the Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10. It had said India and the US “underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot.”“Our serious concerns and rejection of the unacceptable reference to Pakistan in the aforementioned joint statement have been conveyed to the US side,” the Pakistan foreign office said in a statement on Tuesday.It was important that “partner countries take an objective view of the issues of peace and security in South Asia,” it said. It also urged them to “refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities”.Claiming that Pakistan is a country “most affected by cross-border terrorism, sponsored and supported by India”, it said the world recognises Pakistan’s efforts, sacrifices and successes in the fight against terrorism.“Pakistan has repeatedly underlined that peace and stability in South Asia is threatened by the irresponsible policies and actions of the RSS-BJP regime in India — including towards its minorities, its state-terrorism in Indian occupied Kashmir, and its belligerence against Pakistan and other countries in the region,” said the statement.It urged the world to “reverse course and desist from playing a role detrimental to regional peace and stability”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unwanted-references-pak-rejects-us-india-statement-asking-it-to-act-on-terror/story-gceNm1p2SkdUmgwYx47SrL.html
15-09-2020||World||After UAE and Bahrain deals, is Saudi Arabia softening its stance on Israel?||When one of Saudi Arabia’s leading clerics called this month for Muslims to avoid “passionate emotions and fiery enthusiasm” towards Jews, it was a marked change in tone for someone who has shed tears preaching about Palestine in the past.The sermon by Abdulrahman al-Sudais, imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, broadcast on Saudi state television on Sept. 5, came three weeks after the United Arab Emirates agreed a historic deal to normalise relations with Israel and days before the Gulf state of Bahrain, a close Saudi ally, followed suit.Sudais, who in past sermons prayed for Palestinians to have victory over the “invader and aggressor” Jews, spoke about how the Prophet Mohammad was good to his Jewish neighbour and argued the best way to persuade Jews to convert to Islam was to “treat them well”.While Saudi Arabia is not expected to follow the example of its Gulf allies any time soon, Sudais’ remarks could be a clue to how the kingdom approaches the sensitive subject of warming to Israel - a once inconceivable prospect. Appointed by the king, he is one of the country’s most influential figures, reflecting the views of its conservative religious establishment as well as the Royal Court. The dramatic agreements with the UAE and Bahrain were a coup for Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump who is portraying himself as a peacemaker ahead of November elections. But the big diplomatic prize for an Israel deal would be Saudi Arabia, whose king is the Custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, and rules the world’s largest oil exporter. Marc Owen Jones, an academic from the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, said the UAE and Bahrain’s normalization has allowed Saudi Arabia to test public opinion, but a formal deal with Israel would be a “large task” for the kingdom. “Giving the Saudis a ‘nudge’ via an influential imam is obviously one step in trying to test the public reaction and to encourage the notion of normalisation,” Jones added.In Washington, a State Department official said the United States was encouraged by warming ties between Israel and Gulf Arab countries, viewed this trend as a positive development and “we are engaging to build on it.”There was no immediate response to a request by Reuters for comment from the Saudi government’s media office. Sudais’ plea to shun intense feelings is a far cry from his past when he wept dozens of times while praying for Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque - Islam’s third-holiest site.The Sept. 5 sermon drew a mixed reaction, with some Saudis defending him as simply communicating the teachings of Islam. Others on Twitter, mostly Saudis abroad and apparently critical of the government, called it “the normalisation sermon”.Ali al-Suliman, one of several Saudis interviewed at one of Riyadh’s malls by Reuters TV, said in reaction to the Bahrain deal that normalisation with Israel by other Gulf states or in the wider Middle East was hard to get used to, as “Israel is an occupying nation and drove Palestinians out of their homes”. MUTUAL FEAR OF IRANSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de-facto ruler often referred to as MbS, has promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reform. The young prince previously stated that Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land on condition of a peace agreement that assures stability for all sides. Saudi Arabia and Israel’s mutual fear of Iran may be a key driver for the development of ties.There have been other signs that Saudi Arabia, one of the most influential countries in the Middle East, is preparing its people to eventually warm to Israel. A period drama, “Umm Haroun” that aired during Ramadan in April on Saudi-controlled MBC television, a time when viewership typically spikes, centred around the trials of a Jewish midwife. The fictional series was about a multi-religious community in an unspecified Gulf Arab state in the 1930s to 1950s. The show drew criticism from the Palestinian Hamas group, saying it portrayed Jews in a sympathetic light. At the time, MBC said that the show was the top-rated Gulf drama in Saudi Arabia in Ramadan. The show’s writers, both Bahraini, told Reuters it had no political message. But experts and diplomats said it was another indication of shifting public discourse on Israel.Earlier this year, Mohammed al-Aissa, a former Saudi minister and the general secretary of the Muslim World League, visited Auschwitz. In June, he took part in a conference organised by the American Jewish Committee, where he called for a world without “Islamophobia and anti-Semitism”. “Certainly, MbS is intent on moderating state-sanctioned messages shared by the clerical establishment and part of that will likely work towards justifying any future deal with Israel, which would have seemed unthinkable before,” said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow with Chatham House.ISOLATED PALESTINIANS Normalisation between the UAE, Bahrain and Israel, which will be signed at the White House on Tuesday, has further isolated the Palestinians.Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has not directly addressed Israel’s deals with the UAE and Bahrain, but said it remains committed to peace on the basis of the long-standing Arab Peace Initiative. How, or whether, the kingdom would seek to exchange normalisation for a deal on those terms remains unclear.That initiative offers normalised ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war.However, in another eye-catching gesture of goodwill, the kingdom has allowed Israel-UAE flights to use its airspace. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has a close relationship with MbS, praised the move last week.A diplomat in the Gulf said that for Saudi Arabia, the issue is more related to what he called its religious position as the leader of the Muslim world, and that a formal deal with Israel would take time and is unlikely to happen while King Salman is still in power.“Any normalisation by Saudi will open doors for Iran, Qatar and Turkey to call for internationalising the two holy mosques,” he said, referring to periodic calls by critics of Riyadh to have Mecca and Medina placed under international supervision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-uae-and-bahrain-deals-is-saudi-arabia-softening-its-stance-on-israel/story-C1k4HJRS7pEOD4wd9DwloK.html
15-09-2020||World||In Donald Trump clash, TikTok founder takes page from ‘Art of the Deal’||Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok-parent company ByteDance Ltd., is showing Donald Trump he knows something about dealmaking too.In his proposal to partner with Oracle Corp. to address US security concerns about the hit video app, the Chinese entrepreneur is offering Trump something the president has already declared unacceptable. The question now is whether Trump rejects the proposal, acquiesces or, perhaps most likely for the man behind the ‘Art of the Deal,’ opens negotiations for a compromise.For months, the president has said that TikTok must be sold to an American owner -- or shut down. What Zhang has proposed instead is a partnership with Oracle that would allow ByteDance to retain ownership of the business, while the US software giant becomes its “trusted technology provider” to protect user data.Final details are in flux, but ByteDance’s venture investors may also take equity stakes in the TikTok business. It’s also possible the Chinese parent will try to keep full ownership of the unit, according to one person familiar with the discussions.China hawks quickly declared the offer dead on arrival. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, wrote a letter to the US Treasury Secretary saying that the administration should “promptly reject” the partnership and press the Chinese parent to work out a “more acceptable solution.”Zhang’s opening gambit may simply be aimed at buying himself more time as he tries to survive the clash of the world’s two superpowers. He is starting from a tough stance to open negotiations and avoid an immediate TikTok shutdown. It’s a lesson that could have been taken directly from Trump’s memoir on his days in real estate.“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it,” the president wrote in his best-selling autobiography with Tony Schwartz. “That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.”Zhang is offering a few things likely to resonate with Trump. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday ByteDance’s proposal would create 20,000 jobs and bring to the US the headquarters for “TikTok Global,” presumably the video app’s entire international operation. Trump has made bringing jobs to the country a cornerstone of his campaign as he heads toward November’s presidential election.Zhang has also aligned himself with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a fervent supporter of the president who appears to have his trust. That alliance may persuade Trump to accept a deal from Oracle he wouldn’t from another company.“Oracle is a great company,” Trump said in August. “I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He’s a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.”It’s not clear whether the Oracle deal includes a payment to the federal government -- a fee that Trump has insisted on for weeks. That demand has baffled policy experts, but it may improve ByteDance’s odds of approval, if included.Trump has made TikTok the central example of his campaign to get tough on China. He signed an executive order that bans the app in the US on Sept. 20, and, in addition, ruled that ByteDance must sell the video app’s US assets by mid-November under an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS.Heading into the last weekend of August, Zhang had been leaning toward a proposal from Microsoft Corp., where he had briefly worked. The agreement called for a full buyout of TikTok US by the software giant and partner Walmart Inc.But the Chinese government intervened at the last minute with a new set of restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including those used in the app. Beijing insisted its regulators must also approve any asset sales by ByteDance.China’s move was seen by several people involved in the talks as an effort to give Zhang more leverage. He couldn’t give away too much to the Trump administration or Beijing wouldn’t sign off.Instead, Zhang turned to Ellison and Oracle. Best known for its corporate software, the Redwood City, Calif.-based company has a growing cloud computing business that could be used to host videos and strong technical capabilities for securing user data. Ellison is also known for his fierce combativeness. When Hewlett Packard fired its CEO for an alleged inappropriate relationship, Ellison called it -- publicly -- “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs.”What Zhang and Ellison crafted is nothing like the deal that the Trump administration had anticipated. Instead of buying the business outright, Oracle would make an investment in a newly restructured TikTok, people familiar with the proposal said. At least two shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent company, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, would take stakes in the new business, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t finalized.“Based on the information that we have at the moment about the Oracle deal, I can’t say that I’m hugely reassured,” Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Bloomberg Television. “ByteDance is essentially under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.”Yet Mnuchin made it sound like the proposal is worthy of serious consideration.“We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, phones are secure, and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical team,” Mnuchin told CNBC during an interview early Monday.Even if TikTok’s data is stored by Oracle in the US, ByteDance could keep some control over the app’s algorithms, the computer code behind what the service uses to pick and choose which videos are shown to which users. If TikTok’s algorithms remain in the hands of ByteDance, they run the risk of being manipulated by Beijing.“The CCP has enormous leverage over this company and that means it would be trivially easy for the CCP to force ByteDance to very subtly nudge up or promote content that would be preferential to one presidential candidate, for instance,” said Ryan.Ultimately, Zhang circled back to proposing a transaction similar to what he originally offered to address American scrutiny. ByteDance had been willing to set up a global headquarters for TikTok with a separate board, although he always wanted keep his ownership.Perhaps in the end, the Chinese entrepreneur decided he could live with the dire consequences of a ban. Trump may be able to shutter TikTok in the US, but Zhang would maintain full ownership elsewhere -- and perhaps return to the country in the future if the political environment changes.It’s a mindset Trump may be able to comprehend.“It’s been said that I believe in the power of positive thinking. In fact, I believe in the power of negative thinking,” the president wrote in his book. “If you plan for the worst— if you can live with the worst— the good will always take care of itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-donald-trump-clash-tiktok-founder-takes-page-from-art-of-the-deal/story-GFFnaqQjS2eLs6XRL3QLcP.html
15-09-2020||World||Trump accuses Biden of taking performance-enhancing substance: Report||President Donald Trump, in his latest shredding of political niceties, suggested Tuesday that his Democratic opponent Joe Biden has taken drugs to improve his performance in debates.The Republican, who is well behind in the polls, initially insinuated during a Fox News interview that “something was strange” with what he saw as Biden’s improvement during the Democratic primary season debates.Early on, when there were multiple Democratic candidates lined up on stage, Biden was “a disaster” and “grossly incompetent,” Trump said. But at a later debate where Biden was one-on-one with leftist rival Bernie Sanders, “he was OK.”Trump told Fox he didn’t want to say what he thought was the reason for the improvement.Seconds later, he did.“He’s taking something or you know, gives him some clarity, or whatever,” he said.Trump repeated his demand that Biden should undergo a drug test before their first of three presidential debates scheduled for September 29.“I would take one too,” he said.Trump, 74, has for months tried to persuade voters that Biden, 77, is suffering from mental decline.The former businessman cites Biden’s penchant for gaffes -- which some believe to be linked to the Democrat’s lifelong struggle with stuttering -- and his reluctance to face unscripted questioning from reporters.Trump -- who takes questions from reporters almost daily but is known for his own frequently garbled and baffling statements -- said, “Joe is lost. We can’t have a president that is mentally lost.”Trump told Fox that, with attacks from the Democrat side gaining intensity, he will now “take the gloves off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-accuses-biden-of-taking-performance-enhancing-substance-report/story-k6qaHKkEBBaMQsyPbSjejM.html

In the week ending September 4, it registered the lowest fatalities in the last four months, but new cases are rising, with experts seeing a second wave.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Tuesday that of all deaths registered in the Week 36 of the year, 78 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificates, which is “the lowest number of deaths in the last 25 weeks”, accounting for 1% of all deaths in England and Wales.The ONS figures relate to deaths in all settings, not only in hospitals, and are based on cause mentioned in death certificates. The Department of Health’s figures relate to cases and deaths in hospitals and care homes.According to the department’s figures as of Monday evening, the country-wide death figure is 41,637, with 371,125 overall number of cases tested positive. The day-rise tally was 2,621, prompting concern over rising numbers after day-cases in the hundreds in July and August.There is also growing concern over the inability of many across the country to have tests, with several people told to reach test centres far from their homes. There are instances of health professionals unable to get tests, affecting their ability to work in hospitals.John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and a government adviser on life sciences, told BBC: “I think what’s going wrong is the second wave…A month ago, they had spare capacity in testing – significant spare capacity – but I think what has been underestimated was the speed at which the second wave would arrive”.“So, I think they are definitely behind the curve in terms of getting the necessary tests for what we need today”.Priti Patel, home secretary, regretted the inability of people to get tests, but said: “Tests are available, you’ve heard me say, particularly in local lockdown areas, I’ve seen this myself, I’ve seen the teams that have been working on this”.“Mobile testing is going in, capacity is going into local areas where lockdowns have been undertaken and are taking place. I think it is wrong to say tests are not available, new book-in slots are being made available every single day, mobile testing units are being made available”.As of September 9, there were 793 deaths of patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in hospitals - the highest among ethnic minorities, who account for 13 per cent of deaths in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-deaths-are-down-but-fears-of-a-second-wave-grow/story-OHqWe7X0bd6p2oFM0YiPPI.html

The former defense secretary, who left the administration in January 2019, has been critical of Trump.“To me he was a terrible general, he was a bad leader,” Trump said of Mattis.A book written by Journalist Bob Woodward in 2018 said Trump urged Mattis to come up with a plan to kill Assad, but that the then-Defense secretary did not go along with the president’s demands. That came after a chemical attack on civilians in 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian government.After the book was released, Trump denied that he’d sought Assad’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-wanted-to-kill-syria-s-assad-after-earlier-denying-it/story-KBajiAUn5uYY9hRQmlqCdJ.html

Federal education minister Shafqat Mehmood, during a visit to a college in Islamabad’s G-6/3 area, hailed the reopening of schools amid the pandemic. He was hopeful that SOPs will be implemented and warned that institutions that do not follow the government’s guidelines will be closed for non-compliance.Pakistan had closed schools in March when the government enforced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.Authorities lifted curbs on most businesses in May, but schools remained closed across the country.On Tuesday, Pakistan reported six new deaths from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, one of the lowest number tolls in more than five months.

While India has thus far reported a total of over 4.9 million cases of the disease, as per Union health ministry data, globally, there have been over 29 million cases of the disease thus far, as per worldometers.As various possible vaccines are trialled across the world, and people hope for a breakthrough, US businessman and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Tuesday called India a leading vaccine producer, adding India’s cooperation is needed to manufacture Covid-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) expressed apprehension there won’t be enough vaccine for everyone in the world before 2024-end.Here are the latest developments in Covid-19 vaccine trials:• Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Tuesday expressed hope for a large-scale Covid-19 vaccine rollout in India next year. “All of us want to get a vaccine out in India as fast as we can, once we know that its very effective and very safe.• Poonawalla, whose SII is in partnership with five international firms-including AstraZeneca and Novovax-to develop a vaccine, said world will need around 15 billion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, if it is a two-dose vaccine.• AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trials have been put on hold in the US till at least midweek, pending a US investigation into a serious side effect in Britain, sources familiar with developments said. • The World Health Organisation (WHO), meanwhile, praised AstraZeneca’s decision to halt its Covid-19 vaccine trials, saying safety is always critical, crucial and has been looked at by AstraZeneca ‘in an appropriate manner.’• A Chinese official said vaccine may be available for public use in the country in November 2020. China currently has four vaccines in final stage of clinical trials, of which at least three have been offered for emergency use.• Over 300 volunteers were inoculated during the post-registration trials of Russia’s CovidD-19 vaccine, dubbed Sputnik V, with 14% reporting ‘minor complaints.’(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-latest-updates-bill-gates-sees-key-role-for-india-astrazeneca-us-trials-on-hold/story-bMq5POVyRGjKgioOqsuwDO.html
15-09-2020||World||‘Herd immunity can’t end the pandemic…a vaccine is critical’: Bill Gates||A vaccine is critical to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, and India’s pharmaceutical industry and will play a major role because of its ability to manufacture high-quality vaccines at affordable prices, said Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder and co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in an email interview to HT.The BMGF’s fourth annual Goalkeepers Report released on Tuesday said social and economic impacts of the pandemic have reinforced inequities and derailed 20 years of progress toward the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals that aim to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change by 2030.Economic damage from Covid-19 is reinforcing inequalities, and extreme poverty has increased by 7%. The International Monetary Fund projections say that despite the US$18 trillion economic stimulus spent around the world, the global economy will lose US$12 trillion or more by the end of 2021, which is the biggest global GDP loss since the end of World War II.Are vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) likely to provide long-lasting protection? It’s too soon to make predictions about how long protection might last. At this point, we don’t have enough data on the duration of antibody and T-cell response to the disease itself, let alone to the various vaccine candidates. Many of the vaccine trials underway should start to report efficacy data in the next few months, which will start to provide answers to these critical questions. The good news is that there is a large portfolio of vaccines in testing, each with a different approach. This gives the greatest possible chance to develop effective vaccines.Also Read: India likely to play key role in manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccine: Bill GatesWhat role can India’s pharmaceutical and vaccine producers play in stopping Covid-19? They can and will play a major role, because they have the ability to manufacture high-quality vaccines at scale for affordable prices. One great example is the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures more vaccines than any other company in the world. Our foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, recently announced funding to the Serum Institute to help it ramp up manufacturing capacity so it can produce up to 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine for low- and middle-income countries in 2021. Serum has agreed to price its vaccines at no more than $3 per dose. Serum is just one company in a very dynamic sector that can support the Covid-19 response. Prior to Covid-19, our foundation has worked extensively with other innovative Indian companies, including Bharat Biotech and BioE, to support them as they develop and deliver safe and effective vaccines for India and for the world. Can Covid-19 end without a vaccine? Is herd immunity possible without a vaccine? When people refer to a herd immunity strategy to manage the pandemic, there are two issues they’re not addressing. The first is that letting people get sick until most are immune and the disease no longer spreads easily will lead to many millions of deaths. The second is that herd immunity is always temporary, because children are born without immunity, and eventually there will be enough susceptible people that the disease can start spreading easily again. For both reasons, a vaccine is critical. It will save lives now and protect future generations from re-living this experience. Also Read: Covid-19 has set global health progress back decades: Gates FoundationSeveral rich countries have pre-ordered millions of doses of vaccines. Does that mean poor and marginalised people will get vaccinated last? How are BMGF and partners ensuring equitable access to vaccines? We are working with many partners on several different fronts to prevent that from happening. One of the key partners is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has 20 years of experience helping low-income countries immunise their people. Gavi is helping support Serum Institute in the deal I just mentioned, and it’s one of the main partners in an initiative called COVAX, which brings countries together to pool investments in developing, manufacturing, and delivering vaccines equitably around the world. So far, about 80 countries have made commitments to the COVAX Facility, so momentum is building. In the next month, one of our priorities is to help raise the money that’s needed to ensure that vaccines don’t just go to the highest bidder. Have we had partnerships for a health response at this scale ever before? Is this the future? That’s one of the big tests of this historical moment. Will we see new models of collaboration emerge to meet this new kind of crisis—or will countries turn inward and try to fight a global problem with national interventions? The root cause of everything that’s happening is a virus that doesn’t recognise borders. Borders matter less and less to the global economy, too. While policies that stop at borders may help citizens of a given country cope with the symptoms of the crisis, they won’t stop it. Every country will benefit when all countries work together on solutions. Hopefully, this crisis helps the world understand that and act accordingly. What is the role of technology and data in the Covid-19 response? It would be hard to overstate the importance of data. Right now, while we’re waiting for treatments and vaccines and have to rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions like contract-tracing, quarantine, and social distancing to contain the disease, we need to know with precision how it is spreading. The more countries know about who is at risk, the more likely they are to be able to devise strategies to keep case numbers low. When new treatments and vaccines become available, data will be critical in helping the world determine how those new tools are changing the patterns of disease. As we learn more about Covid-19, we will get better at fighting it—but only if we have access to the data we need to put those lessons to use. You have been saying the world is not prepared for the next pandemic since the H1N1 in 2009. Are we better prepared now? We know a lot more now about what it will take to be fully prepared. We’ve seen examples of partners working in new ways that will help keep the next pandemic from doing as much damage as this one. For example, scientific researchers are collaborating to invent more new solutions, faster. Global health organisations are building innovative partnerships to coordinate their responses. But we will need to watch carefully over the next several years to see whether the world follows through to institutionalise all this new knowledge and these new capabilities. That will mean investing enough in a permanent infrastructure of pandemic preparedness and response that we’re never caught flat-footed again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-can-t-end-the-pandemic-a-vaccine-is-critical-bill-gates/story-Dqnv2LW5JipoN7yZm7HPsO.html
15-09-2020||World||Kamala Harris sends ‘game on’ signal to donors sitting on their wallets||Kamala Harris’s arrival on the Democratic presidential ticket has helped prompt an historic outpouring of contributions, bringing in women donors, Californians and others who had avoided donating to the Biden campaign until they saw his running-mate pick.The pace and magnitude of the mostly virtual fundraising for the Biden-Harris ticket far eclipse what she accomplished during her own presidential run last year and has thrust her into a highly visible role among small-dollar and big-dollar donors, starting with the Democratic bastions in Hollywood and Silicon Valley.Harris was named Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s running mate on August 11. That month, the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee set a record for monthly campaign fundraising with an intake of $364.5 million. Some $48 million alone came in the first two days after Biden announced Harris’s selection.The California senator headlined a fundraiser Monday evening with 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and comedian Amy Poehler that brought in $6 million from 100,000 people with an average donation of $30, Clinton announced. That compares to the $6.3 million that Biden brought in the first 24 hours of his presidential run, when interest was very high.Last week, entertainer Billy Porter and Indian-American television host Padma Lakshmi helped Harris bring in $3 million.“Vice President Biden has never been the strongest fundraiser in Washington,” said Cooper Teboe, a Democratic fundraising strategist in Silicon Valley. “He spent his time in the Senate taking the train home to Delaware every night to be a father to his kids instead of sitting in his office making phone calls, and never fostered the kind of donor relationships many politicians do.”“Senator Harris has been courting supporters and making friends for the better part of two decades. Her nomination was a signal to her Rolodex that it’s game on.”Harris has kept up a torrid pace of virtual fundraisers, holding as many as three a day.“There are a lot of people who were waiting to see who Biden picked,” said California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat and longtime Harris supporter who has co-chaired three online events in recent weeks raising more than $11 million for the Biden campaign. “Once she was chosen, it unleashed a cascade of excitement and support for the ticket. Everyone stood up and started clamoring for events.”The fresh influx of campaign contributions speaks to Democratic donors’ enthusiasm for the symbolic significance of Harris’s appointment as vice-presidential nominee, the first Black and Indian-American woman to appear on a major-party presidential ticket.“Kamala was absolutely the right choice for this moment,” said Stacy Mason, executive director of Electing Women Bay Area. “She has a proven track record, and I think in this moment of reckoning in our country, the choice to pick a Black woman was necessary. I think he had no choice.”For the Hollywood-Silicon Valley corridor, it also helps, donors say, that she’s the first Democratic candidate from California on a presidential ticket in the modern political era, just when the state is being ravaged by climate-change driven wildfires.Some big Democratic donors sat on the sidelines until Harris was in. Among those giving for the first time to the ticket now are: Actor George Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney; Trisha Cardoso, the former communications head for Showtime Networks; Laura Shell, wife of NBC Universal Media Chief Executive Officer Jeff Shell; and director Lee Daniels, Federal Election Commission filings show. All have attended virtual fundraisers with Harris.Professional fundraisers say her network from three successful statewide races was holding back on giving to the Biden campaign as donors waited to see whether Biden would choose a woman -- and a woman of color they know -- as his running mate.The network of female donors Harris who are now contributing to Biden’s presidential effort includes television producer Dayna Bochco, Esprit Holdings co-founder Susie Tompkins Buell and Seagram heiress Ellen Bronfman Hauptman.“This moment means the world to women in the technology industry,” Teboe said. “They know she understands the nuances of tech and how Silicon Valley can maintain its lead in the innovation economy against China.”Electing Women Bay Area hosted a Sept. 1 fundraiser with a minimum donation of $1,000 per person that took in $1.25 million, more than twice its goal. Of the 55 hosts and co-hosts who were part of the event, 37 had donated to Harris before for state races.Recent fundraisers that featured Harris or Harris and Biden together included a Sept. 8 Bay Area event that raised more than $3 million; an Aug. 26 event in Los Angeles with Lakshmi that raised more than $5 million; and a June 9 event that raised more than $3 million, before Harris was named to the ticket.Though the Trump campaign doesn’t release figures, Vice President Mike Pence’s events typically bring in between $1 million and $1.25 million, according to a GOP fundraiser who asked not to be named because he doesn’t speak for the party.Harris’s fundraising network extends beyond California to alumnae of historically Black colleges, her own Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and other Black sororities and fraternities. Members of the “Divine Nine,” the historically Black Greek letter fraternities and sororities, poured in donations to Biden’s campaign in amounts corresponding to the year each group was founded after Harris was picked.Gaynell Hendricks, an Alpha Kappa Alpha member who attended a Harris fundraiser during her presidential run, gave money to Biden’s campaign the day the pick was announced. “When she was his choice, that’s certainly energized us.”Female donors, in particular, were dismayed that none of the women running for president last year emerged with the nomination – and were ready to open their wallets after Biden, as he pledged to do, chose a female running mate.“There was a fairly widespread, profound, I would call it grief, after Elizabeth Warren withdrew,” said Steve Phillips, a longtime San Francisco fundraiser and host of the podcast Democracy in Color. “That accrues to Kamala’s benefit now. Donors are saying, yes, we should a have a woman, yes we should have a person of color. That’s the country I want to live in. Now that she is a historic choice for vice president, it taps back to that Obama thing and people wanting to be part of making that history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-sends-game-on-signal-to-donors-sitting-on-their-wallets/story-42n6WeD1GwEbr3HcncRCUP.html
15-09-2020||World||Boat capsizes near Libya, 24 migrants presumed dead, says UN||The UN migration agency said Tuesday that a boat carrying migrants bound for Europe capsized in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya, leaving at least two dozen people drowned or missing and presumed dead, the latest shipwreck off the North African country.Safa Msehli, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, told The Associated Press that Libya’s coast guard intercepted three boats on Monday, and one of them had capsized.She said the coast guard retrieved two bodies, and survivors reported 22 others were missing and presumed dead.At least 45 survivors on the three boats were returned to the shore. All migrants were men, with a majority from Egypt and Morocco, she said.“This new tragedy signals yet again the need for increased search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean. Instead, we are seeing restrictions on NGOs and long, unnecessary stand-offs,” Msehli said.The shipwreck was the latest maritime disaster involving migrants seeking a better life in Europe.In August, a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized leaving at least 45 people drowned or missing and presumed dead, marking the largest number of fatalities in a single shipwreck off the coast of the North African country.Libya, which descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has emerged as a major transit point for African and Arab migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boat-capsizes-near-libya-24-migrants-presumed-dead-says-un/story-e5hlZHarunPeAkfy33QHtN.html
15-09-2020||World||US to rejoin Paris climate deal if Democrats voted to power: Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, if elected to power in the November presidential election, and set new standards towards reducing carbon emissions.Claiming that the 2015 Paris climate deal puts an “unfair economic burden” on Americans, president Donald Trump’s administration notified the United Nations in November last year that the US would withdraw from the agreement. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election on November 3.“While he (President Donald Trump) turned against our allies, I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change and I will challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments,” Biden said in a major policy speech on climate change.“Where he reverses the Obama-Biden fuel efficiency standards, he picks big oil. He picks in big oil companies over American workers, even when the automobile industry agreed,” he said in his address from Delaware.Biden is challenging Trump, a Republican, in the November 3 US presidential election. Trump, who has made withdrawing from the climate agreement one of his election campaign pledges, has said the deal “punished” the US and would cost millions of American jobs.However, Trump has also indicated he was open to another climate deal “on terms that are fair to the United States”.The Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision by the US - one of the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - has led to condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders.Biden said, if elected, he will not only bring the standards back, but will also set new ambitious ones that American workers are ready to meet.“I’ll also see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programs and highways all across the country. I see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and initiatives,” he said.“Not only that, the United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles and we’re going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we’re buying electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in the United States of America. And together, this will mean more than a million new jobs in the American auto industry,” he asserted.Biden said he will put the US on a path to achieve a carbon pollution free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can come along and turn back.Transforming the electrical sector power to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the positive benefits to health and the environment, he argued.“We need to get to work right away. We’ll need scientists at the national labs and land grant universities, historic black colleges and universities to improve and innovate technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electric. We need engineers to design and workers to manufacture these new products,” he said.Asserting that climate change is the existential challenge that’s going to determine America’s future as a country, Biden said that like the pandemic, dealing with climate change is a global crisis, and that requires American leadership.“It requires a president for all Americans. So, as the fires rage out West on this day, our prayers remain with everyone under the ash. I know it’s hard to see the sun rise believing today will be a better day than yesterday. Americans face this historic inflection point, a time of real peril but also a time of extraordinary possibilities,” he said.

Outsiders are not being allowed inside city limits. Trade and businesses, except those dealing in essential services such as pharmacies and food markets, have been closed.The infections travelled from Myanmar and Chinese authorities would “crack down on illegal immigrants”, local officials said late on Monday.Besides Ruili, at least eight border prefectures and 25 border counties in the province should enter wartime status immediately, enhancing anti-epidemic measures and border management to prevent imported cases, local officials were quoted as saying by official media.Chinese media reports said authorities were mobilising residents to report “any illegal border crossings in a timely manner, stating that assistance in any form, including the provision of shelter for illegal trespassers, is strictly prohibited”.News agency AFP quoted Yang Bianqiang, vice mayor of Ruili, as saying that the city would repatriate those who cannot verify their time of arrival into China, referring to people who “have no fixed residence and have no fixed place to work”.Beijing had shut a border crossing with Myanmar in April after infighting in the country had spilled over into a Chinese province.Myanmar is a vital part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. It was the last country that Chinese President Xi Jinping had visited, in the third week of January, before the Covid-19 outbreak all but shut international travel out of China.China has largely controlled the Covid-19 pandemic in the country except a number of localised outbreaks, including in Beijing, in recent months.The coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, before triggering the pandemic and affecting economies around the world.As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland reached 85,202. Altogether, 80,426 people have been discharged and 4,634 have died from the disease on the mainland, the national health commission said in its daily update on Tuesday.Eight new imported Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday, taking the total number of imported infections to 2,653.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-locks-down-city-on-myanmar-border-after-fresh-covid-19-cases-emerge/story-cEH32zc9GI2uFJrdxY6J3I.html
15-09-2020||World||15 scientists launch critique of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine data||A group of scientists sent a formal letter to the Lancet on Monday outlining doubts about the accuracy of early data on Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine, one of the authors said, adding further fuel to a dispute surrounding the “Sputnik-V” shot.Fifteen scientists from five countries signed the letter presenting their concerns to the international medical journal, Enrico Bucci, biologist adjunct professor at Philadelphia’s Temple University, told Reuters.Reuters did not see the contents of the letter. The move nonetheless highlights growing concern among scientists about the safety and efficacy of the Sputnik-V vaccine, which the government approved for use before completing full human trials.The official letter came days after a larger group of scientists - including the 15 - signed an open letter to the Lancet’s editor, published on Bucci’s personal blog, after the journal published the early-stage trial results from Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute.They said they found patterns in the Phase I/II data, which was peer-reviewed in the journal, that looked “highly unlikely”, with multiple participants reporting identical antibody levels.The Gamaleya Institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the formal letter sent on Monday.Last week the institute rejected the critique contained in the open letter, which was initially signed by 26 scientists but now has 38 signatories.“The published results are authentic and accurate and were examined by five reviewers at The Lancet,” Denis Logunov, a deputy director at the institute, said in a statement.He said his institute submitted the entire body of raw data on the trial results to The Lancet.The Lancet said it had invited the authors of the Russian vaccine study to respond to the questions raised in the open letter by Bucci.“We continue to follow the situation closely,” it added.Alexey Kuznetsov, Russian assistant health minister, told the Interfax news agency on Sept. 10 that the Gamaleya Institute had already sent detailed answers to the Lancet’s editor.‘RESULTS ARE PLAUSIBLE’Bucci said the blog published last week had drawn wide international support.“We started with about a dozen of us and now we have reached three times the signatures, with colleagues from the United States, Switzerland, Australia, India, Russia, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, Canada,” Bucci said.He said the formal letter to the Lancet was signed only by 15 scientists with expertise in virology, immunology, pharmaceutical development, research integrity and statistical analysis. Most were Italian, but they also included scientists from Sweden, Britain, the United States and Japan, he added.“The journal’s editor wrote asking us to send him our points of objections and inviting the authors of Russian vaccine’s study to respond to our points,” said Bucci.Naor Bar-Zeev, deputy director at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who peer-reviewed the Russian data, last week defended his analysis of the research following the publication of the blog.“The results are plausible, and not very different to those seen with other AdV vectored products,” he said.The researchers had provided more detail than was needed for the review and responded to his questions “intelligently and in a matter-of-fact and confident but understated manner”.The results of the Russian Phase I/II trials, which involved 76 participants and was conducted in June-July, were published in the Lancet on Sept. 4. They showed that participants developed a positive immune response and no serious side effects, the study’s authors said.A Phase III trial, involving 40,000 participants, was launched on Aug. 26. Around 31,000 people have already subscribed to take part, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15-scientists-launch-critique-of-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-data/story-Du3QR2O6YDOeusOurrKsxK.html

At least three of those have already been offered to essential workers under an emergency use programme launched in July.Phase 3 clinical trials were proceeding smoothly and the vaccines could be ready for the general public in November or December, CDC chief biosafety expert Guizhen Wu said in an interview with state TV late on Monday.Wu, who said she has experienced no abnormal symptoms in recent months after taking an experimental vaccine herself in April, did not specify which vaccines she was referring to. A unit of state pharmaceutical giant China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and U.S.-listed Sinovac Biotech are developing the three vaccines under the state’s emergency use programme. A fourth Covid-19 vaccine being developed by CanSino Biologics was approved for use by the Chinese military in June. Sinopharm said in July that its vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of this year after the conclusion of Phase 3 trials.Global vaccine makers are racing to develop an effective vaccine against the virus which has killed more than 925,000 people. Leading Western vaccine makers pledged earlier this month to uphold scientific study standards and reject any political pressure to rush the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-ready-for-public-in-november-official/story-1DzVCBrdOwleJXxuw0wvyI.html
15-09-2020||World||US presidential election: Harris, Clinton rake up USD6 million in fundraiser, make fun of Trump||Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the Democrat’s vice-presidential nominee, and its 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raked up over USD 6 million at a fundraiser during which the two made fun of US President Donald Trump.“I’ve never seen him laugh,” Clinton said during the virtual event.“I’ve never, ever seen him make fun of himself. Certainly not his hairdo — you know, that’s, something I’m quite experienced. It is really telling that part of the cruelty and the indifference, and just the plain meanness that we see on a regular basis from him, is in part because he has no sense of humour. And, you know, he loves putting people down, not lifting them up,” Clinton said.“I totally agree with you, Hillary,” Harris said of Trump’s personality.“There is nothing joyful about him. There is nothing about him that inspires joy,” Harris said.“And it’s such a shame, really. I mean on one level you just have to feel like, you know, oh, everyone should have something in their lives that gives them the ability to smile a genuine smile,” she said.At the top of the fundraiser, Clinton said the event raised more than USD6 million from more than 100,000 people. She said the average donation was less than USD30.When Clinton was asked what advice she has for Harris ahead of next month’s debate with Vice President Mike Pence, she said Pence will try to somehow subtly undercut Harris.“You know, try to say ‘well you know that’s not the way it’s done,’ or ‘that’s not what we expect or that’s not what we believe,’ trying to somehow put her in the box of, ‘you know, the inexperienced woman candidate.’ And she’s not going to stand for that and she’s not going to put up with it, and she has to modulate her responses because we know there still is a double standard alive and well when it comes to women in politics,” Clinton said.“So, she’s got to be firm, and effective in rebutting any implication that comes from the other side. But to do it in a way that doesn’t, you know, scare or alienate voters. So, it’s a process that she will master during preparation,” said the former secretary of state.The fundraiser was hosted by Maya Khabira Rudolph, an American actress, comedian, singer, and voice actress and Amy Meredith Poehler, an American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and director.“This election is about more than what we’re voting against. It’s also about what we’re voting for a brighter future for all Americans. We know we can’t just go back to the way things were before Donald Trump as Joe says we need to build back better,” Rudolph said.In her remarks, Clinton talked about the wildfires out West in California, Oregon and Washington and the people “suffering so dramatically” from families who lost loved ones and property to those dealing with dangerous air quality levels.“I’m just grateful that today Joe Biden delivered a compelling powerful speech about climate change because we all know that it is driving the intensity of these fires and we have to deal with it, along with our pandemic,” Clinton said.“The ongoing moral reckoning with racism and violence, you know, what we’re up against, but I don’t think the current incumbent of the White House seems to know or more importantly, to care.“The Woodward tapes are stunning,” Clinton said. “We’ve heard tapes of presidents before, but we’ve never heard a president who deliberately kept information from the American people that could have saved lives and misery,” she said.“So, we need a president and a vice president who will show the kind of compassion determination and leadership. That is so desperately missing and needed right now,” Clinton said.Calling Clinton “absolutely extraordinary,” Harris said the former secretary of state has always been a model of what it means to have leadership that puts the country ahead of everything else.“You have been someone who has been a role model to so many of us as women. My mother said often to my sister Maya and me, ‘You may be the first to do many things make sure you’re not the last’, and you have always been that person who not only has broken so many glass ceilings as you have said shattering all of those, those shards that may fall. You, you do it was such grace and you always do it in a way that is about creating a path for others to follow,” she said.“The thing about breaking barriers, you know, some people might think breaking barriers means you start on one side of the barrier and you just show up on the other side of the barrier,” Harris said.“But that’s not what happens, I’m breaking barriers involves breaking things. And when you break things. sometimes you get cut. It’s painful. It’s worth it every single time. But it is not without an extraordinary amount of courage and effort, and Hillary you have broken so many barriers and have shown America, its potential,” Harris said.

15-09-2020||World||Researchers trial inhaled versions of Oxford and Imperial Covid-19 vaccine candidates||Inhaled versions of Covid-19 vaccine candidates developed by Oxford University and Imperial College will be trialled to see if they deliver a localised immune response in the respiratory tract, British researchers said on Monday.The Oxford and Imperial vaccines are both being tested in trials through intramuscular injection, but scientists from Imperial said that vaccines delivered via inhalation could potentially deliver a more specialised response.Chris Chiu, of Imperial’s Department of Infectious Disease, said there was evidence that flu vaccines delivered by nasal spray could protect against and reduce transmission of the disease.“We are keen to explore if this may also be the case for SARS-CoV-2 and whether delivering Covid-19 vaccines to the respiratory tract is safe and produces an effective immune response,” he said in a statement.Trials of the Oxford vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca, resumed at the weekend after safety watchdogs gave it the go-ahead. Late-stage trials had been paused after study subject fell in Britain.“We have already shown that (Oxford vaccine) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is safe and induces strong immune responses after intramuscular injection,” said Sarah Gilbert of the University of Oxford.“Delivering the vaccine to the respiratory tract instead may be a good approach to inducing immune responses in the best place to enable a rapid response after exposure to airborne virus.”Imperial’s vaccine is also in clinical trials, although at an earlier stage.The new trials of the vaccines will see volunteers receive aerosolised vaccines through a nebulizer, delivering the vaccine as airborne droplets through a mouthpiece. A total of 30 people will be recruited to the trials.Previous studies suggest that lower doses might be required than in intramuscular injections to give protection, the Imperial researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-trial-inhaled-versions-of-oxford-and-imperial-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/story-xVFN8vM58YRrhkV7dnQA7J.html

He has also called for a national register that can keep track of sex offenders.On Monday, Khan told a regional TV news channel that he feels chemical castration of rapists is urgently needed or at least the culprits should be made to forcefully undergo surgery so that they don’t commit sexual crimes in future. The Pakistan prime minister argued the case for a grading system for rapes and sexual assault cases along the lines of the standard first, second and third-degree classification in place for murder cases.Khan, who was speaking on a recent incident of gang-rape in Lahore that sparked nationwide outrage, said, “Those who are in first degree, they should be castrated and operated upon to disable them from repeating such crimes.”He proposed setting up a three-pronged strategy to deal with rapes and other sexual abuse cases, starting with the registration of sex offenders and paedophiles.Another step, Khan said, to deal with rapists and child sex abusers, was to hand them exemplary punishments. He called for hanging them in public as punishment for scarring the lives of the victims and their families. The Pakistan PM said it wasn’t possible for the administration to know exactly how many rape cases occur across the country, adding that such crimes were routinely under-reported.However, on the topic of public hanging of rapists, Khan said his government believes that such a form of punishment was unlikely to be accepted by the global community, and could even jeopardise the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that is extended to Pakistan by the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-proposes-chemical-castration-public-hanging-of-rapists/story-CL5tDD8m3N8kJBPPfoFzNJ.html
15-09-2020||World||US pulls back from broad import bans for cotton, tomatoes from China’s Xinjiang||The Trump administration on Monday shelved plans for a broad import ban on cotton and tomato products from China’s Xinjiang region while announcing narrower bans on products from five specific entities.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acting Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli said the new “Withhold Release Orders” (WROs) on cotton, textiles, apparel, hair products and computer parts are aimed at combating China’s use of forced labor by detained Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. He told reporters on a conference call that the administration was conducting more legal analysis of the region-wide import bans.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials told Reuters last week that they had prepared the broader bans on cotton, cotton textiles and tomatoes, among China’s biggest commodity exports, along with the orders announced on Monday.CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said on Monday the agency’s investigations into the region-wide orders were continuing. Two people familiar with the Trump administration’s internal deliberations said that concerns about the broad orders and their effect on supply chains were raised by officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. China also had agreed to buy increased quantities of U.S. cotton under the countries’ Phase 1 trade deal, which could be put at risk by a U.S. ban on imports from China’s dominant cotton-producing region. But Cuccinelli said it was legal concerns, not trade, that prompted the need for more study of the region-wide import bans.“We want to make sure that when we do get challenged - and we assume that we will be challenged, legally - that we will prevail and none of the goods we would ultimately would seize under such a WRO would be shaken loose and released into the United States,” he said. The Withhold Release Orders allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection to detain shipments based on suspicion of forced-labor involvement under long-standing U.S. laws to combat human trafficking, child labor and other human rights abuses. Shippers can send the products to other countries or seek to prove that they are not produced with forced labor.DHS said the block on products from Xinjiang entering the United States applied to all products made with labor from the Lop County No. 4 Vocational Skills Education and Training Center; hair products from the Lop County Hair Product Industrial Park; apparel produced by Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing and Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co; Cotton produced and processed by Xinjiang Junggar Cotton and Linen Co Ltd; and computer parts made by Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co Ltd.Neither Xinjiang Junggar nor Baoding LYSZD were aware of the orders when asked on Tuesday. Yili Zhuowan declined to comment.The U.S.-based group Worker Rights Consortium said this year that Yili Zhuowan had made gloves for French brand Lacoste that appeared to have been sewn at a factory where ethnic minority people faced forced ideological and behavioral re-education. Lacoste said it had halted shipments from that factory after those allegations, media reported.A China-based cotton trader said the new orders should “largely be discounted” as they impacted only a few, small suppliers.

They have assassinated people in Europe and in other parts of the world. We take these... allegations seriously.“We make very clear to the Islamic Republic of Iran that this kind of activity -- attacking any American any place at any time, whether it’s an American diplomat, an ambassador, or one of our service members -- is completely unacceptable.”The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman on Monday dismissed the report of an assassination plot as “baseless” and part of “repetitive and rotten methods to create an anti-Iranian atmosphere on the international stage.”The Iranian navy last week said it drove off American aircraft that flew close to an area where military exercises were underway near the Strait of Hormuz.The military said three US aircraft were detected by Iran’s air force radars after they entered the country’s air defence identification zone.In June last year, a US RQ-4 drone was shot down by Iran after allegedly violating Iranian airspace -- a claim the US has denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vows-1-000-times-greater-response-to-any-iran-attack/story-1T7XtY892z8RFSbAF2lTkK.html

Trump had been downplaying the climate crisis right from his pre-presidency days, when he had claimed that climate change was a hoax fanned by China to slow down the growth of industrialised countries.Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Accord, claiming it had given India and China a sweeter deal, and has decidedly rolled back all clean air and water orders issued by his predecessor, Barack Obama.“Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires, record floods and record hurricanes,” former vice-president Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, tying the catastrophic natural events to the climate crisis. “But if he gets a second term, these hellish events will become more common, more devastating and more deadly.”Bided added, “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”The Democratic presidential candidate promised to take the US back to the Paris Accord that Obama as president had brokered with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the world’s top polluters after America.“While he (Trump) turns us against our allies, I will bring us back into the Paris Agreement, Biden said. “I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. And I will challenge everyone to up the ante on their climate commitments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfires-donald-trump-questions-climate-crisis-joe-biden-calls-him-climate-arsonist/story-GnipyHggJQLYfG3ZWfaKkK.html
15-09-2020||World||Covid-19 has set global health progress back decades: Gates Foundation||The knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic have halted and reversed global health progress, setting it back 25 years and exposing millions to the risk of deadly disease and poverty, a report by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation warned on Tuesday.Because of Covid-19, extreme poverty has increased by 7%, and routine vaccine coverage - a good proxy measure for how health systems are functioning - is dropping to levels last seen in the 1990s, the report said.“It’s a huge setback,” Bill Gates, co-chair of the Foundation and a leading philanthropic funder of global health and development, told a media briefing on the report’s findings.The Foundation’s Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of reducing poverty and improving health, found that in the past year, by nearly every indicator, the world has regressed.Alongside dropping rates of routine immunisation, which the report described as “setting the world back about 25 years in 25 weeks”, rising levels of poverty and economic damage from the pandemic are reinforcing inequalities, it said.It found that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, racial and ethnic minority communities and people living in extreme poverty.“After 20 consecutive years of declines in extreme poverty, we’ve now seen a reversal,” said Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Gates Foundation, in an interview with Reuters. “We’ve had nearly 40 million people thrown back into extreme poverty. That’s well over a million a week since the virus hit.”The report cited International Monetary Fund projections that, despite the $18 trillion dollars already spent on trying to stimulate economies around the world, the global economy will lose $12 trillion or more by the end of 2021 - the biggest global GDP loss since the end of World War Two.While the scene is “bleak” right now, Gates said he was confident the world would emerge from the pandemic and resume progress towards the goals on improving global health.“Whether is takes us two years, or even three, we do believe that we’ll overcome this and get back on track,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-has-set-global-health-progress-back-decades-gates-foundation/story-NDZtxU4wziRaQk9tOECHSP.html

Her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris migrated to the US as a 19-year-old young graduate from India in 1957 for higher studies.In multiple interviews, Harris has reflected on the profound impact her mother, a renowned cancer specialist, had on where she is now. “I thought immediately of my mother and what she must be thinking as she looks down on us,” Harris said in response to a question during a fund raiser.“What was it like to get that Zoom call from Joe Biden (last month),” she was asked.Harris recounted how she and her team got a call that Biden wanted to talk and then got another call where she was told Biden wanted to do a zoom call. She described how she went in “our little makeshift office” and then when the call started Biden immediately asked her to join the ticket.After referring to her mother, Harris also described how husband Doug Emhoff’s ear was on the door outside the room listening in on the call. Eventually Jill Biden and Emhoff joined the call with Biden and Harris.When asked how she will present her and Biden’s vision for the first 100 days, Harris said the first thing is to “get the virus under control.” “Specifically, we will create a pandemic board that will oversee testing. So that’s about distribution, it’s about testing is happening in an efficient manner. It’s also about making sure we are investing in the tests that are most relevant in the tests that we are trying to accomplish, so for example rapid testing,” she said.Harris went on to tick off economic relief through a series of executive orders “to strengthen buy American rules so that tax payer dollars support American products and supply chains.” “Again, day one, re-enter the Paris Climate agreements,” Harris said. She pointed to California, Oregon and Washington and said “all of this is predictable.” She continued “Reengage our NATO allies. And this is again a real strength of Joe’s. He has the experience based on a long history of being in the Senate and being a leader on foreign affairs and then of course eight years of being vice president.” Harris said that she will send a bill to congress immediately creating a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers and the 11 million undocumented immigrants” Harris said. She said the administration would push a bill to “deal with systemic racism.” “People are marching in the streets. Minnesota of course are experiencing this and there are reforms that are important that can be put in place so we can do things like ban carotid chokeholds, which of course would’ve saved the life of George Floyd,” she said.A Biden-Harris administration would also introduce a national standard for use of force and national police standard oversight commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-thought-immediately-of-her-mother-when-joe-biden-made-the-vp-call/story-z0oFxciYHAy7Bhy4M7GDuI.html
15-09-2020||World||UAE announces emergency approval for use of Covid-19 vaccine||The United Arab Emirates on Monday granted emergency approval for use of a coronavirus vaccine, six weeks after human trials in the Gulf Arab state started.A phase III trial of a Covid-19 inactivated vaccine developed by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company Sinopham began in the UAE in July and is yet to be completed.“The vaccine will be available to our first line of defense heroes who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus,” said the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority in a tweet.The announcement comes amid a surge in new Covid-19 cases in the UAE, which reported 1,007 cases on Saturday, its highest since the start of the pandemic. There were 777 new cases on Monday.Emergency use of the vaccine, which is still being tested, was granted after a set criteria and after it had been tested on 31,000 volunteers, it said.Mild and expected side effects occurred but there have been no severe side effects, the agency said without specifying. It added a thousand people suffering from chronic diseases who took part saw no complications.Sinopharm secured approval for the trial in late June. The experimental vaccine passed Phases I and II of clinical trials with 100% of volunteers generating antibodies after two doses in 28 days, an Abu Dhabi government statement said in July.According to the Centers for Disease Control, inactivated vaccines - made with either inactivated (killed) viruses or with a protein from the virus - are well known and have been used against diseases such as influenza and measles.Russia in August become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a coronavirus vaccine, after less than two months of human testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-announces-emergency-approval-for-use-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-V56vi9mMHhYXG6XVO0xnxK.html
15-09-2020||World||Donald Trump defies coronavirus rules as ‘peaceful protest’ rallies grow||President Donald Trump is running as the “law and order” candidate. But that hasn’t stopped him and his campaign from openly defying state emergency orders and flouting his own administration’s coronavirus guidelines as he holds ever-growing rallies in battleground states.Democratic governors and local leaders have urged the president to reconsider the events, warning that he’s putting lives at risk. But they have largely not tried to block the gatherings of thousands of people, which Trump and his team deem “peaceful protests” protected by the First Amendment.“If you can join tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets, gamble in a casino, or burn down small businesses in riots, you can gather peacefully under the 1st Amendment to hear from the President of the United States,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.Trump’s refusal to abide by health guidelines — even those crafted by his own administration — underscores the extent to which he believes projecting an image of normalcy is vital to winning in November, even as the country approaches 200,000 deaths from Covid-19.Trump has tried to use this summer’s mass protests over racial injustice and police misconduct as cover for his rallies, making the case that, if demonstrators can gather en masse, so can his supporters. So far, Democratic governors have declined to stand in his way, refusing to become a foil to Trump and feed into his narrative that liberals are trying to deny Republicans their First Amendment rights.Trump’s campaign insisted that it takes appropriate health precautions, including handing out masks and hand sanitizer and checking the temperatures of rallygoers.But images of thousands of maskless supporters standing shoulder to shoulder remain jarring in a country where sports are still played in empty arenas and concerts have been largely banned. That’s especially true for those who have lost loved ones or spent months isolating at home and worry that rallies will further spread infection, undermining hard-fought progress. An indoor rally that Trump held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June was blamed for a surge of virus infections there.Trump held an indoor rally at the Xtreme Manufacturing facility in Henderson, Nevada, on Sunday night. The state restricts gatherings to 50 people — based on White House reopening guidelines —- but thousands of supporters packed into the warehouse space nonetheless. Relatively few people wore masks.“This is an insult to every Nevadan who has followed the directives, made sacrifices, and put their neighbors before themselves,” said Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat.The city of Henderson on Monday announced that it was fining Xtreme Manufacturing $3,000. Sisolak slammed the rally as “shameful, dangerous and irresponsible.” But it does not appear the governor would try to prevent a replay. If Trump returns to the state for another rally, said COVID-19 response director Caleb Cage, state officials will continue to encourage his campaign to follow state law and directives.In some other states, the rallies are legal. In North Carolina, an order signed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper limits outdoor gatherings to 50 people and mandates masks in public, but “activities constituting the exercise of First Amendment rights” are exempt.The state’s top public health official, Dr. Mandy Cohen, played down calls for stricter enforcement last week as she criticized Trump for holding a rally at the Winston-Salem airport, where thousands of supporters crammed together without masks.“This isn’t really about mandates and enforcement. It’s about leadership,” Cohen told reporters.“By using the First Amendment exemption for mass gatherings under the governor’s executive order in this way, they’re making it much harder for North Carolina to get our children back in school and people back to work safely,” said Dory MacMillan, a spokesperson for Cooper.In Michigan, political speech is exempt from Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s order limiting the size of outdoor gatherings. And while Whitmer’s office issued a memo saying people engaging in First Amendment activities still must adhere to social distancing measures, the state hasn’t moved to enforce the rules at Trump’s rallies or during protests.“We hope the president would care enough about his supporters and their friends and families that he would encourage social distancing and mask wearing,” said Ryan Jarvi, a spokesperson for Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel.Nevada is one state where Trump has encountered resistance. His campaign had originally planned to hold a pair of rallies over the weekend in Las Vegas and Reno, but those plans were scuttled after the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority warned one of the hosts that the rally would violate the governor’s restrictions and the terms of the company’s lease. Trump’s campaign immediately moved to blame Sisolak for the pushback, but the governor’s office insisted it had had no involvement.Trump told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in an interview Sunday that “he did not believe he was subject” to the order and blamed Sisolak for forcing him to abandon plans for the outdoors rallies.“They canceled six different sites because the governor wouldn’t let it happen, all external sites,” the president said. The campaign did not respond to questions about what sites they had tried.Upcoming rallies in Wisconsin on Thursday and Minnesota on Friday will be held in open-air airplane hangars, and neither state caps attendance on outdoor events, even though Covid-19 cases have been surging in Wisconsin.Ashley Mukasa, a spokesperson for Winnebago County Health Department, said the county doesn’t have any local ordinances that would allow it to issue or enforce local health orders. However, the agency briefed Trump’s advance team about the statewide mask mandate, she said.“They wanted to avoid breaking any laws,” Mukasa said.In Minnesota, where Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has long been reluctant to spar publicly with Trump, the virus order exempts anything that would limit “the movement of federal officials in Minnesota while acting in their official capacity.” Beltrami County’s public health director, Cynthia Borgen, said the state’s health department had decided the president’s visit would fall under that exemption — even though he will be there to campaign.For one activist from the state, Trump’s co-opting of the term peaceful protest represents “a new low.”“His actions are a mockery of legitimate peaceful protests that have been happening in Minnesota and around the country regarding our stances against police violence and brutality,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP.Trump on Monday again drew hundreds of supporters to an indoor event in Phoenix that his campaign advertised as a “Latinos for Trump roundtable,” limiting scrutiny, but that had the feel of something different.“This is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally,” he told the crowd.Most in the audience did not wear masks, though tables filled with hundreds of unused masks were at the entrance to the event.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, has consistently refused to criticize Trump for holding large gatherings in the state, including a packed campaign event at a Phoenix church in June, when Arizona was seeing a surge in coronavirus cases.“The constitutional rights of Arizonans are going to be protected,” Ducey said. “They’ve been protected the entire time. They’re nonnegotiable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-defies-coronavirus-rules-as-peaceful-protest-rallies-grow/story-Jx5rAjZ8STgGTbQZmCpNiP.html
15-09-2020||World||Justin Trudeau worried about uptick in coronavirus cases in Canada||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Monday that Canada was “not out of the woods” with the coronavirus, urging citizens to be vigilant amid an uptick in virus cases nationwide.The country recorded more than 1,300 cases over the weekend -- a level not seen since early summer.On Monday, Quebec and Ontario provinces, the most populous in Canada and the hardest-hit by the pandemic, confirmed nearly 600 cases.“One of the things we’re seeing is, with numbers rising across the country, we are not out of the woods,” Trudeau told a press conference in Ottawa.He said the resumption of classes and the reopening of the Canadian economy, meaning more people are back to work, had led to an increase in case numbers.“The last thing anyone wants is to go into this fall in a lockdown similar to this spring. And the way we can prevent that is by remaining vigilant,” Trudeau said, reiterating the importance of wearing masks and practicing social distancing.Ontario Premier Doug Ford sounded a warning, saying: “Let me be crystal clear every option is on the table, we will take every step necessary including further shutdowns.”On Saturday, Quebec became the first Canadian province to fine people for refusing to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces. The fines run from CAN$400-6,000 (US$303-4,550).That did not prevent a crowd of several thousand people from protesting against mask wearing in Montreal on Saturday.As of Monday, Canada had registered more than 137,000 coronavirus cases since mid-March. More than 9,200 people have died as a result of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-worried-about-uptick-in-coronavirus-cases-in-canada/story-xv0C67FNq8vCo8qThfo9AN.html
15-09-2020||World||Trump says Europe has more ‘explosive’ trees than California||Donald Trump and California state officials sparred over whether climate change is contributing to out-of-control wildfires across the West, after the president insisted that poor forest management drives the conflagrations.Wade Crowfoot, the secretary of California’s Natural Resources Agency, told Trump in a meeting in Sacramento on Monday that a warming climate is making the state’s fires worse.“We want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forests, and actually work together with that science,” Crowfoot told the president. “The science is going to be key. If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians.”Trump responded: “It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch.”“I wish science agreed with you,” Crowfoot said.“I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump responded.Trump flew into Sacramento after a weekend campaign swing through Nevada in order to discuss the fires with California officials including Governor Gavin Newsom. More than 5 million acres have been burned across the West this season, killing dozens of people and ruining air quality from California to Washington.Newsom on Friday argued that flawed forest management practices of the past can’t explain the state’s worsening fire seasons. California has been stepping up its use of controlled burns to thin out vegetation and has accelerated cutting fire breaks around vulnerable communities, he said.But the recent drought and a tree-killing beetle infestation, both of which Newsom tied to climate change, have killed more than 150 million trees across the state, leaving ample fuel for fires.“I’m not going to suggest for a second that the forest management practices in the state of California over a century-plus have been ideal,” Newsom said Friday in Butte County, surrounded by scorched trees. “But that’s one point. It’s not the point.”The president has frequently criticized California’s Democratic leaders for, in his view, failing to adequately manage the state’s forests to reduce fire risk.About 57% of California forests are land owned and managed by federal agencies, according to the University of California. Newsom said Monday that just 3% of the state’s forests are on land managed by the state government.In August, Newsom’s administration reached an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to jointly reduce fire risk on at least 500,000 acres of public lands each year.Trump claimed before the meeting that an unnamed European leader told him his country has more explosive trees than California, before disputing state officials who said climate change was contributing to out-of-control West Coast wildfires.“I was talking to the head of a major country and he said, ‘We are a forest nation. We consider ourselves a forest nation.’ This was in Europe. I said, ‘That’s a beautiful term,”’ Trump told reporters after landing in Sacramento.“He said, ‘We have trees that are far more explosive’ -- explosive in terms of fire -- but ‘we have trees that are far more explosive than they have in California, and we don’t have any problem.’”Trump said that “I think a lot of things are possible” in response to a question about whether climate change is driving the western wildfires, which have consumed more than 5 million acres, killing dozens of people and ruining air quality on the West Coast.“With regard to the forest, when trees fall down, after a short period of time -- about 18 months -- they become very dry. They become really like a matchstick,” Trump said. “And they get up; you know, there’s no more water pouring through, and they become very, very -- they just explode. They can explode.”“Also leaves,” he added, “when you have years of leaves, dried leaves, on the ground, it just sends it up. It’s really a fuel for a fire. So they have to do something about it.”He said the state should cut more firebreaks through its forests, again comparing California to European forests that he said are better managed.“They also have to do cuts. I mean, people don’t like to do cuts but they have to do cuts,” he said. “So if you do have a fire and it gets away, you’ll have a 50-yard cut in between so it won’t be able to catch in the other side.“They don’t do that,” he said of California. “If you go to other countries, you go to Austria, you go to Finland, you go to many different countries and they don’t have problems.”After taking office, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord negotiated by President Barack Obama, calling it unfair. On Monday, he suggested the U.S. shouldn’t undertake efforts to mitigate climate change because other countries can’t be trusted to follow suit.“Is India going to change its ways? And China going to change its ways? And Russia -- is Russia going to change its ways?” he said. “You know, so, you have a lot of countries that are going to have to change because they make up -- we’re just a small speck.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-europe-has-more-explosive-trees-than-california/story-2Pyv7tHsJGhlQf6fYontSN.html

In an interview with the RTVI television network on Monday, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of going “beyond all the limits of decency and reasonableness”.“Our Western partners look at us arrogantly, but we too have the right to doubt their claims of professionalism,” he said.Germany was still waiting for the outcome of a separate evaluation by the OPCW global chemical weapons watchdog, Seibert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-opposition-leader-navalny-s-health-condition-improves/story-ajPtDRecmiK0TdkXcEP7oJ.html

The announcement has sparked a wave of anger. The WHO reported 307,930 new daily global infections on Sunday, a record since the pandemic began in China late last year, as total cases topped 29 million. “It’s going to get tougher. In October, November, we are going to see more mortality,” WHO Europe director Hans Kluge said. “We are by no means out of the woods,” the UN health agency’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a meeting of WHO Europe’s 55 members that began on Monday. A Vatican spokesman meanwhile said Pope Francis was being “constantly monitored” after having met with a cardinal who later tested positive. In Greece, 14 refugees tested positive for the virus after thousands of them were left without shelter after a massive fire in the Moria camp on Lesbos island.Britain, France, Austria and the Czech Republic also reported spikes. S’pore gives out devices to trace coronavirusSingapore began handing out pocket-sized coronavirus contact-tracing devices to residents on Monday, part of a planned nationwide rollout. The box-shaped tokens use Bluetooth signals to record nearby devices and store encrypted data of a users’ close contacts.If users test positive, the devices have to be handed over to the authorities to extract the data on other people they have potentially exposed to the virus.In a report, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body created by the WHO and the World Bank, said the world is doing far too little to prepare for future, possibly even more damaging pandemics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-cases-top-300k-covid-19-lockdown-back-in-israel/story-AkYAYTNBoJwP9Ifd21bjPM.html
15-09-2020||World||Fight and talk: Facing negotiations, Taliban almost took key Afghan city||Khan Agha has endured years of violence in Kunduz, but it was the Taliban’s attack on the strategic city in northeastern Afghanistan, as the government and insurgents were preparing for historic peace talks, that unnerved him.“Like me, the majority of Kunduz residents are living in fear,” Agha, a 46-year-old driver, told Reuters. “Looking at what’s going on, anything could happen at any time.”The Taliban offensive, encircling and almost seizing Kunduz late last month, came just weeks before the Kabul government sat down with their sworn enemies in Doha on Saturday to start historic talks aimed at ending 19 years of war that has killed and wounded more than 100,000 civilians.The opening ceremony for the talks in the Qatari capital, replete with calls for peace from US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in a grand hotel and a host of dignitaries on video link urging a ceasefire, contrasted sharply with the recent violence on the ground in Kunduz.Just hours after those talks started, Taliban and Afghan government forces clashed across Afghanistan, officials said, underscoring the uphill challenge of ending the long war. The most intense of those clashes on Saturday were in Kunduz, where Taliban again jostled with security forces for control of key highways, and the Afghan military deployed air and artillery strikes.Agha, stranded outside the city of 270,000 for four days during last month’s larger attack and unable to reach his family on his way back from a delivery, has since stockpiled three months’ worth of food in his small home.A Reuters examination of the little-reported August offensive - the worst since 2015, when Kunduz briefly fell to the Taliban - shows how the insurgents have recently raised pressure on this strategic urban centre, a gateway in the north to mineral-rich provinces and to central Asia, and a hub for transportation and drug-smuggling.The Taliban deny the Kunduz attack, saying their fighters only attacked bases in retaliation for troops firing on nearby areas.“From the start of the year we never had plans of large attacks on any big city for one reason, and that is the peace process,” said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. “Attacking large cities can damage this process.”Though it ultimately failed, the brazen attempt to take a strategic urban centre and the continuing pressure shows the Taliban are pursuing a fight-and-talk strategy, largely ignoring the international pleas to temper the violence and agree on a ceasefire.“The scale of ambition to expand territorial control has not ebbed,” said a senior Western diplomat. “They want their fighters to stay active on the ground - it is a key concern ahead of talks as primary trust and confidence-building depends on a reduction in violence.”The Taliban’s muscular action comes just as the United States rapidly draws down its troops in Afghanistan, in line with President Donald Trump’s promises to end America’s longest war. A February pact between Washington and the Taliban set May 2021 as the date for the final pullout, subject to certain security guarantees. US troop numbers are expected to fall to 4,500 by November from over 100,000 in 2011. Battleground to negotiating table “A serious Taliban attack on Kunduz City breaks with the U.S.-Taliban agreement, at least in spirit, and sends an ominous signal ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations,” said Elizabeth Threlkeld, deputy director of the South Asia program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.The US Embassy in Kabul did not comment.The Taliban, after gradually tightening their grip on rural areas encircling Kunduz, conducted its offensive from Aug. 20 to 26, seizing several checkpoints and two bases on arterial roads into the city, spreading fear that the militants would seize control, three provincial council members said.“They got enough close to the city that their small arms could easily reach the police headquarters and governor’s compound,” said council member Assadullah Saadat.Fighting displaced more than 60,000 people, according the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Now that the government and Taliban are sitting down for peace talks, after months of delays, officials say a top priority is negotiating a comprehensive ceasefire, which the Afghan government has requested several times but the Taliban has rejected.“Their military capacity represents a threat to the Afghan government, and they are likely to continue launching attacks over the coming months as negotiations kick off,” Threlkeld said.Afghan forces pushed Taliban fighters back with several airstrikes, said defence ministry spokesman Fawad Aman. On one of the heaviest days of fighting, 34 Taliban members were killed and 24 wounded, he said.More than 100 Taliban members were killed 100 were wounded, said a local council member.Though the immediate threat to the city was over, local security force members told Reuters the area remained under pressure.Abdul, who asked that his full name not be used, said that in his seven years in the Afghan security forces in some of the toughest regions, he had not encountered the pressure he found in Kunduz where his unit was under constant fire and their vehicles could not be left in the open for even a few hours without attracting rockets.“There is a common theory here: the more gain on the battleground, the bigger the share on the negotiating table,” he said. “I have experienced the worst time of my whole life here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-and-talk-facing-negotiations-taliban-almost-took-key-afghan-city/story-HE92VqGnEwTavwDdf51o0K.html
15-09-2020||World||Donald Trump arrives in California for wildfires briefing||President Donald Trump arrived Monday in California to be briefed on wildfires engulfing swaths of the US West.The quick stop during a three-day reelection campaign swing was the first time Trump has visited California since the devastating blazes began.Minutes earlier, Democratic challenger Joe Biden branded Trump a “climate arsonist” whose policies are contributing to evermore powerful natural disasters.On arrival in McClellan Park, near Sacramento in central California, Trump repeated his argument that the ever-growing danger from wildfires in places like California, Oregon and Washington is due to insufficient maintenance of forest areas to make them less combustible.“There has to be strong forest management,” he said.“With regard to the forests, when trees fall down after a short period of time, about 18 months, they become very dry. They become really like a match stick,” he said. “They just explode.”Trump immediately went into a meeting with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has strongly argued that the fires are driven mostly by global warming.Newsom acknowledged that “we have not done justice on our forest management,” though he pointed out that more than half of the land in California is under federal, not state control.But he said the overwhelming cause of the problem is far bigger.“The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier,” he said. “We submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-arrives-in-california-for-wildfires-briefing/story-wEC5TVYWvaVadkW4IOXrXM.html
15-09-2020||World||Documentary on Wuhan makes its presence felt at TIFF||In a year ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, it is perhaps fitting that the first major full-length feature documentary examining the outbreak is set in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the first epicentre of the international crisis. 76 Days, a 93-minute film that shows powerful footage of the chaos and panic inside Wuhan in the initial days of the outbreak when the unknown virus had just begun to wreak havoc, had its world premiere at the ongoing Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The documentary spans the period from January 23 to April 8 this year when Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, was placed under a lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak.The film was made by Hao Wu, a New York-based Chinese director, who collaborated with two China-based reporters as co-directors – Weixi Chen and another associate identified only as “Anonymous”.With the Chinese government reportedly trying to conceal its failure to have warned the world of the onset of the snowballing health crisis, the film’s creators requested the first viewers at the TIFF to “refrain from discussing identifying details contained in the film” so as to “avoid any potential government interference with the film, and with the filmmakers in China, before the film’s wider release”. The film’s production notes say, “China is imposing strict controls over the narrative of its Covid-19 response, and the footage contained in this film is unprecedented in its access.”The film shows doctors, nurses and paramedics striving to control a torrent of patients pouring into hospitals even as health authorities seek to downplay the outbreak with repeated calls of: “Don’t panic.” The documentary starts with the wailing of a woman who wants to see her dead father’s corpse once last time, and shows a box in which ID cards and phones of the dead are placed.Hao, the filmmaker, recalled spending the Chinese New Year holidays in Shanghai as “a panic was setting in all over China”, adding, “It became increasingly clear that the local government had lied and suppressed whistleblowers to conceal the outbreak. It also became apparent that the situation was dire in Wuhan - people were dying, hospitals were overwhelmed, and medical personnel did not have adequate protection, so they too were getting sick and dying. The country was angry. I was angry.”The filmmaker’s teammates filmed in four hospitals and shared the raw footage online with Hao, who then took it forward.The film that was eventually put together underlines human suffering at the hands of a deadly and unknown virus as well as the heroism of medical personnel struggling to save lives in a dystopian backdrop of an escalating health crisis.The TIFF’s artistic director Cameron Bailey described the film as “urgent, powerful filmmaking”.Hao said his team members “risked their own lives to film in the hospitals, especially when the danger of the coronavirus was little understood in the early days of the Wuhan lockdown”. Hao’s co-directors entered the containment zone donning protective gear that resembled space suits. At one point, they feared for their safety and the project had to be halted when China began cracking down on non-official information being released from the country. However, after Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted, they were persuaded to return to ground zero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/documentary-on-wuhan-makes-its-presence-felt-at-tiff/story-Mgb8eAhLX1R7AEOSqpWQwN.html

Though their schedules have not been released yet, they are expected to first visit Ahmedabad where the US president will address a rally with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is expecting “millions” of people to show up. Their next stop will be New Delhi and then they will leave for home with a brief stopover in Agra.“Thank you @narendramodi for the kind invitation,” the first lady wrote in a tweet, with a retweet of Prime Minister Modi’s post from Wednesday promising them a “memorable welcome”. She added, “Looking forward to visiting Ahmedabad & New Dehli (a typo, she meant Delhi) later this month. @POTUS & I are excited for the trip & to celebrate the close ties between the #USA & #India.”ALSO WATCH | ‘PM Modi is a friend of mine, a great gentleman’: Donald Trump ahead of India visitIt could not be immediately ascertained if this will be Melania Trump’s first visit to India. But she has met the prime minister before, during his June visit to the White House for his first meeting with the president. The First Lady had hosted a small reception for the Indian delegation and the president’s top aides. The president has been to India before, at least once that could be confirmed. He visited Mumbai in 2014 as a businessman for the launch of the Trump Tower with local business partners. The Trump Organization’s overseas operations are the largest in India, with 16 properties, according to The Washington Post, all dating to before Trump election to the White House.The president had cut himself from his business organisation, which is run by his two sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, after his election to the White House and has not visited India since.His eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, who is an adviser to the president, visited India in November 2017,where she shared the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ivanka led the US delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. The delegation is a US initiative that had traveled out for the first time. The president’s eldest son Trump Jr visited in February 2018 on a business trip. He visited four cities, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata where the Trump Organisation has businesses. The trip had raised eyebrows in the United States for expenses incurred on a private, business visit by the US government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/excited-melania-trump-looks-forward-to-india-visit-celebrating-close-ties/story-VPUONhaz8DjnLtizJljRUO.html

All residential areas are being manned around the clock,” the state media report says.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus scare: Separating facts from fictionHubei, and its capital city, Wuhan also reported nearly 15,152 new cases of the disease, which is now officially known as Covid-19.With the sharp jump in the number of the infected, nearly 60,000 are now sickened by the disease in China.In the biggest political fallout of the escalating outbreak, Ying Yong, mayor of Shanghai, was appointed Communist Party of China (CPC) chief of Hubei province replacing Jiang Chaoliang, official news agency, Xinhua reported on Thursday.“Ying was also appointed as a member and Standing Committee member of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee, it said.Jiang Chaoliang will no longer hold the office,” the brief statement from the CPC added.“Ying, 62, a native of Zhejiang province in eastern China, began his career in 1976 and has rich working experience in Chinese political and legal affairs, including in the public security bureau and the courts. He became Shanghai mayor in early 2017,” the report said.On the sharp rise in the number of new cases, the Hubei health commission said the number of new cases “…included 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases, which have been seen as confirmed cases from Thursday”.It brought the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 48,206.Clinically diagnosed cases are unique to Hubei statistically. The inclusion of those cases drives the surge in the number of new confirmed cases.“Any suspected cases with pneumonia-related computerised tomography (CT) scan results are counted as clinically diagnosed cases,” according to the latest version of the diagnosis and treatment scheme released by China’s national health commission (NHC).The provincial health commission said the diagnosis criteria revision has been made to give those who have been clinically diagnosed the timely standard treatment of confirmed cases to further improve the treatment success rate.“The province also saw 3,441 patients discharged from hospital after recovery as of Wednesday. Among the 33,693 hospitalised patients, 5,647 were still in severe condition and another 1,437 in critical condition,” official media reported.Outside China, at least 25 countries have reported cnfirmed cases and several nations including India have evacuated their citizens from Hubei where tens of millions remain under a lockdown with severe restrictions.Two deaths have been recorded outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned the virus poses a “grave threat” to the world, with chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying the virus could have “more powerful consequences than any terrorist action”.The Financial Times, quoting local media sources, reported Son Loi, a village in northern Vietnam about 40 kilometre north-west of Hanoi, has been put on lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.“Vietnamese state-controlled media reported on the move on Thursday, one of the first such instances of an entire residential area being sealed off outside China to prevent transmission of the disease,” the FT report said.The VNExpress said that Vin Phuc province, where Son Loi is located, had “locked down” the commune for 14 days because seven people had contracted the coronavirus.Vin Phuc province accounts for the majority of Vietnam’s 15 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, the FT report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/254-die-in-a-day-in-china-as-war-time-measures-put-in-place-for-covid-19-top-hubei-official-sacked/story-5gAnGMcTHakHnFyRale8sJ.html

15-09-2020||India||‘Decide cases against tainted legislators in one year’: Amicus report to SC||A one-year deadline to try criminal cases against sitting and former legislators, special courts for each district are part of key recommendations made to the Supreme Court in a report tabled by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria. Hasaria is assisting as amicus curiae in a PIL demanding steps to fast-track trial against tainted politicians. The list of recommendations also includes a presiding judicial officer with a minimum fixed tenure of two years and a dedicated top cop in every district to be the nodal prosecuting officer.Making radical suggestions, based on statistics on criminal cases pending against former and serving politicians received from various High Courts, Hansaria’s report said, “The High Courts may be directed to prepare a blueprint for expeditious disposal of the cases not later than one year for the conclusion of a trial. Chief Justice of each High Court may be personally requested to look into the matter and submit an action plan within such time as this Court may deem fit.”The recommendation comes in a PIL filed by BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay who has demanded fast-tracking of criminal trials against tainted politicians and a life ban for those convicted in such crimes.Also read: ‘May alert others, destroy evidence’: Why Rhea Chakraborty didn’t get bailHansaria further demanded a special court in each district to exclusively try criminal cases against legislators. At present, twelve such courts exist in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi and three special courts at magisterial level in Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi. A total of 4,442 criminal cases are pending against sitting and former legislators in various courts across the country. Of this, 2,556 cases relate to sitting members of Parliament (MPs) and members of legislative assemblies (MLAs) where trial is pending at various stages.The report makes a state-wise analysis to arrive at the recommendations. For instance, a big state like Madhya Pradesh has one special court hearing 184 cases. He further cited the instance of Tamil Nadu special court hearing only 78 cases even as the bulk of cases (246 cases) involving legislators remain pending in various trial courts across 31 districts.There are some states bursting at its seams. For instance, the special court at Uttar Pradesh’s Allahabad district has 256 cases. There are 62 special courts in the state shouldering the burden of 1,217 cases - the highest for any state. Jharkhand and Odisha do not have a special court. As many as 142 cases against MPs/MLAs are pending in Jharkhand and 331 cases in Odisha. The amicus highlighted some districts like Trivandrum where at the Magisterial level there are 100 cases pending against legislators.Hansaria goes on to state that a special court in each district is the need of the hour for expediting trial against tainted politicians. He recommended that the judicial officers heading these special courts should have a minimum fixed tenure of two years with priority to be given to cases against sitting legislators. The court is to accord top priority to list cases involving death or life sentence, followed by cases under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, cases involving punishment of seven years or more jail term and finally other offences, he stated.To ensure production of accused and witnesses during trial, a nodal prosecution officer, not below the rank of Additional Superintendent of Police, is to be appointed in each district. Forensic labs will also give top priority to cases involving legislators and two special public prosecutors will be dedicated to try such cases by each state/union territory, the report said.In cases where a trial is stayed, Hansaria recommended the top court to direct Chief Justices of High Courts to list the appeals in two weeks with no request for adjournment.Advocate Sneha Kalita, who assisted in the preparation of the report, told HT, “The report has accorded top priority to witness protection as these cases involve high and mighty. The Karnataka High Court has framed rules for video conferencing facilities in each court which all HCs must adopt. This will provide safe and secure examination rooms for witnesses to depose freely through video conferencing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decide-cases-against-tainted-legislators-in-one-year-amicus-report-to-sc/story-OdBUeLT9N3neklcL3oEmwN.html
15-09-2020||India||Ganga’s water quality improved between 2014 and 2019, experts say pace is slow||The Central government’s ambitious project to clean River Ganga, under its Namami Gange Project (NGP), has borne some fruit with river water from Rudraprayag in Uttarakhand to Uluberia in West Bengal improving between 2014 and 2019, latest data of the Jal Shakti ministry showed.The dissolved oxygen level has improved at 27 locations while biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and faecal coliform (FC) has improved at 42 and 21 locations, respectively, the information provided by the ministry to Kochi-based Right to Information applicant, K Govindan Nampoothiry, stated.The ministry has provided an annual average of Ganga water quality on these three parameters, thereby discounting the season variations.These parameters help in understanding the water quality of an aquatic system. Higher dissolved oxygen (national standard is 5 milligram per litre or more) shows whether water can sustain aquatic life. Lower BOD (national standard is 3 milligram per litre or less) shows there is less amount of bacteria and other microorganisms in water. Faecal coliform (national standard less is than 2,500 coliform in 100 ml of water) indicates the amount of sewage in water. Also read: ‘To vilify Muslims’ - Supreme Court stops Sudarshan TV show on UPSC examThe data shows that in the past six years the water quality of the river on these three parameters has improved marginally at most locations. Experts say by this pace, the authorities would take decades to make water fit for human consumption. “The progress so far has been slow. In six years, if Ganga’s water quality has improved by just 10-15 percent, it would take decades to clean Ganga,” said BD Joshi, founder of the Indian Academy of Environmental Sciences, who has worked on the river for more than four decades.The Central government had initially fixed 2019 as the deadline to clean the national river but extended it to 2022 as the Namami Gange Project (NGP) took off slowly. As on August 1, only 29 percent of the 154 sewage projects taken up have been completed. For these projects, the ministry has allotted Rs 23,120 crore, as per government documents.Till now, the ministry has approved 310 projects costing Rs 28,790 crore, as per the information provided by the ministry to Rajya Sabha on September 14, 2020. Most of these projects are at an advanced stage of implementation, the ministry said.A ministry official privy to the information about the project said the sewerage infrastructure projects are coming up in eight states — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Haryana Delhi and Himachal Pradesh — through which the 2,525-km river flows. Currently, the 97 towns located on the main stem of the Ganga generate 2,953 million litres a day (MLD) of sewage. However, the available treatment capacity is only 1,794 MLD.The RTI reply showed the maximum improvement in Ganga water quality has happened in the hills of Uttarakhand, primarily due to effort been made to contain the flow of human and animal sewage. Another reason for this could be that unlike the plains, the flow of industrial waste in the hill is much less.“We have minimized flow of human sewage by building sewage treatment plants in towns and toilets for all those living close to river Ganga. Work is on for zero sewage into river Ganga in the state,” said Uttarakhand environment minister Harak Singh Rawat. The reply showed that as the river flows into the pilgrimage city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand, the water quality deteriorates and further falls downstream at the industrial town of Kanpur where industrial waste still flows into the river. The water quality between Haridwar and Kanpur improved between 2014 and 2019 by 8-10 percent.The water quality was slightly better in Chapra and Patna because of fresh flow of water from tributaries in Bihar such as Kosi and Gandak. But, thereafter, it again fell as the river entered West Bengal. The water quality in Bihar and West Bengal has almost improved by almost 30 percent between 2014 and 2019.So, the river which has DO of almost 9 and faecal coliform of 200 at Rudraprayag in 2019 turned dirty at Uluberia in Howrah district of West Bengal with DO of almost six and coliform count of 22,000. In fact, the coliform count at Uluberia has not changed between 2014 and 2019, according to the data provided. Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) and water expert, said that the bigger issue than improvement in water quality is the flow of the river.“If the flow of the river improves in all seasons, the water quality will improve significantly. But, the reality is that the flow is decreasing and it will have huge implications for people living in the Ganga river basin even if water quality improves,” he said.Thakkar acknowledged that work has happened in building sewage and industrial treatment plans but the real challenge was its monitoring and efficiency. “The state pollution control boards (who are responsible for water quality management) need to ensure that plants don’t give false reports and work at their maximum capacity,” he said. “This (improvement in water quality) is nothing compared to what we have spent on Ganga,” waterman Rajendra Singh said.To revive river Ganga, he said, the government should cancel all proposed dams, re-design existing dams to ensure maximum water flow, push for zero sewage flow in Ganga and relocate all polluting industries away from the Ganga basin area. “We have sent a white paper enumerating these demands to the Central government. Let’s see what they do,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-s-water-quality-improved-between-2014-and-2019-experts-say-pace-is-slow/story-8iMaaaOhQ0Z8OzkiiYpF5O.html
15-09-2020||India||Odisha to amend GST Act to make fraud in input tax credit non-bailable||Faced with rising cases of fraud in input tax credit, the Naveen Patnaik government plans to amend the Odisha Goods and Services Tax making fraudulent input tax credit and retaining benefit as a cognizable and non-bailable offence.The Cabinet which met on Tuesday decided to amend the Odisha Goods and Services Tax Act 2017 by bringing Odisha Goods and Services Tax(Amendment) Bill 2020 in its place so that people who do fraudulent GST transactions or passing and availing fraudulent input tax credit would be liable for penalty. The amendment would also make such offences cognizable and non-bailable.The Cabinet also decided to insert a new section 168A in the Odisha GST Act to extend due dates for various compliances during war, epidemic, flood, drought, fire, cyclone and natural calamities.The proposed amendment has come in the backdrop of a series of cases involving fraudulent input tax credit by dishonest businessmen of the state. In August, officials in Odisha had busted a racket of fake GST invoice involving Rs 712 crore and arrested a businessman for carrying out fake transaction. Businessman Kashmira Kumar Agrawal had hired middlemen who collected documents like PAN card, Aadhaar Card, photographs from people seeking gainful employment such as housewives, drivers, and plumbers from Sundargarh and Sambalpur districts in exchange for money. He, however, misused the documents and created fictitious and dummy firms in the name of these persons. He had transferred huge amounts of money to different firms without having any business transactions with them.In January this year, the state’s GST enforcement authorities arrested two persons for GST frauds worth Rs 212 crore through 28 fictitious and dummy firms in the name of daily wage labourers, private tutors, unemployed youths and housewives. In March, the enforcement officials of GST busted a major fraud in which fake invoices to the tune of Rs 294 were generated by 11 dealers in Bhubaneswar.The GST frauds have been a major source of concern for Odisha has come at a time when its collection in the first five months of 2020-21 fiscal went down by 21 per cent compared to the corresponding period of last fiscal. The total collection till August-end was Rs 4362.95 crore as against Rs 5529.33 crore collected during the corresponding period of 2019-20 fiscal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-amend-gst-act-to-make-fraud-in-input-tax-credit-non-bailable/story-UMnYA1f00HiajqPqIBvNAK.html

Explain”.Another question was “what may be the three reasons that the Congress could not get an expected victory in the 2014 and 2019 general elections? Explain in detail with examples”.“Can a one-party system be implemented in the country? Explain in the backdrop of the present situation” and “how useful is reservation after seven decades of Independence and what will be the impact on increasing demand for reservation in society after 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general class” were some of the other questions in the paper.Questions on “nationalism versus development”, the military surgical strikes, Pakistan’s Hafiz Saeed being declared an international terrorist, demonetisation and GST and their effects on the economy, triple talaq were some of the other topics that students had to tackle.Demanding cancellation of the paper, MP Congress spokesperson Neelabh Shukla in a statement said, “It is highly objectionable that DAVV coloured the examination of important faculty like journalism in BJP’s hues. The students of this subject should be taught party neutrality in a higher education institute.” Shukla demanded intervention of Governor Anandiben Patel, who is also university chancellor, in the matter.However, state BJP spokesperson Umesh Sharma said the “questions asked to journalism students are related to current and relevant topics” and the Congress was “making an issue out of nothing”.Meanwhile, DAVV Examination Controller Ashesh Tiwari said anyone having objections to any question in the concerned paper can approach university authorities with a complain and an inquiry committee would probe it.The paper was uploaded on September 14 and students have to submit written answers by September 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/questions-on-bjp-win-pm-modi-quota-in-mp-varsity-paper-irk-congress/story-0UHiAt7GAHQyqkJOPs9XZJ.html

Chatterjee has been charged under the Indian Penal Code with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, causing grievous hurt by act that endangers life and personal safety of others and damaging property. He has also been charged under several sections of the Motor Vehicles Act for rash driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial is scheduled to start in October. Chatterjee was arrested on July 6, 2017. His car had hit a pavement at high speed in south Kolkata in the early hours of April 29, killing Sonika who was sitting in the front passenger seat. The Kolkata police filed a chargesheet on July 19. Chatterjee, who was in court, did not want to comment on Tuesday. His lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta said the court did not accept the prosecution’s argument for charging Chatterjee with murder (Section 302 of the IPC). The section was dropped while the rest were kept. It was alleged that Chatterjee consumed alcohol at a party and also while he was driving the car. Forensic reports indicated that the car was moving at a speed well over 100 kmph. Sonika’s friends gave confidential statements to a magistrate. After his arrest, Chatterjee was remanded in judicial custody before being released on bail. The death created divisions in Kolkata’s modelling and acting circles. Many of Sonika’s friends accused Vikram Chatterjee of suppressing the truth. The model’s friends organised a candlelight walk on May 8, 2017, demanding justice for Sonika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charges-framed-against-kolkata-actor-2-years-after-car-crash-that-killed-model-sonika-chauhan/story-Ov4tdqAbAmUwcYiCF4YPjO.html
15-09-2020||India||Row over Agra’s Mughal Museum’s link with Shivaji, project in need of funds||The under-construction Mughal Museum, which is now likely to be named after the great Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, stands about 1,300 metres east of the Taj Mahal, awaiting funds for its completion. According to historians, Shivaji once visited Agra during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. There are various theories around what took place during that visit. The most popular one is that Shivaji was arrested and kept in a jail within the Agra Fort but managed to hide himself in a basket of fruits and escaped. The ASI had also attempted to identify the jail where Shivaji was kept. There is also a statue of Shivaji at the gate of Agra Fort to mark this incident. Retired head of the department of history at St John’s College, Dr RC Mishra, however, had a different view but admitted that Shivaji came to Agra during the reign of Aurangzeb and camped away from Agra Fort at a location near present Gwalior Road. “Aurangzeb had taken Shivaji as hostage in his camp. It is said that Shivaji bribed the guards on duty and escaped,” said Dr Sharma. He said Mughal Museum was the appropriate name. There was no sense in naming the museum after Chhatrapati Shivaji. Also read: ‘Rename Agra’s Mughal Museum after Shivaji’ - Yogi AdityanathOn April 17, 2017, the Agra airport was named as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Airport. Another demand that has been raised time and again is to name Agra as ‘Agravan’ after Maharaja Agrasen. BJP MLA from Agra (North) late Jagan Prasad Garg had moved this proposal and the history department of Dr BR Ambedkar University was working to trace the links between Agra and Maharaja Agrasen who is much revered by the Agarwal community. However, there was no demand to name the museum after Shivaji and so the announcement about name change took many by surprise. “It was a long pending demand of the tourism sector to have a grand museum in the Taj city. The existing museum on the Taj Mahal premises has failed to serve the purpose and is not visited by tourists,” said Rajeev Saxena, vice president of the Tourism Guild of Agra. “The tourists coming to Agra and visiting Mughal period monuments were unable to connect with the chronology of the Mughal dynasty. Hence this museum was visualized to make them aware of Mughal hierarchy, architecture, art, craft, weaponry, manuscripts and coins through the Mughal Museum,” said Saxena. “This Mughal Museum was also aimed at increasing night stay of tourists as an added attraction. The idea of the then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav was to give a global recognition to this museum. Provision was made for performing arts at the museum’s art gallery and a fashion corridor. It was designed by David Chipperfield and even foreign tourists visiting Agra used to ask when this Mughal Museum would be open for tourists,” he said. “In recent years, it was also decided to incorporate Braj art and culture in it. Now, the museum’s name is to be changed and since this the government’s decision, we cannot do much. However, what is important is that it gets completed and serves the purpose,” said Saxena. Shamshuddin, president of Approved Tourist Guide Association, dubbed the name change as a ‘political move’. “Chhatrapati Shivaji had a connect with Agra Fort where his statue is placed. There is no connect of the Maratha king with Agra beyond that. So changing the name is not the right decision,” he said. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee member Dr Madhurima Sharma too smelt politics behind the name change. “The state government is not releasing funds needed but is indulging in name change for political gain,” she said. However, BJP state secretary Vijay Shivhare said the decision was justified. “The Mughals came and ruled us so there is no logic calling it ‘Mughal Museum’,” he said. The museum, being constructed by the UP tourism department, was visualized by former Samajwadi Party chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in 2015. He laid the foundation stone in 2016 with the target to get it completed by 2017 with the project cost of Rs 141 crore. Initially, the work went on at a steady pace but later both funding and work were hit, more so due to Covid-19-induced lockdown. Many in the city had forgotten about it till they were reminded of it on Monday when chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced to rename it after Shivaji.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-agra-s-mughal-museum-s-link-with-shivaji-project-in-need-of-funds/story-c41dMHL49Emuj2A8ufbV4I.html

Aditya is also the brother-in-law of Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi. Aditya’s mother Nandini also unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls on a JD(S) ticket from Bangalore Central.The CCB police on Tuesday raided Aditya Alva’s ‘House of Life’ resort-cum-residence which is spread over four acres in Hebbal, Bangalore. Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sandeep Patil said that the raids had been carried out after obtaining a search warrant from the court. Aditya is accused No.6 in the FIR filed in the Cottonpet police station regarding drug procurement, usage and peddling under various sections of CrPC and NDPS acts.Two popular Kannada actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani, along with seven others, have already been arrested in this case.

We will eventually question Aditya also”.Meanwhile, two other ‘Sandalwood’ actors, Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray, who are married to each other, were asked to appear before CCB for questioning in the drug racket.

15-09-2020||India||India responds to UN human rights chief’s criticism of situation in Kashmir||India on Tuesday responded to the UN human rights chief’s criticism of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir by saying it had revived grassroots democracy and pushed economic development in the region despite Pakistan’s efforts to derail this process. In her global human rights update on Monday, UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet had said that both “incidents of military and police violence against civilians” and incidents related to militancy were continuing in Kashmir, while legal changes to the Constitution and domicile rules were “generating deep anxiety”. Giving India’s response during the debate on Bachelet’s update on Tuesday, India’s permanent representative Indra Mani Pandey said since changes were made in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year, people in the region have been “enjoying the same fundamental rights as people in other parts of India”. “We have been able to revive grass root democracy and provide a new momentum to social and economic development, despite the challenge posed by [the] Covid-19 pandemic and persistent attempts by one country to infiltrate terrorists to derail this process by all possible means,” Pandey said. Though the envoy didn’t name the country, it was obvious he was referring to Pakistan, which India has blamed for supporting cross-border terrorism, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. Pandey also said the government’s efforts aimed at socio-economic development and ensuring better governance in Kashmir over the past year have “yielded unprecedented results”. He added, “By extending coverage of positive and affirmative federal legislations and repealing discriminatory or outdated local laws, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering socio-economic justice to disadvantaged people in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, including women, children, minorities and refugees.” Bachelet had also said in her update that the “space for political debate and public participation continues to be severely restricted” in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly since new media rules prohibited vaguely defined “anti-national” reporting. She welcomed the release of some political and community leaders, but noted that “hundreds of people remain in arbitrary detention, with many habeas corpus petitions still pending – including those of many of Jammu and Kashmir’s political leaders”. She also welcome initiatives to extend services to remote areas and the conditional restoration of full internet connectivity in two districts, and said these measures “should be applied promptly to the rest of Jammu and Kashmir”. Bachelet noted that people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have “limited internet access, creating difficulties in accessing education and other vital services”. She said she was also concerned about restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and association on the Pakistani side. “My office is committed to continuing its engagement with both India and Pakistan, to uphold the rights of the Kashmiri people – which is the best way to prevent further tensions and conflict,” she said. Bachelet had also criticised the situation in Kashmir in her global update in 2019, when she had also spoken out against the National Register of Citizens verification process in Assam, saying it had caused “great uncertainty and anxiety”. Pandey also said in his intervention that India remains committed to upholding all human rights and is of the view that the human rights agenda and discourse “must be pursued in a transparent and impartial manner with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs of states”. India also exercised its right of reply to respond to statements by Pakistan, Turkey and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) during the debate on the UN high commissioner’s update. It said it has become “habitual” for Pakistan to malign India with false and fabricated narratives for “self-serving malicious purposes”, and that India and other countries don’t deserve an “unsolicited lecture on human rights from a country that has consistently persecuted its ethnic and religious minorities, is an epicentre of terrorism, has the distinction of providing pensions to individuals on UN sanctions list and has a prime minister who proudly admits training tens of thousands of terrorists to fight in Jammu and Kashmir”. “It’s not surprising that other relevant multilateral institutions have been raising serious concerns on its failure to stop terror financing and lack of effective actions against all terror entities in Pakistan,” the Indian representative said in the reply. Pakistan’s “nefarious designs” also continue in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and its “zeal to reassert its theocratic ideology” has ensured that “ethnic and religious minorities have no future through systematic persecution, blasphemy laws, forced conversions, targeted killings, sectarian violence and faith-based discrimination”, The Indian representative said. India also pointed out that “thousands of Sikh, Hindu and Christian minority women and girls have been subjected to abductions, forced marriages and conversions in Pakistan”. India also noted that Pakistan has been “abusing” various UN human rights mechanisms and platforms to raise issues that are “extraneous to the mandate” of the Human Rights Council and relate to the internal affairs of India. New Delhi also rejected the OIC’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir and said the organisation has no locus standi to comment on India’s internal affairs. The OIC has also allowed itself to be “misused by Pakistan”, India said in its reply. India also advised Turkey to “refrain from commenting on the internal affairs of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-responds-to-un-human-rights-chief-s-criticism-of-situation-in-kashmir/story-O1tCJTrhsH3qHAcmSYTsnI.html
15-09-2020||India||‘To vilify Muslims’: Supreme Court stops Sudarshan TV show on UPSC exam||A controversial television show slated to be aired by TV channel Sudarshan News on the entry of Muslims in the civil services is aimed at vilifying the Muslim community, the Supreme Court observed on Tuesday as it barred the channel from going ahead with the telecast of the remaining six episodes of the programme “Bindas Bol”.The court will hear the case on Thursday as well. The channel had earlier aired four episodes.The top court took strong exception to the contents of the show, noting that the claims made by the channel seemed to be “insidious”, painted an entire community with the same brush and cast aspersions on the credibility of the exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.“Prima facie, it does appear to the Court that the intent, object and purpose of the episodes which have been telecast is to vilify the Muslim community. An insidious attempt has been made to insinuate that the community is involved in a conspiracy to infiltrate the civil services. The drift, tenor and content of the episodes is to bring the community into public hatred and disrepute…Any attempt to vilify a community must be viewed with disfavour by this court as a custodian of Constitutional values,” the bench comprising justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph said.At an earlier hearing, the court had declined to impose a pre-broadcast ban on the controversial programme citing freedom of speech and expression.On Tuesday, the judges said there has been a change in circumstances because of the tone, tenor of the programme that emerged after 4 episodes were telecast from September 11 to 14.“We are of the view that there has been a change of circumstances at least prima facie on the basis of the record which has emerged before this court. We order and direct that pending further orders of this court, Sudarshan News shall stand injuncted from airing any further broadcasts in continuation of or similar to the broadcast which have taken place on September 11, 12, 13 and 14 either under the same or any other title or caption,” the bench ordered.Senior counsel Shyam Divan, who appeared for Sudarshan News, told the judges that such an order would amount to prior restraint on publication of news and would violate free speech.“I reserve my right to fair criticism of the order after the hearing of the matter is over. As of now, I feel that the entire telecast of 4 episodes must have been referred to by the petitioners/intervenors. Their arguments were contrary to facts and records. My client has never said anything about Muslim community. We are concerned with the issue of national security,” advocate Vishnu Jain who represented Sudarshan News told HT.The court was hearing a petition by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan who submitted that the programme contained statements that were derogatory about the entry of Muslims in the civil services. In the programme’s trailer, which was widely shared on social media platforms, the anchor and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan news, Suresh Chavhanke was seen questioning what he called was a sudden increase in the number of Muslims succeeding in IAS and IPS exams.Chavhanke had asked about what the consequences would be if “Jihadis from Jamia (university)” would hold positions of authority and power like that of Collector and Secretary.Khan submitted that expression of views were derogatory to a particular community, has a divisive potential and was in violation of programme code enumerated under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995.Simultaneously, another petition on the same subject matter was heard by the Delhi high court ,which on August 28, stayed the telecast and asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to take a call on the matter. The ministry cleared the programme on September 10 while directing the channel to ensure that the show does not violate any programme code. Action would be taken as per the law if any violation was found, it said.Subsequently, a fresh petition was filed before the high court which issued notice on the plea on September 11 but declined stay. Sudarshan News had then proceeded to telecast four episode of the showSenior counsel Anoop Choudhari and advocate Shadan Farasat appearing on behalf of petitioners and intervenors submitted before the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the telecast violated the programme code and amounted to hate speech.Farasat pointed out that the programme made false statements regarding relaxation being afforded to Muslim candidates with respect to upper age-limit and number of attempts available to take the exam.The bench was critical of the episodes aired by the channel stating that the insinuations made in the programme did not befit the democratic traditions of the country and that several statements which were brought to the attention of the court are “palpably erroneous”.“You are doing a great disservice to the nation. What has been happening does not do credit to our democratic system. We are a melting pot of cultures, civilizations, religions and languages,” said justice DY Chandrachud.Justice Chandrachud also stated that every single person who applies for the UPSC goes through the same selection process and the insinuation that one community is trying to infiltrate civil services does great disservice to the nation.“In the UPSC exam, all are subjected to the same tests, interviews and are assessed by the same persons. But the insinuation is that one community is trying to infiltrate the UPSC. What you are doing does not do credit to our democratic system. Your client is doing great disservice to the nation. We are a melting pot of cultures,” Chandrachud told Divan.Divan submitted that the programme raises an issue concerning national security and it is in public interest to bring out the story.“The programme is in adherence to programme code,” Divan claimed while also underscoring that the matter involves foreign funding from sources which are inimical to India’s interests.Justice KM Joseph, who was also on the bench, said freedom granted to the media is not absolute and the manner in which certain television channels conduct news debates today left a lot to be desired.He asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for central government, to explore options on disclosing the shareholding pattern and revenue model of media houses on public domain.“Certain channels mute panelists when they express views which go against the anchor’s views. This is unfair. No freedom is absolute, not even journalistic freedom,” justice Joseph said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sudarshan-tv-show-on-upsc-exam-aimed-at-vilifying-muslims-says-supreme-court/story-qNK61goy13c5GbOwVsE0ML.html

Responding to a query from AIMIM leader Asadudin Owaisi, wherein he asked about the impact of August 5, 2019 decision, Union minister of state (home) G Kishan Reddy informed the Lok Sabha that the decision has “fully integrated J&K and Ladakh into the mainstream of the nation”.

The investigation in respect of those persons is in process. If the accused is released on bail then she will alert those persons and they will destroy the evidence. There is a possibility of tampering of evidence,” the order said.Also read: NCB probing link between Bollywood and drugs traffickers, says MHA in ParliamentIt added that Chakraborty’s statements were recorded by NCB on September 6,7 and 8 and the actor was also provided police protection on her request. “The prosecution revealed the role of the accused on the basis of said statement and thereafter, she was arrested in the crime. Therefore, at this stage, when the investigation is at a preliminary stage, it cannot be said that the statement is forcefully recorded and inadmissible in evidence,” according to the order.The court also noted that Chakraborty was arrested under charges that were non-bailable. “Section 27-A of the NDPS Act as discussed above is in respect of the illicit trafficking of drugs, considering the punishment prescribed for the offence punishable under this section offence is non-bailable,” it said.The court cited electronic evidence and WhatsApp chats that NCB has recovered. It also observed that some amount of money was transferred via credit card of the accused and that a commercial quantity of LSD was recovered from one of the accused Anuj Keshwani.Also read: Two more arrests by NCB in Sushant Singh Rajput caseThe 28-year-old actor, in her bail application, stated that NCB has not disclosed any connection between her and any of the drug peddlers.

The bail pleas of Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, his domestic help Dipesh Sawant, alleged drug peddlers Abdul Basit and Zaid Vilatra apart from Rhea and Showik have also been rejected by the court.NCB has, so far, arrested 18 people in connection with the case.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-alert-others-destroy-evidence-why-court-dismissed-rhea-chakraborty-s-bail-plea/story-Mu6mlYzIWqiwOrN0dIT3vK.html
15-09-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee’s stipend for Hindu priests a move to woo voters, says Opposition||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to give a monthly stipend and houses to Brahmin priests has triggered a debate with the Congress, Left Front and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) calling it a desperate move to secure Hindu votes before the crucial assembly polls next year. Banerjee announced on Monday that the government will give a monthly stipend of Rs 1,000 to 8,000 Brahmin priests facing financial crisis and also provide houses to those who need one. The announcement instantly brought under focus Banerjee’s 2012 decision to give a monthly stipend of Rs 2,500 to the Imams of all mosques. The government started the scheme a year after Banerjee ousted the 34-year-old Left Front government in West Bengal. “She thought she could buy Muslim votes with the stipend for Imams and now she thinks Hindu votes can be secured this way. This cannot be a government’s mode of functioning,” said Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Arguing that Banerjee was no different from the BJP government at the Centre, Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member Md Salim said, “Both ask people to be economically independent but make them dependent on the government. When Hindu and Mughal emperors ruled India they didn’t have to offer monthly stipends to priests and Imams. They ensured a strong economy.” “Rs 1,000 is a paltry sum for running a home but big enough to appear as an act of benevolence,” quipped Salim. Chairman of West Bengal Imams Association Md Yahiya reacted to the political comments saying Banerjee started the stipend for Imams a year after coming to power in 2011 and it was not her electoral promise. “This is simply a welfare scheme because not all Hindus are priests. But even if one accepts for argument’s sake that she wants to secure Hindu votes then one should ask if the BJP and Congress have exclusive rights to Hindu votes. Can’t Hindus vote for the TMC?” said Md Yahiya. “I feel that Rs 1,000 is a small amount. The stipend for priests and Imams should be equal and substantial,” he added. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha accused Banerjee of being partial. “If all Imams in West Bengal are getting the stipend then why is the government selectively helping only 8,000 priests? There are thousands more. Why not help all?” he said. Amitabha Chakraborty, a priest from the northern outskirts of Kolkata, said, “Most people do not know how low a priest’s income can be. I have seen many suffering miserably in their old age when they couldn’t work anymore. This is a good initiative by the government. Some help is better than nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-stipend-for-hindu-priests-a-move-to-woo-voters-says-opposition/story-KFAnPyXNwpE4bx9xFkXBGM.html

I am asymptomatic and feeling healthy,” the CM tweeted. “However as per SOP and safety of others, I am self isolating myself and requesting everyone who came in contact with me to adhere to the SOP,” the 41-year-old added. Khandu tested positive two days after state’s health minister Alo Libang tested positive for Covid-19. Last week, the CM had trekked 24 km for 11 hours to meet residents of a remote village located at a height of 14,500 feet above sea level. Accompanied by just one security officer and some villagers, he trekked through passes, difficult mountain terrain to reach Luguthang in his constituency Mukto in Tawang district. Arunachal Pradesh has witnessed a rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Till Monday, the state had recorded 6,298 Covid-19 positive cases with 4,531 recoveries and 10 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-pradesh-cm-pema-khandu-tests-positive-for-covid-19-in-self-isolation/story-2v6tqsfYIU7aoMuH77E9qK.html
15-09-2020||India||Sasikala may walk out of prison in January, likely to impact TN political landscape||Tamil Nadu, which will face assembly polls in the first quarter of next year, may see some changes in its political landscape as VK Sasikala Natarajan, once a close confidant of former AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa is likely to walk out of prison in January.According to an RTI reply by the office of the Chief Superintendent of Prison, Parapanna Agrahara, where Sasikala is currently serving a four-year prison term after being convicted by the Supreme Court, the probable date of her release is January 27, 2021, if she pays the ordered fine of Rs 10 crore. In case she fails to pay the fine, she is likely to be released on February 27, 2022.However, what is interesting is that in the RTI response by R Latha, Public Information Officer, Sasikala could be released earlier than January 27, 2021, if she utilises her parole facility. Sasikala had entered prison on February 15, 2015, but had served 35 days in prison earlier in 1997 and 2004.Also read: India walks out of SCO meet of NSAs over fictitious Pak map, says it violates normsAccording to Sasikala’s lawyer Raja Sendur Pandian, she is eligible to be released as early as the end of this month, though this could not be independently confirmed by HT with the prison authorities. Pandian claims that Sasikala is entitled to ‘ordinary remission’ given to all prisoners which would enable her to walk out of prison as early as the end of this month. He also said that arrangements have already been made to pay the Rs 10 crore fine to facilitate her smooth and quick release.Sasikala’s reentry into Tamil Nadu’s political landscape is likely to have a significant impact. Before surrendering, she had been elected as general secretary of the party and leader of the AIADMK legislature party and was all set to be sworn in as the chief minister.However, the then Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao waited for the Supreme Court judgement in the disproportionate case against Jayalalithaa and Sasikala. Both of them, along with Sasikala’s nephew Sudhakaran and confidante J Ilavarsi, were found guilty, thus quashing her hopes of becoming the CM. The sentence against Jayalalithaa was infructuous because she had died two months earlier.After Sasikala’s arrest, Edappadi Palanswami - then seen as her proxy and key lieutenant - was elected as the leader of the legislature party and took charge as the chief minister. Later, after falling out with Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran, she was expelled from the AIADMK and removed from the post general secretary. Dhinakaran formed an alternate party AMMK which has not had much electoral success.Now with Sasikala’s imminent release, the political scene could see a churn in the state. Political Analysts L Manjunath says, “If she can project herself as the wronged woman who had to go to jail to defend the honour of Thalivi Jayalalithaa, then she might still emerge as a significant force. Especially, as the Palanswami and the Paneerselvam (Deputy CM) factions are yet to fully reconcile with each other. Also, she belongs to the powerful Thevar community which could also be a factor in her favour.”Also read: Rahul Gandhi takes a jibe after Rajnath Singh’s LAC statementWhile the AIADMK is yet to react officially on the likely imminent release of Sasikala, fisheries minister D Jayakumar had dismissed the possibility of readmitting her or any likely impact on party fortunes because of her reentry into the state politics.However, Sasikala might still face some challenges as the IT department is looking to auction some of the properties seized in the disproportionate assets case. “While the DMK-led alliance swept the Lok Sabha polls, assembly elections are a different challenge. If Sasikala can reunite all the erstwhile AIADMK factions, they can mount a serious challenge and it will not be a walkover like the parliamentary polls,” says Manjunath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-may-walk-out-of-prison-in-january-likely-to-impact-tn-political-landscape/story-wGXL3JlGr2AIeKXm2Clu6O.html
15-09-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 recovery rate surges past 78%, one of the highest globally: Govt||The government on Tuesday hailed India’s Covid-19 recovery rate, which stands at 78.28%, and said it was one of the highest in the world citing data from the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus disease tracker.Balram Bhargava, the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) director general, credited the “very effective” lockdown for the surging number of recoveries in the country. Bhargava said during a press briefing that India learnt from the experience of nations that suffered high fatalities from the viral disease. He said the country was able to “distribute the curve” of the infection as well as avoid the “huge peak” those countries had in terms of deaths.Also Watch | Covid: 1 crore tests jump; 38.5 lakh recoveries; active vs total cases in India As of Tuesday, 3,859,399 people had recovered from Covid-19 and the country’s recovery tally exceeded the active cases by 2,869,338.Also read: 3 vaccines at clinical trial stage in India, SII to begin Phase 3 trial soon, says ICMROn observing the Covid-19 situation in European countries and then acting accordingly, Bhargava said, “Fortunately, we took learnings from that in India and we were able to, what we call, ‘distribute the curve’. We distributed the curve in such a way that we did not have those large number of deaths and that was attributable scientifically because of a very effective lockdown that was imposed in late March, April and May. So, we did not really have a huge peak from that perspective.”He also said that the chances of reinfection are “very, very rare” but it may happen as it did in Hong Kong. However, he dismissed the matter as not a very serious concern.Also read: Only 4 states have more than 50,000 Covid-19 case, says health ministryDuring the briefing, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said there are 14 states and Union territories (UTs) in the country where the number of active Covid-19 cases are less than 5,000. He also said that India’s cases per million population are amongst the lowest in the world, which stands at 3,573 while the global average is 3,704 while deaths per million population at 58 is also amongst the lowest in the world and the global average is 118.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-recovery-rate-surges-past-78-one-of-the-highest-globally-govt/story-wU8YaDW6qG6WEBieTzoD7J.html
15-09-2020||India||In response to China’s actions, Indian troops ready for long haul in Ladakh||India is making vigorous attempts to provide logistics support to its forward deployed soldiers in the eastern Ladakh sector, where more than 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed through the winter months to deal with any provocation by the Chinese forces, with no end in sight to the tense border standoff, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday. From specialised winter clothing to rations and arctic tents to portable heaters, military planes and helicopters have been flying to Ladakh almost daily with their cargo holds filled with crucial supplies and gear that soldiers would require to slug it out in the inhospitable mountain terrain, the officials said, requesting anonymity. Fresh images coming out of Ladakh on Tuesday provided glimpses of the extraordinary effort being made by the military to support its high-altitude deployments in the sensitive sector. Necessary steps have also been taken for equipment sustenance, the officials said.ALSO READ | Any serious situation along LAC will impact India-China bilateral ties: Rajnath Singh In a statement made in Lok Sabha on the situation in the Ladakh sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “I can assure you that the morale and motivation of our armed forces is very high…They are being provisioned with suitable clothing, habitat and the required defence wherewithal.” Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane visited forward locations in Ladakh on September 3 to review the army’s operational preparedness and the logistics arrangements for sustenance of forces through the winter. China has deployed sizeable military assets in the eastern Ladakh theatre, including 50,000 troops, 150 aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems, with India matching every military move made by the neighbour. “The determination of our troops is praise worthy. They are capable of serving at forbidding altitudes with scarce oxygen and in extremely cold temperatures, something that they have effortlessly done over the last many years on Siachen and in Kargil,” Singh said in Lok Sabha. ALSO READ | Indian, Chinese top military commanders likely to meet this weekHe said the lower house should pass a resolution in support of the armed forces that have been defending the country at towering heights, braving inclement weather in Ladakh. Top Indian and Chinese military commanders are likely to hold a meeting along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) this week to reduce military tensions in eastern Ladakh where the situation remains tense after a series of recent maneuvers by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area. Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. They will now be meeting for the first time after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the most significant heights being held by India on Rezang La and Reqin pass where the PLA made some desperate attempts to regain lost ground earlier this week. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The Chinese side has mobilised a large number of troops and weapon systems along the LAC as well as in the eastern Ladakh theatre where the current friction areas include Gogra, Kongka La and the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Singh said. “In response to China’s actions, our armed forces have also made appropriate counter deployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-response-to-china-s-actions-indian-troops-ready-for-long-haul-in-ladakh/story-I0eapRNEzAajwV5by9m86K.html
15-09-2020||India||‘PM misled country on Chinese intrusions’: Rahul reacts to Rajnath’s LAC statement||The Congress on Tuesday questioned the absence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha when defence minister Rajnath Singh made a statement on the India-China border standoff and asked the government why is it shying away from a discussion in Parliament on the issue.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is in the United States accompanying his mother Sonia Gandhi for a health check-up, attacked the Prime Minister for “misleading” the country over Chinese transgressions. “The country has always stood by its armed forces and will continue to do so in future. But Modiji, when will you stand against China? When will we take back the land of our country from China? Don’t be scared of taking China’s name,” he tweeted in Hindi.Also read: What Rajnath Singh said in Lok Sabha रक्षामंत्री के बयान से साफ़ है कि मोदी जी ने देश को चीनी अतिक्रमण पर गुमराह किया।हमारा देश हमेशा से भारतीय सेना के साथ खड़ा था, है और रहेगा।लेकिन मोदी जी,आप कब चीन के ख़िलाफ़ खड़े होंगे?चीन से हमारे देश की ज़मीन कब वापस लेंगे?चीन का नाम लेने से डरो मत।Earlier, Congress members staged a walk-out from the House soon after the defence minister’s statement, alleging they were not allowed to raise certain issues related to the India-China border row. They later protested in front of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the Parliament House complex.In his statement in the Lok Sabha, the defence minister said India is committed to a peaceful resolution of the current border standoff with China but any attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo by the neighbouring country was unacceptable.Singh also said the Indian troops had inflicted heavy costs, including casualties, on the Chinese side during a violent clash with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Galwan valley on June 15. The clash left 20 Indian soldiers, including Colonel B Santosh Babu, dead.Later, addressing reporters outside Parliament, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Prime Minister’s absence from Parliament when the defence minister made a statement in the Lower House on the India-China situation showed that the government was afraid of a discussion on the face-off.“For the Congress party, the country is the most important. We are proud of our armed forces. This government did not allow us to speak in Parliament. They are afraid of Congress asking questions that they will not be able to answer,” he said. “It is our entitlement to put forward our views. When the defence minister made a statement on the India-China situation in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister was not present. He is afraid of conducting a discussion on the issue in Parliament,” Chowdhury alleged. In 1962, when India-China war took place, he said then opposition leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee sought to know about the situation at the border. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to his demand and there was a discussion for two days in Parliament on the war and border situation, he added.Chowdhury said the Congress members staged a walk-out from the Lok Sabha because they were not allowed to send their message to the country and the armed forces.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also said the government should give an answer on whether China has encroached Indian territory at specific positions across the border.“The entire country is proud of the armed forces and that is why we are talking here. But why is the Prime Minister shying away from a discussion?” he asked. “Our questions are very straight forward. Has China occupied Indian territory? Have the Chinese encroached on Depsang Plains, Gogra, Pangong-Tso Lake till Finger 8, Y-junction in Bhutan, Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand and in Arunachal Pradesh. The government should answer these questions,” asked Surjewala.He said the Prime Minister should apologise to the nation if the answers to the questions asked by the Congress are affirmative as he had told an all-party meeting on June 19 that the Chinese have not entered and occupied Indian territory. Congress’ deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi told reporters that Chowdhury and his other party colleagues wanted to send a message of solidarity with the armed forces and also issue a stern warning to China that they should not test India’s patience. “Unfortunately, the government feels as if only they can speak in support of the army,” he added.“The Defence Minister excoriated China for transgressing the LAC, could the Govt explain why the Prime Minister had issued an extraordinary statement claiming that China had not entered our territory? Presumably, the Government has changed the PM’s stand?” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted.“Another question: since the defence minister says that both countries have now agreed in talks to respect the LAC, but separately says the two countries have differing perceptions of where LAC lies, isn’t that a recipe for another clash? Shouldn’t we just insist on status quo ante?” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-misled-the-country-on-chinese-intrusions-rahul-gandhi-after-defence-minister-s-statement-in-lok-sabha/story-eDcQJVKw8lNKuyAv8ubR9H.html

15-09-2020||India||‘Sholay style’: Uttarakhand councillor climbs overhead tank, demands waiver of school fee amid pandemic||A councillor in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani, who had been protesting for over 40 days demanding a complete waiver of school fee during the pandemic, climbed an overhead tank on Tuesday while intensifying his protest. The councillor climbed an overhead tank at Jal Sansthan in Haldwani, Nainital district. When the news spread, local MLA and Uttarakhand leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh reached the spot, urging the councillor to climb down. After he was assured by Hridayesh that the matter will be raised with the state government, the councillor climbed down but was stung by a swarm of bees. Rohit Kumar, the protesting councillor said, “We have been protesting for over a month now and no one from the state government has come to speak to us. Today, I climbed the overhead tank, risking my life demanding a complete waiver of fee collected by schools during the lockdown period, we did not hear anything from the government.” “The leader of Opposition has assured me that she will raise the issue in the upcoming assembly session, which is why we are temporarily cancelling the protest but will continue again if the government takes no action,” added Kumar. Also read: India sheds reluctance in engaging Taliban at the Doha intra-Afghan talksSpeaking on the protest, Savin Bansal, district magistrate, Nainital, said, “As per the state government’s norms, only tuition fee is to be charged by schools. This is no policy decision to waive off fee. It is difficult to do something like this as the private schools also need some money to function.” Meanwhile, investigating the matter of extra fee being collected by some private schools following complaints from parents, the Nainital district education department has sent notices to twelve of forty schools that were being probed in the matter. “We have now sent notices to these schools after listening to the complaints lodged by parents with the district administration. The schools have been asked to inform why they have charged extra fee apart from the collection of only tuition fee as per the norms of the state government. After the schools give us a reply, we will accordingly decide whether the schools should be penalised or stricter action should be taken,” added Bansal. On June 23, the state government had ordered that private schools imparting education through online classes or other communication modes during the lockdown period will be allowed to charge only the tuition fee. The schools cannot charge any other fee from parents. “However, if a school is teaching extra subjects through online mode of teaching, then a fee for such courses, based on a previously set fee, can be charged above the tuition fee,” the order stated. The order further stated, “If certain parents despite taking the benefit of online education are not able to pay the fee then they shall write to the school principal or the school’s managing committee, explaining why they are unable to pay the fee and seek extension for paying the fee. In such a situation, the school management will allow the parent to pay the fee in the extended time period, but in any condition whatsoever, the student will not be removed from the school.” (With inputs from Ankur Sharma in Haldwani)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sholay-style-uttarakhand-councillor-climbs-overhead-tank-demands-waiver-of-school-fee-amid-pandemic/story-8OOmX3Aqh50m63zNa3dXwM.html
15-09-2020||India||‘$1 trillion economy, herculean task’: UP govt tells to-be-consultant in revised RFP||The Uttar Pradesh government has come out with a revised Request for Proposal (RFP) for selection of a consultant to accomplish the ‘Herculean task’ of boosting the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to $1 trillion in the next five years. “The task demands some giant steps. It needs some well-thought-out and long-term strategies on a sustained basis. This would also require organisational restructuring, focused policies and rules for more effective governance, faster decision-making process and improved accountability,” read the RFP document while spelling out the task to the to-be-consultant. A new timeline, given along with the revised RFP, asks bidders to submit their e-bids by October 9. The e-bids will be opened by October 12 and the selected consultant will, thereafter, be required to submit a report in 90 days, outlining a roadmap to make UP a trillion-dollar economy. “Changes have been made in the revised RFP. Some changes have been made in evaluation criteria, while 30-day time, instead of 21 days, has been allowed for submission of bids. Earnest money deposit can be made by RTGS now,” said a functionary of the state planning department. Also read: Any serious situation along LAC will impact India-China bilateral ties - Rajnath SinghGiving the background about the state’s economy, the RFP stated, “The state has already embarked upon the journey of growth and prosperity. Resultantly, in 2018-19, the GSDP has already touched Rs 15.80 lakh crore ($230 billion) with a rich growth rate of 7 percent over the previous year. However, it would be a challenging task to boost the size of the GSDP by nearly five times to reach the target of $1 trillion in five years (2020-2025), discounting for dollar fluctuations and global trends. It enhances the challenge and would require sustained and aggressive efforts at the state level.” As the state has not been able to witness a double-digit growth despite consistent attempts, making the state a trillion-dollar economy would prove to be a major challenge. “The state government has set an ambitious target of making UP a trillion-dollar economy. The RFP itself calls the move a herculean task. So, the government will have to make ‘Bhagirath’ (gigantic) efforts as the Covid-19 is bound to lead to contraction of the GSDP in 2020-2021. The government will effectively have four-and-a-half years to complete the task. Advance estimates for 2019-2020 indicate the GSDP of about Rs 17.94 lakh crore. After contracting of the GSDP in 2020-2021, the state will need a growth rate of about 45 percent per annum at current prices in the next four years,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, economics department, Lucknow University. “UP’s ability to attract investment proposals worth Rs 4.68 lakh crore in the Investors Summit in 2018 and recent jump to second position in the ‘ease of doing business’ gives hope that even the ‘Herculean task’ can be accomplished substantially, if not wholly,” added Tyagi. Last year, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given a call to accept the challenge of making the state a trillion-dollar economy in the next five years. But there was no Covid-19 when Yogi made the statement.“If we keep on moving at the present pace, it will take 12 to 15 years to make the state a trillion-dollar economy. We will have to move faster,” said Yogi while speaking on his government’s first supplementary budget for 2019-2020 in the state assembly on July 24, 2019.” “To make UP a trillion-dollar economy the state will have to make progress in every sector and set a target to attract investment of Rs 70 lakh crore to 100 lakh crore. This may be a big target. But it is not impossible,” he had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-trillion-economy-herculean-task-up-govt-tells-to-be-consultant-in-revised-rfp/story-A4MV4noDkAgTkR4Nk8OYHM.html

He said Indian forces are determined to protect the country’s security and sovereignty and inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces when they clashed with them in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.The defence minister said the violent conduct by the Chinese along the LAC have been in violation of all bilateral agreements including those signed in 1993 and 1996. “China is not honouring the customary alignment of the boundary with India. The alignment has not only been defined by treaties but has been maintained historically.”Also read | What Rajnath Singh said in Lok SabhaMembers of the Congress party were not allowed to speak on the issue as Lok Sabha chairperson Om Birla referred to House rules.

His party has been demanding that status quo ante should be restored at the LAC and Chinese troops be pushed to their side.Before Tuesday, Gandhi had questioned the government on the issue of Chinese aggression on September 11. “The Chinese have taken our land.

After staying the FIR, the court sought a reply from the state government within four weeks and final arguments will be after the reply,” Kumar added. Notably, in 2013, twenty-seven people, including senior Congress leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and VC Shukla, were killed in an attack allegedly carried out by a group of 150 Maoists. On May 26, 2013, the NIA registered a case on this attack and started investigating the case. Recently, on May 25, 2020, Jitendra Mudaliyar, son of Congress leader Uday Mudaliyar, who was also killed in Darbha Valley attack (also referred to as the Jheeram Valley attack), registered an FIR in Bastar district concerning the attack on the Congress convoy. The NIA moved an application on June 16 in Jagdalpur NIA court seeking handing over of the case registered by Mudaliyar to the NIA for further investigation but it was rejected in August. The NIA then moved to the HC, appealing that the FIR should either be transferred to them or be quashed as two FIRs cannot be registered on the same crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jheeram-ghati-attack-chhattisgarh-hc-stays-investigation-into-fresh-fir-by-state-police/story-6pqNP7dQpVPgccJc5k0V8J.html

Based on a reference from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), NCB had filed a case against Rhea and her family members on August 26. She was arrested on September 8 and is currently in judicial custody.“During the period of Covid-19 lockdown, no such actionable inputs were received by NCB revealing the nexus between people in the film industry and drug traffickers. However, a case in this regard has been registered by NCB Mumbai Zonal unit on 28.08.2020,” said Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.“Drugs such as Ganja, Hashish, Tetra Hydro Cannabinol and Lysergic acid De-ethylamide have been seized in the operation,” MHA said. The ministry was responding to a query from Kumbakudi Sudhakaran, a Congress lawmaker from Kerala, who asked if the government had conducted a detailed enquiry in the nexus between people in the film industry and those involved in drug trade during Covid-19.The NCB comes under the Union home ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-probing-link-between-bollywood-and-drugs-traffickers-mha-in-parliament/story-iRqSMdgJG7AjcpzDB5wYWL.html

The vaccine candidate is based on a proprietary vaccine delivery platform of the company.“Aurobindo is in the process of setting up a state-of-art manufacturing facility for viral vaccines which will be used to produce the COVID-19 vaccine and other viral vaccines. The plant will comply with global standards. The company’s COVID-19 vaccine development is going as per plan,” the filing added.Commenting on the collaboration, Aurobindo Pharma Managing Director N Govindarajan said, ”It is a matter of immense pride that BIRAC has placed its trust on our vaccine capabilities. The senior leadership of Aurobindo and Auro Vaccines has extensive experience in development, production and commercialization of several vaccines.” Department of Biotechnology Secretary and BIRAC Chairperson Renu Swarup said the partnership with Aurobindo is to serve the country’s need for a vaccine to fight this pandemic. “The government is focussed on creating an ecosystem that nurtures and encourages new product innovation to address the most relevant issues to our society,” Swarup added.Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute, Zydus Cadila, Panacea Biotec, Indian Immunologicals, Mynvax and Biological E are among the pharma firms in India working on the coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aurobindo-pharma-ties-up-with-birac-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine/story-pd9IvoeagYVLGR8xdjOFbM.html
15-09-2020||India||India, UK working on roadmap to strengthen strategic partnership, says foreign secretary Shringla||As India and the UK work on a comprehensive roadmap to strengthen their strategic partnership in the next decade, the development of Covid-19 vaccines is a crucial area with potential, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Tuesday. Besides partnering India for improving and augmenting healthcare systems, the UK can take advantage of the country’s economic reforms and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to forge new supply and value chains, Shringla said in his address to the inaugural session of the annual UK conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). “Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Boris Johnson are committed to further strengthen our strategic partnership in the next decade, and a comprehensive roadmap for this is being formulated. While we undertake this exercise...both our countries are in a unique position to forge a truly global partnership and should not miss this opportunity,” he said. Referring to work being done by the Serum Institute of India with Oxford University and AstraZeneca on a Covid-19 vaccine, he described the development of vaccines as a “crucial area where there is potential for collaboration”. Just as India’s pharmaceutical sector played a key role in meeting global demand for medicines during the pandemic, the companies of the two countries can work on developing an affordable and accessible vaccine for Covid-19, he added. “The issue of secure and reliable supply chains has also gained increased salience in the current global context. It is important to design supply chains which have greater resilience to major disruptions like the current pandemic,” Shringla said. By increasing its domestic capacities, India can contribute to making global supply chains more resilient by mitigating disruptions, he said. The Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative for self-reliance needs to be seen in this context as it is “not about seeking self-centred arrangements or economic isolationism”, he said. “It aims to ensure India’s position as a key participant in global supply chains,” Shringla added. The pandemic led to the acceleration of reforms with the launch of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, whereby India rolled out a stimulus package of $270 billion, or close to 10% of the GDP. This ensured that India received more than $20 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2020, he said. “While the global FDI declined by 1% in 2019, FDI into India rose by 20% in the same period. Several global technology majors have announced major investments in India. Google is investing $10 billion, Facebook $5 billion and Mubadala, the UAE Sovereign Wealth Fund, $1.2 billion,” he said. Pointing to the complementary nature of the Indian and British economies, Shringla said the UK is strong in research and innovation while India offers scale and affordability. “I would invite British companies to take advantage of the economic opportunities opened up by the reforms currently underway in India,” he added. India emerged the second largest source of FDI for the UK in 2019. Around 850 Indian companies in the UK employ more than 100,000 people and bilateral trade touched £24 billion last year. The UK is the sixth largest investor in India, with investments totalling $28.21 billion till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-working-on-roadmap-to-strengthen-strategic-partnership-says-foreign-secretary-shringla/story-E26BKv3tIKp2JhzznOfO0O.html
15-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: Aircraft (Amendment) Bill passed by Rajya Sabha||The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2020, that seeks to impose a penalty of up to Rs 1 crore for lapses and violation of airline rules and regulations, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. The Bill seeks to amend the Aircraft Act, 1934 that regulates the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of civil aircraft, and licensing of aerodromes. It also seeks to converts three existing bodies—the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), and the Aircraft Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB), under the Ministry of Civil Aviation into statutory bodies. As per the provisions on the Bill, a violation can be punished with up to two years in jail or a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh, or both. Carrying arms, ammunition, and explosives or other banned goods on board, and illegal construction around airports will attract fines up to Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Also Read: Air tickets booked before Covid-19 lockdown may be refundedSpeaking in the House, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said India is the third largest market globally after the United States and China, and is growing rapidly in the aviation sector. At present, there are around 661 aircraft in the sky and the next five years, there will be 1,200. He said airports in the country had handled nearly 300,000 passengers a day before the pandemic and the numbers are steadily inching towards the half-way mark. He also pointed out that by 2024, nearly 100 new airports will be added to the existing number. During discussion on the Bill, several MPs appreciated the role of Air India in bringing back Indians stranded abroad during the nationwide lockdown and expressed concerns over the Union government’s bid to sell the public carrier. Also Read: ‘Soaring higher’: Aviation minister says domestic flight operations picking upCongress’ KC Venugopal raised the issue of privatisation of airports and alleged that several norms were violated in giving airports to a single private entity, the Adani Group. The Congress MP said there is a clear shortage of air traffic controllers, raising the issue of near-misses. His charge was later denied by Puri, who asserted that the vacancies have nearly been filled and the recruitment process had been delayed due to the pandemic. The minister said privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, that together account for 33% of the air traffic, has resulted in the airports authority receiving about Rs 29,000 crore, which is now being used for the development of other airports. On the issue of privatisation of Air India, the minister said the carrier is saddled with heavy losses. “…If we could help it, we would keep it with us, but with a Rs 60,000 crore debt, the choice is not between privatisation and non-privatisation. Some of my colleagues must realise that the choice is between privatisation and closing down. We are confident that the airline, in running condition, doing extremely well, will be given to its new owner in order for Air India and its flag to be kept flying,” Puri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-aircraft-amendment-bill-passed-by-rajya-sabha/story-xPoUarX7ZjxMkIGv0mBOCL.html

The summon was served by the UCPCR on Monday in which it asked the woman and her husband to appear before it to present her side on the allegations of illegally undertaking the DNA test of the child, i.e. without any directions of the court. The summon was served on an application given by former chairman of Bar Council of Uttarakhand Hari Singh Negi to the body alleging the woman and her husband on the same. HT has a copy of the summon served. In the summon, the UCPCR stated that in the aforementioned matter, “the Commission is summoning you in pursuance of its powers under the provision of section 14(i) of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005. The Commission has the powers to monitor the implementation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, RTE Act and POCSO Act”. “Now therefore in the above matter, you are hereby required (personally) to appear before this Commission at 2.30 pm on September 19 at Commission headquarters. If you fail to comply with this order without lawful excuse, you will be subject to the consequences of disobedience under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,” stated the summon. Also read: AAP propped by BJP-RSS to bring down UPA government - Rahul GandhiThe development comes days after the Commission wrote to the investigation officer of the extortion and blackmailing case against the woman, for probing the claims of the woman on undertaking the DNA test of her daughter and husband at a hospital in Uttar Pradesh where she had delivered the child. In that matter, the Commission, while citing the police’s reply, stated that “no such DNA test was held in that hospital as per the woman’s claims”. The woman had then refuted the claims of the Commission and said that she had got the DNA test done at a laboratory in Delhi. The woman’s counsel SP Singh, meanwhile, said that “The summon is yet to be received by them. Once we get it and study it, then only we can comment on it,” said Singh. Meanwhile, the Dehradun police’s Special Investigation Squad (SIS) conducted the medical examination of the woman on Monday in the investigation of the rape case registered against MLA Negi. Arun Mohan Joshi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Dehradun, said “The medical examination was conducted as per the legal procedure. She would also soon record her statements before the court in the investigation.” Many developments have taken place since August when the matter first came to light. Negi’s wife and one of the accused in the rape case, Rita Negi, had lodged a complaint against the woman accusing her of blackmailing and trying to extort Rs 5 crore. Based on the complaint, the police booked the woman along with her husband, mother and sister-in-law. A few days later, the woman lodged a complaint against MLA Negi, accusing him of raping her for the last two years and fathering her child. She also demanded a DNA test of her child and Negi to prove her claims. A case was registered later on the directions of a local court in Dehradun where she had filed a petition, demanding the case to be registered against Negi. The police had refused to do so saying “the complaint will be included in the ongoing probe of the extortion case as it pertains to the same matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-rape-case-uttarakhand-child-rights-body-summons-woman-on-illegal-dna-test-of-daughter/story-ah40cfmBp2ZcMHOjFqO3EM.html

15-09-2020||India||Pak parliament extends ordinance enabling Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal conviction||Pakistan’s parliament has extended by four months an ordinance that enables Indian death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal his conviction in a high court, in accordance with a ruling of the International Court of Justice.The International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, issued in May, was set to expire on September 17. It allows Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court over alleged espionage, to file an appeal against his conviction in the Islamabad high court.In August, the court had directed the government to inform India to appoint a lawyer for the former Indian Navy officer in order to file a review petition. The court on September 3 heard the case for the second time, and directed the government to give India “another opportunity” to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The case will now be heard in October.The direction came after the Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan informed the high court’s larger bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzaib, that the Pakistan government had not yet received a reply from India on the matter.He said Jadhav had maintained that he does not want to take the benefit of the ordinance for an effective review of the case, and requested that his mercy plea, already pending before the Pakistan Army chief, be considered instead.He added that despite the passage of a month since the high court directed the government to offer another chance of legal representation to New Delhi, no reply had been received.On August 6, the court formed a three-member larger bench at the government’s request to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav for his appeal against the death penalty.A special bench headed by Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb had directed the Registrar’s Office to form a larger bench in a written order. The court had also directed the government to make another offer to India and Jadhav through the foreign office to hire a lawyer.The court said in its order that it was refraining from appointing a lawyer for Jadhav. It added that the government of Pakistan should inform Jadhav about his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.The court further observed that Jadhav be informed about the decision of the ICJ, adding that he be made aware of his rights under the ordinance. Pakistan should also inform India of this court order, it added.Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016 in Balochistan on charges of espionage, and condemned to death by a military court the following year.On July 16, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was “neither meaningful nor credible” and he appeared visibly under stress. The Ministry of External Affairs said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of ICJ, which called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentencing of Jadhav, but also of its own ordinance.Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said that Pakistan systematically blocked all of India’s attempts to seek remedies for Jadhav. India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based court ruled last July that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-parliament-extends-ordinance-enabling-kulbhushan-jadhav-to-appeal-conviction/story-s4Z1q7MJJpiXVbEcCbUocP.html
15-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand CM to write to Gadkari highlighting importance of wider Char Dham roads||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat will soon write to Union minister for road and transport Nitin Gadkari explaining the importance of wider roads in the Char Dham road project from a strategic point of view and better connectivity to border areas, informed officials. Char Dham highway project, or the all-weather road, aims to connect the four shrines of the state - Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri - through an 826 kilometre-long road. Darshan Singh Rawat, media coordinator for chief minister Rawat said, “The chief minister will be personally writing to the Centre on the matter of Char Dham road. At present, we have sought documents presented to the Supreme Court last week. The order copy of the apex court will also be studied and then the chief minister will write to the Union minister for road and transport on this matter.” Also read: Facebook objects to Delhi assembly notice on alleged inaction in hate speech cases“In the letter, the chief minister will share with the Union minister details of why the Char Dham road is important from a strategic point of view and improving connectivity to border areas,” added the CM’s media coordinator. Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court had ordered that the ministry of road transport and highway’s (MoRTH) circular of 2018 has to be followed. The MoRTH circular says that the road in the hilly and mountain terrains are to be built with 5.5 m width (18 ft) with two-lane structures (23 ft). This is for a passenger car unit for up to 8000 cars. A MoRTH circular issued on March 23, 2018, with the subject “Standards for Lane width of national highways and roads developed under Central Sector Schemes in Hilly and Mountainous terrains”, mentions that a 2012 letter of the ministry states that the width of the carriageway shall be at least two-lane with paved shoulders irrespective of the traffic thereon in new projects undertaken for widening of carriageway/ bypasses/ realignments. Also read: ‘Disservice to nation’: Supreme Court on Sudarshan TV’s ‘UPSC Jihad’ show“However, challenges have come to the fore in adhering to these standards in the context of National Highways and roads in hilly and mountainous terrains. These challenges arise on account of destabilisation of hill slopes and progressive damaging effects on road alignments and structures in higher contours on hills due to excavation works, the requirement for large-scale felling of precious trees, associated environmental damages…” states the March 2018 circular. The circular further states that the ministry’s 2012 order has been reviewed and with the approval of the competent authority, and the following provisions would be applicable until further orders. The provisions included, “The carriageway width shall be of intermediate lane configurations, i.e. of 5.5 m width with two-lane structures. The passing places may have widths of 2.5 m and 12 m length and these may be provided on alternate sides of the road. The length of the tapered section maybe 6 m on either side of their approaches. Accordingly, the length of the passing places maybe 24 m inclusive of the tapered length…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-to-write-to-gadkari-highlighting-importance-of-wider-char-dham-roads/story-6n7smr0QDaAI15PqdCeBdM.html

Making a statement in Lok Sabha, Singh also said the Indian Army has inflicted heavy costs including casualties on the Chinese side during the clash with the PLA at the Galwan valley on June 15.The defence minister said since April, buildup of troops and armaments by the Chinese side has been witnessed in the border areas adjacent to eastern Ladakh.He said in early May, the Chinese side had taken action to hinder the normal, traditional patrolling pattern of Indian troops in the Galwan Valley area, which resulted in a face-off.Singh said even as this situation was being addressed by the ground commanders as per the provisions of the bilateral agreements and protocol, in mid-May the Chinese side made several attempts to transgress the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. “This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by our armed forces. “We made it clear to the Chinese side both through diplomatic and military channels that China was, by such actions, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. It was categorically conveyed that this was unacceptable,” he said. After Singh’s statement, the Congress wanted to raise certain issues which was not allowed by Speaker Om Birla. Unhappy with this, Congress walked out of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-attempt-to-unilaterally-alter-status-quo-not-acceptable-rajnath-singh/story-AwIBOlCf18mwlSnfLyWseO.html
15-09-2020||India||Centre may release 500 MT onions in select cities to check price||The government plans to release 500 metric tonnes (MT) of onions from its buffer stock to select cities that are facing up to 50% increase in the commodity’s rates and also planning more measures to tame its price during the upcoming festive months of October and November, three officials familiar of the matter said.The proposal is under consideration by the competent authority, the officials said requesting anonymity. The identified select places are located in the north-east region and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) along with cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune and Indore, they said.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Monday banned export of onions by putting the commodity under the “prohibited” list with immediate effect, which HT has reported. One of the officials said: “An inter-ministerial group has proposed to release 500 MT of buffer stocks of onion, which are approaching their end of shelf life. The supply will be meant for select cities that are experiencing the highest prices of the commodity.”However, the officials said the price rise is not uniform across the country. The retail price of the commodity jumped 33% to Rs 40 a kilogram (kg) in Delhi this week.“One of the reasons for a spike in onion prices is a surge in exports. In August, there had been steep increase in the export quantity. About 3 lakh MT of onion was exported in August, as compared to 1.26 lakh MT during the same period last year,” a second official. The price rise could be steeper in October and November, he added .“The move is to signal to the market about the government’s intervention to keep onion prices in check,” the official said. Onion prices in mandis have reported up to a 200% jump in September, as compared to 154% in August, the official added.The government is also concerned about the shortage of onion seeds in the rabi season, a third person said. “Among the five major onion-producing states, Maharashtra is experiencing a shortage of onion seeds to the tune of 505 MT,” he said.“There could be an overall 10% shortage of onion seeds for the ensuing rabi season in the country. However, in Maharashtra alone, the shortage is 30%. Nashik is facing the maximum shortfall of onion seeds,” he added.Plans are afoot to procure 200 MT of onion seeds from Gujarat and other parts of Maharashtra for supply to Nashik. Onion seeds could be imported from those countries that grow the commodity in abundance, he added. The sowing of onion will start from the last week of October.The export of onion was also banned last September due to supply constraints. The commodity’s price had soared to Rs 80 a kg last December in the national capital.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Singh said that during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, he has conveyed that Indian troops have always taken a responsible approach towards border management, but at the same time “there should be no doubt about our determination to protect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”The defence minister further said that the Chinese military had started increasing its presence in the region since April and was creating obstructions in the Indian forces’ patrolling. China’s People’ Liberation Army (PLA) made attempts to transgress LAC in May, their attempts were spotted and foiled in time by the Indian army, Singh said in the lower house of the Parliament. He added that during the Galwan clash on June 15 in which 20 soldiers sacrificed their lives, the army inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces. India and China have decided to resolve the issue peacefully as it is a “complex one” with both countries having different perceptions about the LAC, the minister said. “There are many agreements and protocols between both the countries to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border,” he added. Singh, however, said that violent conduct of Chinese troops is a violation of all past agreements and our troops have done counter deployments in the area to safeguard borders. “China continues to be in illegal occupation of approximately 38,000 sq kms in Ladakh. In addition, under the so-called Sino-Pakistan ‘Boundary Agreement’ of 1963, Pakistan illegally ceded 5,180 sq km of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to China,” the defence minister told the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/any-serious-situation-along-lac-will-impact-india-china-bilateral-ties-rajnath-singh/story-UolONAH3fqP7zpXNZAVYEJ.html
15-09-2020||India||China’s transgression attempts foiled in Ladakh: What Rajnath Singh said in Lok Sabha||Defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed Parliament on Tuesday on India’s ongoing border row with China and said that Beijing does not “recognise the current boundary”.Singh said that India’s armed forces have foiled the transgression attempts by China in Ladakh amid the standoff between the two countries at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). He was speaking in the Lok Sabha on the second day Monsoon Session of Parliament. He added that Indian soldiers have laid down their lives to ensure that Chinese designs are foiled pointing to the violent standoff at the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June this year, when 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed.Here are the highlights from his speech in the Lok Sabha:India and China agree that it is essential for the further development of bilateral relations to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border area.India and China border issue remains unresolved and there has been no mutually acceptable solution till. China disagrees on border.China does not recognise the traditional and customary alignment of the boundary. We consider that this alignment is based on well established geographical principals.We have told China through diplomatic channels that the attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo were in violation of the bilateral agreements.China has mobilised a huge number of army battalions and armaments along LAC and inner areas. There’re many friction points in eastern Ladakh, Gogra, Kongka La, Pangong Lake’s north and south banks. The Indian Army has made counter deployments in these areas.I want to assure you that we are ready to deal with any situation.In meeting with Chinese defence minister, I clearly stated that while our troops had always taken a responsible approach towards border management, but at same time there should be no doubt about our determination to protect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Violent conduct of Chinese troops is a violation of all past agreements. Our troops have done counter deployments in the area to safeguard our borders.I want to assure that the morale of our armed forces is high. No one should doubt it. The Prime Minister’s visit to Ladakh has sent a message that people of India stand behind Indian armed forces.I request this house to pass a resolution that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces who are guarding our borders to safeguard India’s sovereignty and integrity.The Chinese side created a violent face-off on June 15 at Galwan. Our brave soldiers laid down their lives and also inflicted costs including casualties on the Chinese side.We have faced situations of prolonged stand-offs in border areas with China in the past as well, which were resolved peacefully. Even though the situation this year is very different both in terms of scale of troops involved and number of friction points, we remain committed to a peaceful resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-transgression-attempts-foiled-in-ladakh-what-rajnath-singh-said-in-lok-sabha/story-nM7LXQPp9z4vnA9QsbFBYJ.html
15-09-2020||India||3, including a woman, lynched in Jharkhand; 2nd incident in 24 hours||Three people, including a woman, were lynched by villagers with sticks and sharp weapons after the trio allegedly strangled a man, who had opposed the illicit relationship of his wife, in Jharkhand’s Gumla district, around 100-km from capital Ranchi, police said on Tuesday.The incident took place in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday at Deragdih village under Sikoi Panchayat. This was the second incident of mob lynching within 24 hours in Gumla district. On Monday morning, a former member of the ultra outfit People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), was lynched by a mob of more than 80 villagers, including women with sticks, at Tesera village under Sadar police station in Gumla district.Police reached the village on Tuesday morning and sent all four bodies for post-mortem. The man, who was strangulated, was identified as Marianus Kujur, 42, while his wife was identified as Nilam Kujur, 35. The two other persons, who were allegedly in an illicit relationship with Marianus’ wife, could not be identified.The Gumla superintendent of police (SP) Hrudeep P Janardhanan said, “As per the villagers’ statement, the two youths who had come from other places had illicit relationship with Marianus’ wife. When they were killing Marianus, he screamed. Hearing his voice, his family members, relatives and villagers came and they killed the two youths and his wife.”Janardhanan said the two youths have not been identified yet. “We have recovered a moped bike on which they had come. The registration number of the bike is of Simdega district.”He said two FIRs would be lodged in the case-one for murdering Marianus, while another for killing three other persons by villagers. “We are identifying the villagers involved in the crime and arrests would be made soon,” he said. Marianus’ family members at the village said he was a migrant worker and returned from Pune just before the announcement of lockdown in March. They said his wife had developed an illicit relationship when her husband was not in the village. Marianus and his wife often had a dispute over her illicit relationship after he returned from Pune. The wife had called the youths to kill her husband, they alleged. Marianus’ younger brother’s wife Sarita Kujur said, “The two youths had come on a moped bike in late evening on Monday. When they were strangulating Marianus, he screamed loudly. Then, we all including the villagers ran to his house. But, by then Marianus had died. The youths tried to escape but villagers caught them and killed them along with Marianus’ wife with sticks and sharp weapons.” The mob lynching incidents in the state have hit the headlines nationally on several occasions. The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) has claimed that a total of 24 people were lynched in Jharkhand from March 2016 to June 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-including-a-woman-lynched-in-jharkhand-2nd-incident-in-24-hours/story-IIifbU2Gj9oZplLQA0VShL.html
15-09-2020||India||Supreme Court roasts Sudarshan TV for ‘insidious’ show on UPSC exam||The Supreme Court on Tuesday took strong exception to the television programme titled ‘Bindas Bol’ aired by news channel Sudarshan news relating to Muslims entering civil services which the channel had likened to “infiltration” and “Jihad”. A three-judge bench, headed by justice DY Chandrachud, said that the claims made by the channel were “insidious” and it also cast aspersions on the credibility of the UPSC exams and was a great disservice to the nation.“Here is one anchor who says one particular community is trying to infiltrate UPSC. Can anything be more insidious (than such claims). Such allegations affect the stability of the country and also cast aspersions on the credibility of the UPSC exam,” justice Chandrachud remarked.He said that every single person who applies for the UPSC goes through the same selection process and the insinuation that one community is trying to infiltrate civil services does great disservice to the nation.“In the UPSC exam, all are subjected to the same tests, interviews and are assessed by the same persons. But the insinuation is that one community is trying to infiltrate the UPSC. What you are doing does not do credit to our democratic system. Your client is doing great disservice to the nation. We are a melting pot of cultures,” Chandrachud told senior counsel Shyam Divan, who was appearing on behalf of Sudarshan news.Sudarshan news submitted that the programme raises an issue concerning national security and it is in public interest to bring out the story. “The programme is in adherence to programme code,” senior counsel Shyam Divan on behalf of Sudarshan news maintained. Divan also submitted that he was willing to supply copies of all episodes of the programme to the court so that the bench can decide whether or not the programme is in violation of law.The court was hearing a plea by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan who claimed that the programme contains derogatory statements about Muslim community and was divisive in nature. Justice KM Joseph, who was also on the bench, said that freedom granted to the media is not absolute and the manner in which certain television channels conduct news debates today left a lot to be desired.He asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Central government, to explore options on disclosing the shareholding pattern and revenue model of media houses on public domain. “Certain channels mute panellists when they express views which go against the anchor’s views. This is unfair. No freedom is absolute, not even journalistic freedom,” justice Joseph said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that freedom of a journalist is supreme and any regulation of the same would need extensive debates. The bench acknowledged that regulation of media outlets is a very difficult proposition. He however asked Sudarshan news to exercise freedom of speech with responsibility.Last week, the Centre allowed Sudarshan News to broadcast the show which claimed a ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’.Earlier, the top court on August 28 declined to impose a pre-broadcast ban on the news channel, saying it has to be cautious in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views and cannot prevent airing of a programme based on an unverified transcript of a 49-second clip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disservice-to-nation-supreme-court-on-sudarshan-tv-s-upsc-jihad-show/story-aB6PvweUHXCHxHQ5NndsPJ.html
15-09-2020||India||India inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces in June: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said India is committed to a peaceful resolution to the border stand-off with China even as it has conveyed to Beijing that attempts to forcibly alter the border between the two countries is unacceptable. He told Lok Sabha that until now, the two countries have not arrived at a mutually acceptable solution. Singh said Indian forces are determined to protect the country’s security and sovereignty and inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces when they clashed with them in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.Singh said the violent conduct by the Chinese along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between India and China, in violation of all bilateral agreements including those signed in 1993 and 1996.“China is not honouring the customary alignment of the boundary with India. The alignment has not only been defined by treaties but has been maintained historically.”He added China believes that the border is not defined and the issues between the two countries remain unresolved. Singh warned that any serious situation along the LAC is bound to impact bilateral ties.He said Indian forces will forcefully counter all Chinese aggressive action along the border and added there has been an increase in troops and weapons deployment along LAC in Ladakh since April. Singh added the Chinese side hindered the normal, traditional patrolling pattern of Indian troops in the Galwan Valley area. Singh said the Chinese made several attempts in mid-May to transgress the LAC into other parts of the Western Sector even as the ground commanders were addressing the situation as per the provisions of the bilateral agreements and protocol.“This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by our armed forces,” he said. “We made it clear to the Chinese side both through diplomatic and military channels that China was, by such actions, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. It was categorically conveyed that this was unacceptable.”The Congress and other Opposition parties have been critical of the government’s handling of the situation since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clash with Chinese troops in June and sought a debate on the issue. Congress lawmakers staged a walkout from the House after speaker Om Birla did not allow them to speak on the issue following Singh’s statement. They later protested in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the Parliament complex. Also Read: ‘Xi Jinping has risked his future with LAC incursions’: Report on China border rowSingh, who paid tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley, said the border issue is complex. He added the two countries have agreed to resolve it peacefully. “I want to assure you that we are ready to deal with any situation. I request this House to pass a resolution affirming that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces guarding our borders to safeguard India’s sovereignty and integrity.”He said India has conveyed to China through diplomatic channels that any “attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo were in violation” of the bilateral agreements. “Violent conduct of Chinese troops is a violation of all past agreements. Our troops have done counter deployments in the area to safeguard our borders.” There has been a spike in tensions along the LAC after both countries amassed more troops in the Ladakh sector. There have been face-offs on the south bank of Pangong Lake after provocative Chinese movements to change the status quo during August 29-30. India said during the latest face-off on September 7, Chinese soldiers fired in the air after being prevented from closing in on an Indian forward position. This is the first time that guns have been used along the LAC since 1975.Both sides have strengthened their military presence along the LAC by moving in additional troops, tanks, and other weaponry. India has positioned its troops on several strategic heights to prevent further land grabs on the south bank of the Pangong Lake.India and China last week finalised a five-point road map to address the standoff that includes disengagement of troops and easing of tensions. The consensus on the five points was reached during talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meet in Moscow on Thursday last.Also Read: Indian, Chinese top military commanders likely to meet this weekA joint statement issued on Friday said the ministers agreed that both sides should be guided by the consensus of the top leadership on developing India-China relations, “including not allowing differences to become disputes”. They agreed the situation on the LAC is not in the interest of either country. And “therefore...the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”. The two countries agreed that both sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”.The two sides will continue communicating through the Special Representatives mechanism, and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on border affairs. The ministers also agreed that “as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work to conclude new confidence-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquillity”.HT last week reported the Indian side highlighted its concern at the massing of Chinese troops and equipment along the LAC without any credible explanation, saying this violated the 1993 and 1996 agreements and created flashpoints.The five-point roadmap is a broad template for disengagement though differences remain on crucial issues such as how far the troops should be pulled back from the LAC. The Indian side has made it clear the ultimate goal should be to move forces back to their permanent posts, at least 20 km or more from the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-inflicted-heavy-casualties-on-chinese-forces-in-june-rajnath-singh/story-d337K2k0ifFgYFy5zXhW0H.html

They also came after actor Kangana Ranaut’s recent remarks calling Bollywood a “gutter”.Also read: Kangana Ranaut hits back, asks if Jaya Bachchan’s stance would change if her children were targeted Bachchan said during Zero Hour that the entertainment industry was being flogged by social media and asked the government to protect and support it.Here is what she said:* The Samajwadi Party MP said she completely disagrees with those who called the entertainment industry a “gutter”. “People who have made a name in this industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree and I really disassociate,” she said.* Bachchan said she was “really embarrassed and ashamed” in a reference to Kishan’s statement in the Lok Sabha on the alleged Bollywood drug cartel. “Jis thali mein khate hai usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai,” she said referring to a popular Hindi proverb that means to bite the hands that feed you.* She said the entertainment industry in the country provides direct employment to 500,000 people every day and indirect employment to 5 million people. “At a time when the financial situation is in a depressing state and employment rate at the worst levels, in order to divert the attention of people, we are being flogged by social media” and there is no support from the government, she said.* Bachchan said the government should come forward and support the entertainment industry. “I hope the government tells these people who have made their earning, name and fame in this industry to stop using such language,” she said. “There are people in the entertainment industry who are some of the highest taxpayers (in the country). They are still being harassed,” she said.* “I think the government must stand by the entertainment industry because it always comes forward to help the government in whatever good work it takes up. They come and speak for them, they support them. If there is a national calamity, they come forward, they give money and their services,” she said.* “I think it is very, very important that the government must support this industry and not kill it. Just because there are few people, you cannot tarnish the image of the entire industry,” she said, adding the industry brings international name and recognition besides a base for political ambitions.* “Sir, I get very worked up and very emotional. I have too many things to say but you are not giving me enough time and opportunity,” she told Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu. “I need protection, the industry needs the protection and support of the government,” she also said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biting-hands-that-feed-jaya-bachchan-hits-out-at-kangana-ravi-kishan/story-dHLHBSbIDsKqrlLlVjscsI.html
15-09-2020||India||AAP propped by BJP-RSS to bring down UPA government: Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement and blamed them as a proxy for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological mentor, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), in their bid to “subvert democracy” and bring down the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. Gandhi endorsed the remarks of AAP founder-member and civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who in an interview to a private TV news channel, has claimed that the IAC movement was “propped up” by the BJP and the RSS to bring down the Congress-led UPA government, whose rule had come to an end following the victory of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) dispensation in 2014 parliamentary elections. “What was known to us has been confirmed by a founding AAP member. The IAC movement and the AAP were propped up by the BJP and the RSS to subvert democracy and bring down the UPA government,” Gandhi tweeted. Gandhi is in the United States of America (USA), where his mother Sonia Gandhi is undergoing her medical check-up. Bhushan was expelled from the AAP in 2015 following his differences with Arvind Kejriwal, who became the chief minister of Delhi five years ago and now in his second term as the CM. The AAP had won a landslide victory in Delhi assembly polls in 2015 after it had bagged 67 out of 70 seats.The BJP had won the remaining three seats. While the Congress had drawn a blank. Five years on, the AAP retained its supremacy, as it won 62 seats in Delhi assembly polls held in February this year. The BJP wrested the remaining eight seats. Bhushan has cited two specific regrets in the interview. “In hindsight, there are two things that I do regret. One is not seeing that the movement (IAC), to a large extent, was supported and propped up by the BJP and the RSS for their own political purposes to bring down the UPA government and get themselves in power.” He added: “I have no doubt about their (RSS and BJP) role today. He (Anna Hazare) was also probably not aware of it. But Kejriwal was aware of it and I have little doubt about it. The second regret is that I had failed to understand Kejriwal’s character. I understood it too late by which time we had created another Frankenstein-like monster.” Besides Bhushan, another founder-member of the AAP and pollster Yogendra Yadav was also expelled allegedly over anti-party activities. The IAC movement was dominated by strong anti-corruption protests against the UPA government in 2011 and 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-bhushan-s-remarks-rahul-gandhi-says-aap-propped-by-bjp-rss-to-bring-down-upa-government/story-7A830BDAPMS62G9lp6iPdM.html

The social media giant said that matter falls within Centre’s purview.“The regulation of intermediaries like Facebook fall within exclusive authority of the Union of India. Given that the matters are under consideration by Parliament, we object to the Notice and request you recall it,” Facebook India said in its reply to Delhi assembly.A Delhi Assembly committee on peace and harmony has issued a notice to Facebook India vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan asking him to appear before it on September 15 in connection with complaints about the social media platform’s alleged deliberate and intentional inaction to contain hateful content in the country.The panel is headed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator from Rajendra Nagar, Raghav Chadha.“Facebook’s letter is in disregard of committee’s privilege. Facebook’s refusal to appear before the committee is an attempt to conceal crucial facts in relation to its role in Delhi riots. Fresh summons will be issued to it in line with principles of natural justice,” said Chadha.The notice was issued after the committee said that prima facie, it has found that Facebook was allegedly complicit in aggravating the February riots in north-east Delhi that left 53 dead and at least 400 injured. These primarily have to do with posts on its platform ahead of and during the rites.Meanwhile, former employee of Facebook said that a “politically-sophisticated” attempt to influence the Delhi elections in February played out on the social media platform before it was taken down silently. Former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang also cited examples in the memo of how the company has failed to act on time or with transparency in tackling attempts to undermine democratic processes around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-objects-to-delhi-assembly-notice-on-alleged-inaction-in-hate-speech-cases/story-RhD5IoGm3mPIV2qMelmqtK.html
15-09-2020||India||Covid-19: How different masks stop the virus||An experiment conducted by researchers from Duke University has found well-fitted valve-less N95 masks, triple-layer surgical masks and double-layer pleated cotton masks (that can be tied tightly) are the most effective in stopping the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). The researchers analysed 13 kinds of popularly used face masks to determine the best to stop the spread of the virus.The study was based on an experiment in which a person wore each of these face masks and spoke in the direction of an expanded laser beam inside a dark enclosure for 10 seconds. The speech was recorded on video, as well as the 20 seconds after the person stopped speaking.The researchers looked for microscopic droplets that are usual when someone speaks. As they went toward the laser beam, they scattered light, and these were recorded with a cell phone camera before a computer algorithm was used to count the droplets in the video. If this were a person infected with Covid-19, these droplets would likely be infectious.Also read: Battle against Covid-19 far from over, says Harsh Vardhan in ParliamentThe experiment showed well-fitted valve-less N95 masks, triple-layer surgical masks and double-layer pleated cotton masks let less than 15% of the droplets escape, when compared to the number of droplets generated when someone spoke without a face cover.Double-layer cotton masks were among masks that were a little less effective – though, at 20% transmission, they were still fairly effective.A bandana failed to stop half the droplets, while a fleece – thanks to the usual material they are made of – actually made droplets worse.

The host nation Qatar could have only made this possible after talking to all principal stake-holders in the Afghan dialogue, ” said a senior official.Pakistan is understood to have conveyed its concern over an Indian role at Doha to the parties concerned as Indian participation is now not restricted to only Kabul, instead New Delhi is a legitimate stake-holder in Afghan peace and reconciliation process.Over the past decade, New Delhi was reluctant to engage with the Taliban but with external affairs minister S Jaishankar himself addressing the inaugural session, this ambiguity has been removed with India ready to talk to both sides. An ultra-conservative Sunni movement, the Taliban leadership is based in Quetta across the Bolan Pass, and its deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani leads the proscribed Haqqani Network. Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada is a cleric and Haqqani is the sword arm of the insurgent group.Zalmay Khalilzad, the US Representative for Afghan Reconciliation, is meeting external affairs minister Jaishankar around 3.30 pm today to brief the Modi government about the way forward to the Afghan peace, elections and the expectations from India. A Pashtun himself, Khalilzad will be arriving from Islamabad.Addressing the inaugural session, EAM Jaishankar had advocated for a ceasefire between warring parties in Afghanistan and sought commitment from both Afghan government and the Taliban representative that Afghan soil would not be used for anti-India activities. The second part referred to the presence of Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Tayyeba terrorist training camps across both Khyber and Bolan pass.Also Read: Seize the opportunity, says UK on Afghan-Taliban peace talksWhile India understands the US desire to get out of Afghanistan after 19 long years of counter-insurgency and policing, it is concerned about the rise in violence once the Americans exit out of Kabul with only a representative force of 4,700 available after elections.However, the positive sign in Doha was the presence of both Afghan Government and the Taliban on the same table and the willingness to talk with each other. This raises hopes that Taliban may take the election route this time and not go for military take-over of Kabul once the US exits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sheds-reluctance-in-engaging-taliban-at-the-doha-intra-afghan-talks/story-JjalNUPrIRqqnZLo5bcbAO.html
15-09-2020||India||Bengal govt moves green court NGT to allow Chhath puja at Kolkata lake||The Kolkata Municipal Development Authority (KMDA) has appealed to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to relax its order banning Chhath puja rituals to be held at the famous Rabindra Sarobar Lakes in south Kolkata. The NGT will hear the review petition on September 17.The word Chhath means six. The festival is dedicated to Lord Surya (Sun God) and Chhathi Maiya, who is known to be the sister of Lord Surya. This festival is unique to the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi. Devotees express their gratitude towards Lord Surya and perform important rituals over a for a span of four days. While the opposition sees this as another move by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to woo Hindi-speaking voters prior to the 2021 assembly polls, environment activists and conservation experts said they are extremely worried. The NGT passed an order in 2018, banning Chhath puja at Rabindra Sarobar, after environment activists and wildlife lovers started a movement. The petition was moved by noted environment activist Subhas Dutta. The green activists had earlier moved the Calcutta high court as well to stop the old practice.Covering 192 acres of artificial lakes and with 7,000 trees, some of which were badly damaged by cyclone Amphan in May, Rabindra Sarobar is a birders’ paradise. At least 200 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted here by the city’s birders. It is also home to numerous types of fish and animals. Despite the ban, hundreds of devotees broke open the gates of Rabindra Sarobar in November 2019 to perform Chhath puja. They even used crackers and played drums at the Sarobar although the government has earmarked alternative waterbodies in the city. The incident made headlines and triggered a huge controversy. “It is very difficult to control the religious sentiments of people. The police could not take any harsh measure because the rituals are performed by women. We have appealed to the NGT to relax the ban this year. The puja will be held on November 20,” a senior KMDA official said on condition of anonymity. “This is shocking. How can the government allow nature to be destroyed?” said veteran environment activist Banani Kakkar whose organization, PUBLIC, has been crusading for a greener city for more than three decades. “There is very little time to move the NGT against the KMDA’s review petition,” she added. Declared as a site of national importance Rabindra Sarobar was developed by the British in the 1920s as one of the twin lungs of Kolkata, the other being the Maidans. Bird species sighted here include cotton pygmy goose, large-billed leaf warbler, Tickell’s leaf warbler, black-headed cuckooshrike and slaty-blue flycatcher, among others. No TMC leader was willing to comment on the development on record. Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit vice-president Ritesh Tiwari took a dig at chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “It has taken her nine years to understand the sentiments of Hindi-speaking people. But it is too late now. Why didn’t the government take action when some outfits were making insulting remarks against Hindi-speaking people in public in recent years?” said Tiwari. Incidentally, on Monday, the TMC launched an all-new three-tier Hindi cell while India observed Hindi Diwas. The cell will have separate committees at state, district and community block levels. The BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 seats to 22. The BJP poses a challenge to Banerjee in the upcoming assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-moves-green-court-ngt-to-allow-chhath-puja-at-kolkata-lake/story-QeXxVOaaAKeSsrRKv4lzaN.html

In a special mention made in the Upper House, Trinamool Congress leader Shantanu Sen said the term ‘social distancing’ is regularly used to avoid the spread of coronavirus.    “Actually, it is physical distancing of nearly six feet between two persons. On the contrary, the use of the term social distancing has promoted social stigma which has led to nearly an attitude of boycotting of COVID patients socially,” he said.  As a consequence of this, Covid-19 patients and their families are facing several “inhuman situations”, he said.Sen further said, “To stop social discrimination   and social stigma, the term social distancing should not be used any more to fight Covid-19.

15-09-2020||India||Odisha govt tells officials not to rush Covid cases to Bhubaneswar||With Covid hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack groaning under growing cases, the Odisha government has asked districts to not rush their Covid patients to hospitals in these cities.“The Covid hospitals of Bhubaneswar are being used by all other districts as referral hospitals. The facility available in the cluster district will be exhausted first before deciding to shift it to Bhubaneswar. The medical officer of the district will inform the medical officer of the Covid hospitals of Bhubaneswar and obtain confirmation about the availability of the requisite facility needed before sending the patient to Bhubaneswar,” development commissioner Suresh Mohapatra noted in a letter to senior officials in charge of Covid management in the state.Mohapatra, who last week chaired a meeting of top health officials to analyse the situation, told the officials that the available Covid-care facilities at district level must be utilised to the fullest extent before referring the patient to the Covid hospitals of Bhubaneswar.With 4613 active cases in Bhubaneswar and 2213 cases in Cuttack city till Monday, the twin cities have now become Covid hotspots while the hospitals in the two cities are struggling to admit new patients. With just six ICU beds left in Covid hospitals of Bhubaneswar, it remains a challenge.What has made the Covid situation in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack difficult is the rush of patients to the Covid hospitals there from other hotspot districts such as Puri, Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Kendrapara and Jajpur due to perceived better care and management.In Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, just about 20 per cent of the beds are occupied by patients from both the cities while the rest have been taken over by people from other districts.Mohapatra has now instructed the officials that Covid hospitals should only be for moderately severe symptomatic patients and those who are asymptomatic and very mild to mild symptomatic cases should be in home isolation.“The facility of home isolation needs to be promoted further and asymptomatic and very mild to mild symptomatic cases should invariably be allowed for home isolation. The Covid hospitals should only house moderate to severe symptomatic cases,” the letter from Mohapatra said.To lessen the Covid load on the capital city, the government asked KIMS hospital that has set up Covid hospitals at Bolangir, Mayurbhanj and Kandhamal districts to make functional lCUs available.The government has also asked the Covid hospitals in Bhubaneswar to convert some of the general beds to high dependency unit (HDU) beds for shifting stable patients from ICU to HDU thus increasing availability of ICU beds for deserving critical patients.The government has also decided on a new discharge protocol under which a Covid patient would be clinically discharged after 10 days from the date of sample collection provided he has no symptoms for the last three days. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has been asked to prepare the list of such patients on 9th day district wise and post the same in the Collectors’ WhatsApp group. The respective district collectors would have to pick those cured cases on the 10th day from the respective Covid Hospitals of Bhubaneswar.To deal with allegations of negligence of doctors and paramedics in treatment of Covid patients, the government also asked the authorities at Covid hospitals to install CCTVs in their ICU and general wards for close monitoring of doctors and paramedics. It also asked the laboratories doing RT-PCR tests to mention the CT (Cycle Threshold) value in each of the positive samples so that the viral load in each case can be tested. As the CT value determines the viral load of the positive cases, those patients with lower CT value (meaning higher viral load) can be prioritised for admission in Covid hospitals.Meanwhile, health secretary PK Mohapatra, asked all district collectors and Municipal Commissioners to shut down the temporary medical centres, Covid care homes and Covid care centres in the districts where the occupancy has dramatically fallen. The state government also asked all private hospitals in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Rourkela Municipal to keep a minimum 50% of their general beds and 80% of ICUs for treatment of Covid positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-tells-officials-not-to-rush-covid-cases-to-bhubaneswar/story-GXa7l2YRlFCR828dQf72KO.html
15-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: What to expect today||Fireworks are expected in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the second day of Parliament’s monsoon session as the government wants to push two contentious legislation to replace ordinances. Also, defence minister Rajnath Singh will make a statement on the “developments on our borders in Ladakh”, a key area of concern for the Opposition.It was not immediately clear if Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla would allow a debate on the issue after Singh makes the statement. The Congress and other Opposition parties have been critical of the government’s stand on the border conflict that escalated after the clash in the Galwan Valley in June that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Also Read: DMK MP raises NEET exam issue in Rajya SabhaSingh will make the statement as top Indian and Chinese military commanders are likely to meet along the contested Line of Actual Control this week to reduce tensions in Ladakh, where the situation remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area.Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. The expected meeting this week will be their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi attacks Modi govt over deaths of migrant workersThe legislative business is likely to trigger protests over the two bills that have been brought to replace ordinances. The Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill seeks to replace an ordinance issued to reduce the salaries of lawmakers by 30% in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme fund, too, has been cancelled for two years (2020-2022).The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill to be introduced on Tuesday in the Lok Sabha is another bone of contention between the Opposition and the ruling side. The Congress has raised five major objections to the proposed law. It has said cooperative banks are part of the structure of cooperatives and ought to be regulated by the state governments, not by the Centre. “If the ordinance becomes law, all key financial intermediaries will come under the control of the Central government, there will be more centralisation. Congress Party stands for decentralisation and for empowering states,” the party said in a statement.Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan will introduce the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.In Rajya Sabha, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will introduce a bill to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.In Rajya Sabha, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will introduce a Bill to provide for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals, assessment of institutions, maintenance of a Central Register and State Register, and creation of a system to improve access, research and development and adoption of latest scientific advancement.The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill and the Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Bill are also expected to be passed in the Upper House on Tuesday along with the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-what-to-expect-today/story-3y2JdzOLCh21WgIecGIsFM.html

15-09-2020||India||‘Politically-sophisticated’ attempt to influence Delhi elections on Facebook before it was taken down: Ex employee||A “politically-sophisticated” attempt to influence the Delhi elections in February played out on Facebook before it was taken down silently, a recently fired employee of the social media company has said in a memo. Former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang has also cited examples in the memo of how the company has failed to act on time or with transparency in tackling attempts to undermine democratic processes around the world.American digital media outlet BuzzFeed News accessed the memo and reported about it late on Monday. The memo cites instances of alleged influence operations by political parties in Azerbaijan and Honduras, and similar but unattributed campaigns in Ukraine, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador, in addition to India.Also Read: Hate speech complaints: Delhi Assembly panel summons Facebook official“I worked through sickness to take down a politically-sophisticated network of more than a thousand actors working to influence the election,” Zhang wrote in the 6,600-word memo, according to the BuzzFeed report. It added Facebook did not report the takedown officially.Zhang, who did not specify who was behind the attempt, was with Facebook’s Site Integrity fake engagement team. “In the three years I’ve spent at Facebook, I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions,” she wrote in the memo.Also Read: Plea in Supreme Court over data protection in UPI platformsThe disclosure adds to questions of transparency in how the social media company acts on problematic content, which includes hate speech and fake information that has been proven to succeed in influencing elections. It also spotlights the problem of who takes these calls, which in Zhang’s case appeared to be a mid-level employee.“There was so much violating behaviour worldwide that it was left to my personal assessment of which cases to further investigate, to file tasks, and escalate for prioritization afterwards,” she wrote in the memo.The BuzzFeed News report is the third since the August 14 story by the Wall Street Journal that first detailed how Facebook struggles to manage content on its website, especially those involving politicians.Facebook India’s policy team members personally intervened to halt action against a Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party leader, citing a potential risk to the company’s commercial interests in the country, the first report said.Facebook has since banned the politician and denied that it acted in a biased manner. The company is being investigated by a parliamentary and Delhi legislative assembly committees.Zhang suggested Facebook has a pattern of prioritising such problems only when they turn into a publicity issue for the company. “It’s why I’ve seen priorities of escalations shoot up when others start threatening to go to the press, and why I was informed by a leader in my organization that my civic work was not impactful under the rationale that if the problems were meaningful they would have attracted attention, became a press fire, and convinced the company to devote more attention to space.”It was not clear why Zhang was fired, but the report noted that she had turned down a $64,000 severance to avoid a no-disparagement deal.The Buzzfeed News report did not carry a reaction from the company.The misinformation campaigns in Honduras and Azerbaijan appeared to be the most serious Zhang was involved in responding to. Facebook took nine months to act on the Honduras attempt, and responded close to a year after the Azerbaijan campaign was flagged, the report added.A Facebook company spokesperson said they have built specialised teams, working with leading experts, to stop bad actors from abusing their systems. “[The teams have resulted] in the removal of more than 100 networks for coordinated inauthentic behaviour.” The spokesperson said it is a highly involved work that these teams do as their full-time remit. “Working against coordinated inauthentic behaviour is our priority, but we are also addressing the problems of spam and fake engagement. We investigate each issue carefully, including those that Ms Zhang raises, before we take action or go out and make claims publicly as a company.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politically-sophisticated-attempt-to-influence-delhi-elections-on-facebook-before-it-was-taken-down-ex-employee/story-xb85vKHU3hT4HUs5GHhisN.html
15-09-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi attacks Modi govt over deaths of migrant workers||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked the government for stating in Parliament on Monday -- the first day of the 18-day uninterrupted monsoon session -- that it did not know how many migrant workers had died during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown while returning to their native places. “Modi government does not know how many migrant workers died or how many people lost their jobs during the lockdown,” he tweeted in Hindi. “You didn’t count so what, nobody died? Yes, but it is unfortunate that there was no impact on the government. The world saw them dying but the Modi government remained clueless,” Gandhi added. मोदी सरकार नहीं जानती कि लॉकडाउन में कितने प्रवासी मज़दूर मरे और कितनी नौकरियाँ गयीं।तुमने ना गिना तो क्या मौत ना हुई?हाँ मगर दुख है सरकार पे असर ना हुई,उनका मरना देखा ज़माने ने,एक मोदी सरकार है जिसे ख़बर ना हुई।In reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state (MoS) for labour and employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar had said on Monday that the government did not have any record of deaths of migrant workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. “No such data was maintained,” the minister had said in the written reply. In reply to another question, Gangwar had said the government did not have any assessment of job losses of migrant labourers during the viral outbreak. When asked “whether the government has provided any compensation/economic assistance to victims’ families,” the government had said, “the question does not arise”, since it had no records in the first place. However, on the total number of migrants who had returned to their home states, the minister presented state-wise data and said, “More than 630,7000 migrants shifted to various destinations during the Covid-19 pandemic. While 4611 Shramik Special Trains were run to ferry the migrant returnees.” According to an estimate, 122 million people have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Around 75% of these were small traders and daily-wage labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-modi-govt-over-deaths-of-migrant-workers/story-lXnsInhRqiEkzF2DQVnk9H.html

15-09-2020||India||TV9 former CEO Ravi Prakash moves tribunal to buy majority stake in company||V Ravi Prakash, former chief executive officer of popular multilingual television channel TV9, on Monday moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Hyderabad seeking to take over the channel management – Associated Broadcasting Company Private Limited (ABCL) by buying majority stake in it.Ravi Prakash, who was founder-director of ABCL was sacked as director and CEO on May 10 last year for allegedly cheating the company promoters.The company, which was originally promoted by Srini Raju of iLabs, was acquired by Alanda Media and Entertainment Limited, jointly promoted by real estate major My Home Group and construction giant Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL) which bought 90.54% of shares.Ravi Prakash, however, still owns a minor stake of 8.82 per cent in the company, though he was sacked from the board. On October 5 last, he was later arrested by the Banjara Hills police in Hyderabad in connection with alleged siphoning off Rs 18.31 crore from the company and was released on bail on October 26.In his latest petition in the NCLT, Ravi Prakash said the TV9 channel had run into losses ever since the new management took over the company. The company’s valuation report prepared in August 2020 stated that the present share value of the company in the market is Rs 78.32 per share, as against Rs 252 per share when it was taken over by the new management, he said.“The profit after taxes of the company which was Rs 16.78 crore for 2018-19 went down to a loss of Rs 56.09 crore at the end of 2019-20 financial year. For 2020-21, the company projected a loss of Rs 58.78 crore,” Ravi Prakash pointed out, adding that the projections indicate that the company does not foresee any positive results for the next four years.In an attempt to have an amicable settlement with the new management, the former CEO said he had proposed to sell his minor stake of 20 lakh shares in the company at the original rate of Rs 252 per share, but the management offered to buy the same only at Rs 78.32 per share as per the market value.“What is worse, the management claimed that I was holding only 5 lakh fully paid-up equity shares and the remaining 15 lakh shares were only partly paid-up shares. In fact, the previous board of management on May 6, 2019, had resolved to convert these 15 lakh shares into fully paid-up shares and I had even paid Rs 1.35 crore for the same. The board resolutions and payment details were sent to the Registrar of Companies and Union ministry of corporate affairs,” Ravi Prakash said.He said now that the company itself had projected in its valuation report that the share value had come down to Rs 78.32, he requested the NCLT to allow him to take over the majority stake in the company at this price, since the present management had pushed the profit-making company into losses.When contacted, a top executive of the ABCL, who preferred not to be quoted, said there was absolutely no merit in the petition filed by Ravi Prakash before the NCLT. “When nobody in the company is willing to sell his stakes, where is the question of Ravi Prakash buying them, let alone taking over the management?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tv9-former-ceo-ravi-prakash-moves-tribunal-to-buy-majority-stake-in-company/story-UUnmUnpiSZxfAZAch1oQSP.html

15-09-2020||India||Netflix argues for free speech in court spat with Indian tycoons over ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’||An Indian court’s decision to stall the release of a Netflix Inc series on four Indian tycoons facing fraud allegations “freezes free speech” and hurts the company financially, the U.S. streaming giant has argued in a court filing seen by Reuters.“Bad Boy Billionaires” is a documentary series about liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya, Sahara group’s Subrata Roy, Indian IT executive Ramalinga Raju and jeweller Nirav Modi. Netflix put the show on hold this month on order of a state court where Sahara alleged violation of Roy’s privacy rights.Roy is currently on bail in a case where he was ordered by court to repay billions of dollars to investors in a scheme which was found to be illegal. Roy denied wrongdoing in the case and has already repaid investors, his counsel said.Arguing for free speech in an appeal at the High Court of eastern Bihar state, Netflix said the docuseries was an assimilation of information available in public domain. The filing has not previously been reported.The pre-publication injunction granted by the court “freezes free speech,” Netflix said in the filing earlier this month, which was reviewed by Reuters. It argued it has a right to free speech “on a matter of public interest.”Some Netflix shows in India have faced court challenges and police complaints for obscenity or for hurting sentiments. The ongoing legal spat is among the most high-profile ones Netflix has faced in India, one of its key growth markets.The court in Bihar that gave the injunction earlier had said the series “would certainly damage the reputation” of Roy. Sahara and Netflix declined to comment. Roy could not be reached for comment.The U.S. streaming giant has argued it had invested large sums and done worldwide publicity on the series. The injunction, Netflix argued, resulted in irreparable monetary loss, as well as affected its goodwill and reputation.Netflix describes “Bad Boy Billionaires” as an “investigative docuseries (which) explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India’s most infamous tycoons.”Netflix is locked in a legal spat not just with Sahara, but also another businessman Raju whose story was to appear in the series.Raju, accused of a $1-billion accounting fraud more than a decade ago, had secured a separate state court order against the show’s release, but Netflix has challenged it in a higher court, said A. Venkatesh, a lawyer representing Raju.Raju will continue to argue against the show’s release, said Venkatesh.Both Netflix’s appeals are likely to be heard in coming days. It was not clear if the other two tycoons - Modi and Mallya - have filed petitions against the release of the series.Modi is facing extradition attempts by India after his arrest in London last year over his alleged involvement in a $2 billion bank fraud. Mallya, too, is in Britain fighting India’s extradition bid for alleged fraud at his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.Modi and Mallya have denied any wrongdoing.Zulfiquar Memon of Indian law firm MZM Legal, who is part of team representing Modi in his extradition case, said they hadn’t filed any case to halt the release of the series, but were “sitting on the fence” tracking the ongoing proceedings.A lawyer for Mallya could not immediately be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netflix-argues-for-free-speech-in-court-spat-with-indian-tycoons-over-bad-boy-billionaires/story-3IfwF5eXG3Pnx0JJsffHzH.html

A first information report (FIR) was filed against Guruashish Constructions Private (Pvt) Limited (Ltd), a subsidiary of HDIL, in March 2018 on the basis of a complaint by Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). Also read: PMC Bank fraud case: Shift HDIL’s Rakesh Wadhawan to govt hospital, says PMLA courtWadhawan was lodged in Arthur Road Jail after he was arrested in October 2019 along with his father and others by the EOW in connection with the Rs 6,337-crore fraud at the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank.“We have arrested Sarang Wadhwan to investigate the Patra Chawl redevelopment fraud case. He will be produced in court on Tuesday,” said an EOW official.Wadhawan is one of the directors of Guruashish Constructions. He was booked along with other directors of the firm, under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in March, 2018 on the basis of the complaint by MHADA.In February Pravin Raut, also a director in the company, was arrested by EOW. EOW suspects that MHADA officials, who had held key posts in 2011, were hand-in-glove with the accused and their role will also be probed. The redevelopment of Patra Chawl in Siddharth Nagar has been mired in controversy since the beginning. In 2007, MHADA had allowed Guruashish Constructions to redevelop the chawl spread over 47 acres and rehabilitate its 672 tenants. However, later, MHADA received complaints that Guruashish Constructions had sold the project to another developer. The charge was denied by the firm’s directors.In lieu of the development rights of the property, Guruashish Constructions was to give 767 square (sq) feet (ft) built-up area flats to each of the 672 tenants and 2,28,961 sq ft constructed area to MHADA. The accused developer also stopped paying transit rent to the displaced tenants after two years.“The developer disposed of various parcels of MHADA land for construction of free sale component buildings to various third party developers without obtaining consent from the authorty and received substantial amounts of money, running into thousands of crores of rupees. The third party developers have sold flats in the free sale component to various purchasers and have also received substantial amounts of money,” Nitin Gadkari, executive engineer, MHADA, had alleged in the complaint.“Guruashish Constructions allegedly breached the trust and sub-contracted the redevelopment to two-three other developers. The accused not only sublet the contract, but also mortgaged the property to take loan, while keeping MHADA in the dark,” said another official.In January, 2018 Guruashish Constructions was given the last opportunity to clarify its alleged irregularities by February 15. An FIR was filed because it had failed to respond to the notice before the deadline expired, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eow-arrests-hdil-promoter-sarang-wadhwan-in-rs-1-034-crore-scam/story-Ft0zh7eal5BOwRisZM5uOI.html

Along with the state government officers, the board would also include transgender representatives and the members of the social organisations working for the welfare of the transgenders,” a state government official said. He said the transgender welfare board will identify transgenders across UP, enlist them, issue identity cards, get them enrolled in educational institutions, provide them accommodation under various hostel and housing schemes of the state government and launch welfare schemes for the community. The UP Kinnar Akhada Parishad had demanded for the constitution of the transgender welfare board after the Supreme Court in its order in 2014 recognised transgender as the third gender. The Central government’s expert committee had directed the UP government to constitute a welfare board for transgenders, he said. In March 2019, the State Law Commission, in a proposal submitted to the government, had raised the demand for a law acknowledging the inheritance rights of the ‘third gender’. The commission’s chairman justice AN Mittal had drawn attention of the government towards the inheritance laws that missed the transgenders. During the monsoon session, the legislative assembly passed the UP Revenue Code Bill, 2020 to allow the transgender people in the state to inherit ancestral agriculture land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-to-set-up-transgender-welfare-board/story-EqGsbBU3BnlBIeT6hWJ1lK.html

The accused reportedly threatened the girl of consequences if she informed anyone. Apparently, this is why the girl did not inform her family members about it.”The local police acted after the video went viral and an FIR was filed in the matter. Teams from four police stations were deployed on the case. The police detained one of the accused.“We have detained one of the accused and our teams are raiding possible hideouts of the remaining accused. All the accused are adults and are of the same area. Efforts are also being made to prevent further circulation of the video online,” the police officer said.According to locals, five men surrounded the girl when she was on her way back from a market. They took her to a secluded spot near the village and gang-raped her. They also shot a video of the act and threatened the girl that they would make it go viral if she told anyone about the incident. The girl will be taken for a medical examination on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-year-old-gang-raped-in-up-case-filed-after-clip-is-shared-online/story-6hgynB4nD0hT1NCJyzt72O.html
15-09-2020||India||‘Xi Jinping has risked his future with LAC incursions’: Report on China border row||China’s failure to push around the Indian troops in the Line of Actual Control (LAC) means that the ability of Chinese President Xi Jinping to intimidate anyone has reduced.In an opinion article for Newsweek written by Gordon G Chang, a lawyer and commentator, the Chinese President has risked his future with the failed high-profile incursions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into more areas of the LAC, the border between India and China.The writer says that Xi is the “architect” of these aggressive moves into India and the Chinese troops have unexpectedly flopped. Also Watch | China defends Pakistan after India & US call for action against terrorThe failures of the Chinese Army at the LAC will have consequences and will give Xi an excuse to pick up the pace of replacing adversaries in the armed forces with loyal elements.Also read: China invokes 1962 war to put India on a defensive. It won’t work | AnalysisHowever, these failures motivate Xi, who as chairman of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Military Commission, is the leader of the PLA, to renew his bid to launch another offensive against Indian positions.In early May, Chinese troops advanced south of the LAC in three separate areas in Ladakh. With the boundary poorly demarcated, Chinese forces have trespassed into Indian positions for years, especially after Xi was appointed the party’s general secretary in 2012.Cleo Paskal of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told Newsweek that large-scale manoeuvres in Tibet were not preparations for such a move.In June, China and India were engaged in a violent face-off in Galwan Valley. Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers in a premeditated move and the clash was the first deadly confrontation between the two countries in 45 years.While the Chinese side is thought to have suffered 43 casualties in the Galwan face-off, the number could exceed 60, according to Paskal.Late last month, for the first time in a half-century, India launched an offensive against China, taking back strategic points the Chinese recently grabbed. The offensive took the Chinese forces aback and they retreated.Chang, the writer, says that China’s subsequent efforts to counter India has proved ineffective. For now, Indian troops, in the southernmost of the three areas of Ladakh, are under its control, which was once in Chinese hands.“India is not giving the invaders the opportunity to improve. Both sides have just accused the other of violating decades-old rules of engagement by firing warning shots. It appears, however, the Chinese are the ones closer to the truth: India’s troops are displaying newfound boldness,” the author says.“The game has changed. You can say the Indians are more aggressive or more aggressively defensive, but they are in fact bolder and better,” Paskal told Newsweek.According to Jayadeva Ranade, a former senior Indian intelligence official and now head of the New Delhi-based Centre for China Analysis and Strategy, Xi who has now faced a setback, now needs a “victory” and could force further conflict in Ladakh.Richard Fisher of the Virginia-based International Assessment and Strategy Center told Newsweek that the Chinese, in that conflict, could roll out “joint mechanised warfare for which they have been preparing for 30 years.”With the rapid buildup of Indian forces and their high-state of readiness, Xi is not assured of the success he needs, especially as India has brought its own mechanised vehicles to Ladakh, according to Ranade.“PLA leaders begin to see little choice but to undertake offensive military actions to avoid becoming a victim of Xi’s internal terror,” Fisher says.“What we are learning in 2020 is that Xi wants victories, and as the PLA is judged to have reached requisite levels of strength by rearming and reorganization, Xi is increasingly willing to use the military,” Fisher adds.Xi has shown that he is good at the political mobilisation of the army and can spend huge amount on military equipment. He has also perfected the art of intimidating other countries. However, the Chinese President has yet to show his military in a fight and is worth a damn.“Unfortunately, it looks like China’s leader, who had looked invincible, now has something to prove. As a result, he appears absolutely determined to make his point by launching another attempt to break India apart,” Chang says adding that other countries will take cognisance that Chinese military is deficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/xi-jinping-has-risked-his-future-with-lac-incursions-report-on-china-border-row/story-exbuosBi7PhN6HWQWYi8hP.html

Public Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar and others also attended the meeting, an official statement said.The chief minister said the government machinery has been working round-the-clock over the past five-six months to tackle the disease, but the challenge is not yet over, it said.Thackeray said the government was unlocking the state in a staggered manner and that living with the novel coronavirus is reality now.“Ensuring that no one gets infected by the disease is the key mantra and our squads will reach out to households to inform people on this,” the statement quoted Thackeray as saying.In the first phase of the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ initiative, the government has set a target of reaching 2.25 crore families twice a month, for which help of NGOs and elected representatives will be taken.Volunteers will be appointed by the health department for undertaking a door-to-door survey and test temperature and oxygen levels of people.The teams will trace suspected Covid-19 patients and those suffering from other ailments, as per the government.The first phase of the campaign will end on October 10 and the second phase will take place between October 12 to 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-my-family-my-responsibility-campaign-to-tackle-covid-19-rolls-out-from-today/story-ljb1BFm8dAIYsIRx43CTQK.html
15-09-2020||India||Umar Khalid in 10-day custody, police to show him 1.1mn pages of data||A Delhi court on Monday sent former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid to 10 days in police custody,a day after his arrest under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA, for his alleged role in a conspiracy behind the February riots in the national capital’s north-east district.Khalid’s counsel Trideep Pais told the court that his client was not in Delhi between February 23 and 26, when the riots took place; that he was opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and not ashamed of his stand; and that the police were yet to produce evidence that Khalid had incited the protests.The court accepted the police’s remand application on the grounds that the 33-year-old has to be confronted with a huge volume of technical data, and that he should be sent to custody so that an effective investigation can be carried out.Several activists and civil society members have opposed Khalid’s arrest on allegedly flimsy grounds, and have demanded to know why the police have taken no action against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra, who was seen giving an inflammatory speech in north-east Delhi a day before the violence broke out on February 24.They also asked why other BJP leaders were not booked for speeches delivered during the run up to the Delhi elections just weeks before the riots.Nine retired IPS officers on Monday wrote to Delhi’s police commissioner SN Srivastava saying they were “pained” at police implicating anti-CAA protesters while “letting off the hook all those who instigated violence and are associated by the ruling party”. Though the letter did not mention any names, BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma were criticised at the time for speeches and slogans ahead of the Delhi elections. Mishra, who denies all charges, on Monday released a video congratulating the police for arresting Khalid and “people like him”, and likened the riots with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Delhi Police produced Khalid before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat in a virtual hearing of the Karkardooma court on Monday afternoon. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad said Khalid had to be confronted with documents that run into nearly 1.1 million pages and “huge technical data”. The judge allowed Khalid’s counsel to interact with his client for half-an-hour every day, while asking police officers to remain outside the audible range during the meetings. He also directed a deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to make arrangements for ensuring Khalid’s safety and security during the police remand after Pais raised concern over the safety of his client in case he is taken out of the police station.Fifty-three people were killed and around 400 injured in the north-east Delhi riots, which started as clashes between pro- and anti-CAA and protestors before acquiring a communal colour. The police contended that an examination of witnesses revealed that Khalid was coordinating between protest sites in Delhi in connivance with other radical groups. “Further interrogation is needed in order to unearth deep-rooted conspiracy and to collect clinching evidence to nab/arrest the remaining conspirators behind these riots During the course of investigation, names of some more suspects have also cropped up and above named accused are required to be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars for further investigation,” the police remand application said.Khalid was arrested at around 11pm on Sunday after 10 hours of questioning. He was arrested in a case registered by the special cell of Delhi Police that is probing a suspected larger conspiracy behind the Delhi riots. The case has been registered under stringent Sections, including 13, 16, 17 and 18 of the UAPA that pertain to unlawful activities, terrorist acts, raising funds for terrorist acts and conspiracy.‘Planned riots’In the same case, police have arrested at least 11 others, including former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor former Tahir Hussain, activists Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar and Gufisha Khatoon, who are students of Jamia Millia Islamia, and Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, both JNU students and members of the women’s collective Pinjra Tod. The police also alleged: “The riots were planned to be happened during or prior to the visit of US President Donald Trump in February 2020.” “My son was targeted for participating in the protests held against the CAA and National Register of Citizens across the country,” Khalid’s father, Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas said.Khalid has been named in multiple first information reports (FIRs) and charge sheets filed by police in the riots cases. Police have alleged that Khalid orchestrated the riots along with AAP councillor Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi, a member of the United Against Hate group. In least four charge sheets filed in city courts, the police have said that Khalid met the two men at the Shaheen Bagh protest site on January 8, during which they discussed a plan to orchestrate the riots. In a twitter post, advocate Prashant Bhushan criticised Delhi Police for arresting Khalid but not acting against Kapil Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/umar-khalid-in-10-day-custody-police-to-show-him-1-1mn-pages-of-data/story-AswCCMo8FIzyA65C6SOsFI.html
15-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The much-delayed release last week of detailed data from an antibody prevalence study conducted in May by the Indian Council of Medical Research has resulted in a flurry of projections on the actual number of coronavirus disease cases in India. The study, whose headline results were reported in June (by the HT newsroom and a few others) showed a prevalence of 0.73% among adults, translating into around 6.5 million infections.This number isn’t cause for alarm as some suggest.Similar surveys conducted since have shown that the prevalence in large urban centres could be as high as 20%. Antibody prevalence surveys for some parts of rural India are available, but the sample sizes are far too small for the results to be taken seriously. Still, based on the 20% number, it can be safely assumed that around 15% of the urban population, and 5%-7.5% of the rural population (a third to half the urban proportion) has been exposed to the virus.Also read: Delhi Metro now puts floor stickers to ensure social distancingAssuming a rural population of 850 million and an urban one of 450 million, this translates into 67.5 million cases in urban India, and between 42.5 and 63.75 million cases in rural India — a total of between 110 million and 131.25 million cases.This number, too, isn’t cause for alarm.It is now widely accepted that around 40% of the people infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 do not show any symptoms. And that many of the others show mild symptoms.Let’s make a third assumption — that the infection fatality rate in urban and rural areas is around the same, the 0.1% calculated in a previous installment of this column (Dispatch 152 on September 8). What urban India gains because of its better health care facilities, it loses on account of the lifestyle of its residents.At a 0.1% infection fatality rate, the number of people who have died thus far from the disease in India should be 110,000 to 131,500. India has seen around 80,000 coronavirus deaths from Covid-19 till Sunday night. That would mean 30,000 to 51,500 deaths may have been missed — not an implausible number even if this isn’t immediately clear in records of deaths (although record-keeping, even in the best of times, isn’t infallible when it comes to deaths and is likely to have been affected because of the pandemic). Even at the higher bound, this death number only translates into a 2.7% case fatality rate (on the basis of reported cases), which is lower than the 3.2% case fatality rate for the world.Also read: Covid-19 cloud on monsoon session as 29 MPs test positiveSome of the gap can be explained. Demographics; the protection granted by the BCG vaccine (widely, near universally administered in India); previous exposure to other coronaviruses resulting in, at the least, a better ability to fight the virus because it is recognisable; and the lower prevalence of lifestyle diseases in rural India, have all been recognised as factors that lower the mortality rate. (Some, such as the BCG factor, have been established by several studies, including a very credible one by JNU scientists).What does the prevalence rate of 10% (assuming a prevalence of 7.5% in rural India) across India mean from the perspective of the country’s fight against the pandemic?It’s still a long distance from the 65% or even 40% required for herd immunity according to widely accepted norms and mathematical models created by scientists at the University of Stockholm and University of Nottingham respectively. But universal masking can help boost this number, according to a study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco. The researchers argue that “universal masking could become a form of variolation” (the term means exposing an individual to a small or milder form of the virus in the belief that this would result in a mild infection and, ergo, immunity) in a study that has generated a lot of discussion.Their hypothesis is that a mask reduces the quantum of the virus-carrying exhalations inhaled by a wearer, reducing the intensity of infections, even making it asymptomatic. They further add that the proportion of asymptomatic cases is at least 80% in regions that mandate universal masking compared to the widely accepted proportion of 40%. If true, strictly enforcing the wearing of masks could be a safe way to move towards herd immunity while we wait for a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-VrPL1zUmceC1TyEMPzqZGN.html
15-09-2020||India||Bengal CM Mamata announces stipend, houses for Hindu priests, academies for Dalits||With the West Bengal assembly polls in 2021 becoming crucial for her party, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday made a series of announcements for the state’s Hindi-speaking, backward classes and tribal population as well as different religious groups. Banerjee also announced a monthly stipend of Rs 1,000 and houses for Hindu priests facing poverty. “Many of them (priests) are very poor. They met me several times to seek help. We have given the priests a plot of land at Kolaghat for setting up a place for pilgrims. Priests who do not have houses will be given the same under the state’s rural housing scheme,” Banerjee said at a press conference in the state secretariat. “Please do not think we are doing this only for Hindu priests. We are ready to help clerics from other religions as well. The state Wakf board already gives a stipend to Imams of the mosques. We thought of doing something for the others. The state has already given a 700-acre land to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) at Nabadwip (Nadia district),” said Banerjee. “The government will prepare a map of places of worship of all religions. The places of worship in poor state will be renovated and preserved. Those with no definite owner or trustee will be taken over by the government,” she said. Describing the moves as a part of the state’s welfare measures for “people from all class, creed and religions,” Banerjee announced that a Hindi language academy will be set up. It will be run by prominent members of the Hindi-speaking population. She announced a series of names as well. Former TMC Rajya Sabha member and newspaper editor Vivek Gupta will head the committee. Making another announcement, Banerjee said, “Similar academies for tribal people and members of the Dalit communities will be set up to help them preserve and spread their culture and heritage.” Banerjee said an academy for Dalit literature will be headed by prominent writer from the community, Manoranjan Byapari, who won the Bangla Akademi award, amongst several others. While referring to the Dalits, the chief minister specifically mentioned the Matua community who comprise a sizeable chunk of voters as well as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha member. Also, BJP won all the three seats in the state’s western districts where the tribal population is significantly big. The culturally important Baishnupur town, which incidentally is in Bankura where the BJP won the Lok Sabha seat in 2019, figures prominently in the chief minister’s new plans. “Bishnupur was a seat of learning centuries ago and the local museum has an archive of more than 3000 handwritten scrolls on various subjects including Vaishnav literature. The state government will digitize these for preservation and research,” she said. The Bengal BJP leadership said Banerjee was making desperate attempts to please Hindi-speaking people, Dalits, tribals and Hindu priests after doing nothing for them for 10 years. “All these years she never thought of these people. Rather she used to target those who chanted the Jai Sri Ram slogan in front of her. She gave stipend to the Imams and attended all Muslim festivals. Her regime will be over in six months. People will not be fooled by these promises,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. Significantly, on Monday morning Banerjee launched an all-new three-tier Hindi cell of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) while India observed Hindi Diwas. The cell will have separate committees at state, district and community block levels. The decision, senior TMC leaders said, was based on recommendations made by election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in by Banerjee after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 seats to 22. The BJP poses a challenge to Banerjee in the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-announces-stipend-houses-for-hindu-priests-academies-for-dalits/story-B3uTAtuADpDanfJRLK15OK.html

When IMA stopped paying dividends in March 2019, investors lodged complaints with the police and in June 2019, the Karnataka government set up a SIT to investigate the more than 51,500 complaints which had been filed by investors.On 30 August 2019, the investigation had been transferred to CBI which after a probe sought permission of the state government to prosecute Hemant Nimbalkar who was then IGP, CID and Ajay Hilor who was Deputy Commissioner East under section 197 of CPC and section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act 1963, for extending favours and protecting interests of the IMA promoters.The CBI has said Nimbalkar favoured Mansoor Khan and IMA by preventing a proper enquiry into its affairs. Ajay Hilori has been accused of accepting illegal gratification for extending favours to Khan and IMA. The permission by the state government has been given to CBI vide a letter dated September 11, which was made public today. Incidentally, Nimbalkar’s wife Anjali is the sitting Congress MLA from Khanpur assembly segment of Belgavi. Neither Hemant Nimbalkar nor Ajay Hilori were available to comment on the government’s decision to allow CBI to prosecute them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-permits-cbi-to-prosecute-two-senior-ips-officers-in-ima-scam/story-z0qaLYuZuisYirhVEgEu9J.html

Difficult geographical conditions and local dialects pose a huge challenge for police deployment in Bastar region, hence if local young men are recruited they will be of great advantage for the police,” said a senior police official.Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh, DM Awasthi told HT that the attempt is to employ the young men in the police force from Maoist affected villages of the region.“The recruitment will start in the next few months. We will send a proposal of recruiting around 1,000 personnel from all seven districts of Bastar division,” said Awasthi.The DGP further said that district-wise recruitment has been planned in the force.“They will be engaged in all police activities including anti-Naxal operations. Since they are well aware of the terrain they can be useful for us,” he added.Earlier in 2016, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) raised the Bastariya Battalion, to counter insurgency in which local tribals were recruited.Recently, Baghel wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking deployment of seven battalions of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).As per an estimate of the Chhattisgarh police department, around 60,000 police personnel of state and paramilitary forces are deployed in seven districts of Bastar division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-set-up-specialised-police-unit-to-counter-maoists-in-bastar/story-fkXep4KGhYuZ5IooWUiwwO.html
15-09-2020||India||Manish Sisodia Covid-19 positive but rapid tests miss 2 MLAs||New Delhi: Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that he is going into isolation after contracting the coronavirus disease, even as a special session of the state assembly concluded in a scare with three Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs, who came to attend the House proceedings, testing positive for Covid-19 by evening. Sisodia did not attend the session because he was down with fever since morning. “After suffering from mild fever, I took a coronavirus test and it turned out to be positive. I have isolated myself. I don’t have a fever or any other problem as of now. I am absolutely fine. With your prayers, I am sure I will return to work after regaining my health,” Sisodia tweeted in Hindi.While Sisodia was tested through the gold-standard Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method, two of the MLAs mentioned above were cleared to attend the session after their rapid antigen tests were negative. The third MLA, Girish Soni (Madipur), was found positive during a rapid antigen test conducted on the assembly premises before entering the House. Soni left the area immediately after that. Under the guidelines of the Delhi assembly, all MLAs have to undergo RT-PCR tests to attend the session. But the results of at least seven MLAs had not arrived until the Hose convened. Hence, the assembly secretariat made those without an RT-PCR report to undergo rapid antigen tests. Pramila Tokas (RK Puram) and Vishesh Ravi (Karol Bagh) tested negative during this drive but were found to have contracted the infection in their RT-PCR reports hours later. Their reports came when the session was underway and when they were in the House. The incident highlights the pitfalls in the Delhi government’s reliance on rapid antigen tests, which can throw up “false negatives” — or give a negative result for an infected person — in as many as 50% of positive cases, researchers have said. Delhi has been conducting about 80% antigen tests over the past two weeks as it has scaled up testing. “A total of 49 MLAs attended the Assembly session on Monday. While most of the legislators were allowed entry based on their latest RT-PCR negative test report of the past 48 hours, there were a few whose reports were yet to come. So, we arranged rapid antigen tests before the session for such MLAs,” a senior official in the Delhi assembly secretariat said, explaining what happened. “The reports of the three concerned MLAs in the rapid antigen test had come negative and they were asymptomatic. But, when RT-PCR test reports came by evening, the reports of Tokas, Soni and Ravi came positive,” he added. There was no response from the Delhi government till the time of going to the press. A second official in the assembly secretariat said about two dozen people, including a few MLAs, who came in contact with Tokas, Soni and Ravi, have been asked to go under self-isolation. In addition, three staff members of the assembly were also found positive. They, too, were present on the assembly premises during various session-related work. “The assembly is now being fully sanitised. Contact tracing is still on to ensure whoever came in contact with them are put under self-isolation. The three MLAs who tested positive are under home quarantine,” the official said. On Saturday, four legislators -- BJP MLA from Ghonda Ajay Mahawar, and AAP MLAs Rajesh Gupta (Wazirpur), Rituraj Jha (Kirari) and Surendra Kumar (Gokalpuri) had told the assembly that they were infected with Covid. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the Delhi government’s testing strategy needs a review. “Just increasing testing is not the point. Which form of testing is being increased is also significant. Ideally, rapid antigen tests should be conducted only in hospitals, containment zones and on special surveillance groups and high-risk groups such as senior citizens. The primary form of testing ideally should be RT-PCR in the city. Even the high court has noted this point,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sisodia-covid-positive-but-rapid-tests-miss-2-mlas/story-T0kNWxPNDKFYDhwII5AUZP.html
15-09-2020||India||No action on slums for four weeks, SC told||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that discussions were underway to implement the court’s August 31 order to remove 48,000 slums located alongside railway tracks in the Capital, and ruled out the immediate evictions of their residents, offering them a semblance of relief at a time when the city is battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The court recorded the Centre’s submission that no coercive action will be taken against the slum-dwellers until a decision is taken and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.“The ministry of railways, the ministry of housing and urban affairs, and the government of Delhi are going to take a decision on the issue raised in the instant petitions and till a decision is taken, there is no question of removing them,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central government, said. The apex court was hearing an application filed by Congress leader Ajay Maken, who was represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and a separate petition by slum dwellers challenging the demolition notices issued by Indian Railways.The petitioners said the notices had been issued in total disregard for the policy of rehabilitating the slum-dwellers, adding that they had ought to force them out of their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said, “It is a fair suggestion made by solicitor general. We will record his statement and the matter can be heard after four weeks.”Eleven slum dwellers represented by senior advocate Salman Khurshid were also allowed to join the proceedings on the next date of hearing. The biggest grievance of the slum dwellers was that an order removing slums was passed without them being heard. The August 31 order also restrained any courts from granting a stay on the eviction.The court recorded Mehta’s statement, which said: “Till then (until a decision is taken on the issue) the Union of India will not take any coercive action against the slum dwellers.” Singhvi understood the order to be as good as a “status quo on demolition”. But the bench clarified, “We have not given any status quo. The solicitor general has said that they will maintain status quo, which we recorded.”But Monday’s order provided much-needed relief to nearly 240,000 affected slum dwellers.“We were all tense after we heard about eviction notices being issued to several slums along rail tracks in neighbouring areas. We knew that we too would receive a notice very soon. Now that the government has said that our houses will not be demolished immediately, it has brought us big relief,” Ghanshyam Vishwakarma a 32-year-old resident of a slum along the railway tracks in Kirti Nagar, said.Puran Mehto, a 45-year-old resident of a slum along the railway tracks in Mayapuri, has other concerns.“We have learnt that the government and the Court are talking about rehabilitation. Now the problem is that if we are relocated to far-off locations, we shall lose our livelihood. And that would take a heavy toll on us under the present circumstances, especially in the light of the loss of work because of the pandemic,” he said.Both Vishwakarma and Mahato were factory workers who lost their jobs in April during the lockdown.Advocate Vrinda Grover, who appeared for four Nangloi slum dwellers, told HT: “The August 31 order of the top court never sought demolition of slums. The notice of demolition issued by the Indian Railway is totally illegal and contrary to two decisions passed by the Delhi high court which recognises right to shelter of slum dwellers and entitles them for in-situ rehabilitation under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.”Singhvi claimed that demolitions had taken place in some areas on Friday (September 11) and Monday (September 14), but Mehta denied this, stating: “My instruction is that under this order (of August 31), no demolition has taken place.”Presenting a short note of his submissions, Singhvi pointed out that India is currently president of UN-Habitat, which issued guidelines on March 14, urging member-states and governments to stop all relocations and evictions during the pandemic. Singhvi said, “India is globally the second worst affected country in the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the said circumstances, it would be highly risky to demolish the jhuggis (slums) of approximately 2.5 lakh persons without prior rehabilitation… Even a small percentage of the displaced population, if affected by Covid-19, the same will prove to be a recipe for disaster in the current pandemic.”Most of the slum dwellers work in markets and industrial areas near their residence. In their application, the slum dwellers stated that if removed, earning a livelihood in these difficult and unprecedented times of the pandemic will be the biggest challenge.The court passed its order of August 31 when considering the issue of garbage and solid waste piling up near the railway tracks in pending matters related to air pollution in Delhi.The court asked the authorities to put their mind together on the issue. Pursuant to discussions, the Railways filed an affidavit which acted as an immediate trigger. The Railways stated that the predominant presence of slums along the 140-kilometre route length of track in the national capital territory of Delhi “are not only adding to the present menace of accumulation of garbage, municipal solid waste, human waste along the railway line but are a safety threat to the day-to-day operation of the Railways.”The transporter informed the court that despite a special task force having been constituted to remove encroachments, political interference was coming in the way of getting the slums removed.On Monday, the ministry of railways said it will not dismantle any encroachments along the city’s railway tracks, without a “proper decision” taken in consultation with the urban development ministry and the Delhi state government. Railway officials are holding regular meetings with stakeholders, including the Delhi government, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board and the urban development ministry, a statement by northern railways said. “Further, Railway will not dismantle any encroachment without proper decision...The same stand has been taken by ministry of railways in hearing of Ajay Maken’s petition in Hon’ble Supreme Court listed today,” the statement said. Railways has removed 5-6% of garbage lying along train tracks. “The garbage cleaning will be completed within three months as given in the order by Hon’ble Supreme Court,” it added.Indu Prakash, a member of Supreme Court-appointed committee on monitoring of homeless shelters in Delhi, said, “It is a good sign that the court has agreed to put the matter on hold for a month and the Centre and the Delhi government will sit together and discuss it. We are writing to the railways and the Delhi government to include the residents in this discussion too, as it is a matter of their lives. We will be submitting a memorandum in this regard to the two governments soon. These people should be actively involved in the decision-making process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-action-on-slums-for-four-weeks-sc-told/story-aj1UHCyDKWNK7vo9qGYgoM.html
15-09-2020||India||Covid-19 cloud on monsoon session as 29 MPs test positive||At least 29 members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the run-up to Parliament’s first session in almost six months, according to officials aware of the matter, casting a shadow over the opening day of the monsoon session of the country’s highest legislative body.Twenty-one of the MPs belong to the Lower House and the remaining eight belong to the Upper House, the people said, requesting anonymity. Most of them tested positive on September 13, the eve of the start of the session which will convene on all days until October 1. According to officials, at least 17 of the lawmakers belong to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three to the Congress. The list includes minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi and two BJP MPs from Delhi, Meenakshi Lekhi and Pravesh Verma. All three posted tweets confirming that they tested positive. The monsoon session started on Monday, spread over different shifts in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, with staggered seating arrangements and strict health rules in place in the wake of the pandemic. Three-hundred-and-fifty-nine Lok Sabha MPs attended the first day of the session and around 180 MPs were present in the Upper House on Monday, according to official figures. Ministers are not required to mark their attendance.Apart from the Covid results, it was a busy day for both Houses. The Lok Sabha passed two bills (National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill and the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill ); introduced eight more, and tabled the supplementary demand for grants.The Rajya Sabha saw the introduction of five bills. The Upper House also re-elected Harivansh of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the deputy chairman. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke to the media before the session began, noted that Parliament’s monsoon session is being held in an extraordinary manner, with social distancing measures and with the two Houses conducting business in shifts. He also urged MPs to “send a message to the soldiers that the whole country is with them”, remarks that came against the backdrop of tensions at the border in eastern Ladakh, where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are locked in a stand-off.Defence minister Rajnath Singh will make a statement on the India-China conflict in Parliament on Tuesday.With a total of 770 seats across the two Houses, India has the world’s fourth-largest Parliament by number of lawmakers after the UK, Italy and France. As a part of the massive preparations to keep the Parliament estate free of Covid-19, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla announced two weeks ago that all MPs, officials and journalists covering Parliament would have to test for the disease before coming to the House. The Rajya Sabha also declared a similar policy. At least 2,000 people were tested in the run-up to the session, officials said. Besides the 29 MPs, around 70 officials tested positive, increasing the burden on the Parliament secretariat in running the session. The positive results came as a temporary setback for the session that has been delayed by at least two months because of the sweeping pandemic. While these 29 MPs are almost ruled out for the session, many senior MPs have already decided to skip it due to the pandemic. Union home minister Amit Shah, who has recovered from the viral infection, is currently in All India Institute of Medical Sciences for routine check-up. New Delhi Municipal Council officials were involved in conducting the tests along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The apex medical research body tweeted on Monday, “ICMR is honoured to have carried out testing of 2500+ samples of Hon’ble Members of Parliament and other officials on war footing over the weekend in service of the nation.” Minister of state for railways Angadi announced that he had tested Covid19-positive and that he was doing fine. “Taking the advice of doctors. Requesting all those who have come in close contact with me in the last few days to monitor their health and get tested in case of any symptoms,” he tweeted. BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi; another Uttar Pradesh MP of the BJP, Kaushal Kishore; and Congress lawmaker A Chellakumar have informed the Parliament secretariat that they tested positive. On August 28, the sitting MP of Kanyakumari, Congressman H Vasanthakumar, succumbed to Covid-19. On September 6, Congress’ s Rajya Sabha MP, Deepender Singh Hooda, declared that he tested positive for the infection. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member, Shanta Chhetri, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Rajya Sabha floor leader, A Navaneethakrishnan, informed the Rajya Sabha secretariat about their  positive status. Apart from these leaders, a Shiv Sena MP, one lawmaker each from the Aam Aadmi Party and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and two YSR Congress MPs too tested positive.“It is a constitutional requirement that the House has to meet. This is an unusual situation and no one can blame the secretariat for not doing enough. Of course, the absence of active members is always a loss, but we can’t apply general logic as things are really not in anybody’s control,” P Sreedharan, a former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cloud-on-monsoon-session-as-29-mps-test-ve/story-IQsw6g6M6tejNf94RIrdCI.html
15-09-2020||India||In a first, MPs use ‘Attendance Register’ app to mark attendance in Parliament||In a first of its kind initiative, the members of Parliament marked their attendance through an app on Monday, according to the Lok Sabha secretariat.The Lok Sabha MPs used the ‘Attendance Register’ App on the first day of the Monsoon session which commenced today.The app is designed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to curtail the risk of Covid-19 spread as MPs will not have to use or touch the attendance register. They have to be present inside the Parliament to register themselves using the coordinates provided by the app.Speaker Om Birla today welcomed the MPs and said that it was an extraordinary occasion and urged them to follow all arrangements and guidelines for safety during the Covid-19 pandemic phase.“The session is being held in extraordinary circumstances this time. While we always try to decrease the distances between the members, but this time arrangements have been made to keep them apart. I am aware of the discomfort caused to some members due to this but it is important to do so for safety,” Birla said.The Lok Sabha Speaker also hailed the unity of the country in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and the contribution of the MPs in extending the benefits to the last man.He also expressed the hope that the pandemic phase would soon be over and stressed upon the need for positive and constructive discussions on the important issues facing the country.“We have limited time in this session, therefore, it is our responsibility to put forth our points in a concise manner,” he said.He also congratulated the country on behalf of the Parliament on the occasion of Hindi Diwas.Meanwhile, National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah also attended the Lok Sabha session today.Abdullah was put under detention after the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year and was released on March 13, 2020.The monsoon session of Parliament commenced today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-mps-use-attendance-register-app-to-mark-attendance-in-parliament/story-hruucyinTLN0K9dQ9NtnCM.html

Malkangiri district collector Manish Agrawal said a medical team had visited the village and taken blood sample of the people in the area. “We have also taken a sample of the drinking water available in the area. Our medical team is making regular visits to the village to conduct tests. But the exact cause of deaths is yet to be known,” said Agrawal.Local villagers said the disease reportedly starts with swelling of the body following which the patients lose appetite. Those who died had become weaker by the day and succumbed, said a villager.Also read: BSP MP Ritesh Pandey to marry UK-based psychology student KatharinaMalkangiri chief district medical officer Dr PK Nanda said the administration has admitted 14 villagers in hospital and conducted tests on them. “While some were found to be anaemic others had a malaria attack. A few others may have consumed a local brew laced with urea for more intoxication,” he said.In June, similar deaths were reported from another village of the district. In Kenduguda village of Malkangiri block, 15 people had died with many of them complaining of swollen legs and stomach.Nutrition expert Basanta Kumar Kar said most of the deaths in tribal families of Malkangiri could be attributed to lack of proper nutrition. “As per the National Family Health Survey 4, malnutrition is as high as 51.8 percent, way below the state average. While essential micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are necessary to prevent mortality, the availability of nutritious foods may have worsened during the lockdown. Besides, malaria too plays a role in undermining the immunity of the tribals,” said Kar, who received the Global Nutrition Leadership Award last year.In September 2016, over 100 children, most of them malnourished, in Malkangiri had succumbed to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and Japanese Encephalitis. According to the 2014 Annual Health Survey report, seven out of ten children in Malkangiri are underweight while district ranked third in the country among 100 districts that have the highest prevalence of underweight children under the age of five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-10-tribals-in-odisha-s-malkangiri-district-die-of-unknown-ailments/story-xfc6CrRWbaIG6i3zuNFUTM.html

Relatives of Roy alleged that he was murdered by local Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers. BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu, the party’s state youth front president Saumitra Khan and others leaders led a peaceful dharna outside the office of the sub-divisional police officer of Arambagh in Hooghly on Monday. “Our protests will continue. Roy is not the first BJP worker who was killed and hanged. This started during the panchayat polls in 2018,” said Basu. In Kolkata, BJP youth front workers led a road block on Central Avenue and 10 of them were arrested for violating law. The victim’s body was handed to his family on Monday evening and cremation was carried out. “Today, Roy’s home was found locked and his family is missing. The police must have taken them somewhere since we wanted to meet them,” alleged Khan. Officers at the Goghat police station said they had no idea where the family had gone. Nirmal Das, the sub-divisional police officer, told reporters on Sunday that no external injury was found on Roy’s body except the ligature mark on his neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-worker-s-death-triggers-protests-in-hooghly-kolkata/story-H0Zy8zCw1y5QJcaUjaFqkK.html

Dr Amit Garg, microbiologist and in-charge of Covid-19 lab in Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, Meerut, is one such warrior who has been part of the battle against Covid-19 for the past about six months. The medical college lab was set up on March 23 to perform RT-PCR tests and Garg was made its in-charge with twelve staffers. He has not taken a single day’s leave in these 176 days.His mother Gunmala Garg got infected with Covid-19 but he returned to his lab after admitting her in a private hospital in Noida. “My friends and wife took care of my mother because I was engrossed in testing of samples in the lab,” said Garg who leaves home every day at 8 am for his lab but there is no fixed time of returning home.Also read: Won’t be enough Covid-19 vaccines till 2024: Serum Institute’s Adar PoonawallaGarg’s wife, Charu, is a pathologist.

15-09-2020||India||MPs must come together, stand behind soldiers: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday noted that Parliament’s monsoon session is being held in an extraordinary manner, with social distancing and with the two Houses conducting business in shifts, and urged MPs to send out a message that they were standing with soldiers at a time when they were bravely doing their duty in a difficult border terrain.The PM’s allusion was to the standoff at the border in eastern Ladakh, where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are within a few hundred metres of each other amid tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“This Parliament has a special duty; today our brave soldiers are at the borders with zeal and confidence in difficult terrain and soon it will begin to snow. They are there for the protection of the country, all MPs should together send a message to the soldiers that the whole country is with them. All MPs in one voice will say they are standing behind the brave soldiers,” he said in a customary address to the media before House proceedings began.Modi also thanked MPs for choosing the path to duty in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I congratulate them and expressed gratitude to them. This time, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha will be held at different times in a day. It will be held on Saturday and Sunday as well. And all the MPs have accepted this,” he said.After the budget session was cut short in March owing to the pandemic, Parliament reconvened on Monday for an 18-day session. While Zero Hour has been reduced and Question Hour dropped in view of the curtailed business hours, the PM expressed hope that Parliament will raise important issues. “There will be discussion on various issues and we have experience that in Lok Sabha that the whole country tends to benefit from the detailed and extensive discussions that take place. We will continue that great tradition and all MPs will add value to it.” The PM also urged MPs and the media to abide by social distancing protocols. “In these circumstances, we will abide by the protocols; till there is a vaccine we cannot let down our guard.”Later, in the Rajya Sabha, speaking after the election of Janata Dal (United) leader Harivansh as deputy speaker, the Prime Minister commented on the productivity of the House last year, and said that several bills that changed the direction of the country were passed. “This House made a new record for being the most productive even when it was an election year. This is a great matter of pride that apart from productivity, positivity also grew in the house,” he said.Reacting to the PM’s statement on soldiers, Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, said: “The entire country has stood by the Army irrespective of whose government is at the Centre.”“On matters of National Security, Parliament as well as the Nation has always spoken in one voice. It is the PM himself who stood out by dismissing the incursion by PLA on our land in order to change the LAC unilaterally. It was PM who struck a discordant note by giving a clean chit to the Chinese. Our valiant soldiers have retaliated in full might and we are grateful for their supreme sacrifices...We must teach the aggressor a lesson...,” said Congress spokesperson Pranav Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-must-come-together-stand-behind-soldiers-pm/story-apevTuk7APdBA5FFrL6LpK.html
15-09-2020||India||Govt imposes ban on export of onions||The Union government on Monday banned export of all varieties of onions, anticipating a supply crunch in the coming weeks, as exports surged. In the April-July period, export of onions rose an unusual 30%, causing prices to show signs of firming up. A notification by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Monday said that exports of onions, which were so far “free”, now stood “prohibited with immediate effect”. A key kitchen staple, onions tend to suffer frequent price and supply volatility. The government had last banned onion exports on September 29, 2019, after a bad crop crimped output. In December 2019, prices soared to Rs 80 per kg in the national capital. The government had lifted the ban on March 15, 2020. Retail prices this week rose to Rs 40 a kg from Rs 30 a kg in several cities. According to official trade data, the country exported US $328 million worth of fresh onions and US$ 112 million worth of dried onions in 2019-20. Between April and July 2020, exports of onions to neighbouring Bangladesh soared 157.7%. Since the bulb is a common base ingredient of most Indian dishes and widely consumed, consumers are quite sensitive to a rise in onion prices, relative to many other commodities. The country’s consumer or retail inflation in August rose 6.69%, slightly lower than 6.73% recorded in the previous month, according to government data released on Monday. According to the consumer price index data, food inflation in August fell marginally to 9.05%. Yet, overall food & beverages inflation rose to a high of 8.3% in August, Monday’s data showed. “Retail inflation in last five months have been in excess of 6%. Unless retail inflation in September 2020 declines sharply to around 4.5%, the retail inflation in three consecutive quarters will exceed 6% and monetary policy committee (of the Reserve Bank) will have to respond to the government on the steps taken to keep inflation in 2-6% range,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings and Research in a statement. High inflation shrinks the scope of Reserve Bank of India to lower lending rates to boost sagging growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-imposes-ban-on-export-of-onions/story-XqKn0RiTl1DmRGYQLmCBPM.html
15-09-2020||India||Govt seeks additional spending of Rs 2.35 lakh crore||The central government, as of now, plans to spend an additional Rs 2.35 lakh crore this financial year. It has sought Parliament’s approval for this amount through a supplementary demand for grants, which was tabled on the first day of the monsoon session on September 14. Out of the gross additional expenditure of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, Rs 1.67 lakh crore is the net cash outgo and Rs 68868 crore is matched by savings of the Ministries/Departments or by enhanced receipts/recoveries, the document said. The proposed additional expenditure suggests that the exercise is a post-facto approval for the announcements which were made by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the month of May. A research note by Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Pvt. Ltd calculated the additional fiscal impact of the government’s package at Rs 2.1 lakh crore. Also read: Retail inflation at 6.69% in August, marginally down from 6.73% in July“As can be seen, most of these expenditures are part of the announcements made by the government as part of Covid relief and hence these demands are formalization of the process of incurring these expenses. However, the state deficit grant appears to be outside these announcements and hence becomes additional expenditure”, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, adding that his firm now estimates the fiscal deficit at around 8-8.5% of GDP, assuming a marginal fall in nominal GDP from last year. The net change in central government spending will only be known when the next union budget is presented in February 2020. This is because the government can move more supplementary demands for grants during the course of the year. It is also not bound to declare the details of expenditure rationalisation, or cuts in budgetary spending during the year, until the publication of revised estimates for 2020-21 in next year’s Union Budget. In an interview with Bloomberg Quint on September 8, T V Somanathan, the expenditure secretary in the ministry of finance, said that the government has reduced spending for some ministries, given the resource crunch due to the pandemic. Among the major heads listed in the supplementary demand for grants, Rs 44,340 is for states as additional allocation under Post Devolution Revenue Deficit Grant, Rs 30957 crore, Grants-in-aid General for Direct Benefit Transfer to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna Women Accounts Holders, Rs 40,000 crore is for the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and Rs 20,000 crore is for infusion in state-owned banks. Also read: Inflation rises, food prices ease: DataThe document also shows that some of the big-ticket spending in the government’s Covid-19 response may be financed from extra-budgetary resources. For example, the government extended the provision of subsidised food up to November; this was initially announced for a period of three months beginning April, in June. This was expected to create an additional subsidy burden of Rs 1.5 lakh crore. However,the supplementary demand for grant has allocated only Rs 10000 crore for the department of food and public distribution. This means that additional subsidy burden will have to be financed from borrowings by the Food Corporation of India. DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India said: “A limited fiscal stimulus is being injected into the economy through supplementary demands for grants for 2020-21 by the Ministry of Finance. The total amount is Rs 2.36 lakh crore, that is, about 1.16% of FY20 GDP. The genuine additionality amounts to INR1.67 lakh crore which is 0.82% of GDP. The balance amount pertains to re-allocation of budgeted expenditures.” “The main items where additional expenditures are involved pertain to grants-in-aid for the states, direct benefit transfers to women account holders under the Jan Dhan Yojana, MNREGA, and for recapitalization of PSUs. Nearly 68.5% of this supplementary demand pertains to revenue expenditure. There is hardly any increase in capital expenditure. Furthermore, the additional provision for grants-in-aid to the states only makes up for the under-provision in the Budget with respect to the Fifteenth Finance Commission’s recommendations for 2020-21,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-additional-spending-of-2-35l-cr/story-CNeDRHQzSStcMyxLd8K1tO.html

Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. This will be their first meeting after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the most significant heights being held by India on Rezang La and Reqin pass where the PLA made some desperate attempts to regain lost ground earlier this month, the officials said. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on Thursday. The Indian Army rushed its front-line tanks and infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) to strategic heights held by its soldiers on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh in response to intimidating military moves by the PLA in the theatre earlier this month, the officials said. Conflict in the eastern Ladakh theatre is below the threshold of a shooting war but could take any trajectory, top officials told HT last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-top-military-commanders-likely-to-meet-this-week/story-V9WEO7LImc4Rgid1jSPFIN.html

[but] I have not heard of anyone coming even close to that [level] right now,” he told the business daily in a video call from London. The Financial Times reported that as part of SII’s agreement with AstraZeneca, the firm will aim to produce vaccine doses that cost around $3 for 68 countries and under its agreement with Novavax, for 92 countries.The company may also partner with Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute to manufacture the Sputnik vaccine, according to the newspaper.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Last week, human trials of the Oxford vaccine candidate by AstraZeneca were halted after a volunteer fell sick in the UK following which the Serum Institute of India also paused the trials as it was issued a show-cause notice by the Drug Controller of India. The trials, however, have resumed in Britain.After the human trials of the Oxford vaccine resumed in the UK late last week, Poonawala had tweeted, “As I’d mentioned earlier, we should not jump to conclusions until the trials are fully concluded. The recent chain of events are a clear example why we should not bias the process and should respect the process till the end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-of-india-s-adar-poonawalla-says-there-won-t-be-enough-covid-19-vaccines-till-2024/story-nwdl0qvTOY9BCTLddiOCgO.html
15-09-2020||Editorials||A reality check on the economy | HT Editorial||India’s GDP contracted by 23.9% in the quarter ending June 2020. The government has argued that a V-shaped recovery is underway in the economy. But almost all institutional and private forecasts do not support this claim. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) expects the Indian economy to contract by 9% in 2020-21. ADB had projected a 4% contraction in June. On September 14, S&P projected a contraction of 9% for the economy, from its earlier forecast of a 5% contraction. Most experts also warn that even the sequential recovery in the economy cannot be taken for granted. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached its highest post-lockdown level in the week ending September 13. However, the Nomura report raises questions on its sustainability given the continuous rise in Covid-19 infections. In addition, rising inflation poses another challenge to economic recovery. Headline retail inflation clocked a 6.7% growth in August, making it the fifth consecutive month when inflation was above the upper bound of Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s comfort level. Food prices and necessary services such as transport and communication are driving up inflation, even as the market for mass consumption goods such as apparel continues to be weak. Consumers are clearly facing a double whammy of squeeze on incomes and job losses along with a rise in price of essential commodities and services. And till this situation is reversed, the economy, across sectors, and citizens, across age groups, regions and classes, will suffer. Given these disconcerting facts, many — including this newspaper — have suggested a fiscal stimulus to boost economic activity. However, the fact that the supplementary demand for grant moved on the first day of monsoon session asked for a net additional spending of ₹1.67 lakh crore suggests that there are no immediate plans for another stimulus. To be sure, the government has not ruled one out. In July, the chief economic adviser said that the second round of stimulus might be timed when the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. What needs to be understood, however, is the fact that delaying the stimulus might make things worse. Unless there is a focused intervention in the economy, both business and consumer sentiment will continue to deteriorate, eclipsing prospects of any credible recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-reality-check-on-the-economy-ht-editorial/story-T4o4X3xCxgOy1OLnsQDVpK.html
15-09-2020||Editorials||Integrate NCDs into the Covid-19 fight | HT Editorial||It took a global pandemic for governments around the world to realise the importance of investing in health care. However, a new study indicates that a lot still needs to be done. According to a Lancet Commission report, for the first time, non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) have caused more deaths and disability among the world’s poorest billion people. NCDs, a diverse set of diseases that causes premature mortality, results in seven out of every 10 deaths globally. Another key finding is that people with NCDs show increased susceptibility to severe Covid-19 infection, which can lead to death. While countries, especially India, tackle Covid-19 and its economic fallout, they must also begin to direct resources towards other health challenges.The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seeks to lower death rates related to four NCDs by 2030: Cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes. The report highlights the need for governments to show greater commitment. India is one of the 16 countries that has established national NCDI poverty commissions, groups and consortia, indicating its resolve.To reduce death rates, however, requires social, environmental, behavioural, nutritional, and clinical determinants related to NCDs. This includes creating awareness about the causes of NCDs, including alcohol consumption and tobacco usage, among others. These interventions coupled with equitable and effective health care systems are imperative. Covid-19 has exacerbated NCD burdens, but it can be a wake-up call, especially if the government integrates NCDs into the Covid-19 response. This will help reduce the death rate further, and also assist in reaching SDGs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/integrate-ncds-into-the-covid-19-fight-ht-editorial/story-pNZS5RNdPDxqrx3XHzeXJI.html

With the US elections due in November, the wildfires have also become a key political issue. Last week, Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden warned that “climate change poses an imminent, existential threat to our way of life” and accused President Donald Trump, a climate sceptic, of denying “that reality”.Mr Biden’s statement linking the wildfires with the climate crisis has wide support. California governor Gavin Newsom said this is a “climate emergency”. Scientists have blamed the peak heatwave and dry winds for fanning the fires, and have warned that such “compound disasters” (when more than one extreme event takes place at the same time, across geographies) are a result of the climate crisis. The US is not the only country that has seen such wildfires. An inquiry has found Australia’s 2019-20 bushfires were likely made worse by the climate crisis, warning that such devastating wildfires are likely to happen again. While India has not seen such large-scale fires, forest fires (mainly manmade) are not uncommon. But unfortunately, the forest department’s firefighting capabilities are rudimentary. It doesn’t have modern equipment, adequate number of vehicles and enough field staff, which can bolster their rapid response system. In an era of the climate crisis and human encroachment into forest areas, it’s time to learn from the crises of the US and Australia and bolster its firefighting infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/california-wildfires-a-climate-lesson-for-india/story-lLd4rljifHmhNLDc7COI2N.html
