03-09-2020||News||To take on China, boost local defence capabilities||India and China are currently engaged in a low-intensity opaque war (LIOW), and renewed tension has been reported in recent days along the already troubled Line of Actual Control (LAC). These developments have taken place at the southern bank of the Pangong Tso and New Delhi has charged Beijing with attempting a second “provocative action” on August 31, even as talks were being held at the local military commanders’ level. Pre-emptive action by Indian troops has evidently foiled any further Chinese intrusions. China has displayed lack of sincerity and engaged in deception. The steady build-up of troops and related inventory by both sides is indicative of heightened military tension, with a probability of skirmishes leading to unintended escalation, and a long winter vigil. For India, the monitoring and safeguarding of the claim line along LAC with China will demand a higher level of sustained military presence.Against this backdrop, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s address, at the end of August, on defence manufacturing acquires critical salience, particularly for the candid manner in which the inadequacies and structural flaws of equipping India’s military machine were highlighted. He noted, “It is not hidden from anybody that India has been one of the main defence importers in the world for the last several years. When India became Independent, it had huge capabilities in defence production. There was a well-established 100-year-old ecosystem in defence production in India. Not many countries had the resources and potential of India. But it is unfortunate that not much attention was paid on this issue for several decades. No serious attempts were made. But, the situation is changing now”.The PM’s statement merits scrutiny in relation to how India will manage the China factor in the long-term from a military perspective. He was right when he referred to a 100-year-old ecosystem since India’s first gunpowder factor was set up in Ishapur (Bengal) in 1787 and a modern rifle factory was established by the British in 1904. Slowly, a defence production base was created in India, but only to serve the imperial interest. During World War II, the Indian contribution was considerable by way of war goods — but they were at the lower end of the spectrum and included ammunition, clothing, footwear, animals, among other items.When the British left India in 1947, this production infrastructure was denuded of its critical human resource and funding; further, it was irrevocably fragmented due to Partition. Lethal stores were destroyed and platforms such as bomber aircraft damaged and rendered non-operational. So the PM’s suggestion that India inherited “huge capabilities” apropos defence production at the time of Independence is not accurate. But the PM was spot on that while India had the potential to build a defence industrial base, it was “unfortunate” that no serious attention was paid to this strand of national capability for decades. The onus for this omission lies with those entrusted with the higher defence management. There has been no dearth of reports and recommendations about how to fix the problem but the under performance of the Indian defence manufacturing ecosystem has been overwhelming. That India is among the world’s largest importers of arms is a shameful reality, and it is to the PM’s credit that he had acknowledged this fact in his first term (2014) and had sought to enhance the indigenous production of military inventory. However, the empirical truth is that, six years later, the 100-year-old “ecosystem” that the PM referred to has not enabled or nurtured any significant progress in the indigenous design and manufacture of military inventory. The most stark indicator is that India is still floundering with the basic personal weapon for the soldier — the Kalashnikov equivalent — and is dependent on Russia for this item.Modi 2.0 has another four years to pick up the military equipment gauntlet, and having a full-time defence minister in the seasoned Rajnath Singh is positive. India has to invest in design and research and development in a far more sustained and effective manner, and not succumb to short-term measures such as urgent imports when there is a crisis. This happened in Kargil 1999, and most recently, post-Galwan. The PM has outlined India’s indigenous defence manufacturing challenge with commendable candour. The challenge is to irrigate the ecosystem in a manner that will enable India to acquire the appropriate level of military capability and confidence (atma nirbharata) to deal with the China challenge along the LAC and beyond. To start with, how about focusing on producing an Indian-designed and manufactured personal weapon that will compare with the best in the world by August 2023? That will be the best symbolic gift for India’s national security, as the nation completes its 75th independence celebrations.

03-09-2020||News||Old boys, Cobra Kai and the viral comfort of nostalgia||The second season of Cobra Kai opens with an epic fight between Johnny Lawrence and John Kreese. The two men, one middle-aged and the other certifiably old, go at each other in an empty dojo whose emblem is an upright snake, to establish who is the alpha — if there is an afterlife, Dr Freud must have had goosebumps when this scene was being filmed. It’s hard to take the Lawrence and Kreese fight seriously even though both give it their all. At one point, Lawrence (perhaps inspired by the bottle cap challenge from last year?) unleashes an almighty kick just so he can dislodge a fat cigar from Kreese’s mouth. You’d think there would be easier ways to stop a guy smoking, but no. That cigar lands neatly in a wastepaper basket and starts a small fire. At the end of the fight, when both men are flat on their backs and gasping for breath, a sprinkler bursts forth to extinguish whatever little ego the victor may have wanted to pat. Cobra Kai is all about the hangover of the past reaching into the present. The original rivalry between the teenaged Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso from iconic The Karate Kid is rinsed and repeated in different settings for Cobra Kai. Much of the show’s appeal lies in seeing how Lawrence, the old bully, evolves into a grouchy, but soft-hearted sensei. The roles of LaRusso and Lawrence being reprised by the same actors (Ralph Macchio and William Zabka), who played these parts in the 1984 film is a masterstroke. With a soundtrack full of ’80s tracks and visual tropes from that period’s cinema — Los Angeles somehow looks as sunny and pristine as it did back then — Cobra Kai simultaneously pokes fun of the past while milking it for nostalgic appeal.The show also adds details that help Cobra Kai take a bat to toxic masculinity. The dojos are mixed-gender now, and the show repeatedly underscores just how little there is to be gained from violence. The last fight of the season begins with comic undertones, as two girls circle each other, fighting over a boy. It seems to be a reversal of The Karate Kid’s love triangle, but in no time, Cobra Kai taps into 21st-century bloodlust. Soon, violence has spread like wildfire through the high school, and everyone, down to the cutest nerd, is kicking their way down hallways. In Cobra Kai’s second season, we’ve seen Lawrence emerge out of the cave of the 1980s, and change the way he thinks. The scene has now been set for Season 3, in which we’ll presumably see Lawrence and LaRusso assemble (a la Avengers) against Kreese’s machismo (and hairdo). For streaming platforms such as Netflix, the age of Covid-19 has delivered a flurry of surprise hits. From the kidnap erotica 365 Days to the contemporary ode to arranged marriages that was Indian Matchmaking, and now the second season of Cobra Kai, there seems to be no telling what we’ll turn to for comfort. Yet there is a connection. Despite belonging to starkly different genres, there’s been a strong element of nostalgia to many audience favourites during the lockdown. Frequently, the old ideas and formulae are packaged in modern storytelling. While Indian Matchmaking suggests arranged marriages can adapt to the present, 365 Days has stereotypes (like the bad-boy hero) from the pulpiest paperback romances of the ’80s and ’90s. Cobra Kai doesn’t just reference the past; it revives the ’80s by showing scenes from The Karate Kid films. Contrasting with the contemporary Cobra Kai, the films seem to hark back to a mellower, easier time than the one that Lawrence and LaRusso have to negotiate. When the future is uncertain, it’s not surprising that we’re looking to the past for comfort. So here’s the wisdom distilled from Lawrence’s experiences in Cobra Kai — to move forward, you’ve got to learn from the past, change with the times, and chuck your smartphone into the sea.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/old-boys-cobra-kai-and-the-viral-comfort-of-nostalgia/story-46wT8GGMDsfTFPE7gPfzjL.html
03-09-2020||News||The Congress has four choices now||How the Congress party deals with the current crisis will prove who was right: Those who argued that the Congress must perish or those who believe that the party still remains the best available option to challenge the hegemony of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)?It must first ask itself whether the demands made by the signatories of the letter to Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, are legitimate. The letter from 23 senior leaders of the Congress seemed a genuine attempt to draw attention to the fast-eroding support base of the party, especially among younger voters. It highlighted the leadership challenge, and made recommendations for organisational rejuvenation. And given that several of these signatories come from diverse social segments, with considerable political experience, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that many within the party (even those who rallied behind the Gandhi family) share the sentiments in the letter. No one, either during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting or in television debates, has criticised the content of the letter. The criticisms were limited to the timing and the motives of the signatories.After the showdown at the CWC meeting on August 24, there are four possible scenarios. And it seems the Congress party has opted for the least preferred outcome. First, Rahul Gandhi takes over as the president in the next All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting and promises to take up the demands made by the signatories. This would be the most optimal outcome. However, the optimal outcome is rarely the eventual outcome in politics as the game not only involves strategic decisions, but a range of other variables. In such a situation, shallow loyalties may be rewarded and even mild criticism would be unacceptable. Second, there is a split in the party. With most formal positions held by pro-Gandhi family camp, it is almost impossible for dissenters to force the Gandhis to step aside. But the pro-Gandhi camp cannot also go for indiscriminate purging, as some signatories are heavyweights and may well walk out of the party. However, it is unlikely that there will be any major vertical split in the Congress in the near future. There is little possibility of a 1969 or a 1977 sort of national split as a large section of the Congress base still associates the party with the Gandhi family. Furthermore, during the two national splits earlier, it was a Gandhi leading the rebellion against the party. Today, there is not a single leader within the party who can mobilise voters across states or has the resources to sustain such a formation in a lean period. There are a few who can do so in their respective states though. Why does India’s grand old party no longer have enough leaders with a substantial mass base and how did the Gandhi family become synonymous with the party? Though this history is well known, it is worth reiterating. The increasing interference of the Congress high command in state politics during the Indira Gandhi (and Rajiv Gandhi) years neutralised the emergence of independent centres of power within the party. State leaders were appointed (or dismissed) by the high command in a whimsical manner. The unwillingness to nurture strong state leaders allowed the Gandhi family to stay pre-eminent in the party.Third, the Gandhis decide that no one from the family will be party president, and ask for a non-Gandhi to lead the party. This is not an easy option. Will the new president be given the space to act as an independent centre of authority? Will the new leader be free from pulls and pressures if the Gandhis continue to play favourites? Will the new leadership have the full support of the party cadres across the country? And, what about the fear among many that the Congress will fragment if a non-Gandhi leads the party?And fourth, a policy of active marginalisation of dissenters is pursued. The composition of new party committees for the two Houses last week, in particular the selection of Gaurav Gogoi of the Gandhi camp as the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha over other senior figures who dissented, suggests this is the most likely course of action. This is not a fruitful option as all sides are likely to lose, but this appears to be the direction the party is taking. The Congress has opted to drift along without tackling the crisis head-on. Perhaps we may witness more examples of people expressing dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the party with greater frequency. But it is unlikely that there will be a coup d’etat or ruthless purging. As serious restructuring and re-imagination of the political agenda seem unlikely, political attrition will become a norm. Some leaders may join the BJP, others may go to regional outfits as in the case of Tripura.What does the Congress need to do to overcome this state of inertia? The party leadership must realise that whatever the party’s projections of its electoral strength, in reality, the party is getting marginalised. It can no longer continue in the belief that it is an umbrella party with a national presence. The party needs to make a realistic assessment of what revival means for it. In any state, where the party has slid to the third or fourth position, be it Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, West Bengal or Tamil Nadu, it has never recovered. With depleting resources to contest against the BJP machine nationally, the absence of a popular acceptable face to take on Narendra Modi, organisational atrophy, ideological confusion, and formidable challengers in many states, it must act wisely and urgently.

03-09-2020||News||China is investing in emerging tech. India needs to catch up, soon||In the backdrop of China’s trade and technology rivalry with the United States (US), its president Xi Jinping summoned leaders of China’s artificial intelligence (AI) and strategic industries to a meeting on July 21, and asked them to align their business strategies with China’s needs in the greater interest of the country. After Xi unveiled his grand ambition of making China a world leader in emerging technologies in 2013, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars to develop commercial and military applications of AI, 5G, new materials, energy platforms, quantum computing and financial technologies. Its progress has been aided by its civil-military fusion policy, under which ministries and armed forces work together with State-owned and private companies, with the State directing resources in priority areas, without any competition from foreign companies. Several experts say that China has made considerable progress in domains such as smart cities, smart manufacturing, surveillance, semi-autonomous vehicles and hypersonic weapons. In e-commerce, financial technologies, new energy platforms, China is viewed as a world leader. In June 2020, China launched its final satellite to complete its Baidou navigation system, thus becoming a true space power. According to a study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (2018), China is trying to integrate AI and big data into unmanned aerial vehicles, drone swarms and cyber systems in order to achieve “brain supremacy” (ability to damage cognition of the enemy).Huawei’s emergence as the largest maker of telecom equipment and second largest vendor of smartphones in the world is well known. China has also emerged as the largest manufacturer and exporter of electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels. It accounts for 70% of commercial drone-manufacturing exporting to more than 70 countries and has developed variants of the US’s MQ-1 Predator drones with reconnaissance, command, control, communications and integrated precision-strike capabilities.Though China has excelled in many areas, it is still dependent on foreign companies for cutting-edge technologies. Huawei’s reigning supremacy may well end as the US sanctions on the supply of microchip Kirin (system on chip) start kicking in. Despite huge investments over the last 30 years, China remains dependent on American, South Korean and Taiwanese companies for the supply of microchips and semiconductors which are a prerequisite in the AI industry. Similarly, China’s record in making its own engine for long-range aircraft is disappointing. Its homemade WS-15 engine for J-20 stealth fighter aircraft exploded in a ground running test in 2015, and it has started manufacturing the J-20 using the old Russian AL-31 engine which lacks the thrust vector control necessary for a 5th generation aircraft. Ditto, its inability to make high-grade carbon for its stealth aircraft or miniaturise the nuclear reactor for its aircraft carriers.In many instances, China has acquired advanced technologies from the West by forcing its companies to part with them in exchange for market access or by stealing and copying foreign designs. A basic lacuna in China’s approach is low expenditure in basic sciences and fundamental research, which has remained 5% of its overall research and development expenditure (as against 25-30% in developed countries) and shortage of skilled personnel. Also, the environment for innovation has deteriorated with authoritarian and expansionist policies being pursued by the Xi regime, which is damaging global chains, essential for research and collaboration. India has taken some incipient steps to induct AI into civilian and military domains by establishing the required policy framework and promoting research and applications with collaboration among our defence establishments and industry. In some cases, drones, smart weaponry and other hi-tech military equipment have been imported from the US, Russia, France and Israel. There is urgent need to prioritise the resources in development of AI platforms, necessary for civilian and military applications, to ensure that India does not fall behind more in relative power matrix with China.Yogesh Gupta is a former ambassador who writes on China-related issuesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-is-investing-in-emerging-tech-india-needs-to-catch-up-soon/story-b2cY9gq1drYPJx7R7ilMrN.html

03-09-2020||Noida||Minster asks discom to reduce line loss to below 15% in two months in Noida, Ghaziabad||The state energy minister Shrikant Sharma Thursday asked the power distribution companies in Noida and Ghaziabad to bring down line loss to below 15% and ensure uninterrupted power supply in the respective jurisdictions. While making a virtual inspection of high loss power substations in Noida and Ghaziabad, the minister also asked the distribution companies to upgrade the existing 10KVA and 16KVA transformers to higher capacities as soon as possible. “It is the duty of the power department officials to provide correct and timely bills to consumers. The officials must work out a plan to bring all the power substations, falling under the red zone, so denoted owing to higher line loss presently, to the green zone (where the line loss is below 15%) within two months,” he said. SHarma expressed his unhappiness over the line loss at substations in sectors 10, 47, 50 (a new one), 122, Mandi Shyamnagar, Rabupura, Jewar, Dankaur, Bankapur and Luharni in Gautam Budh Nagar district and Gadana, Bamheta, Muradnagar, Bapudham, New bus stand, Kala Patthar, Niti Khand-2, Behrampur and New Rajendra Nagar in Ghaziabad. “The line loss and tripping from these stations can’t be tolerated in any case as bona fide consumers also suffer due to frequent outages. Stern actions will be taken against all officials concerned if problems pertaining to line loss and frequent power cuts are not corrected within two months. Without ensuring uninterrupted power supply, making power corporations self-reliant will remain a mirage,” he said. Virendra Nath Singh, chief engineer (Noida zone) of Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), who also attended this review meeting, said Sharma has also stressed on ensuring correct meter readings. “He has asked us to provide correct electricity bills to consumers, based on meter readings. We have also been told to use the mobile phone numbers of consumers to collect feedback regularly. The consumers have been told to lodge FIRs against their billing agencies concerned, in case of discrepancies. The chairman of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has been assigned to review the power scenario in both districts, till the problems of line loss and power cuts end,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/minster-asks-discom-to-reduce-line-loss-to-below-15-in-two-months-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-oPdeOUHSAAo9GutMaeVMBJ.html

The institute said that convalescent plasma will be issued based on Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines for its off-label use and request forms must carry information on the clinical condition of the patient and severity of disease as per ICMR treatment guidelinesGovernment and private hospitals in UT wanting to use convalescent plasma treatment need to register with department of transfusion medicine, PGIMER, through an e-mail on plasmabankpgi@gmail.com by registering their phone number and e-mail ID with the designated nodal officer of their hospitals.The nodal officers will send the patient’s clinical detail information on the email ID.Once clinical indication for transfusion of CP is approved by the clinical team of PGIMER, patient attendants can submit request form along with patient’s sample, declaration form and patient’s clinical form. A minimum of three hours will be required to process this request following all Covid-19 precautions.After confirmation of the blood group of the patient, one unit (200ml) of group specific convalescent plasma will be issued.Convalescent plasma will be issued for free to patients admitted in PGIMER and other govt hospitals in Chandigarh. However, for private hospitals, minimum processing charges will be levied as per institute policy.Plasma bank committee, PGI, Chandigarh, has recommended that nodal officers of hospitals outside PGI should share a list of Covid-19 recovered patients discharged from their hospitals with department of transfusion medicine and motivate them to donate plasma.Recovered Covid patients willing to donate convalescent plasma can contact and fix their appointment for screening and testing with Dr Suchet Sachdev (7087009487) and Dr Divjot Singh Lamba (7087003371).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-sets-up-plasma-bank/story-Ojnbms1N1T81tywobvkiKL.html
03-09-2020||City||Forest department, Greater Noida authority to develop integrated green area and trails||In a first, the district forest department and the Greater Noida authority have decided to combine their green belts and parks to develop a larger Integrated green area for the public. Planned in Gamma-1 of Greater Noida, the project will club seven separate parks and around 18 hectares of the forest department land and other green belts. The project is still in its planning phase and so the official involved in the discussion did not provide an estimate of the area they will likely develop. Officials said that tenders will be floated soon to develop in next three months, estimate its cost to be around ₹4 crore and that they are aiming at a deadline of January 2021. “We have inspected the area along with officials of Greater Noida authority and its chief executive officer (CEO). It will be a great initiative to bring the residents closer to nature. A large part of the project, which will be in the shape of an arc, will be around the high-rises,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar. The integrated green area and trail will have several facilities like open-air gym, fitness work stations, dense forest systems, children play area, facilities for senior citizens, jogging tracks and shops offering healthy drinks, officials said. “We have taken concepts from different places like the parks in London, New York, Sydney, etc. Even Delhi has the Central Park and Nehru Park, but those have a walking trail of about 4 or 5 km, and nothing much else. We aim at developing the entire green area with more elements of nature, be it water bodies, or dense forest areas, longer and continuous jogging tracks, etc to name a few. We have received several suggestions under our friends of the Greater Noida scheme. Under this initiative, we aim at integrating the green belts, parks, and forest areas into one. The work will be paid by us and forests will be developed the forest department,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO, Greater Noida authority. “The length of the overall trail is likely to be around four kilometers. The designing phase will be completed in the next two months and the tender will be awarded by the next four months. We are aiming to conduct some activities at this project next year during our annual carnival that happens from January 26 to 29.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-department-greater-noida-authority-to-develop-integrated-green-area-and-trails/story-PYkzLfQjWMtflYO4hCJjgP.html

However, more than a one-and-a-half hours later, a police team found him unconscious on the road with several injuries. He is currently undergoing treatment at Fortis Hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU).Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida (zone 1), said around 12.22am a police control room vehicle found Kalra lying unconscious on the road. “He was admitted to a private hospital and the police informed his family members. He has received injuries on his head and body,” he said.According to his family, Akshay is a final-year B.Tech student, while a spokesperson of a Noida-based private university, where he was studying, said the 24-year-old had finished his course after clearing the fourth-year exams held in June-July.Gulshan Kalra, victim’s father, said that on Wednesday night Akshay told his mother that he is going outside and would return soon. “He was returning home when some criminals robbed him of his car and hurt him grievously. It was the police who found Akshay injured on the road. The police contacted me with Akshay’s phone and told me about the incident,” said Gulshan, who came to Noida on Thursday morning from Kanpur where we is deployed as a chief engineer with the Life Insurance Corporation of India. “Akshay has received critical injuries and is on ventilator support in the ICU. He is not in a condition to talk as well,” he said.Fortis Hospital refused to comment on Akshay’s condition.Based on the father’s complaint, the Sector 58 police have registered a case against unknown suspects under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.Love Kumar, additional police commissioner, Gautam Budh Nagar, along with the Noida DCP and other police personnel visited the crime spot and also met the victim’s family members. Kumar said a primary probe indicates that some criminals snatched the victim’s car and hit him for putting up resistance. “We have assigned teams to arrest the suspects,” he said. The criminals also took Akshay’s wallet. The police said they are investigating the incident from all angles and not ruling out the possibility of personal enmity. Four police teams are working on the case.The police reviewed footage from the CCTV cameras at Stellar Park society. The camera shows Akshay leaving from the society, but there is no CCTV camera where the crime took place, the police added.A police officer investigating the case, requesting anonymity, said the police found some shattered windshield glasses near the crime spot. “It is possible the criminals smashed the windshield glass in order to stop the victim.”Security in-charge of Stellar Park Apartments’, Ghanshyam Singh, said Akshay had left the society in his car around 10.45 pm according to the society’s CCTV camera footage. “We checked the society’s CCTV camera and found he drove towards the left side. However, he was found injured on a stretch that is on the right side of the society. It appears he was returning home when the criminals stole his car and hurt him,” Singh said.Stellar Park Apartments has 83 flats and 62 of them are occupied. Society’s RWA president Pradeep Mishra said the criminals fled with Akshay’s car and purse while his phone was found at the spot. “We feel the police should step up security steps around the society. The criminals should be arrested soon. A residents’ delegation will soon meet Noida police officials over safety issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/24-year-old-man-critically-injured-while-trying-to-resist-car-robbery/story-kkYCsIWhp1cASN8u2FHhhL.html

03-09-2020||City||Private hospitals cannot charge more than the capped price, will issue fresh order: UP govt||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday said that they will issue a fresh order to clarify the price cap on private hospitals could treat Covid-19 patients. This comes after it emerged that many hospitals were takind advantage of a loophole in a previous order by charging tests and other consumables separately.The July 10 Uttar Pradesh order had capped the prices upon the recommendation of a committee formed by Union home minister Amit Shah and headed by Niti Aayog member Dr. V K Paul. Patients would be charged between ₹8,000 to ₹15,000 per day depending on their condiction -- whether “moderate” or “severe” or “very severe”.However, the order did not specify whether it included the cost of medicine, laboratory tests and other extras.“We will be sending a new government order (to clarify this). The package mentioned in the previous order is all inclusive, except for medicines like remdesivir or tocilizumab. Tests like IL-6 (which measures the level of the protein Interleukin 6 that is produced in response to an infection) can also be charged extra,” UP additional chief secretary Amit Mohan Prasad said in a press briefing in Lucknow on Thursday. “The rest (testing and management) is included in the package even if the patient suffers co-morbidity. We request the private hospitals not to charge extra otherwise they may face action under the Epidemic Act.”As per the July 10 order, the cities in the state were divided in three categories. Tier ‘A’ cities included Noida area, Ghaziabad city, Meerut, Kanpur, Lucknow and Agra, among others.It said that National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited super-specialty hospitals could charge ₹10,000 for moderately ill Covid-19 patients, Rs 15,000 for severely ill sickness (includes ICU without need for ventilator care) and ₹18,000 for very severly ill patients (which includes ICU with ventilator care).The rates for non-NABH accredited hospitals were ₹8,000 (moderate), ₹13,000 (severe) and ₹15,000 (very severe).In a recent internal communication to the health department officials in UP, state officials had cited an exampled of a Lucknow hospiral charging ₹52,000 per day for a room. It asked the district nodal officers to keep watch.“We are waiting for the new government order in this regard and appropriate action will be taken. We have about 598 beds available in 10 private hospitals in Ghaziabad with 355 patients admitted. We have about 422 active patients in home isolation,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer.Private hospitals did not offer comment on their position to the government decision.“The hospitals are working as per previous order and it is good sign that the government has clarified. We will wait for the order to come and the rates recommended by the Dr. VK Paul committee are better than the rates which are offered under Ayushman Yojna,” said Dr. VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association - Ghaziabad.According to the figures of the state health department, only 2,558 patients are presently taking up treatment in private hospitals across the state while the number of patients in home isolation is about 29,588.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-hospitals-cannot-charge-more-than-the-capped-price-will-issue-fresh-order-up-govt/story-B9gGdu2ZFG0wPGztLAFLzM.html
03-09-2020||City||Those between 20 and 59 years account for 79% of Covid cases in Ghaziabad||As the number of Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Ghaziabad, the four age groups of 20-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-49 years and 50-59 years have been the most affected, accounting for nearly 79% of the total cases reported from the district, from March 1 to August 31, health officials said Thursday. The officials said people in these four age groups are the most mobile and, hence, are at a higher risk of contracting the infection. Of the four groups, the age group of 20-29 years has a total 1,806 cases from March to August, while those in group of 30-39 years account for 2,071 cases during the same period. The third group, 40-49 years, is also high on cases with 1,578 cases, while the age group 50-59 years has 1,233 cases during the six-month period. The other significant age group is 0-9 years that has reported 273 cases of the total 8,440 Covid-19 cases reported till August 31. On the other hand, senior citizens, aged 60 and above, have reported 951 cases during the period. “Those between the ages of 20 years and 59 years are the ones who have to go out for work and also due to fact that most activities have opened up with the easing of lockdown restrictions. So, these are the people who are more prone to get the infection and their numbers are on the rise,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The age group of 40-49 years has shown minor decline in the number of fresh cases in the month of August, Gupta said. “The minors and the senior citizens are contracting the disease from others in their family who step out the most. The senior citizens from the start of pandemic have been advised to stay at home and take utmost precautions. The numbers for that age groups is not much,” said Dr VB Jindal, president, Indian Medical Association. “That is why the sero surveillance which is to start soon will be taking samples from those between the age of 18 years and 59 years,” he said. Amit Mohan Prasaad, additional chief secretary (health), Uttra Pradesh, has issued an order for the sero survey which is slated to start from September 4 and has decided to include the age group of 5-18 years as well. “The number of samples will now be 1,440 for the sero survey and 360 of them will be from the age group of 5-18 years. We have prepared our teams for sample collection. The survey results will indicate how much of the population has developed antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19,” Dr Gupta said. A serological survey checks for an immune response against the virus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help authorities establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought off the virus without showing symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/those-between-20-and-59-years-account-for-79-of-covid-cases-in-ghaziabad/story-EXmqNsjL2rr8c5b9SfU5hO.html

03-09-2020||City||Containment zones unguarded in Ghaziabad, residents raise concerns||The Ghaziabad administration on Thursday uploaded the list of 336 Covid-19 containment zones in the district on their website. However, on the ground, several of these zones say their areas were hardly “contained” with no measures to prevent people from moving in or out. With infections spreading and the economy slowly opening up, the Union government had, in its Unlock 4 guidelines issued last week, insisted on keeping containment zones off-limit to any activity, including travel by Metro. Only essential services would be allowed. These rules will be in force till at least September 30.On Thursday, Hindustan Times visited several of these containment zones in Indirapuram, Shashtri Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, among others, and found no bar on entry/exit of people neither were there any prominent posters declaring the area as a containment zone.“In our area there is no sealing or barricading witnessed for past some time. Public movement is allowed without any restrictions. Since we remain mobile in the area, there is hardly any barricading seen around,” said Mohan Sangwan, general secretary of the confederation of trans-Hindon residents’ welfare association (RWA). At Niti Khand I in Indirapuram where six patients from a household tested positive on August 26, as per administration’s list, and is scheduled to be de-sealed on September 9. However, when HT visited the area, there was unhindered public movement “There is hardly any sealing of containment zones on ground while it merely exits on paper. Nowadays, one will hardly find any barricading outside the zones,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. “In my ward I have not seen any barricading or sealing for long time. I came across one house where there are five cases and on Thursday I got the area outside it sanitised with my own efforts. There is another house in J block where there is no sealing. It seems there is some lack of co-ordination and the officials must rope in supervisors of the corporation. Otherwise, people are free to move and there are more chances of spread of infection,” said Ajay Sharma, councillor of ward 67. Containment zones are sealed for 14 days and de-sealed in case they have no fresh cases. These zones are divided into two categories -- category-1 with only one case and a 100-metre radius “lockdown” or the entire mohalla, whichever is less; cateogry-2 with more than one case and a 200-metre radius “lockdown” and an additional buffer zone outside based on officials’ assessment. When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey referred the matter to CP Tiwari, additional district magistrate (city), who is in-charge of containment zones. “All containment activities like surveillance, sanitisation, sealing and de-sealing are taken up on regular and timely basis in containment zones. In case residents have raised issue, I will take up report from every incident commander who is in-charge of the respective areas. Once the report is received we will take appropriate measures. There is always scope for improvement,” Tiwari said, without expanding on HT’s findings.The police said they were not responsible for ensuring the containment.Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said, “We have about 500 personnel deployed on containment zone duties day and night. There is also a plan to rope in auxiliary personnel like home guards, chowkidars etc. The barricading is done by magistrates and public works department.”This passing the buck, an expert said, will be detrimental to containing the spread of the virus. “There is less visibility of containment zones nowadays as compared to initial months of the pandemic. It would also be handy if there is rigorous antigen testing taken up immediately in order to identify the suspect cases in the area,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. According to the official figures, the Ghaziabad, till September 2, has 8586 total cases which include 68 deaths and 1464 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/containment-zones-unguarded-in-ghaziabad-residents-raise-concerns/story-WViZ6P5yeXBFtX1KuHIiXJ.html

Officials said as per the current plan, security personnel will be deployed to check the temperature of commuters and only those will be allowed to travel whose temperature is normal. They added that NMRC may introduce some changes as needed in coming days, based on the trends in ridership and passenger behaviour that they see.NEEDS DISTRICT ADMIN QUOTE ON METRO REOPENING AND CONTAINMENT ZONES AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO PREPAREGautam Budh Nagar on Thursday recorded 138 coronavirus (Covid-19) positive cases while 86 patients were discharged after treatment. The official data shared by the administration revealed that there are 1,163 active cases in the district. Containment zones are decided by the district administration which sees how many positive patients are there in any given locality before taking a call. Up till Thursday, Gautam Budh Nagar had 289 containment zones, according to the health department.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said: “The security persons will be able to check people’s temperature and allow only those whose temperature is under the prescribed limits. We may introduce some changes once the system starts working,” she said.The NMRC has placed stickers to guide commuters to stand in queues and maintain social distancing norms. This will be applicable inside and outside the trains as well. At the entry gates, Covid safety messages will be displayed on the LED screens inside the trains. According to NMRC guidelines, commuters entering the premises will have to apply sanitisers on their hands, which will be made available to them after temperature screening. To ensure adequate social distancing, passengers will be advised to stand in queues at designated spaces by visible markings one metre apart at frisking zones, platforms and inside the train.Data from the corporation shows that ridership was lower in the third week of March this year, just before the lockdown was implemented nationwide, and the outbreak was rearing its head in the region as well as the country. The district recorded its first coronavirus case on March 5.On March 2, 3 and 4, the Aqua Line had recorded 26,079, 26000, and 24,591 commuters, respectively, against March 16, 17 and 18’s 19,064, 17,720 and 16,007. Sharma said that some private organisations and MNCs had advised their employees to work from home and academic institutions had also closed, which resulted in low footfall in the last week of March 2020. She said, however, that she is not sure about what kind of footfall numbers to expect.“We hope gradually the system will be in place. But we are not sure about the number of commuters in the next few weeks. We have to wait and see,” Sharma said. Medical experts, though, say there is a risk of infection in the metro as people from all over the NCR would travelling in the trains.According to N K Sharma, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Noida, it is possible people from containment zones may end up on the trains. “The Aqua Line connects Noida to Greater Noida while the Blue Line connects Noida to Dwarka. A number of people from various parts of the national capital region would take metro, once it starts. This may lead to spread of infection. Officials must check temperature, Aarogya Setu App and also seek a Covid negative report from the commuters to allow their entry,” he said. Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, meanwhile, said in Gautam Budh Nagar, teams of health department and police keep a check on containment zones. “The teams try to ensure that people do not venture out unnecessarily from containment zones. The restrictions would keep in check metro commuters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nmrc-to-start-aqua-line-metro-from-monday-but-difficult-to-keep-track-of-commuters-from-containment-area/story-KkFzjIuDrnJWd57yyHI3MK.html

They also requested the minister to ban export of steel in order to facilitate indigenous manufacturers.Kular stated that the prices have risen by Rs 3,000 per tonne from September 1, which is totally unjustified considering the MSMEs. Steep hike in steel prices are observed every month, and the industry is facing huge losses as previous orders have not been completed yet, he added.“The industry is forced to purchase steel and iron at renewed prices. The frequent hike is fatal for the industry and indigenous manufacturers” he said.With the easing of lockdown, industrial units are operational at around 40% of their capacity, due to social distancing and other government SOPs. Though the demand for products have increased, but production capacity hasn’t.“Steel prices have increased from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per tonne in last 45 days, which is totally unacceptable to the industry and consumers. As the source of income has gone down, prices of the finished goods have started increasing, which is a direct burden on the common man,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fico-demands-regulation-in-steel-prices/story-WvVGtcIauHSWUaoVG6jGzN.html

Party leaders accused the state government of adding to the woes of residents who were already suffering financial crises.Earlier, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) used to collect property tax for this category at ₹5 per yard. But, the local bodies department on August 31 notified the hiked 7.5 percent tax on the annual rent generated by the owner of such a property. The new rates would be applicable from April 1, 2020.Punjab BJP vice-president and former Ludhiana senior deputy mayor Praveen Bansal said the residents are already struggling to make ends meet amid the ongoing pandemic and the government has decided to add the tax burden. Moreover, most of the PGs and labour quarters are lying vacant as the tenants have returned to their homes due to the pandemic. The owners are not getting rent and the government is burning a hole in their pockets, the BJP leader said. “Rather than providing relief to the residents amid the pandemic, the Punjab government is increasing taxes. It should revoke the hike immediately. For most residents, their incomes have shrunk, while some are bearing high treatment costs after contracting the disease. It is unfortunate that the government is not being run by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, and the bureaucracy is making all the decisions in closed-door meetings. The CM should step out of home isolation and see the ground reality,” said Bansal.Apart from criticising the increase in the property tax, former BJP councillor Inder Aggarwal slammed the government for imposing the decision with retrospective effect. “It will lead to large-scale corruption as many residents have already paid the tax and they will now be served notices for reassessment. This will also lead to chaos and harassment of the public. The government should immediately reverse the decision,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roll-back-hike-in-property-tax-for-rentals-demands-bjp/story-8qpytZJNHQQFE1bVICqtKL.html

It has been observed that the antibodies present in the cured person’s blood neutralise the virus present in the Covid patient’s body. Thus, the treatment is being suggested for patients who are moderately affected by the virus. Plasma can be donated once in 14 days.According to Dr Bhanu and Dr Ashish, plasma donation is similar to blood donation and is a half-an-hour long process. A needle is placed into a vein in the arm. Plasma is collected through a process call plasmapheresis and is conducted in cycles, they added.DMCH managing society secretary Prem Kumar Gupta appreciated the noble gesture by both the doctors to save lives of Covid patients.As per medical superintendent Dr Bishav Mohan, donating plasma will not reduce your own immunity or affect your future antibody levels. “Till now, many few people have come forward for plasma donation,” he said, urging others to do the same for ill patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-doctors-donate-plasma-to-critical-covid-patients-in-ludhiana/story-incTeRd3B7nkdHFvTPjy8L.html

The owners claimed they were suffering losses and struggling to pay the fixed charges, besides their staff not being able to make ends meet and going jobless.Hotelier Pritam Singh said, “We have been sitting idle since mid of March as restrictions have been imposed on gatherings and people are not organising events. We are facing losses and are somehow trying to retain the staff. We want the government to allow events with 50 percent capacity in banquets and hotels, but not even 100 persons can participate in the events, even when the Centre has allowed the same. We would lodge protests if no relief is given.”Taranjit Singh, who runs a resort on lease, said, “Many staffers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, while others are struggling to support their families. But the government is not paying heed to our problems. The business is on the brink of collapse and the owners are forced to pay hefty fixed charges, including electricity bills, even when no events are being organised at our venues.”MLA Kuldeep Vaid has assured the association to the take up the matter with the state government and get help for the suffering industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/loss-ridden-banquet-owners-in-ludhiana-demand-hike-in-wedding-guest-limit/story-wCwIOlqUBLYfuSrp8dQloJ.html

03-09-2020||City||Now, pay fine for not segregating household waste, littering||With the local bodies department notifying the ‘Solid waste management and cleanliness and sanitation bylaws-2020’, residents will now have to pay hefty fines for failure to segregate waste or indulging in other violations. The challan amount can range from Rs 250 to Rs 5,000, depending upon the category of the property or violation. Challans up to Rs 20,000 can be issued on sale of plastic carry bags and Rs 25,000 for burning garbage. The municipal corporation (MC) has also been directed to depute nuisance detectors in the city, who will keep an eye on violators and issue challans. GARBAGE COLLECTION The local bodies department has also fixed monthly charges for door-to-door garbage collection. The charges vary from Rs 50 (for households up to 200 sqm area) to Rs 25,000 for a university. There would be at least 5% annual increment in the charges. Bulk waste generators, including hotels, marriage palaces and schools, have also been directed to dispose of the waste within the premises as far as possible and only the residual waste should be handed over to waste collectors. HOLDING EVENTS AT PUBLIC PLACES A person intending to organise an event at a public place will have to inform the civic body three days prior to the event and pay user charges for collection of waste which may vary from Rs 5,000 (for up to 100 participants) to Rs 40,000 (for over 10,000 participants).

WASTE MANAGEMENT Facing heat over its failure to manage solid waste properly, the MC will soon commence a drive in the city to issue challans to those who don’t segregate their household waste as directed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT had, on August 24, directed the MC to deposit bank guarantee of Rs 15 lakh to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) over its failure to take up the solid waste management project. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that bylaws have been notified to ensure compliance of the solid waste management rules. The MC General House had approved the bylaws in September last year and final approval was also given by the local bodies department in the month of January this year. However, the notification was pending due to which the MC was not able to issue the challans. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We were waiting for the notification and now extensive drives will be conducted to ensure door-to-door lifting of garbage and waste segregation. We are also working to improve the infrastructure for collection and lifting of waste in a segregated manner. Public should also support the civic body in this matter as solid waste management has become a major concern for the city.” VIOLATORS LIABLE FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE As per the notification, residents who fail to pay the penalty will be liable to do community service, such as road sweeping and graffiti cleaning, for at least one hour. A case can also be lodged against the violators under Environment Protection Act-1986, which can also lead to imprisonment and a fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-pay-fine-for-not-segregating-household-waste-littering/story-RbrMgWYcoAw6qZPEPirPTI.html

Prakash, a 1998 batch IPS officer, is the third commissioner for PCMC in two years after the state government established the commissionerate in industrial town on August 15, 2018, as law and order became a challenge following rise in number of street crimes and cases of vandalism. Prakash’s transfer was part of major reshuffle carried out by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday in which around 50 officials were transferred. Bishnoi was the second commissioner of PCMC and had hardly completed a year before he was transferred. He was preceded by senior IPS officer RK Padmanabhan who too was transferred before completing two years in office. Prakash is known as “ironman” in police circles. Earlier, he had served as special IG at the director-general (DG) office. He originally hails from Hazaribagh in Bihar. Besides Prakash’s transfer, Pune rural police SP Sandip Patil has been promoted, and sent to Gadchiroli . The PCMC police commissionerate faces serious issues related to human resources like lack of manpower and adequate number of vehicles to address the rising crime. The shortage comprises lack of four assistant commissioners of police, independent armoury, BDDS squad, independent hospital, Rapid Action Force Unit (RAF). Due to lack of funds of state department, the commissionerate is dependent on CSR funds and also PCMC. Post lockdown, the area is facing issues like rising two wheeler thefts and house breaking incidents across the commissionerate area. Despite repeated attempts, Prakash could not be reached with calls and messages sent to him went unanswered. The force has a strength of 2,000 personnel although the requirement is of 7,000 personnel, according to the commissioner. As per the 2011 census, PCMC had a population of 1.72 million which is estimated to have grown to 2.08 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/third-police-commissioner-in-two-years-krishna-prakash-has-tough-task-ahead-in-pimpri-chinchwad/story-dRhjOZZt6AsixdyFkDKJ5L.html

The fine was imposed by the high court bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma as the Centre failed to submit its reply to the petition filed by Khemka on July 30. “Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 – Union of India prays for and is permitted to file a written statement within a period of one week from today subject to payment of Rs 1,000 as costs,” the bench said while deferring the hearing till September 15. It was on July 23 that CAT, Chandigarh, had passed the order. Khemka was seeking direction to the Centre to consider his empanelment for holding additional secretary or equivalent post at the Centre. CAT had dismissed the plea observing that appointment of a person at the Centre can’t be a matter of right. Khemka has told the court that he was empanelled as joint secretary in December 2010 and applied for central deputation in 2011, 2012 and 2014, but was not appointed. Non-empanelment at this stage, he had told the court, would lead to a cascading effect and he will not be able to serve at the Centre permanently. Subsequently, he had also sought the records pertaining to empanelment or exclusion of officers in another plea filed on August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-imposes-rs-1-000-fine-on-centre-for-not-responding-to-khemka-s-plea/story-04A3OaH9fyieB7HifOzYZL.html

03-09-2020||City||PDP leaders prevented from leaving home for party meeting||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Thursday did not allow several People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders to leave their homes for attending a party meeting here, its spokesman said. It was for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year that the PDP had called the meeting of its senior office bearers and leaders at its party headquarters here .Many senior leaders, including PDP general secretary GN Hanjura, former education minister Naeem Akhtar, former legislator Ajaz Mir and former MLC Khurshi Alam were not allowed to move out of their homes by the police. “Despite being free on paper and in government submissions in high court and Supreme Court, PDP leadership continues to be under illegal detention, without any official orders. I wasn’t allowed to attend the PDP meeting nor were any of my colleagues, “Akhtar wrote on Twitter, while sharing a video of how he was stopped by the police. “Show us some order ... Or at least allow me to go on foot,” he pleads in the video to the policemen who respond saying there is no permission.PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura said they had to cancel the meeting when most of their leaders were not allowed to move out of their homes. “They did not allow around 20 of our leaders and members to move out of homes saying that we are under house arrest. We told them to show us some orders or give us something in writing because recently they told the court that no one is under detention in Kashmir,” Hanjura said.He said they had written a letter to divisional commissioner and police top brass about four days ago informing about the meeting and seeking permission, however, they got no response from the authorities. “These are double standards of the government. In the high court and Supreme Court they said that nobody is under detention but on ground they are targeting a particular political party,” he said.The twitter handle of incarcerated PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, handled by her daughter Iltija Mufti, tweeted a number of videos showing the leaders being stopped from leaving their residences. “Shameful that J&K administration along with police physically prevented PDP leaders from leaving their homes in Srinagar. They shamelessly lie to courts that these people are free to move and then have the audacity to detain them illegally at home, “ Iltija wrote on Twitter. “BJP & other parties are allowed to hold meetings. But for some reason, the same freedom isn’t given to PDP. GOIs claims of setting all political leaders in J&K free is as fake as their narrative of normalcy,” she tweeted. Calls to Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole and inspector general of police Vijay Kumar did not elicit any response.Political parties lash out at govt“The government should come clean on whether someone is detained or not. This heralds the new struggle. Struggle to get the government to agree that a person is detained,” said People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone said. CPIM leader MY Tarigami condemned the police action to disallow PDP leaders from moving out of their houses for the party meeting. It has once again exposed the “hollow claims” of the BJP government about normalcy in Kashmir, he said. “Not allowing political leaders to attend their party meetings will have debilitating effects on democratic process and amounts to further squeezing of democratic space,” he said.Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) senior leader Mohammad Dilawar Mir termed the police action as highly condemnable and undemocratic. “Rather than imposing autocratic decisions the government should facilitate an early resumption of the political process in J&K which has already received a huge dent since last year,” Mir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pdp-leaders-prevented-from-leaving-home-for-party-meeting/story-EFHlEKLfnp01OFyeJWUATN.html

03-09-2020||Chandigarh||High court gives Haryana six weeks to issue tender for artificial limbs to Panipat boy||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Haryana government to issue a tender within six weeks for artificial limbs to a Panipat boy who lost both his arms and a leg due to electrocution in 2011. In 2016, myoelectric prostheses worth Rs 50 lakh were given to Raman, who was five at the time of mishap. He had suffered 100% disability after coming in contact with a sagging 11KV transmission line passing over the roof of his house. Myoelectric prostheses are externally powered artificial limbs that one controls with the electrical signals generated naturally by his/her own muscles. However, these prostheses have become redundant now. The order came from the high court bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar on an application moved by Anil Malhotra, an amicus curiae in the case, who had apprised the court of the boy who was without artificial limbs for one year now. His upper implants practically ceased to be of any use as they did not fit him due to his physical growth over the years. These limbs were to be replaced in 2021. He had also raised issues with regard to authorities not adhering to court directions on the selection of artificial limbs to be given to the boy. Now, director general, health services, Haryana, has been asked to constitute a team of experts in orthopaedics, who would consult specialists from premier medical facilities such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and then make a decision about the best viable artificial limbs for the boy. The HC bench said that consultation be held through videoconferencing in view of Covid-19 and tender would be issued within six weeks. The court also directed that the exercise of replacing limbs cannot be undertaken once in every five years as decided earlier as the boy is of growing age and would substantially grow over the next few years. It would be incumbent upon the state and the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) to undertake the exercise afresh as and when he outgrows the limbs now provided, the bench directed. It was in 2013 that the high court had awarded compensation to the boy and also issued directions to provide him artificial limbs as it was found that he suffered due to negligence of authorities. The matter went up to the Supreme Court, which in 2014 had upheld the decision that UHBVN would pay Rs 60 lakh to Raman. Of the amount, Rs 30 lakh was to be kept in a fixed deposit till the boy turns 21. The remaining amount was to be deposited in an interest-bearing account to enable the child meet his day-to-day needs. The SC had also directed authorities to provide him artificial limbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-gives-haryana-six-weeks-to-issue-tender-for-artificial-limbs-to-panipat-boy/story-QSqdkCRjfQMqyl7AxTfvhL.html

03-09-2020||Lucknow||BJP candidate Zafar Islam set to win Rajya Sabha bypoll||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) UP unit general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla withdrew his candidature for by-elections to the lone Rajya Sabha (RS) seat from the state on Thursday, thereby clearing the way for the party’s original nominee Syed Zafar Islam to be elected to contest unopposed on Friday. Friday is the last date for the withdrawal of nominations and now with just Zafar left in the fray, the RS election process will not be stretched till September 11—the bypoll date—as the RS bypoll has now been reduced to a no-contest. Zafar Islam would add to BJP’s numbers in the RS at the cost of Samajwadi Party whose MP Amar Singh’s demise in Singapore on August 1 necessitated the RS bypoll. After being elected, Zafar Islam would serve the remainder of Amar Singh’s term till July 4, 2022.On Tuesday, Shukla had filed his papers and, soon after, an independent candidate Mahesh Chandra Sharma filed his papers as well.Sharma’s nomination was rejected the next day itself as he didn’t have the backing of 10 MLAs as required under the election rules while Shukla— who had filed the nomination to cover up for any technical glitches in Zafar’s nomination—withdrew on Thursday. “Yes, Govind ji has withdrawn his candidature and now the BJP candidate Zafar Islam is the lone candidate in the fray,” confirmed BJP general secretary JPS Rathore, who is expected to collect the certificate confirming Zafar’s election as RS MP from returning officer Brij Bhushan Dubey after 3 pm on Friday—the deadline set for withdrawal of nominations.Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna who had filed the nominations on Saturday on behalf of Zafar, who was ill and admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), is also expected to accompany Rathore. Zafar who had taken oath from AIIMS at the time of filing of nomination—it is a mandatory requirement for all RS candidates to take oath before the returning officer—has now been discharged. However, party leaders said he may not be able to make it to Lucknow on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bjp-candidate-zafar-islam-set-to-win-rajya-sabha-bypoll/story-LsZOSPlYXcjbHdi9mSOi3K.html
03-09-2020||Lucknow||Rakesh Pandey ‘encounter’: NHRC seeks UP DGP reply in 6 weeks||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought Uttar Pradesh police chief H C Awasthy’s response to a complaint questioning the genuineness of the exchange of fire in which gangster Mukhtar Ansari’s alleged aide, Rakesh Pandey, was gunned down on August 9, the complainant said.Social activist and lawyer Nutan Thakur, the complainant, said Awasthy has been asked to respond within six weeks and NHRC has fixed the next hearing in the matter on October 23.Thakur said she reported the matter to NHRC on August 10 following allegations of Rakesh Pandey’s father, Baldutt Pandey, that his son was picked up from his house in Lucknow a few hours before he was claimed to have been killed in the exchange of fire. Baldutt Pandey also stated that most of the cases against his son had ended and they did not even know when a 50,000 reward was declared on his head.Thakur said the sequence of events leading to the killing raised many questions. “The case in Audyogik Thana of Prayagraj in which a reward has been declared on Rakesh does not even mention him as an accused... Besides, STF [Special Task Force] sleuths claimed that the Innova car in which Rakesh Pandey was travelling hit a tree while police chased him but there is no dent on it.”Rakesh Pandey, Ansari, and another gangster were accused of killing Bharatiya Janata Party leader Krishnanand Rai in 2005 but were acquitted in July 2019. He had at least 10 criminal cases registered against him between 1993 and 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rakesh-pandey-encounter-nhrc-seeks-up-dgp-reply-in-6-weeks/story-hT7koN55FRIlGVBxHNQ2TI.html
03-09-2020||Mumbai||Exercise restraint while reporting on Sushant Singh Rajput case: HC to media||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the media to exercise restraint while reporting on the actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case and also asked representatives of television news channels to be present on September 10 – the next date of the hearing of the two petitions filed by social activists and former senior officials of Maharashtra Police. The court asked the media to report the case in line with the ongoing investigation.The petitioners have approached the court seeking a restraint on the TV channels from carrying out a trial by media in the Rajput case.They cited that the non-stop biased coverage would prejudice the minds of the public and would also tarnish the image of the Mumbai Police. A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices AA Sayed and SP Tavade, while hearing the petition filed by social activists Nilesh Navlakha, Mahibub Shaikh and Subhash Chander Chaba was informed by senior advocate Devadatt Kamat that the media houses be directed from not going overboard while reporting the Rajput case. Kamat pointed out that some of the TV channels had overstepped the guidelines laid down in the programme code as per the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and were conducting a media trial by exposing names and details of those named in the case. He submitted that some TV channels had named police officials and passed their judgements on the names mentioned in the first information report (FIR) even though the investigation was still in progress.Senior advocate Dr Milind Sathe and advocate Chetan Kapadia represented the former senior officials of Maharashtra Police. The petitioners include former director-generals of police (DGPs) PS Pasricha, K Subramaniam, D Shivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal, Satish Chandra Mathur; ex-commissioners of Mumbai Police Mahesh N Singh and Dhananjay N Jadhav; and former chief of Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Maharashtra Police, KP Raghuvanshi.Dr Sathe submitted that the media coverage of the Rajput case was irresponsible and would create prejudice among the public about the investigation. He argued that the round-the-clock biased coverage of the case was also detrimental to the image of the Mumbai Police and, as a result, the court should restrain the TV channels from running a media trial. He prayed before the court to direct the government and media regulators to lay down guidelines for the mode and manner of coverage of any pending high-profile investigation, particularly the Rajput case. Additional Solicitor-General (ASG) Anil Singh, who appeared on behalf of the Central government, said he needed time to respond since the copy of the petition --- filed by the former senior officials of Maharashtra Police -- was served to him late at night on Wednesday. He also submitted that as the petitions involved media houses, they should also be allowed to defend their actions before the court passes any order. The bench heard the submissions and passed a brief order. “The media should exercise restraint and report the case as per the investigation,” the bench observed.The court also directed the TV channels named in the petitions to be present for the next hearing of the case on September 10. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA), a private body of various TV channels, has been asked to file its reply before September 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exercise-restraint-while-reporting-on-sushant-singh-rajput-case-hc-to-media/story-b2MBBE3tsSL6jlyj18XMbK.html

03-09-2020||Pune||Pune sees rise in Covid cases during two-week Ganesh festivities||While Pune is known for its lavish and traditional Ganesh celebrations every year, this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, government authorities urged people to stay indoors and even bid goodbye to bappa in a sombre way inside their homes. However, it was seen that people started coming out for festival shopping and some were even seen arguing with police officials at the riverbanks to carry out visarjan as usual. This lack of discipline form people could have led to a rise in the new cases that the city is seeing. As per the state health department, for every 1,000 new cases reported from the district 23 deaths are reported. As per figures by the state health department, with the eleven-day celebrations, the district recorded 37,968 cases in 12 days between August 22 and September 2nd while in the same period of 12 days between August 10 and August 21, the district reported 31,110 cases which is 6,858 cases more during the festivities as compared to the weeks before. While the police authorities and district administration had urged people to stay indoors and celebrate this year’s Ganesh Chaturthi in a simple way following social distancing norms and wearing masks, however it was seen across the city especially in peth areas that the jubilations continued. State director of health services Dr Archana Patil said, “Due to increased movement among people after the lockdown was lifted and also Ganpati festivities, we saw crowded marketplaces and public areas which is what has led to an increased number of cases. It is true that we are observing people not following social distancing norms or not even wearing masks.” The common crowded places were Shivaji road, Mandai and Bajirao road for shopping and during visarjan crowded roads included peth areas namely Kasba peth, Tambdi Jogeshwari and Tulsibaug. On social media, photos of politicians including Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol not wearing masks and surrounded by crowds were seen. Mohol recently tested his blood sample to donate plasma after he completely recovered of Covid-19 infection almost a month ago. Pune police too have urged people to stay indoors but at many places including along the river or at prime shopping areas including Laxmi road and Tulsibaug where crowded streets were a common site during and before the festivities began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-sees-rise-in-covid-cases-during-two-week-ganesh-festivities/story-u2BYDsvqhaXsCNvQ0tLxYP.html

The impact had caused glass and debris to fall in neighbouring buildings as well,” he said.“While Bhondwe’s wife and daughter were in the house, he switched on the gas early in the morning before heading to work, according to the officials. The gas had leaked for hours probably which is why it caused such an explosion,” he said.It took two fire brigade officials and 15 Jawans about 15 minutes to bring the situation under control.On August 9, a 40-year-old man was killed while ten others were injured in a similar case in Dighi area of Pimpri Chinchwad. The cylinder had exploded at 6:30 am when the family was asleep.In 2019, 284 accidental fire cases caused by cooking gas cylinder of the stove were recorded in Maharashtra. The 284 incidents claimed 285 lives in 2019, as per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/10-injured-in-cylinder-blast-at-two-story-building-in-wadgaonsheri/story-8pxv2p1uOlBkA4KJVqwdpN.html

Ganesh Punalkar, whose father is undergoing treatment at Jumbo facility located at College of Engineering, Pune, (COEP), said he has no clue about health status of father. “My father is admitted from the last four days at Jumbo Covid hospital and we are trying to contact him on his mobile phone. But it’s battery is discharged. Even reception desk at the Covid centre is not giving proper information,” said Punalkar.From shortage of doctors and inadequate equipment, to lack of coordination, the newly set up Jumbo facility has invited wrath from many patients and their relatives. Ashish Mane, social activist said, “One of my friends and his father both are Covid positive. Father is admitted at jumbo facility but for the last four days there has been no communication with him. Even the family members do not know his health status.” Set up on August 23, Jumbo facility has 600 oxygenated and 200 ICU beds. However even after 10 days, the facility is still not equipped with adequate number of doctors and medical staff. “It is a sad truth that despite ample time, administration has not been able to recruit adequate number of doctors and equipments here,” said Pune MP Girish Bapat.Lifeline hospital Management, which was responsible for recruitment of medico manpower and running the facility denied the charges that doctors and nurses are short staffed. Sujit Patkar, one of the partner at Lifeline hospital Management said, “There is enough manpower in the jumbo facility. Manpower is enough and as per planned phase deployment.” Amit Bagul, congress party’s city unit secretary said, “Jumbo facility is the worst. There are many complaints about food and admission. Though it has 800 capacity, hardly 30 percent of patients are there. I have phone records where the doctors from the jumbo facility are accepting that the ventilators are not installed yet. Even many issues in ICU wards. As the infrastructure work is not completed the hospital is showing that there is zero vacancy.” Bharatiya Janata Party’s city unit president Jagdish Mulik heavily came down on the Maha Vikas Aghadi over the jumbo facility. Mulik said, “State government did hurry in the inauguration of the jumbo hospital. The agency should announce how much manpower, doctors, nurses are provided for the facility till date. The government machineries did not have any control over the jumbo facility and it is run by private organisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/staff-shortage-poor-coordination-pune-s-jumbo-covid-facility-invites-patients-wrath/story-c9XtAjiMwlKYdPffbf2kEM.html

All these idols which are collected will be immersed in water by authorities,” said Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner on Tuesday. Sanskar Pratisthan has been doing this work since the last 27 years in association with the PCMC.“In ten days a total of 31,754 Ganesh idols were donated to us.

The immersion of the Ganesh idols till continue until Wednesday afternoon,” said Mohan Gaikwad, director of Sanskar Pratisthan. Many people donated idols for the first time as ghats were sealed. “I had heard about Sanskar Pratisthan a few years back, but I used to do it by on my own at Chinchwad ghat but this year me and many families from our society donated idols to them. They (Sanskar Pratisthan) have ensured proper immersion will be done by concerned authorities,” added Nupur Nagpure, a resident of Chapekar Chowk.

He earns around Rs 300 a day and our family is facing difficult times during the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, he bought the smartphone on instalments two months ago so that I could attend my online classes,” says Kusum Kumari, a resident of Fatehpuri Mohalla in Jalandhar.“My 18-year-old brother had to drop out of school due to our financial condition. He now works as a driver. But my father wants me to study and I want to make him proud by becoming an IAS officer one day,” she says.“My father didn’t want technology to come in the way of my education and I knew he wouldn’t be able to afford another phone so my studies would get affected if the snatchers had their way. Those were the thoughts racing in my mind as I desperately fought the snatchers,” says the teenager.‘LEARNING TAEKWONDO HELPED’Kusum suffered a wrist injury in the incident at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar near the Jalandhar-Kapurthala road after the pillion rider on the motorcycle, Avinash Kumar, 23, snatched her phone when she was returning home from tuition on Sunday afternoon.She ran behind them and didn’t give up even when she was attacked with a knife.

He was also released from jail two months ago. Both the accused became friends in the jail. Vinod’s family members are also on run since he was booked in this case. Police sources said he took to crime to make easy money after the death of his father a few years ago.Both the accused belong to poverty-stricken families.POLITICIANS MAKE A BEELINEMeanwhile, Kusum is getting free treatment at a private hospital in Jalandhar and people, including local politicians, are making a beeline to meet the gritty girl.The local administration has given her Rs 51,000 as a reward and is recommending her name for state and national bravery awards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gritty-girl-of-jalandhar-who-took-on-phone-snatchers-says-her-only-fear-was-missing-online-classes/story-4Ppob6v0ZMIuX4MAB3JLJI.html

We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would’ve started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi,” he said.The national capital recorded 2,509 fresh cases, the highest single-day spike in nearly two months, on Wednesday. As many as 1,79,569 people have been infected in the city, while 19 fresh deaths took the toll to 4,481 on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters, Jain said people “should not stress about numbers”. The government was increasing the testing for Covid-19, he added. “We are increasing (the number of) tests. We are emphasising on testing and working aggressively on it. Yesterday, the number was around 30,000 and today the number of tests will be around 35,000,” he said.Delhi’s case-fatality ratio was 0.75 per cent on Wednesday, the minister said, adding that it was a ‘good sign’. “Overall, it is 2.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was less than one per cent, which is a good sign. At one time, it was 3.5 per cent,” the minister said.When asked about city’s preparation for resumption of Delhi Metro services, he said that government was forming protocols to be followed. “Protocols are being formulated. Dry run is also being done so that it can be ensured that social distancing is maintained, people wear mask and clean their hands - that they follow a Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he said.The Delhi Metro will resume services in three stages between September 7 and 12, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.

Soni’s teacher from Godda, who had helped her fill up the form to get admission in the MP, said a car was being arranged for students from Godda and we had to pay Rs 30,000 for it.”Soni said Kumar had been jobless for the last 4 months and it was not possible to hire a car. “I got disheartened and said to my husband that I wouldn’t be able to write the exam,” said Soni.

03-09-2020||Patna||Yashwant Sinha’s UDA, Kejriwal’s AAP to add zing to Bihar assembly polls||While the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Grand Alliance (GA) are the major formations face to face in the forthcoming Bihar assembly election 2020, efforts to give shape to a third front has also quietly picked up momentum adding some zing to the election, otherwise seen as a direct NDA vs GA fight. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the United Democratic Alliance and some other political parties are aiming to provide an alternative to voters in Bihar. UDA, headed by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, is reportedly in talks with AAP. Last year AAP had offered Sinha a seat to contest Lok Sabha elections from New Delhi but it did not materialize then. However, Sinha’s proximity with AAP is well known. In May this year, Sinha, who has been consistently critical of the Narendra Modi government, had sat on joint dharna at Rajghat in New Delhi with AAP leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, demanding proper arrangements for migrant workers to get back home. They were later detained. Defying his 80-plus age, Sinha has been criss-crossing the state for the last few weeks after announcing his return to active politics in June. He says he is in the Bihar assembly elections fray to change the “stage-managed narrative of 15 years versus 15 years” and provide an “alternative that people could believe in”, despite being aware that it will take no less than a miracle to create any room considering the present caste-based poll arithmetic in the state. “We have formed UDA, which includes 16 smaller parties and senior leaders bound by a common ideology, to give Bihar an alternative it is yearning for. I have covered almost two-thirds of the state and the remaining one-third will be completed soon. Everyone knows what we are here for. Even AAP knows it,” said Sinha, adding UDA would keep away from anyone with corruption and criminal taint. Also Read: With hundreds of Oximeter centres, AAP gets ‘closer’ to people in BiharUDA includes former Jehanabad MP Arun Kumar, five-time MP from Jhanjharpur Devendra Prasad Yadav, former union minister Nagmani, former Bihar ministers Narendra Singh and Renu Kushwaha and several others.“The moment ticket distribution starts, we know many more will be interested in joining us after getting discarded by their own parties, but we have our benchmark,” said a senior leader of the new alliance. Sources in the UDA said that Sinha and AAP getting closer was a possibility considering their compatibility. However, they ruled out any truck with former MP Pappu Yadav’s party. Bihar AAP chief Sushil Singh said that the party’s Bihar incharge Sanjay Singh might be talking to Sinha. “It is all up to the senior leaders. AAP, in the meanwhile, is working on the ground to ascertain its poll strategy and decide the number of seats it should contest. Good people are always welcome,” he added. Also Read:NDA gets a boost in poll-bound Bihar as Jitan Manjhi’s party joins it A senior AAP leader said that even Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) could join the emerging third front if the GA did not treat it properly during seat sharing. “We can see the discomfort Upendra Kushwaha is in. If he wants, he can join our fight. We are open to people with a clean image,” he added. RLSP principal general secretary Madhav Anand said talks for seat sharing were underway within the GA. “At present, there is no move to leave GA, as we hope things will work out during the talks. A normal seat sharing formula could be arrived on the basis of Lok Sabha seats contested. We had contested five seats and that converts into around 30 assembly seats. With new allies joining the GA, we know all constituents will be required to make some adjustments, but it has to be reasonable and proportionate. We hope the GA will decide it amicably,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/yashwant-sinha-s-uda-kejriwal-s-aap-to-add-zing-to-bihar-assembly-polls/story-xx8zmNgmt2bDRBI6AHbfYK.html

It’s for the first time in 30 years in the business that he’s come across such a lean patch. He’s one of the wedding card printers in town who have been dealt a blow by the Covid-19 pandemic. With a restricted gathering of close relatives, invitation cards that were an integral part of the big fat Punjabi wedding and considered the first impression to the extravaganza, have become a thing of the past. Though the government has announced relaxations for weddings of late but card printers are still struggling for orders. “Three wedding seasons in April, July and August are over and I didn’t get a single printing order! Weddings are limited to family members due to the restriction on the number of guests. So people don’t find any need to get cards printed,” says Khanna. Kawaljeet Singh of JK Press admits, “I find it difficult to recall when we got our last order to print wedding cards. There has been a 90% decline in the business since the first lockdown in March. Before that, we used to receive an order to print 500 to 800 cards per wedding.” PRINTING AT A STANDSTILL Not only wedding cards, other services of the printing industry have also been hit by the pandemic. Printing work related to books, notebooks, government content and advertising material has come to a standstill. Parvesh Mangla, the president of Patiala Printing Association, says, “Schools are not open so orders for study-related content are not coming. Almost half of the government work is at a standstill. We’re not getting any printing order from the government. Besides, printing orders of advertising material such as pamphlets and brochures besides hoardings is awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-pandemic-rings-alarm-bells-for-wedding-card-printers-in-patiala/story-kJ9fSC1y48yBaHEwMDkXLJ.html

The data collected through Global Positioning System for the exercise will be compiled to bring out a detailed ‘sarus atlas’ of Uttar Pradesh, mapping nesting, feeding, and breeding sites of the bird. The document thus developed will be very helpful in formulating a policy for its conservation, the officials said.The sarus is found mainly in Uttar Pradesh’s Etawah, Mainpuri and Shahjahanpur districts. But their population is on the decline due to the use of pesticides and the birds being preyed upon.Sarus (Grus antigone) is the tallest flying bird found in wet and agricultural lands in Asia. The officials said several surveys of the bird have been done in Uttar Pradesh but now a complete mapping of sarus habitats is being done for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/lucknow-university-begins-survey-of-up-s-state-bird-sarus/story-jaioHOve8WI4uMKC9IJjrJ.html

Our workers will be engaged in all of Bihar to win the elections and in the interest of the state, we will form the NDA government,” the HAM leader said.“We felt that there is nepotism and corruption in Lalu Prasad Yadav’s leadership in Mahagathbandhan,” he added.Manjhi was earlier part of the NDA but left the alliance to join ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (Grand Alliance) in 2018.HAM, which contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in coalition with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)- Congress alliance could not win even a single seat in Bihar and broke its ties with ‘Mahagathbandhan’ last month.Manjhi was a minister under the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar government. In the 2014 general election, Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) decided to leave NDA and contested polls but lost badly.Later, Manjhi replaced Kumar after the latter resigned taking moral responsibility for his party’s defeat.After a dramatic episode, Manjhi resigned from the post which paved way for Nitish Kumar’s return at the helm. He later floated his own party, Hindustani Awam Morcha, and joined hands with BJP-led NDA to contest 2015 Assembly polls. However, ‘Mahagathbandhan’ emerged victorious and Kumar returned as Chief Minister.Due to some differences, JDU severed ties with ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in 2017 but later secured support from BJP to run the state government.

03-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: When nobody had a mobile number||Until a year ago, this place was a professional bawarchi’s (cook’s) kitchen. You would see tubs full of onion rings. On some evenings, the street outside would be lined with degs (vessels) containing shorbas and biryanis.And today the same place is crammed with.... well, let’s start with the old rotary dial landline telephone. The black beauty is lying atop a dusty radio, which is from the days when radios used to be as hefty as CRT TVs. A narrow ledge on the wall is supporting a loud speaker, a broken clock, a cassette player (whatever that is!) and even an exhaust fan, one of those tiny ones that are installed in the kitchen.“This is my antique shop,” says shopkeeper Atik Rehman. The dimly lit establishment in Old Delhi’s Galli Chooriwallan looks like a cave, and most of it is piled up with a mound of indecipherable objects—some of which might be considered antique.Mr Rehman, a resident of nearby Matia Mahal Bazar, has been in the business of old things for about two decades, but he took up this shop space on rent only some months ago.This morning he is on his own in the shop, sitting behind his desk, by the telephone and the radio. His left arm is plopped up beside what looks like one of those cute-looking speakers of old desktop computers, that were in vogue at the turn of the century. Now, this thing might not be antique but it sure is something you no longer see.The pull of this place is in its bizarreness. You might be repelled by the gloomy darkness of the place and exit it immediately—or, you might happily spend an entire day here, sorting through objects, some of which you will find totally useless and some with possibilities of archival beauty. Mr Rehman doesn’t go about the city to collect these items. “Kabadiwallas who gather rejects from across the city come to me, and I pick up the things I want from their pheris (carts).”One of the charms of this place is that it has a great amount of utilities that were in everyday use just two or three decades ago, and have now completely disappeared. Their sight starkly jolts you—how quickly we have moved on, leaving behind the memories of stuff that until recently were an integral part of our living. (For instance, there’s even an iPod in the litter, one of the early ones, that looked like a slim long box you could hang around your neck.)If you came of age in the 90s, come here to find the souvenirs of your teenage years. If you are a millennial, step in to see how life was in the time of your fuddy-duddy cousins.The shop opens daily from 8am to 8pm. The telephone is for ₹5,000, and the radio is for twice that amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-when-nobody-had-a-mobile-number/story-UxfZLbsqlBtMJguJHrsxaK.html

Recently in ARIIA ranking we were ranked 2 in the country and now in Times ranking, we are ranked 4.

With the innovation buzz at the university, our research output has increased. Our faculty deserves all credit for being productive and ensuring that they walk the talk with students,” said Dr Ashish Jain, director of PU’s internal quality assurance cell.Dr Jain said they were working on the grey spots as well to make a mark globally. “I am confident, with the present pace, that should happen soon,” he added.SOCIAL CARDI am aware that to compete at a global scale, we have to also focus on our industry income and international outlook.

The result will be given within eight hours and until then, the airport operator will make sure that passengers are made to sit in a place with basic facilities, including Wi-Fi, food and washrooms. Sources said that both Mumbai and Delhi have prepared the awaiting lounge (area) in order to commence this facility.HT tried to clarify from ministry of civil aviation if pilot basis meant that the facility would, as of now, be restricted to handful airports, however, a reply from the ministry was awaited till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/airports-to-test-international-passengers-for-covid-19-on-pilot-basis/story-WL0QMBp334OEg8ZH2HNMAL.html

Chirag Bhatia of Chandigarh said he was pretty confident about the inorganic chemistry part of the exam. “The delay worked out in my favour as I got extra time to revise the syllabus and was able to read more reference books.” Avneet Kaur of Mohali added, “Both physics and math were a little tougher, but chemistry was high-scoring.” Tanish Kohli of Chandigarh discussed how the sample papers of the NTA were tougher than the exam on Wednesday, but Harsh Nagar said his January attempt had gone much better. Arshdeep from Kharar said the paper wasn’t too long and he was able to finish it before time with sufficient time to revise.All students said that the protocols to maintain social distancing and hygiene were followed meticulously. Students were frisked without touching and markings were made for them to line up. They were given a three-ply mask to wear during the paper and the centers were thoroughly sanitised between the two shifts. Even parents were impressed. SP Singh, a Chandigarh-based banker whose son took the exam, said the organisers had done a professional job and the police didn’t let any crowds in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/day-2-of-jee-main-chandigarh-students-find-chemistry-easy-most-scoring/story-oMGpbxYC4rVDNBSUNQY0JO.html
03-09-2020||City||GMADA to auction 65 properties in Mohai by September end||Trying its luck amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) will hold an e-auction of 65 residential and commercial properties by the end of September after slashing the reserve price by 10%. The last auction was held in February when the authority had decreased the reserve price by 20% and managed to sell 32 of the 67 properties. Thereafter, GMADA planned another auction from July 21, but postponed it amid the rising Covid-19 cases.“We have not decided the date yet, but will be holding the auction in September itself. The reserve prices will be finalised soon after 10% reduction. We are hopeful of getting a good response this time,” said Sanjeev Kumar, estate officer of GMADA.The 65 proprieties on offer include 16 residential properties, with plots ranging between 100 and 500 square yards. These are located in Eco City-1, Sector 64, 61 and 56. As many as 25 booths to be auctioned are in Sectors 59, 60, 61, 63 and 65. Six SCO/SCF/SSS are located in Sectors 61, 53, 56 and 64. Seven IT Industrial plots are in Sectors 83 and 101. Besides this, a hotel site in Sector 66-B, one school site in Eco City-1, three group housing sites — one in Sector 66 and two in Medicity, will also be on offer.“Due to recession, we had been demanding slashing of the reserve price. Though the 10% reduction in prices will evoke good response, GMADA should go for an open auction instead of e-auction for a healthy competition,” said Shailander Anand, former president, Mohali Property Consultants Association (MPCA).What GMADA sold in February? In the auction held in February this year, a 352 square metre plot in Sector 65 had gone for the highest price of Rs 1.93 crore against a reserve price of Rs 1.85 crore.An SCO of 100 square metres went for Rs 4.33 crore against the reserve price of Rs 3.60 crore. Besides, an industrial plot of 20,882 square metres was sold for Rs 32 crore against the reserve price of Rs 28 crore. GMADA had also auctioned three hotel sites in Sector 66-B.

Himmat Jakhar told the police that in August last year, he had come in contact with one Punyamanthula Navya Radhakrishan, who wanted to sell a Mercedes GLS 400 through a website. He bought the vehicle for Rs 52 lakh, but on verification, found that a loan was outstanding against it. But, Radhakrishan assured him that the loan was cleared and an NOC was awaited from the bank. He later also submitted an NOC to Jakhar, who found out that it was fake and the loan was still outstanding.When Jakhar confronted Radhakrishan, he agreed to refund the money, but failed to keep his promise, following which the former filed a police complaint. The vehicle was originally registered in the name of Radhakrishan’s father. After he passed away, the car was transferred in the name of their relative, Chinta Shankar Rao.

03-09-2020||Chandigarh||Roll back toll rate hike: Surjewala||Condemning the increase of toll rates on highways in Haryana, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday urged the government to roll back the hike immediately. In a statement, Surjewala said the toll rates have been increased by the government for the second time during the coronavirus pandemic, which showed their “insensitivity”. “When people are facing economic recession, the government is rubbing salt into their wounds by issuing such orders,” he added. Surjewala reminded that a heavy tax in the form of road tax was levied by the state government on the purchase of new vehicles and “it is also a matter of record that the Khattar-Chautala government of the state has been repeatedly increasing VAT on petrol and diesel for the last six years”. He said there are 32 national highways and three national expressways with a total length of 3,531km in Haryana. “Often, one has to use NH to go from one district to the other. In such a situation, the toll rate hike would increase inflation and directly affect transporters and a large number of people using private vehicles,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roll-back-toll-rate-hike-surjewala/story-EYjSaCXFKzg5cSmfVElSOI.html

The deceased has been identified as Sandeep Kaswan of the same village. His three partners — Dinesh, Anil and Jasbir — have also sustained injuries in the attack. In his complaint, Dinesh said all four of them were sitting at a liquor shop on Tuesday evening. “Led by Daiyar sarpanch’s husband Jaibir, the assailants, including, Meva Singh, Sahil, Lilu Ram, Ramesh and 11 others, came in three vehicles there around 8.30pm and opened fire on us. Sandeep died on the spot, while we three got injured. Anil and Jasbir are undergoing treatment at a private medical facility in Hisar,” Dinesh, who has been discharged from the hospital, added. He claimed that the assailants also threatened them with dire consequences.Ongoing conflict between sarpanch’s husband, victimFatehabad DSP Ajayab Singh said Sandeep and sarpanch’s husband Jaibir were at loggerheads over several issues, primary of which was the sale of liquor.“The complainant told us that Jaibir and his aides had been smuggling liquor for past many years. The victim, along with his partners, had secured the tender to run a liquor vend at Daiyar village. We suspect that the assailants were from a rival group and they had an old enmity over sale of liquor in the area,” he added.The DSP said they have started an investigation and launched a manhunt to nab the accused. The police have booked the accused under sections 302, 120-B, 148, 149, 323, 380, 427 and 452 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 25 of the Arms Act.Third such incident in last two monthsThis is the third such incident in the last two months in the region where a rival group has attacked a contractor. Last month, Meham police had booked 11 people belonging to rival group for allegedly firing at a liquor trader’s house in Behlamba village. Similarly, two liquor contractors were shot dead at Sirsa’s Chautala village in July. The accused, after their arrest, had confessed that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang was behind the murders.It’s pertinent to mention here that in November 2015, Haryana minister Anil Vij had left the meeting of district grievances and public relations committee after a spat with Sangeeta Kalia, the then Fatehabad superintendent of police. She had reportedly refused to obey his order to leave the venue following heated exchanges over the alleged illegal liquor trade in Fatehabad. Vij had justified his stand, saying that he was getting complaints of drug and liquor mafias being active in the area, but the police had failed to put a check.However, the officer had refused to leave the meeting and even objected to the minister’s mannerism. Vij had then left the meeting himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-contractor-shot-dead-three-injured-in-fatehabad/story-QI4sv2pHzZMGpXY9CjbvTJ.html
03-09-2020||Chandigarh||Upgrading sewage treatment plants: Chandigarh MC finally issues commencement letters to three firms||The Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) has finally allotted work contracts to three companies for upgrading the five sewage treatment plants (STP) in the city.The ₹280-crore project of revamping the STP at Diggian in Mohali has been allotted to Larsen & Toubro, which was one of the four companies in the fray. Of the seven firms that applied for upgrading the STPs at Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd, the CSCL has chosen GSJ Environment Limited at ₹123 crore. For the Dhanas and 3BRD plants, the ₹74-crore contract has been given to Passavant Environment Private Limited.“The CSCL has issued the commencement letters. The projects are estimated to be completed within two years,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL.The CSCL will bear the principal cost of upgrading the five STPs, and the municipal corporation will operate and maintain these STPs for the next 15 years.After failing to get any response on its previous tenders, the CSCL had divided the five-plant project into three different tenders. In October last year, CSCL had floated a ₹700-crore tender to hire a single agency to upgrade all the five plants. However, the MC General House in November had not endorsed the proposal. Settling the matter, the UT administration in its letter to CSCL and MC had asked to cancel the existing tender and split it into three parts.The National Green Tribunal (NGT), too, had directed the MC to upgrade the plants or face penalty. The effluent discharge from four of civic body’s five STPs into Ghaggar tributaries has much higher biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) level than the latest permissible level of 10mg/litre. A low BOD is an indicator of good quality water, while a high BOD indicates polluted water.None of the STPs in Chandigarh has the requisite machinery to deal with faecal coliform, a major water pollutant after BOD level, the most probable number (MPN) value for which needs to be contained below 230 MPN/100.Apart from polluting the Ghaggar, higher BOD level is affecting the quality of treated water MC is releasing from these STPs for the irrigation of public and private parks. Due to this, treated water stinks due to which private households use it less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/upgrading-sewage-treatment-plants-chandigarh-mc-finally-issues-commencement-letters-to-three-firms/story-SkX4vHYHv3JKMZl4DAKafM.html

No further monitoring is required in this case. The applications for intervention/ impleadment stand disposed of accordingly. No further monitoring is called for. The miscellaneous applications stand disposed of accordingly,” reads the August 25 apex court order.The CBI had in January 2019 registered a criminal case against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, an official and 15 real estate developers in the land matter.Apex court’s displeasure over probeThe apex court on December 2, 2019, however, had expressed its displeasure over the manner in which the central agency had investigated the case. “We are not happy with the way in which the CBI has investigated the matter. Let the CBI director look into the same. We expect a fair, independent and impartial investigation to be made in the matter, which is being supervised by this court,” the apex court had said.Earlier also, after the CBI had filed the final report on April 27, 2019, the SC had expressed its dissatisfaction since the investigating agency had failed to come up with a deadline to complete the probe and submit a chargesheet in the court.‘Handover possession of property to buyer’The apex court in its August 25 order also directed the builders to handover the possession of properties to the applicants as expeditiously as possible. “Prayer has been made in these applications to direct the builder to handover the possession. Haryana’s senior additional advocate general said there is no objection in handing over the possession by the builder to the buyers. Accordingly, we direct the builder to handover the possession in accordance with law to the applicants as expeditiously as possible. The judgment and order passed by this court will not come in the way of the applicants,” the SC said.The apex court though said that as stated by Haryana’s additional advocate general, the conveyance deed be subject to ultimate outcome of the CBI investigation and appropriate order to be passed thereupon by the court concerned.“It is further stated by the additional advocate general that occupation certificate is also being issued. Let the occupation certificate be issued as expeditiously as possible,” the SC said.The case being probedThe Congress government had in June 2009 issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 1,407 acres for developing residential sectors 58-63 and commercial sectors 65-67 in Gurugram by the HUDA.The land sought to be acquired was spread across eight villages — Badshapur, Behrampur, Nangli Umarpura, Tigra, Ullahwas, Kadarpur, Ghatta and Medawas of Gurugram. However, while issuing the declaration under Section 6 on June 2, 2010, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. Finally, the award dated May 29, 2012, was passed for 87 acres only. The CBI in its preliminary inquiry had prima facie established irregularities in the release of land from acquisition process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurugram-land-release-case-supreme-court-not-to-monitor-cbi-probe-anymore/story-A2drOXxo1nqKMLZUQfkieJ.html
03-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC writes to Haryana Pollution Control Board to check discharge of untreated sewage in Sukhna choe||Municipal commissioner KK Yadav has shot off a letter to the Haryana Pollution Control Board seeking immediate corrective action on the untreated sewage being discharged in a nullah that merges with the Sukhna choe.In the letter dated September 1, Yadav states, “Untreated sewer water is being disposed into a nullah (choe) passing through Sector 7 and other areas of Panchkula. This choe merges into the Sukhna choe and finally goes into Ghaggar river, polluting it.”The executive committee, constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), on August 16 had directed the MC to take immediate action to identify the area discharging the effluent in the choe. It had also asked the MC to take action against the defaulting agency under the provisions of the Water Act.Yadav had formed a team headed by the MC chief engineer to examine the issue. The team had visited the site and observed that the polluted water was being discharged from Panchkula side. The matter was again discussed in a meeting of the executive committee on August 19. Thereafter, Yadav sent the letter to HPCB.NGT DIRECTIONS ON POLLUTION OF GHAGGARThe NGT panel has long sought checking of pollution in Sukhna choe, which carries water to Ghaggar river and the N-choe. In August last year, taking suo motu cognizance of media reports on pollution in Ghaggar, the NGT had directed the chief secretaries of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh to constitute a special task force (STF) to clean the river.Directions to 100% treat sewage water or pay environmental compensation had been issued to the administration.On its part, MC claims that all the sewage outlet points into Sukhna choe have been closed and instead contends the untreated water is being discharged from the choe coming from Panchkula.BOTH SUKHNA CHOE AND N-CHOE POLLUTEDWater quality of both the Sukhna choe and N-choe as monitored by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Board indicates that the level of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is much higher than the permissible limit of 10mg per litre. A low BOD is an indicator of good quality water, while a high BOD points at pollution.Sukhna choe and N-choe, which cross Chandigarh and merge with the Ghaggar, are among the river’s major pollutants. Even the quality of treated sewage that is discharged into these streams is poor because of outdated technology used in the MC–run treatment plants. These STPs are now being upgraded by the MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-writes-to-haryana-pollution-control-board-to-check-discharge-of-untreated-sewage-in-sukhna-choe/story-UF9rRI2hKhJWpI4Fs6mDnK.html

The victim has got her statement recorded before a magistrate. She said that she was taking civil services coaching from an institute in Sector 15, Chandigarh, in 2018, when she came in contact with the accused through a social networking website. The complainant said that she had asked Sarabjit to lend her some money, for which he asked her to meet him at the Sector 17 bus stand, from where he took her to a hotel on pretext of handing over the money. She said that the accused then gave her a drink laced with sedatives and raped her in the hotel and also took objectionable pictures of her. She added that the accused sexually exploited her after that by blackmailing to share the pictures with her fiancée. She alleged that in March 2018, Sarabjit and his friend had raped her in a hotel in Manimjara and then in July 2018 in a hotel in Amritsar.

The accused had already distributed these gloves to over 107 distributors.Police arrested four people in the case between August 18 and 23, while the fifth accused was arrested on August 28. The main accused in the entire racket is still absconding. Police first arrested Prashant Surve, 48 with four tonnes of disposable gloves from Belapur. Later they arrested Vipul Shah, 52, a resident of Malad; Nazeem Khan, 30, from Bhiwandi, and Afroz Shaikh, 36, from Malegaon. Around 15 lakh pairs of used gloves weighing 15 tonnes were seized from a Bhiwandi godown, while 19 lakh pairs weighing around 19 tonnes were seized from an Aurangabad godown. On August 28, police arrested Tarun Rammani, 40, who was hiding in Delhi. He was the prime distributor in Mumbai. The prime suppliers of the racket are based in Hyderabad and Bengaluru.

03-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Aarey Colony gets one-fifth of its area marked as reserve forest||In a significant decision, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday declared around one-fifth of the 3,166-acre Aarey Milk Colony as a “reserve forest”. However, proposed infrastructure projects, including the Mumbai Metro car depot, in Aarey — one of the last remaining green spaces in Mumbai — are not in the 600 acres and therefore, will continue to be executed. Several activists and citizen groups had staged protests opposing construction of the car shed. The state used sections under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, which gives powers to the state, to notify 600 acres near the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) as a reserve forest. The decision was taken after a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The state urban development department will invite suggestions and objections from people, giving them 45 days, following which it shall issue a notification in the official gazette.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray confirmed to HT that the Metro car shed will not be a part of this plan. He said that the 600 acres would only include open land in Aarey. He said: “[The] final survey will be undertaken soon. This [the plan] wouldn’t hold adivasi [tribal] lands and slums. [The] rehab plan is separate.”“After hearing suggestions and objections, the area to be excluded from the forest will be decided. But, the rights of the tribal community and others concerned will be protected while declaring it as forest,” said Thackeray in a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office. The statement added, “Roads, slums, tribal hamlets and other government structures will be exempted.” The state forest department also plans the rehabilitation of tribals within the 600 acres in phase one of the plan. A senior bureaucrat said, “The state will rehabilitate adivasis who have settled in the area now being made a reserve forest. The department will survey the total number of tribals and look for a suitable location for their rehabilitation.” The senior official added that there is also a plan to develop tourism on Aarey land, but that would be taken up after tribals are relocated. “A survey will be conducted of the remaining Aarey land for activities such as night safari or nature tourism,” he said requesting anonymity.Aaditya Thackeray further said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and urban development minister Eknath Shinde had a separate meeting on the car shed. HT had reported that chief minister Thackeray had recently chaired a meeting with all state officials to look at possible options for the Metro-3 car shed. One of the options being considered, officials said, was a plot in Pahadi Goregaon. With no appropriate decision on the car shed yet, the 33.5-km Metro-3 corridor is facing massive delays.Following the meeting, Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Forest& Environment Depts has decided to apply Section 4 of IFA to approximately 600 acres in Aarey land near SGNP. This implies that it will be declared a reserve forest after a hearing for suggestion/ objections. Approx 600 acres of open land being declared as forest while all rights of Adivasi communities will stand protected. Rehabilitation of slums within the area would be expedited. This wld be phase 1 for which the Forest Dept will move a proposal. Phase 2 survey for additional open/ forest land in Aarey, post Phase 1 will begin soon. This would help the State protect the flora & fauna existent in SGNP and Aarey, (sic).”Meanwhile, forest minister Sanjay Rathod said there were plans to protect remaining areas of Aarey apart from the 600 acres too. “A detailed proposal had been submitted before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last month, showing 600 acres to be declared as protected forests. Some additional areas have also been identified contiguous to SGNP and home to a large biodiversity that needs protection. The area identified falls outside the proposed development of the state. Once approved, a detailed mapping of the proposed zone will be done before proposing the draft notification,” he said.Environmentalists welcomed the state’s decision. “This is a step in the right direction and we would like to see this protective cover extended across all of Aarey. The value of Mumbai’s natural heritage has been recognised. It comes as a breather for wildlife after a six-year-battle for this recognition,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.The Shiv Sena had backed environmentalists and locals who opposed the construction of a Metro car depot in Aarey Milk Colony and had rejected a proposal for the axing of over 2,000 trees for the car shed construction in the tree authority of the Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The party in its manifesto ahead of the state elections in 2019 had promised to declare Aarey as ‘forest’ when they come to power. After coming to power, chief minister Thackeray had stayed work on Metro car depot construction and later appointed a panel to study if any alternative location is feasible for the car depot for the Colaba-Bandra-Seepz metro 3 corridor.(with inputs from Badri Chatterjee)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-aarey-colony-gets-one-fifth-of-its-area-marked-as-reserve-forest/story-Q7lNtdRsQa0co4BvPrtKUJ.html

Pradip Misar, uncle of the patient, has submitted a letter to the civic body chief Vijay Suryavanshi claiming that his family was charged ₹ 11,000 for plasma worth ₹7,000.“My nephew, who is a constable with Thane Police, is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Thane since August 31. As his health condition is severe, we decided to begin plasma treatment for him as per the doctor’s suggestions. We looked for donors by reaching out to many people including the local politicos,” said Misar. The family managed to get a donor and the donation was done at a private blood bank in a civic hospital in Kalyan. However, Misar alleged that the bill they gave was of ₹12,000. “The actual cost is ₹7,000; when we questioned them about the overcharge, they reduced the bill by ₹1,000. I have raised a complaint with the civic body,” added Misar. Epidemic officer of KDMC, Pratibha Panpatil said, “It is a private blood bank being operated at our civic hospital. We will inquire about the complaint from the patient’s relative and then take action if there is any overcharging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-patient-s-kin-complains-of-overcharging-for-plasma-at-blood-bank/story-yR6xAwNL7HUKIAHD1cBiEJ.html

The building’s 22 residents were able to evacuate in time, and no one was injured. The four-storeyed Safalya Sangali building at Majithia Park in Achole Road collapsed at 1.15am on Wednesday. The building had been redeveloped in 2009, but in 2018, major cracks had developed in parts of the structure.The Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) had declared the building dangerous and unfit for residents due to safety issues and had issued evacuation notices to the flat owners two years ago. Around 15 families had moved out, but five families, consisting of 22 residents continued to reside in the building. The building also housed 10 commercial shops which were shut after receiving the VVMC notices.“We could not afford the huge rent in other buildings, and we were fighting a court case against Abhay Naik, the builder as he had done a shoddy job using bad quality building materials. He had also constructed some illegal structures without approval from the VVMC. However, when it went for redevelopment, the building was legal, and the Vasai civic body had also given approval,” said a resident of Safalya Sangali, on condition of anonymity.A few of the residents had held a meeting on Tuesday evening after they noticed a large amount of fallen debris near the main gate, and they had decided to approach and complain to the Vasai civic body on Wednesday.Around 11.15pm, the residents heard some sounds of falling rubble and thought a mild tremor had occurred. They found that some portions of the structure had fallen, and more deep cracks were visible. The panicked residents left their flats and stood inside the building compound.Around 1am, one couple, Dayanandand Seema Deorukhkar, went to their fourth-floor flat to pick some petty cash and lock the apartment. Soon after they vacated the building and reached the gate of the compound at 1.15am, the structure collapsed. The Vasai civic fire brigade arrived at the spot and started clearing the debris. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) may be called in for further help if required. “A first information report (FIR) will be registered after the Vasai civic body informs us as it is the lookout of the civic authority,” said Vijaykant Sagar, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Vasai.“Despite warning the residents to shift out of the ramshackle building, five families continued to stay while the other 15 flat owners moved out. We are clearing the debris, and in a day or two we will submit a report to the Tulinj police to register an FIR against the guilty persons, and no one will be spared,” said a Vasai civic body official.The incident in Nallasopara comes just nine days after a five-storey building in Mahad, Raigad, collapsed, killing 16 people and injuring nine others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-redeveloped-building-in-nallasopara-collapses-22-residents-escape/story-0ox3ciOJmFrbVHJTLEZalM.html
03-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government’s extension on price cap for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals unrealistic: Medical associations||A day after the state health department extended the price cap on private hospitals for Covid-19 treatments for the next three months, medical associations on Tuesday called the decision unrealistic since it will further affect the economic stability of smaller hospitals. In April, the state government had mandated private hospitals to allocate 20% beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 80% beds were to be regulated by the civic body. On Monday, the health department issued a circular extending the duration of the price cap until November 30. The circular also stated that private hospitals can begin charging regular rates on 50% beds reserved for non-Covid patients, even as the government rates will apply to the remaining 50% beds meant for Covid-19 patients. In response, the Indian Medical Association (IMA)- Maharashtra in an open letter on Tuesday said such low rates will lead to the closure of smaller hospitals across the state. “The government agreed to hold a separate meeting on the issues. Unfortunately, the government unilaterally announced hospital rates without any discussion with IMA. Compliance with these rates is simply impossible. Small hospitals cannot sustain at these rates as they are already catering to affordable healthcare unlike big multi-bedded corporate hospitals,” reads the letter. State health minister Rajesh Tope didn’t respond to HT’s call or messages. The association has also criticised the government for not taking action against those who assaulted doctors involved in treating Covid-19 patients. “Many doctors have lost their lives while working on Covid-19 duty but they have not received any insurance or assistance from the government. If hospitals are compelled by such unilateral, impractical, anti-democratic, autocratic decisions, then IMA with its doctors will be compelled to think of alternative steps,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president IMA, Maharashtra. The Association of Medical Consultants (AMC) stated that the state government, in violation of the disaster management act, is not reimbursing private hospitals for the loss they are sustaining. “The government should reimburse the hospital for the vacant beds under the 80% scheme. The rates are unrealistic especially where multiple doctors are required,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of AMC. He also said the state government can’t decide on Covid-19 charges as the matter is under consideration in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-s-extension-on-price-cap-for-covid-19-treatment-at-private-hospitals-unrealistic-medical-associations/story-6jJbvUibk1tAxBcaDSDA0H.html

Officers claimed that opening of shops and markets during the festive season has led to the increase, as more cops were deputed on patrolling duty. Till Wednesday, 1,236 officers from the commissionerate had tested positive for Covid, of which 1,125 have recovered. So far, 16 Thane police personnel have died due to Covid. In early August, five to six cases were reported daily, however, the numbers have increased to 15 to 18 cases since mid-August. On Wednesday, 17 cops tested positive in Thane commissionarate, of which, 15 are from the Kalyan-Dombivli jurisdiction, and the remaining three are from Thane city. “Many shops and markets have started before the festive season. This led to crowding in the markets in most cities, for which more manpower from the police department was deployed. Most of them were standing for hours in heavy rain. All these factors led to an increase in cases in the last two weeks,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-covid-19-cases-among-thane-cops-due-to-increased-patrolling-duty-during-ganesh/story-0mwf0kQJ3vfDph94FutRLI.html
03-09-2020||Mumbai||With all eyes on Covid-19, malaria cases in Mumbai rose in August: BMC data||Even as civic officials are struggling to control the spread of Covid-19 cases, mosquito-borne malaria is now posing another challenge, with a rise in the number of cases to 1,137 in August, compared to 824 in August 2019. Most cases are being reported from G-South (Worli, Lower Parel, Prabhadevi), G-North (Dharavi, Dadar), M-East (Chembur) and E (Byculla) wards, which have also reported a large number of Covid-19 cases. Last month, for the first time since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recorded two deaths, where the duo was suffering from a combination of malaria and the coronavirus infection. These two deaths – from G-North and M-East civic wards, which were once hot spots for Covid-19 infection – broke the city’s decade-long record of zero fatalities due to malaria. Civic officials said fogging in these areas, which also comprise the biggest slums of Mumbai (G-North and M-East), is turning out to be problematic because many have locked their homes and left the city. Rajan Naringrekar, chief of the insecticide department, said, “In slums, people often store water in buckets and tanks. Now, as they have left, the unused water has become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. We can’t break open and fog their houses.” Due to the lockdown, most people have restricted their movements outside the house, making them an easy prey for mosquitoes from neighbouring breeding grounds. “As the work has come to a halt, the under-construction sites, too, aren’t getting cleaned,” he said. To prevent an outbreak of malaria, BMC has started a ‘construction drive’ where all construction workers will be examined and sites that are closed down will be inspected. “We have increased door-to-door surveillance in high-risk areas. Also, if anyone tests positive for malaria, we immediately conduct the rapid antigen test to find out if the person has Covid-19,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Meanwhile, cases of dengue have decreased to 10 from 134 last August. Civic officials expect dengue and leptospirosis cases to surge this month owing to monsoon flooding. In August, 45 leptospirosis, 53 gastroenteritis and 10 hepatitis cases were recorded in Mumbai. BMC has advised people to take a prophylactic medicine, Doxycycline, for leptospirosis, if they have waded through rainwater. As per BMC, three rounds of surveillance have been conducted in areas that witnessed flooding recently. A total of 671,663 houses have been surveyed and 35,021 adults have been given Doxycycline. However, activists have criticised the civic body for delaying monsoon preparations due to Covid-19. Jitendra Tandel from non-profit Rugna Kalyan Seva Samajik Sanstha said, “Every year, a large chunk of malaria cases are reported from slums like Dharavi and Govandi. Despite this, BMC didn’t fog these areas this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-all-eyes-on-covid-19-malaria-cases-in-mumbai-rose-in-august-bmc-data/story-MorLGEE1rOFN2GAXa7JkuM.html

Of them, 201 were in the past 48 hours, another 55 deaths were from last week, while the rest 36 deaths were from the period before that, health officials said. The death toll stood at 25,195. Along with fresh infections, the number of casualties continues to be highest across states in the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 3.5% on Wednesday, slightly less than Gujarat, which has the highest CFR in the country. On Tuesday, Gujarat’s CFR was 3.11% with 3,034 deaths (97,629 cases), according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they are working to bring down CFR to less than one percent. “Of the total patients, 80% are asymptomatic, 15% have mild symptoms and only 5% are in serious condition. We have brought down CFR to 3.5% and are working to reduce it to less than 1%,” he said at Doordarshan’s Sahyadri channel on Wednesday.The surge in cases is likely to increase further as fresh round of relaxations has come into effect from September 2. The state has allowed inter-district travel by removing a mandatory condition of e-pass required for travelling and allowed private passenger buses, mini buses to operate. It has allowed to increase the workforce in government and private offices between 30% to 50%. It has further allowed hotel, lodges and guesthouses to operate at their full strength.“The fresh relaxations simply mean withdrawing most of the restrictions. This will allow more people to step out of their homes and expose themselves to the virus and get infected, which is our only concern,” said a senior official from state health department. “The decision to continue curbs in 19 municipal corporations declared as red zones is fair as they still contribute most of the cases,” he added.Dr Pradeep Vyas, health secretary, said that the situation of the state is improving on all parameters. “Situation is continuously improving on all parameters. For instance, our recovery rate that was 56.3% at end of July has improved to 72.6%; week-on-week new case growth rate has now declined to 1.93%. The case doubling rate also improved to 36.3 days, which was 26.1 days in July,” he said.On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,622 cases, much higher than the daily number of cases seen in August, which ranged between 900 and 1,400. Its tally reached 148,569. Of them, active cases are 20,810.On June 27, Mumbai has reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases.City toll stands at 7,727 after 34 deathswere reported on Wednesday. Its case fatality rate (CFR) is 5.2% and discharge rate is 80.5%.Pune city continued to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,706 cases on Wednesday, taking its tally to 104,555. Nagpur becames third highest contributor with 1,184 cases, pushing its count to 23,595. Pimpri-Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), also recorded 1,006 cases and its tally went up to 49,794.Apart from them, Pune district, Jalgaon district, Satara district, Nashik city and Kalyan-Dombivli of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) continued to record high number of cases. They have recorded 902, 762, 683, 631 and 508 cases respectively.On Wednesday, the state conducted 72,248 tests and total number of tests conducted till date are 4,284,000.On the other side, the total number of infected patients recovered also inched close to 6-lakh after 13,959 recoveries reported in the last 24 hours. Its tally stood at 598,496 recoveries.The recovery rate improved to 72.48%, against the national average of 76.98%.

03-09-2020||Mumbai||State Election Commission may conduct polls for five civic bodies in Maharashtra together||The first set of local polls for five civic corporations that have completed their five-year term may be held simultaneously by the end of this year or early next year. The State Election Commission (SEC) on Tuesday held a review meeting to take stock of the Covid-19 situation and tap the possibility of conducting polls for local bodies that are completing their tenures by the year-end.The commission is expected to hold elections for five municipal corporations – Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Aurangabad, Kalyan-Dombivli and Kolhapur, together. The polls of the first three civic bodies were postponed after their terms ended between April and June. The SEC has now asked Kalyan-Dombivili and Kolhapur civic bodies to complete their pre-election process of ward delimitation and voter updation. The five-year terms of these two corporations will end in November.Besides the five municipal corporations, around 12,500 gram panchayats are on the verge of completion of their five-year term and are due for elections by year-end. After the review of the Covid-19 spread in five corporations, the SEC has reportedly decided that the elections to the civic bodies could not be held anytime soon.“In the given conditions, congregations of people in the wake of elections cannot be allowed and hence, it is not possible to hold the elections immediately. We have asked the local bodies to start pre-poll preparations, including delimitation of wards, finalisation of boundaries, hearing on suggestions/objections and finalisation of electoral rolls,’’ said Kiran Kurundkar, secretary, SEC.“In Navi Mumbai and Aurangabad, the pre-poll preparation has been completed while in Vasai-Virar it is in the final leg. The Election Commission of India is expected to hand us the updated electoral rolls by September-end, after which we will publish the list of voters, ward and polling stations wise,” he added.Since the state government has excluded 18 villages from the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), the civic body is expected to have a reshuffle in its wards before the elections. The corporation has been asked to begin this process.Kurundkar said that the decision about holding the elections in these local bodies will be taken at the appropriate time after consultation with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-election-commission-may-conduct-polls-for-five-civic-bodies-in-maharashtra-together/story-2vC0jgNYsUv2m6cy70IlNP.html

The complainant, Shyamsunder Agrawal, in his complaint said that he had entered an agreement with M/s Salasar Balaji Reality; M/s Seven Eleven Construction Private Limited which is owned by Mehta; and Salasar Balaji Infra Pvt Ltd in September 2018 for the sale of five properties measuring around 27,170 square metre in Bhayandar (West). However, as he did not receive any payment for the same within the stipulated time, Agrawal terminated the contract and sent notices to the proposed purchasers. Agrawal alleged that on Tuesday evening, Mehta along with Keluskar with around 40 men barged into the said properties and threatened the security guard. They allegedly also destroyed signboards.“We have registered cases under sections 147 (rioting), 143 (unlawful assembly), 149 (offence committed by a member of unlawful assembly), 447 (criminal trespass) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

03-09-2020||Mumbai||All CETs from October 1-15, schedule to be out soon: Maharashtra minister Uday Samant||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday declared that it will be conducting the state’s common entrance test (CET) from the first week of October. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said the CET exams for all courses will be conducted between October 1 and 15. He said that the decision on final dates, schedule, and how exams can be conducted, will be taken in the coming days.The state is also likely to decide on final-year examinations in the next two days. Samant said that Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari wants to know the views of the vice-chancellors of the University of Mumbai (MU) over conducting the examinations and hence, called a meeting with them on Thursday. After this, the state will take its decision by calling a state disaster management authority meeting. “The state will be holding CET exams for all courses between October 1 and 15. We are likely to conduct MHT-CET for engineering, pharmacy and agriculture courses in the first week and then the rest will be held,” said the minister.“The state government is currently busy resolving the issue of final-year examinations for professional and non-professional courses. The decision is likely to be taken in the next two days, after which, a decision on CET will be taken. I have a received a proposal from the CET commissioner,” Samant added.The state CET exam was first scheduled in April. Later, it was postponed to July and then deferred till further notice. The state government had postponed the exams due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.On Wednesday, Samant met the Governor and briefed him about their plans for final-year examinations. The Governor was also of the view that the exams should be conducted in a way that it will not bring students under stress, Samant said. “The Governor also wants to review the issue in detail and asked for the views of the vice-chancellors before any decision is taken by the state. The report by the vice-chancellors will also be discussed in the meeting. After this, a proposal for a final decision will be placed before the state disaster management authority headed by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said Samant.On August 31, Samant had declared to allow students to appear for final-year exams for professional and non-professional courses from home. He also said that the exams are likely to start from the first week of October and the state can seek an extension up to November 10 from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to complete the examination process. The Supreme Court (SC) last week said that students cannot be promoted without writing the final-year exams, and also upheld a July-6 directive of the UGC to hold exams by September 30. However, it has given liberty to the states to approach UGC if they wish to postpone holding the examinations beyond the September-30 deadline given the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/all-cets-from-october-1-15-schedule-to-be-out-soon-maharashtra-minister-uday-samant/story-2f2sq3eKkxuX1hDrpHs4gP.html

Indrajit arrived at the guest house at 10.25am and left around 8.45pm. Apart from that, CBI has also been questioning Sushant’s house help and cook Niraj Singh and Keshav Bachner as well as Rajput’s roommate Siddharth Pithani. On Tuesday, Indrajit and his wife Sandhya were questioned for around nine hours face-to-face with Singh, Bachner, Pithani, Rajput’s former business manager Shruti Modi and house manager Samuel Miranda.CBI has been investigating Rajput’s death based on a first information report (FIR) filed by his father KK Singh. The actor was found dead in his Bandra house on June 14.Meanwhile, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) questioned two Bandra residents for alleged drug peddling in the Bollywood circle and their suspected connection with Rajput death case.NCB has started their interrogation after the enforcement Directorate (ED) shared certain chats and communications found on phones of some persons interrogated in connection with the actor’s death. The chats related to drugs consumption, procurement, usage and transportation. NCB registered a case against Chakraborty and others and launched investigation in the matter.During search, NCB officials have also found Indian as well as foreign currency from one of the peddlers from Bandra who admitted that the money was proceeds of drug peddling. On August 28, in a separate incident, NCB registered a case based on specific input and raids were conducted in Mumbai following which two persons — Abbas Lakhani and Karn Arora — were arrested and curated marijuana was seized from their possession. During questioning and detailed network analysis, NCB found a link to two persons, both residents of Bandra, and further inquiry is going on, said an NCB official. ED is also investigating a case of money laundering in connection with Rajput’s death against Chakraborty and others. The probing agency called Goa hotelier Gaurav Arya and questioned him for two days on August 1 and 2. Gaurav’s name popped up in a group chat with Chakraborty and others.ED also questioned Rajput’s former business partner Varun Mathur on Wednesday regarding the company which he formed along with Saurabh Mishra and Rajput in 2018. Mathur came to the ED office along with his lawyer around 11am. The company in question, Innsaei Ventures Private Limited, only had Mathur and Saurabh Mishra as directors when it was launched and Rajput joined a month later as the third director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-cbi-questions-rhea-chakraborty-s-father-for-the-second-day/story-GFlmvbP9t9gdtwzij6XxeO.html
03-09-2020||Gurugram||Cases on rises, but Gurugram manages to keep Covid-19 deaths under check||The number of active Covid-19 cases in the district might have witnessed an uptick since mid-August, but Gurugram’s mortality rate has been kept well within check, if health officials are to be believed.Compared to July, when 27 Covid-19 deaths had been reported in a month, only nine deaths were reported in the month of August. The overall deaths in the district due to Covid-19 stands at 133, the second highest in Haryana after Faridabad, which has reported 173 deaths so far.On Wednesday, 184 new cases were reported in the district, taking the total Covid-19 tally to 12,297. Of these, 1,145 are active cases, while 11,019 have recovered. On August 29, one Covid-19 death was reported taking the death toll to 133. The current fatality rate is 1.13%, less than 1.35% reported in July.According to the district health bulletin data, till June 6, only four Covid-19 deaths were reported in Gurugram. By the end of the month, the number had shot up to 83. During the period, Gurugram’s positivity rate was 47% and the number of cases had increased from 1,692 to 5,006. By July 3, the Covid-19 death toll increased to 96, with another 27 deaths being reported in the next 27 days, taking the death count to 123.Health officials said they have been holding meetings with private hospitals to check the mortality of Covid-19 patients. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Since Covid-19 cases are rising — with nearly 180-196 new cases being confirmed every day — we have asked hospitals to gear up and prepare facilities once again. Presently, 148 patients are hospitalised in Gurugram. These are mostly symptomatic patients with co-morbid conditions. In preventing fatality, we are trying to ensure timely hospitalisation of patients.”There has been only one Covid-19 death under home isolation, he added.Across the state, however, deaths due to the virus were increasing. The state in August was reporting an average 10-12 deaths a day. On September 1 (Tuesday), Haryana witnessed 17 deaths in a day. On Wednesday, the state again witnessed 15 deaths. The deaths have been reported from districts like Ambala, Panipat , Karnal, Hisar, Kurukhsetra, Rewari and Yamuna Nagar.At least 31% Covid-19 deaths in the state are due to multiple co-morbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, according to the data by the Haryana health department.Till August 30, when 682 deaths were reported in the state, nearly 29% had succumbed to the illness without having any previous health issues. They had no co-morbid issues. Most of these deaths have been reported in the age group 55-64 years, followed by 65-74 years and then 45-54 years. Based on the overall toll, the mortality rate of Haryana is 1.06%.Data shows that there has been a rise in deaths due to diabetes, which is almost 10%. It is higher compared to hypertension (5%), heart disease (4%), respiratory disease (5%), cancer (3%), kidney disease (3%), among others.A senior health official, privy to the matter, said, “In most of the small towns and districts, there is a need to streamline the process of getting admitted to a hospital. Patients are reaching late to the hospitals, and hence they are not getting timely treatment at the preliminary stages of the infection. Some patients have also died under home isolation, though their number is less. Shuffling between hospitals is also a contributing factor. The focus should now be on controlling mortality in small towns, with timely access to healthcare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cases-on-rises-but-gurugram-manages-to-keep-covid-19-deaths-under-check/story-mirhJfvXPfP7gYSf7H0RiK.html

According to a circular issued on Tuesday, admission for students, who have been selected in the online lottery conducted by the department, can take place until September 15. This year, a total of 14,135 applications were received for the 7,069 available seats under the quota in the city. Of the selected students, 2,522 students have confirmed their admissions. “Several students, who have migrated to their hometowns due to the Covid-19 situation, may not have been able to make it to the city to confirm their seats,” said an official from the education department. The circular states that parents, who are not able to physically visit schools to confirm provisional admissions, can send relevant documents to the school through email or social messaging applications. Such admissions would be confirmed provisionally and parents can submit the original documents to the school later. After the deadline for admission ends, students whose names appear on the waiting list will be eligible to claim seats against vacancies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-extends-deadline-for-admissions-under-25-rte-quota-due-to-rising-covid-cases-in-mumbai/story-YKF1eHSUxBapvfbwcawmJI.html
03-09-2020||City||33 inmates test positive in Bhondsi Jail in two days, contact tracing on||Gurugram: A total of 33 inmates of Bhondsi Jail have tested positive for Covid-19 since Tuesday. They will be housed at an isolation ward at the government PG medical college in Sector 9, where they will be under observation until they test negative, jail authorities said on Wednesday. The authorities said RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) chain tests were conducted on inmates displaying symptoms of Covid-19 since Sunday. “We received their reports on Tuesday. Out of 56 inmates, 15 tested positive for Covid. We conducted a second round of rapid antigen tests on 171 patients who were in their close contact and found 18 other inmates infected on Wednesday,” said assistant jail superintendent, Sanjay Kumar. All positive patients were from two barracks.The authorities said the 15 inmates were shifted to the government college in sector 9 on Tuesday. Arrangements were being made to shift the 18 who tested positive on Wednesday to the same college. Asked about the source of the infection, Kumar attributed it to routine movement of prisoners outside jail premises for trial proceedings in Sohna, Nuh and Gurugram courts. “The undertrials and convicts also undergo medical examinations for which they are sent to Civil Hospital. Someone could have contracted the virus either while travelling for court proceedings or for a medical examination. Contact tracing to identify more cases is underway,” he added. Kumar said that a separate isolation barrack has been created in the jail to quarantine prisoners who have ventured out. “If they show symptoms, then we test them. But if they don’t show symptoms for two weeks, then we move them back to their barracks,” Kumar explained. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Through contact tracing, we were able to trace the outbreak to two prisoners, who were found to be positive earlier this week. We are conducting more tests and tracing their contacts.”At present, at least 2,100 prisoners are lodged in the Bhondsi Jail. Earlier in April, the head warder of the jail had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/33-inmates-test-positive-in-bhondsi-jail-in-two-days-contact-tracing-on/story-6mUJkARGk7bJXvaNYT8qLM.html

The operation will start in a graded manner and the trains will operate in two shifts first from 7am to 11am and second from 4pm to 8pm, said DMRC chief Mangu Singh. The Rapid Metro has an 11.6 km network from Cyber Hub to sector 56 along the Golf Course road. It has 11 stations on the network and its operation was taken over by the DMRC last year. “On September 7 we will start with the Yellow line which is a major line and Rapid Metro which is a smaller line in a graded manner with hours of operation curtailed and these lines will operate during peak hours in morning and evening,” said Dr Mangu Singh, DMRC chief, addressing a press conference in Delhi. He further said that operation on these lines in phase one will be reviewed and based on that remaining lines will be opened. The passengers will have to wear masks mandatorily and follow all norms prescribed for preventing the spread of Covid 19, he added. Singh also said that only selected gates will be allowed for entry at metro stations and a separate gate would be allowed for exit. Only use of smart cards and cashless transactions will allowed for travel, he said. A DMRC spokesperson said that all preparations for resuming rapid metro service have been made and a plan based on SOPs released by the union government will be made operational September 7 onwards. When asked about who will look after the security of the Rapid Metro in Gurugram, he said the matter pertained to Haryana government. VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, when asked about the matter said that though this decision has to be taken by the authority concerned, which is Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation (HMRTC), but it is likely that this job will be done by Haryana police. “The cost of deploying CISF is very high and it is likely that Haryana police will be given the task to ensure security of Rapid Metro. The state police can follow the SOPs prescribed by CISF and approval has been sought in this regard,” he said. Nadim Akhtar, advisor, planning, HMRTC did not reply to phone call and messages by HT for a comment on this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rapid-metro-to-resume-service-in-a-graded-manner-from-sep-7/story-Ebg7A4DQ4vBCKoQqMxAl1N.html
03-09-2020||Gurugram||Two snatch gold chain of woman in Sector 45, probe launched||Two unidentified men allegedly snatched the gold chain from a woman and escaped in Sector 45 on Tuesday morning. Police said they are yet to nab the suspects. As per investigators, the incident took place around 7.30 am when the woman was taking a stroll in a service lane near her house. Police said one of the suspects walked up to her, lunged and grabbed her gold chain and fled with it even as she raised the alarm . The man then met up with the second suspect, who had parked his motorcycle a little distance away, and they both fled. A police official, privy to the investigation, said, “The victim was caught by surprise and started yelling. The suspects sped away on a motorcycle. They had covered their faces with masks and were wearing helmets. The victim could not note down the registration number of the motorcycle.”Police said they were checking CCTVs in the vicinity of the crime spot to identify the suspects. A case was registered under section 379 A (snatching) of Indian Penal Code at Sector 40 police station. This is the third incident in the city in the past three weeks where snatchers had used similar modus operandi, police said. On August 11, two unidentified motorcyclists had snatched the gold chain of a man near Sector 12 bus stand . The victim, a resident of Gopal Nagar, had gone near the bus stand to for some work and was leaning on his scooter when the snatchers had targeted him.

03-09-2020||Mumbai||Opposition corners Sena-led Maharashtra goverment over reopening temples||Although the Shiv Sena has reiterated that it has not given up its Hindutva ideology, the party is being cornered by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other Opposition parties over reopening temples in the state. In the past five days, the BJP, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Prakash Ambedkar and All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Imtiaz Jaleel held agitations in different parts of the state demanding temples, mosques and other places of worship be reopened. Last week, BJP led a ‘Ghantanaad andolan’ (tolling of bells in protest), demanding opening of temples in the state. On Monday, Ambedkar led a protest in Pandharpur, demanding reopening of the Vithhal temple, and Jaleel came face-to-face with Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire in Aurangabad on Tuesday, after the former demanded opening of Khadkeshwar temple in the city. Sena leaders, however, have dismissed any pressure on the party to prove its Hindutva credentials. Shiv Sena MP and former Union minister Arvind Sawant said, “The present situation is such that the [Covid-19] numbers have gone up. The unlock process is on and everybody should support it. India is a country of several religions, but the government has to think seriously without any discrimination. Under a pandemic situation, what Prakash Ambedkar did is not correct. Gathering during a pandemic for political gain is wrong. It has become a compulsion for the BJP to politicise all issues.” Political analysts say the BJP is trying hard to corner its former ally, but such issues will not have an impact on the Sena, both politically and in the government. Pratap Asbe, political analyst, said the agitation did not have any backing from people. Surendra Jondhale, another political analyst, said the political opponents of the Sena are trying to “make a quick political buck”. “It is the pet issue of the BJP and they will project themselves as protectors of Hindus. BJP, by this agitation and demand, is catering to their specific political constituency. But it doesn’t seem that the constituency is interested in going to temples at the moment. The demand is not coming from the devotees,” Jondhale said. “The issue is not just faith. Several people’s livelihoods are dependent on these religious places. We also want the temples to reopen. The government is working on it,” said Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/opposition-corners-sena-led-goverment-over-reopening-temples-in-maharashtra/story-ub4T3Wb4sjIt6V1DJFrtRJ.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: No admission in class 6 in Delhi govt’s 22 RPVV schools this year||After ruling out the possibility of conducting an entrance exam for admissions to its 22 Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas (RPVVs), amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi government on Wednesday announced that there will be no admissions in class 6 in RPVVs for the academic year 2020-21. RPPVs are high-end resource-rich schools run by the Delhi government that enrol students only in classes 6 and 11, through competitive entrance exams. While the government has decided to make merit-based admissions in class 11 this year, it will skip enrolments in class 6.In a notification issued on Wednesday, the Directorate of Education’s (DoE) RPVV branch said, “On account of the Covid-19 pandemic, all government/government-aided schools of the Directorate of Education, GNCTD, MCDs/NDMC, and Delhi Cantt board schools are closed for students. The entrance test for admission in class 6 for session 2020-21 in RPVVs cannot be conducted due to the pandemic. In these circumstances, it’s been decided that there will be no admission in class 6 in all 22 RPVVs for the academic session 2020-21.”The government has also decided to conduct admissions in classes 6 and 7 in all RPVVs next year through the entrance exam. A senior official of the education department, on condition of anonymity, said, “All those students who were looking forward to gaining an admission in class 6 in the exclusive RPVVs this year will get a chance only next year.”The official further said, “It was easier to have merit-based admissions in class 11 since students have their board exam results and can be enrolled on the basis of those. But in class 5, there is no such exam. So, it will not be possible to have merit-based admissions in class 6.”The RPVVs offer education from class 6 to class 12. With Wednesday’s notification, the 22 exclusive schools of the Delhi government will not have a class 6 this year. An English teacher of class 6 at one of the RPVVs said, “This year, we won’t have one class. All these RPVVs have at least three sections of class 6. The move will now decrease the requirement of teachers this year.”A principal of another RPPV said schools are already closed in view of the pandemic and classes will continue to be held online for another few months. “RPVVs are academically the best-performing schools run by the Delhi government. Twenty of 22 RPPVs have crossed the average quality index of 400 in class 12 board exams this year. So, it will not be justified to enrol students without proper screening,” the principal said.The All India Parents Association (AIPA) criticised the move and said it will reduce opportunities for many students this year. Ashok Agarwal, president of AIPA, said, “If the government cannot conduct entrance exams this year, it can come up with an alternative way to carry out the admissions. It can invite applications and conduct a draw of lots to select students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-no-admission-in-class-6-in-delhi-govt-s-22-rpvv-schools-this-year/story-wH9GHlaQaNgZCpbyXuhGqM.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro to resume services in phased manner from Sept 7, stations to be closely monitored: SOP||The Delhi Metro is all set to resume operations on September 7, after more than five months shut. Services will be resumed in phases, and all corridors will be operational by September 12, according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) announced by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) on Wednesday. Upon its restart, operations will be monitored in real-time, and officials will be tasked with ensuring distancing and minimising crowds. For instance, senior officials said, trains will be allowed to skip a station if crowds are deemed too large. Further, no further passengers will be allowed entry into a station if officials consider it to have hit peak capacity.The Delhi Metro, before it shut on March 22 — when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a ‘Janta Curfew’, serviced around over 2.7 million people a day. But come September 7 — when it will be 169 days since it was closed, it is expected to cater to far fewer, to ensure social distancing at stations and inside Metro trains.Announcing the protocol for reopening Metro services under the Unlock 4 plan, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the Delhi Metro, which runs across 10 lines and comprises 389km of the 678km of Metro lines in the country, will be monitored closely initially, and reviewed after a week. “We will closely monitor crowd control measures and operations, and will review the arrangements. Initially, the frequency of service and entry and exit inside stations will be regulated, but full functionality will be resumed by September 12,” Puri said on Wednesday. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will reopen its doors to passengers in three stages. In the first stage, the Metro will function for truncated periods — from 7am to 11am, and then from 4pm to 8pm. In this stage, Metro lines will also be opened in phases starting with the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli to Huda City Centre) and the Gurugram Rapid Metro, which will be open for passengers from September 7. This will be followed by the Blue Line (Dwarka Sector-21 to Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) and the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) on September 9. From September 10, the Metro will also resume services for the Red Line (Rithala to Shaheed Sthal), Green Line (Inderlok to Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh Marg/Kirti Nagar) and Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Ballabhgarh). Operational hours will be increased in the second stage, which will commence from September 11. Trains will continue to ply over two shifts, each of which will be extended — 7am to 1pm. and 4pm to 10pm. In this stage, the Magenta (Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden) and Grey (Najafgarh-Dwarka) lines will also be made operational. In the third stage, from September 12, when Delhi Metro operations are expected to return to its full-functionality, service hours will go return to their pre-lockdown schedule — from 6am to 11pm. At the same time, Airport Express Line (Dwarka sector-21-New Delhi Railway Station) services will also be thrown open to passengers. Mangu Singh, managing director, DMRC, said all arrangements necessary have been made at stations and inside trains to ensure social distancing is maintained at all times. All stations will be monitored from a control room using CCTV cameras to ensure there are no crowds and that commuters follow all required norms. Arrangements have also been made to spot passengers flouting guidelines and train drivers, through a real-time communication system, will be directed to not stop trains at such stations. Singh also said the footfall inside Metro stations would be monitored regularly, and entries stopped if the station is deemed full. “We have a comprehensive plan in place, where everything will be monitored on a real-time basis,” Singh said. The agency will focus on the regular sanitisation of station premises and inside trains and trains will stop at stations for a longer duration to allow passengers to board and de-board with ease, without having to crowd the train gates. This might affect the frequency of the trains and increase the journey time in the initial days, but the Delhi Metro will try to maintain its frequency at 5-7 minutes, he said. “In the initial period, we have decided that all the gates of stations will not be opened for entry and exit. For each of the station, depending on the footfall and the size, we have released a list of one or two gates that will be used for entering and exiting the station,” said Singh. He added, “Since the use of tokens is risky now, because they could be carriers of the virus, we will only allow smart cards for trips. Top-up options will also be restricted to cashless modes for the time being.” Stations located in containment zones will stay closed and trains will not stop at these stations, the DMRC guidelines read. The SOP also specified that masks will be mandatory for all passengers entering the station, and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to travel. Masks will be available for purchase at kiosks in stations. Passengers will be screened before entry and hand sanitisers placed across the station. Singh also said that with schools and colleges yet to open and several private companies encouraging employees to work from home, the footfall in the network will be lower, making crowds more manageable. Union housing affairs secretary Durga Shankar Mishra said, “We will closely monitor the operations of the Metro through our control room, and if there is any instance of crowding observed, we will review the measures. We request the passengers to cooperate. Stand only where there are markings and follow the guidelines. Rules such as naming and shaming erring passengers, and not letting trains stop even if one passenger ignores the rules will encourage passengers to be more careful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-metro-to-resume-services-in-phased-manner-from-sept-7-stations-to-be-closely-monitored-sop/story-Zds8A8f1iDiN7wUw6eASiM.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Commuters caught in two minds over Delhi Metro reopening plan||The news of Delhi Metro resuming services after a hiatus of five months was met with mixed reactions from commuters on Wednesday.c The Capital recorded 2,509 new cases of the infection on Wednesday — the highest single-day spike in nearly two months.Sujeev Singh Panna, a resident of northwest Delhi’s Rohini, said his office called all staffers back from August 1. However, with the Delhi Metro closed for passengers, he said travelling was proving to be a tedious task. “I work in central Delhi, and travelling has become extremely difficult. Public buses are also not running to its full capacity, and the area where I live is not very well connected by the bus service. In such times when everyone is wary of maintaining social distancing, how do you even ask a colleague to give you a lift? The opening of the Metro will be a boon, especially when most offices have started calling employees back,” Panna said. Social media was also abuzz with people lauding the service’s phased opening plan. “Graded opening would help assess and manage the crowd. We finally know that Delhi is nothing without the Delhi Metro,” tweeted P Sulekha. Many, however, were sceptical of the timings of the opening, and said resuming a mass-transit mode such as the Metro could increase the already growing number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital. Radhika Arya, who lives in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar and works at a private company in Noida, said closed spaces, especially the underground stations, could be spaces where infections spread rapidly. “No one is questioning the preparations of the Delhi Metro or the government, but how much can you monitor crowds inside stations? What happens if someone is asymptomatic? Inside trains, we don’t even know who has touched holding bars and who was sitting in the seat before you. Sure, the trains will get sanitised at terminals, but you would have already contracted the infection by then,” Arya said. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MOHUA) on Wednesday released a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the resumption of Metro services across the country. The Delhi Metro will resume operations from September 7 in phases, where operations will be opened line-wise and for restricted hours initially. From September 12, after reviewing operations, the Metro services will be completely resumed, the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commuters-caught-in-two-minds-over-delhi-metro-reopening-plan/story-v8czsliZjGM8psBMAP21LP.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Masks not enough, crowds a concern: Experts divided over Delhi metro reopening||Experts are divided over the Centre’s decision to resume metro services in Delhi at a time when coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are on a gradual rise. Delhi on Wednesday recorded 2,509 new cases, the highest since the beginning of July. Medical experts say the decision is not based on epidemiological data but driven by economic considerations, with some saying it will only increase the chances of transmission of the contagious pathogen.But transport experts say while the concerns are partly valid, they argue that there are no studies or data to show that public transport is a hot spot for transmission.On Wednesday, Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be adopted by metro rail corporations to ensure social distancing at stations and trains. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) announced it would open train lines in a staggered manner and that wearing masks would be mandatory. But epidemiologists say that just a mask is not enough. Their concern is about crowd management, especially if the services are allowed to operate inter-city.As the Metro connects Delhi with Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad, experts say this will result in crowding at stations. “How will social distancing be ensured at stations? Just wearing a mask will not be enough. At a time when Covid cases are steadily increasing, the opening could have been delayed,” Dr PK Sharma, epidemiologist and former medical health officer with the New Delhi Municipal Council, said. “Presently, a lot of people from neighbouring areas are not able to come to Delhi as Metro operations are closed. Starting it would only allow the movement of more people and increase chances of infection,” Sharma said.Transport experts say medical experts have a valid concern, but there is no data available to prove that public transport modes are Covid hot spots.Shreya Gadepalli, who leads the South Asia Programme of Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), said, “Some studies have found the virus can spread when people interact with each other for extended duration within enclosed air-conditioned spaces. However, studies worldwide have not found public transport to be a hot spot for the spread of Covid-19.”A section of the medical fraternity welcomed the decision to resume metro services. “Cases will increase as more and more people will get exposed to the infection and we don’t have a vaccine yet. But we can’t stop these activities, as people are stepping out for livelihood. Public transport is essential to help people commute to their workplaces. All we need to do is ensure people follow proper social distancing measures,” said Dr Puneet Misra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.With nearly six million passenger journeys every day, the Delhi Metro is the transport lifeline of Delhi and other National Capital Region cities. As a majority of commercial activities have been allowed in the city, people are facing a lot of problems while commuting due to inadequate public transport and the restriction on the number of passengers who can travel at a given point of time. Anuj Malhotra, Knowledge Partner to the high-powered committee, Union ministry of home affairs, said, “Opening Metro services is a welcome step. Public transport services should not cease to function in any city as they are the lifelines for the health of citizens, not just for the city’s economy. Closing services shall only mean rapid deterioration of the city’s air and longer jams. At the same time, public transport travel etiquette for Covid has to be ensured by the travellers so that it remains a safe way to travel and they can avail services for a longer time. Metro should also come up with penalties for people who do not respect safety”. Transport experts say metro services are operational in cities such as Hong Kong, London and Singapore. “Many cities such as Singapore, Tokyo, and others in Europe, have resumed public transport services. They have relaxed physical distancing rules but require the use of masks at all times. Passengers are instructed to not speak since the virus can spread through air,” Gadepalli said.The decision, epidemiologists say, is not based on epidemiological data but largely on economic considerations. Ideally, they say, such services should open when the positivity rate is 5% or below for a couple of weeks. “As per the second sero survey report, nearly two-thirds of the population is still unexposed. The positivity rate is already on a rise and if you create opportunities for people to mingle, then it will increase the chances of transmission. Though metro service is important, ideally these should open up when the positivity rate is 5% or below for a couple of weeks. But we have to keep in mind the economic considerations also,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/experts-divided-over-delhi-metro-reopening/story-GqLRicS6IThTzNPUxf8fQL.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi conducts a record 28,835 tests in a day||Delhi conducted 28,835 tests for Covid-19 on Wednesday — the highest ever so far. The peak in capital’s testing comes a week after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that testing would be doubled to 40,000 a day in the capital. With Wednesday’s record number of testings, Delhi beat its previous record of having tested 24,592 samples on August 8. On Tuesday (September 1), 24,198 samples had been tested.On Wednesday, India crossed the 1-million tests a day mark for the second consecutive days. Health ministry data shows that Delhi conducts the second highest tests per million in the country, after Goa. Wednesday’s data also showed that just over one in three of the 28,835 tests (around 9,612 samples) conducted were using the gold-standard RT-PCR test. The rest were using the faster and cheaper rapid antigen test method, which is not as sensitive and sometimes throws up false negatives. The surge in the number of tests has led to a decline in the positivity rate – the proportion of people who test positive among those who are tested. The positivity rate recorded on Wednesday’s daily bulletin was 8.7%, a decline from 9.55% the day before. As on Wednesday, Delhi’s seven-day average positivity rate stood at 9.01%, up from 7.78% the week before. The lowest single-day positivity rate ever reported from Delhi was 5.1% recorded on August 7. “The higher positivity rate is indicative of increased ongoing transmission. This means, we need to focus not only on treating people but also controlling the spread of the infection, which means testing and isolating positive cases. Scaling up of tests will definitely help in that. If you ask me whether 40,000 tests are enough, I will say I do not know. There is no estimate for what the correct number of tests are. We have to maintain a positivity rate of 5% for at least a couple of weeks to say that the transmission rate has stabilised in the city,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research. He, however, suggests that merely increasing the number of tests was not enough. “Merely increasing testing is not the point. Which form of testing is being increased is also significant. Ideally, rapid antigen tests should be conducted only in hospitals, containment zones and on special surveillance groups and high risk groups, such as senior citizens. The primary form of testing ideally should be RT-PCR in the city,” he said. With the increased number of tests, the number of new tests in Delhi on Wednesday crossed the 2,500 mark. Delhi added 2,509 Covid positive cases in 24-hours, according to the health bulletin released by the Delhi government. This is the highest number of cases recorded in a single day since July 3. After reaching a peak in mid-June, the number of daily cases had witnessed a slow downward dip and dropped to below 2,000 in mid-July. The cases started increasing again in the third week of August. The numbers are likely to decline again in Delhi soon, experts believed. “There are several models that suggest that about 40 to 60% of the population needs to have had exposure to the infection to develop herd immunity. And, this time in the serological surveillance data, we might see whether we have reached that level. However, the decline in the number of cases in the country will take some time as different places will reach their peaks at different times,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, centre for infectious disease at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Delhi also reported 19 deaths due to Covid-19 in Wednesday’s health bulletin, taking the city’s total toll to 4,481. Even as the number of cases is on the rise, the case fatality ratio – fraction of people who succumb to the virus among those who test positive – has been on the decline since mid-June. The highest CFR of 4.1% was recorded on June 16, when Delhi reconciled its death data, adding 437 deaths due to the infection in a single day. The current CFR in Delhi is 2.5%. This is still higher than the national average of 1.7%, much lower than the global average of 3.34% and that of countries like United Kingdom where 12.4% of those diagnosed with the infection have died and Mexico where 10.7% of those with the disease have succumbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-conducts-a-record-28-835-tests-in-a-day/story-VlTJicka4KMeB7hID1jteO.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||AIIMS suspends routine surgeries for 15 days for want of beds||An increase in the number of emergency patients has forced the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to stop admitting patients for routine surgeries and procedures, two months after it gradually started resuming routine services in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The services will remain suspended for 15 days after which the situation will be reviewed and a call taken. During this period, the out-patient clinics will continue as usual. All emergency or semi-emergency surgeries will also be performed, the hospital informed. “In view of the need to optimise usage of available inpatient beds for hospitalisation of seriously ill emergency/ semi-emergency patients, it has been decided to temporarily stop routine out-patient department admissions to general wards as well as private wards at the AIIMS hospital and all centres with immediate effect for a period of two weeks. The situation will be reviewed after that,” said a letter from the hospital medical superintendent to all heads of departments. “There has been an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases reporting to the trauma centre, which means that we have to continue managing all trauma cases at the old OPD building on the main campus. The number of road accidents that we attend to has also gone up since the lockdown restrictions were eased. This has resulted in a shortage of beds at the hospital. We cannot stop treating the emergency patients,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS. The hospital had closed its out-patient units as well as all routine services in March-end when the nationwide lockdown was announced. The 250-bed AIIMS Trauma Centre on the Ring Road was converted into a stand-alone centre for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. All accident and trauma cases were being managed by the main campus in the old-OPD block. The hospitals routine services had resumed in July after putting in place adequate protective measures against Covid-19. The number of patients that was allowed to visit each out-patient department was restricted to 15 to maintain social distancing. The hospital, before the lockdown, used to get about 13,000 patients in its OPD every day. Wednesday’s move will result in higher pendency of routine surgeries and procedures, doctors said. As it is, the premiere medical institute usually has a waiting period of up to a year for surgeries in certain departments. The services had remained suspended for at least three months during the lockdown, as a result of which many surgeries were postponed indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-suspends-routine-surgeries-for-15-days-for-want-of-beds/story-grxv0VcdLevnD7YtbxnQGM.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Incentives for finding missing kids pays off||Daily recovery and rescue of missing children in Delhi almost tripled between August 6 and 28, compared to the rest of the year, after the Delhi Police announced quick promotions to constables and head constables for finding at least 50 missing children aged below 14 in a year.According to data provided by the Delhi Police, recoveries per day between January 1 and August 6 was six, which went up to 17, between August 7 and 28. The promotion order was issued on August 6. A crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “There is a competition among the men and women in our force to find missing children now. It has suddenly become a top priority for them. Even we did not expect such quick results.”According to a report by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) released last year, 17 children go missing every day in Delhi and at least two of them remain untraced. As per police statistics, at least 6,366 children went missing in 2019 from across the city, of whom police traced 4,311. In order to reverse the trend, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava ordered that any constable or head constable who finds at least 50 missing children aged below 14 (of whom at least 15 children younger must be eight-years-old) in a year would be eligible for an out-of-turn promotion. Usually, constables are eligible for promotion after five years in service, that too only if they clear a test. If the person does not take the test, it takes around 10 years to become a head constable. Special stress was laid on finding children aged 14 or below since many of them fall prey to traffickers, said police officers. 2473 children were reported missing till August 28 this year, of whom 1752 have been found/rescued. In the last month, police rescued missing children from roads, outside temples, gurdwaras, hospitals and railway station. The police have also solved cases of children who were trafficked from places such as Assam, Agra and Noida in Uttar Pradesh.Explaining the success of the initiative, another senior officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said personnel posted in police control room van duty, who are otherwise not duty-bound to probe missing cases and are only the first responders to distress calls on the roads, found at least 20 missing children and reunited them with their families.Explaining how constables and head constables are finding missing children, a constable from the crime branch’s anti-human trafficking unit, said, “I was part of a case in which a 14-year-old boy was reported missing in Jaitpur, south-east Delhi. A kidnapping case was registered but all these years there was no clue. We reopened the case, took out the boy’s photographs and showed it to people at railway stations, hospitals and night shelters. We found him on the evening of August 22 outside the Bangla Saheb Gurdwara. He had been kidnapped by a local drug dealer and was forced to sell drugs. The child has been reunited with his family.”Another officer, who is part of the police control room van unit, said they have started using loudspeakers to make announcements, the minute we receive the report about a missing child. “On August 27, our men in PCR van found a 3-year-old child crying near the Gandhi Nagar market in east Delhi. Now that our focus is on finding such children, we used the van loudspeaker to announce details of the child. Other police personnel in PCR vans, who heard us also started doing this in their areas. Within a few hours, a woman in Seelampur heard the announcement made from one such PCR van and told them about her missing daughter. The girl was then reunited with her family.”Retired Delhi police officer Amod Kanth, who also runs Prayas — an NGO for children, said, “ I am glad the police are focusing on finding missing children. Incentives always work. This is an issue that needed to be tackled seriously long ago. The results indicate that police are also digging old files and tracing those children. I am sure that the results will improve with each passing month. “Kanth was earlier the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights and also worked as director general of Arunachal Pradesh police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/incentives-for-finding-missing-kids-pays-off/story-IhyZ3aZvOiD87a48OmNWPN.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Coming in Delhi: Testing camps at construction sites, ISBTs; test-on-demand policy||To ramp up testing in Delhi amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) on Wednesday decided to open testing camps at construction sites, all inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) and railway stations, senior government officials said. While these camps will be set up in a week, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal directed officials to simultaneously draft a policy to introduce a ‘test-on-demand’ programme, wherein people could call at a helpline and fix an appointment at the nearest Covid testing centre without having to wait in a queue. The decision was taken in a meeting of the DDMA chaired by Baijal in the presence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is vice-chairperson of the authority, Dr VK Paul, member of NIti Aayog, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bhargava and other ministers and top officials of the state government. A testing centre is already functioning at the Anand Vihar ISBT since August 13 to screen migrants heading back to the Capital, where as many as 3,381 people have undergone rapid antigen tests till Wednesday, of which 19 have been diagnosed Covid-19 positive, government officials said. A senior official of the DDMA said the rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi was discussed at length during the meeting. Delhi on Wednesday recorded 2,509 new cases, the highest since the beginning of July. “Principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt informed DDMA about some probable reasons for the increase in positivity rate Delhi. The possible reasons included the lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour; impact of festivals in the month of August; late testing by Covid suspects; cross-infection; return of migrants and unlock measures,” the DDMA official said.In a statement issued late evening, the DDMA said the L-G advised that besides the entry points to the city (ISBTs and railway stations), large-scale construction sites should be covered through special camps for targeted testing.This is in line with the Delhi high court’s directions issued on Monday to ramp up testing in Delhi. After becoming the first major region to register a sustained fall in cases, Delhi has seen an uptick since mid-August, prompting Kejriwal to hold an emergency meeting on August 26 where it was decided that the rate of testing will be doubled to nearly 40,000 a day in the next week. Accordingly, the government increased its daily numbers from Monday when 24,198 tests were conducted. In the past 24 hours, the government conducted 28,835 tests -- the highest in Delhi a single day so far. “Ramping up testing facilities and augmenting hospital infrastructure keeping in view the changing scenario were discussed. The LG directed that home isolation cases need to be regularly reviewed and technology needs to be leveraged more effectively to ensure compliance. He directed the government to focus on rural areas separately,” the DDMA’s statement read. Health department data showed the spike in Covid-19 cases was noticed from the last two weeks of August. “There was around 35% increase in the positive cases in the fourth week of August over the third week of August. Also, 30-40% of the daily new cases are originating from the same family. Besides, increasing incidence of Covid-19 cases has been observed in migrant habitations,” a health official said.During the meeting, Dr Paul advised that the Capital needs to re-strategise its Covid-19 management by enhancing testing, intensifying tracking and augmenting available medical infrastructure with a focus on hot spots, containment zones and the use of technology to improve contact tracing, quarantine, isolation and containment zone planning, the DDMA said.While the LG’s office did not comment on the matter, Delhi government officials said that activities under the Centre’s unlock 4 guidelines were only briefly discussed in the meeting. “Since the Centre has already allowed the resumption of metro services, it was decided that the finer details of the operation of Delhi Metro would be discussed in a day or two once the SOPs are issued by the Centre. The same was for the decisions on allowing inter-state buses and opening of gyms,” a second DDMA official said. Anand Vihar testingA senior official, citing records maintained by the Shahdara revenue district, said, “All 19 people who tested Covid-19 positive in Anand Vihar had arrived from Uttar Pradesh. Two of them were women. All 19 were symptomatic and sent to Covid care centres.” Anand Vihar is in the jurisdiction of Shahdara district.The Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the positive cases reported at Anand Vihar.The Centre government has allowed inter-state road transport under its Covid-19 unlock plan but Delhi is yet to take a final call on allowing buses to enter the city. However, the Anand Vihar ISBT, which is right next to the Delhi-UP border, has witnessed large footfalls .Most migrants coming back from various districts in UP step down at another bus terminal in Kaushambi on the Ghaziabad side, bang opposite the Anand Vihar ISBT. From there, they would walk to Anand Vihar and then take local buses in Delhi to reach their destination, said another district official.The official cited above said heath officers deployed at the centre roughly test one out of three persons – which essentially means around 10,000 people have arrived in Delhi after August 13 via Anand Vihar in working hours. The centre operates from 7 am to 7 pm.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The objective of the tests play a crucial role in this case. Since, the government is isolating positive cases, they should ideally test all individuals. RT-PCR should be a preferred mode in this case.”Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests are considered to be more accurate.T Jacob John, former professor of virology at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said using RT-PCR tests in these centres, where migrants are tested, would help the government in accurately detecting more Covid-19 positive cases but the process may have its own challenges.John said, “Conducting RT-PCR tests on all individuals arriving in the city would require the capacity of laboratories to be increased immensely. So, instead of that, the government can first reduce the numbers by a round of rapid antibody tests and relieve people who are found to have contracted the virus and recovered. The second round should be rapid antigen tests and those found positive should be isolated immediately. Both tests show results within 30 minutes and the kits are cheap. On the remaining population, RT-PCR tests can be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coming-in-delhi-testing-camps-at-construction-sites-isbts-test-on-demand-policy/story-3S3c8JwlQ3JXXRXhjAQpuO.html
03-09-2020||Delhi||Check on 24 old trees in Old Delhi, ensure their health and safeguard them, HC orders Delhi govt, north civic body||The Delhi High Court Wednesday directed the Delhi government’s tree officer to check on 24 old trees in Chandni Chowk area and, together with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, formulate a plan to restore them and save them from further damage of any kind.The corporation Wednesday submitted an affidavit listing the old trees in Dariba Kalan, Urdu Bazaar, Jama Masjid and Jagat Cinema areas on the court’s earlier directions, issued while hearing a plea to restore an approximately 300-year-old tree in Nai Sadak area of Chandni Chowk.On August 6, Nai Sadak resident Nitin Gupta had filed a plea, through advocate RK Kapoor, about the unauthorised construction taking place in the area that was hampering the tree. While hearing his petition, justice Najmi Waziri had said it cannot be denied that in the Walled City, especially in the densely populated and heavily built-up area of Chandni Chowk, there are hardly any trees. Therefore, each tree in that neighbourhood is valuable and would need protection, he said.He had then asked the tree officer and the north corporation to jointly carry out a tree census in the Walled City.On Wednesday, the civic body in its affidavit said that it has identified the trees and work has started to remove the concrete from around their trunk base. Advocate Ajay Arora, the standing counsel of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said in some places, the work to remove the concrete could not be carried out because of lack of space and, in one case, the danger posed to a house as the tree is abutting the foundation of that house. He also informed the court that at six places, people have constructed temples near the base of the tree and so the matter has been referred to the religious committee of the Delhi government for necessary action. He also said some of the trees fall in the jurisdiction of the public works department(PWD) and the PWD has already completed the concrete removal work.Following this, Waziri directed that the tree officer visit each tree and guide the corporation on the measures needed to restore and safeguard each tree.Waziri also pulled up the Delhi government for its failure to protect the 300-year-old banyan tree in Nai Sadak, which has been damaged due to the illegal construction. The Delhi government then detailed the action taken to remove cement and girders from around the tree, which is believed to have been standing since before the British rule in India. Advocate Gautam Narayan, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, said a large number of its roots have been damaged and, perhaps, are now dead for want of oxygen and moisture. But due to a high regenerative potential of the root system, the tree could develop new roots once the concrete around its base is removed and replaced with good alluvial soil or sandy loam. To prevent the attack of termites, due to presence of dead and decaying roots, and also to prevent the onset of pests (root borer) and pathogens (soil-borne fungi and bacteria), 1% neem cake will be added to the roots.However, the court was unhappy that the upper girders, which were stifling the tree branches, are yet to be removed. The judge said action should be taken against the outgoing tree officer for not acting on the complaint given by area resident Kushmakar Rastogi in January.“We are talking about a treasure, a living creature. How can you not act on the complaint given by Rastogi in January, rather you had given him a date in August,” Waziri said while adding, “Take action against the officer. You can’t keep on cutting trees because of the incompetence of officers.”Advocate Narayan told the court that the current tree officer had taken charge only recently and is trying to learn the ropes. He ensured the court that the remaining girders will be removed forthwith. Following this, the court asked the tree officer to visit the tree and see that there is no further construction happening around it.The matter would be now heard on September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/check-on-24-old-trees-in-old-delhi-ensure-their-health-and-safeguard-them-hc-orders-delhi-govt-north-civic-body/story-Nt3MwawLZ27QHnKd42DpVO.html
03-09-2020||Chandigarh||No odd-even in Chandigarh markets from September 4||The odd-even system in markets to prevent overcrowding due to the Covid-19 outbreak will end on September 4, almost a month after it was imposed on August 7.Orders issued on August 24, extending the plan to allow odd and even numbered shops to open on alternate days for 10 days, will be in force up to September 3.The decision to end the restrictions was taken on Wednesday at the war room review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore. The administration has put the onus of maintaining social distancing and wearing masks on shop owners.“Market closure further will not help. People have to take precautions and behave responsibly. Restrictions on trade cannot continue indefinitely,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.Odd-even rules are in place at the Electronics Market in Sector 18, the Sector 8 internal market, Patel Market in Sector 15, Palika Bazar and Sadar Market in Sector 19, Azad Market and Palace Market in Sector 20, Booth Market in Sector 21, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Janta Market in Sector 27, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and at places near the old PNB Bank/Bihari Garment Shop and Burail Chowk. Basements of seven shops in the mobile market, however, will remain closed while the Sector 43 market will be closed on Sundays.Local traders have demanded opening of all shops as it had impacted small businesses in the city.MORE RELAXATIONS IN THE OFFINGThe weekend shutdown of Sukhna Lake to prevent overcrowding on weekends is also set to be withdrawn from September 5. A final call on the matter, however, will be taken on Friday.Inter-state bus operations are expected to restart from September 15.Services were earlier suspended in July after a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases.For starting bus operations from Sector 17, the administration has decided to move the vegetable and fruit mandi currently open there back to Sector 26 before September 15. Apni Mandis, meanwhile, will not operate till further orders but organic markets can function with precautions near Nagar Van. The chief conservator of forests will ensure social distancing and sanitisation.A decision will be taken soon on the typing test being conducted by Panjab University to select employees for UT administration, which had earlier been suspended due to Covid-19. UNLOCK CHECKLIST What’s openAll markets, religious places, restaurants, hotels, pubs, clubs, tricity bus services, taxis, government and private offices;What’s closedSukhna Lake (on weekends), apni mandis, educational institutions,Cinema halls, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres and similar places.What’s aheadSocial, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions and other congregations with a ceiling of 100 persons will be permitted from September 21.A maximum limit of 50 guests at weddings and 20 mourners at funeral will be in place up to September 20, after which 100 persons will be allowed.Open air theatres are likely to open from September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-odd-even-in-chandigarh-markets-from-tomorrow/story-G6F0lby2Yn7ndS0ZTWRR3M.html
03-09-2020||Pune||Satara Police arrest man for murder of 4 from same family||The Satara Police have arrested a man for murdering four members of a family and dumping the corpses in the Marli ghat area of the district, officials said on Wednesday.The accused, identified as Yogesh Nikam (38), was arrested by a team of Satara police on Monday for killing two brothers and their parents.According to the police, Nikam injected the victims with poison, and then assaulted them with iron rods.Anand Sable, assistant police inspector (API) and investigating officer in the case said, “The villagers and relatives identified the bodies of the parents. We were informed that the parents had gone to Mumbai to meet their two sons who had been promised a job with a security agency. This was a month ago and they had not returned. Hence, a missing complaint was filed.”“During his interrogation, he (Nikam) confessed that he promised security jobs to the two brothers, identified as Tushar and Vishal, and took Rs 40,000 from them. While taking them to Mumbai, he injected them with poison, attacked them with iron rods and dumped their bodies in the Mali ghat section. Later, when his parents contacted him for their whereabouts, he asked them to come to Satara and promised to take them to Mumbai. On their arrival, he injected them with poison, attacked them with iron rods on their heads as he did with the previous two murders and dumped their bodies in the ghat,” said Sable.The police began the investigation on a missing persons’ complaint from Bamnoli village, which comes under Kupwad MIDC police station of Sangli police.According to police, a hand-written note found near the female corpse on August 29 led to the arrest of the accused. The gruesome murders are a reminder of another murderer, Santosh Gulabrao Pol (41) a resident of Dhom village in Wai taluka of Satara district. In 2016, he paraded himself before the locals as a doctor and anti-corruption activist and murdered six persons between May 2003 and August 2016. Pol used to administer anaesthesia to his patients and then murder them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/satara-police-arrest-man-for-murder-of-4-from-same-family/story-6xQFWjvhkjPx61LP4i3HBO.html
03-09-2020||Pune||Pune district has highest Covid-19 case count in India||Pune district is now the district in the country with the highest number of progressive positive, and active, Covid-19 cases. Pune has overtaken Delhi on the Covid count, which, until now, had the most number of cases in the country. On September 2, the district reported 3,614 new cases - Pune rural at 902, Pune municipal corporation (PMC) with 1,706 and 1,006 from the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) - which puts the progressive positive count at 1,82,212 cases. As of September 2, Delhi state reported 1,79,569 progressive cases, of which 1,58,586 have been declared cured and discharged. The Delhi death toll is at 4,481 with an active case count of 16,502. Mumbai has reported 1,48,569 progressive cases, of which 1,19,702 have recovered, with the death toll at 8,057 and the total number of active cases at 20,810. Pune is also the only district in the country which has crossed the 50,000 mark in terms of active cases. The district now has 54,760 active cases with 1,23,292 declared recovered. Progressive cases include the total number of cases reported till date, including deaths, recovered and active cases; whereas active cases are those undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals, or are being isolated at home. A total of 39 Covid-19 related deaths were reported on Wednesday, which puts the death toll in the district at 4,160. State director of health services Dr Archana Patil said, “There could be a possible data discrepancy, because the state health department forms its reports based on the data which is uploaded on the portal. Pune district may have not uploaded its discharges which is why the number of active cases is above 50,000. The portal is updated by the local government authorities, in Pune it is updated by the PMC, PCMC and the Zilla Parishad. The update is done as per the names so every discharge has to be done by identifying the person who has been discharged, which is not happening in case of Pune. There needs to be better contact tracing in the district and also better management of containment zones. However, it is also true that Pune is doing maximum testing in the country and so more cases are being identified.” The BJP MLA from the from Shivajinagar constituency, Siddharth Shirole said, “After multiple demands to ramp up health infrastructure, we got two jumbo centres at COEP and Baner for Pune city, after which, we felt that the healthcare needs of critical care patients would be taken care of. However, as soon as the centres started multiple complaints from patients have started coming up. We have spent Rs 200 crore, which is public money, to develop these centres. I have written to the CM to intervene in this situation.” The district’s health infrastructure is still struggling to cope with bed availability despite 1,200 beds added for critical care last week. As of Wednesday, the district has 6,950 total vacant beds for Covid-19 patients, including 5,726 beds for isolation without oxygen; 1,002 isolation beds with oxygen; 162 ICU beds without ventilators; and 60 beds with ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-district-has-highest-covid-19-case-count-in-india/story-AsQjyoqyhJ4aKLGx7qwdoI.html

But the JD(U) is willing to leave for it 10-12 seats, according to reports.Manjhi is the lone member of his party in the assembly. But, his induction would help the NDA’s outreach to Dalits, particularly other than Paswans which is the support base of the LJP.Dalits in Bihar are over 16 per cent of the electorate and about 40 seats in the 243-member house are reserved for them.Manjhi had quit the JD(U) in 2015 after being forced to step down as the chief minister to make way for the return of Kumar.Later, he formed the HAM(S) and contested 21 seats in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections as an NDA constituent. With the return of Kumar to the NDA in July 2017, he walked out of it to join hands with the opposition grouping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/ahead-of-bihar-polls-jitan-ram-manjhi-s-party-says-it-will-join-nda/story-yvRzRlfgnGn3QZwPrrg6iO.html
03-09-2020||World||Novel vaccine candidate shows promise against Covid-19: Study||An experimental vaccine that boosts the production of specific proteins could be effective against the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, according to a study conducted in mice. Scientists at The Ohio State University in the US manipulated a natural cellular process to ramp up levels of two proteins used by the virus to infect other cells, packaged the protein-boosting instructions in nanoparticles and injected them into mice. Within a month, the mice had developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to the study published on Wednesday in the journal Advanced Materials. The technique involves altering specific sequences of messenger RNA, molecules that translate genetic information into functional proteins, the researchers said. While these sequences are not translated to proteins, the researchers changed their structures to promote higher-than-usual levels of proteins. The sequences are known as untranslated regions, or UTRs. Though Phase 3 clinical trials of fast-tracked Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in progress, Yizhou Dong, an associate professor at the Ohio State University, said his lab’s platform offers a potential alternative. “If the current vaccines work well, that’s wonderful. In case the field needs this, then it’s an option. It worked as a vaccine is expected to, and we can scale this up very fast,” Dong said. “For now, it’s a proof of concept -- we’ve demonstrated we can optimise a sequence of messenger RNA to improve protein production, produce antigens and induce antibodies against those specific antigens,” he said. The crux of the method is typical to vaccine development: using snippets of a pathogen’s structure to produce an antigen -- the foreign substance that triggers an appropriate immune response -- and finding a safe way to introduce it to the body. However, the technique takes antigen design to a new level by making use of messenger RNA UTRs, Dong said. His lab worked with the two UTRs that bookend the start and finish of protein assembly, functioning as regulators of that process and influencing how the resulting protein interacts with others. UTRs themselves are strings of nucleotides, the molecules that compose RNA and DNA, the researchers said. “For our application we tried to optimise the UTRs to improve the protein production process. We wanted as much protein produced as possible -- so we can give a small dose of messenger RNA that produces enough antigen to induce antibodies against the virus,” Dong said. The team experimented with two potential antigens that the novel coronavirus is known to use to cause infection: a spike protein on its surface and a receptor binding domain. The domain is a component of the spike protein that the virus uses to make its way into host cells -- a necessary step to make copies of itself. Both are used in other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, the researchers said. After manipulating the messenger RNA for these two proteins, the team encased them in lipid nanoparticles developed previously in Dong’s lab. They injected mice with the experimental vaccine and gave them a booster two weeks later. A month after the first injection, immune cells in the mice had taken up the antigens of the two proteins and developed antibodies against them. “It takes some time for the immune system to process the antigens and have cells produce antibodies. In this study, we detected antibodies after 30 days,” Dong added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novel-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-against-covid-19-study-finds/story-yBZpoHpbhoWZvFsjnJtmQM.html
03-09-2020||World||US Presidential Polls 2020: Donald Trump tells Americans to try to vote twice||President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed his call for supporters to try to vote twice on November 3, claiming that only this way can they be sure their ballot is counted.Trump said Americans should first try to vote by mail, if that option is offered in their state, then also go to the polling station on election day to check that their ballot has been counted -- and, if not, vote again.“YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED,” he said in a Twitter threadIt was the latest assault by Trump on the credibility of mail-in voting, which is being rapidly expanded across the country in response to fears of Covid-19 contagion for voters going in person to polling stations.Despite Trump’s relentless challenges, the mail-in practice is already widespread and largely trouble free in the United States. He himself uses the absentee mail-in option to vote in Florida while living in the White House.While Trump says that increased mail-in voting will generally allow ballot tampering and rigging of the result, elections experts say there is no evidence of significant danger.Polls show Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to vote by mail.Also read: Joe Biden meets family of black Kenosha man shot by policeTrump first aired the idea of casting a precautionary second vote on Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina.“If you get the unsolicited ballots, send it in, and then go -- make sure it counted. And if it doesn’t tabulate, you vote,” he said. “So, send it in early, and then go and vote.”The recommendation prompted the election board in the state, which Democrat Joe Biden hopes to snatch from Trump, to issue a statement pointing out: “It is illegal to vote twice in an election.”“Soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law,” the board’s director, Karen Brinson Bell, added.Polls currently show Biden on course to defeat Trump.However, experts warn that the country faces a confusing and potentially tense aftermath of the voting on November 3, due to the unusual circumstances.Given the larger than ordinary number of mailed-in ballots, few expect there will be a clear-cut result that evening.Under one scenario, Trump could be shown to have won on the basis of ballots cast during the day, but mail-in ballots, once counted days later, would then put Biden over the top.Trump has repeatedly refused to declare he will accept the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2020-donald-trump-tells-americans-to-try-to-vote-twice/story-O2Fl2ipwkQf05IeQbquaYK.html

03-09-2020||World||Facebook moves to target misinformation before US presidential polls||With just two months left until the US presidential election, Facebook says it is taking more steps to encourage voting, minimize misinformation and reduce the likelihood of post-election “civil unrest.”The company said Thursday it will restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about Covid-19 and voting. It will also attach links to official results to posts from candidates and campaigns that declare premature victories.“This election is not going to be business as usual. We all have a responsibility to protect our democracy,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Thursday. “That means helping people register and vote, clearing up confusion about how this election will work, and taking steps to reduce the chances of violence and unrest.”Facebook and other social media companies are being scrutinized over how they handle misinformation, given problems with President Donald Trump and other candidates posting false information and Russia’s ongoing attempts to interfere in US politics.Facebook has long been criticized for not fact-checking political ads or limiting how they can be targeted at small groups of people.With the nation divided, and election results potentially taking days or weeks to be finalized, there could be an “increased risk of civil unrest across the country,” Zuckerberg said.Civil rights groups said they directly pitched Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives to make many of the changes announced Thursday.“These are really significant steps but everything is going to depend on the enforcement,” said Vanita Gupta, who was head of the Obama Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and now leads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “I think they’re going to be tested on it pretty soon.”In July, Trump refused to publicly commit to accepting the results of the upcoming election, as he scoffed at polls that showed him lagging behind Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump also has made false claims that the increased use of mail-in voting because of the coronavirus pandemic allows for voter fraud. That has raised concern over the willingness of Trump and his supporters to abide by election results.Under the new measures, Facebook says it will prohibit politicians and campaigns from running new election ads in the week before the election. However, they can still run existing ads and change how they are targeted. And many voters are expected to vote by mail well ahead of Election Day.Posts with obvious misinformation on voting policies and the coronavirus pandemic will also be removed. Users can only forward articles to a maximum of five others on Messenger, Facebook’s messaging app. The company also will work with Reuters to provide official election results and make the information available both on its platform and with push notifications.After being caught off-guard by Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook, Google, Twitter and others companies put safeguards in place to prevent it from happening again. That includes taking down posts, groups and accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” and strengthening verification procedures for political ads. Last year, Twitter banned political ads altogether.Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed more than 100 networks worldwide engaging in such interference over the last few years.“Just this week, we took down a network of 13 accounts and two pages that were trying to mislead Americans and amplify division,” he said.But experts and Facebook’s own employees say the measures are not enough to stop the spread of misinformation –- including from politicians and in the form of edited videos.Facebook had previously drawn criticism for its ads policy, which cited freedom of expression as the reason for letting politicians like Trump post false information about voting.Trump campaign spokeswoman Samantha Zager criticized the ban on new political ads, saying it would prevent Trump from defending himself on the platform in the last seven days of the presidential campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-moves-to-target-misinformation-before-us-presidential-polls/story-wBKVybrepfayeFNrGSoZfM.html

This comes when President Donald Trump has ordered a review of federal funding for cities that can be designated “anarchist jurisdictions”, mostly Democrat-run.Trump is keeping the focus of his re-election bid on the protests as a law-and-order issue, while Biden is trying to make it a vote on Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic. In a major speech on Wednesday, he said the reopening of schools is a “national emergency” and the administration has no plans for it.But responding to Trump’s stress on law and order and his attempt to tie Biden and Democrats to the violence, the former vice-president will visit Kenosha on Thursday and unlike the president, he will meet the family of Jacob Blake, the black man shot seven times in the back by a white police officer.“We’ve got to heal. We’ve got to put things together and bring people together,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday. “So my purpose in going will be to do just that — be a positive influence on what’s going on, talk about what needs to be done and try to see if there’s a beginning of a mechanism to bring the folks together.”Also read: Chinese Embassy in US criticises move to impose new restriction on diplomatsTrump had mostly met law enforcement officials during his Kenosha visit on Tuesday and had offered them his full support in the face of criticism of their use of excessive force, which he had said were mostly because some officers “choke” under pressure.Keeping the focus on law and order, the Trump administration ordered federal agencies to review funding to cities that have been in the grip of prolonged protests and block funds to those that are determined by the justice department to be “anarchist jurisdictions”, which have allowed the unrest to continue.The White House order named a few of them — Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; New York City, New York; and Washington DC.“Anarchy has recently beset some of our states and cities,” Trump said in the order. “For the past few months, several state and local governments have contributed to the violence and destruction in their jurisdictions by failing to enforce the law, disempowering and significantly defunding their police departments, and refusing to accept offers.”This will not be the first time the president has threatened to block federal funding to states and cities that have disagreed with him. He threatened to withhold funds from the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions — that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities — in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/while-trump-targets-anarchist-areas-biden-to-visit-kenosha-to-be-a-positive-influence/story-Z3foq16u0rZXnDPfKTWsyK.html

The Islamabad high court, after hearing arguments in the matter, asked attorney general Khalid Javed Khan to inform the government to send the court’s order to India and put off further hearings till October 3. The direction came after the attorney general informed the larger bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzaib, that the Pakistan government hadn’t received a reply from New Delhi on the matter till date. Khan said it appeared the Indian government was not interested in availing the opportunity of legal representation and its “focus is on embarrassing Pakistan”. He said that despite the passage of a month from the time that the Islamabad high court directed the government to offer a chance of legal representation to New Delhi, no reply had been received from the Indian side. Khan also said Pakistan is continuing the process of implementing the Internation Court of Justice’s (ICJ) judgment but “India is busy obstructing the right to review.” The ICJ had asked Pakistan to stay Jadhav’s death sentence and carry out a comprehensive review of his conviction and sentencing by a military court. On August 6, the Islamabad high court had formed a three-judge bench at the government’s request to hear the matter of allowing Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence. On August 3, a special bench headed by Chief Justice Minallah had directed the registrar’s office to form the larger bench. The court had also directed the government to make another offer to India and Jadhav through the Foreign Office to hire a lawyer. In its order, the court said that it was refraining from appointing a lawyer for Jadhav. It added the government of Pakistan should inform Jadhav about his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The court further observed Jadhav should be informed of the ICJ’s decision, adding he should also be made aware of his rights under an ordinance issued by the Pakistan government to the ICJ’s verdict. Pakistan has alleged Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in Balochistan on charges of espionage. He was subsequently sentenced to death following a secret trial by a military court the following year. India has rubbished these charges and said Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-court-directs-imran-khan-govt-to-give-india-another-chance-to-appoint-lawyer-for-kulbhushan-jadhav/story-FB9sPLpfYpvqZNdAEnm0ZI.html

This has grossly trampled on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and China is firmly opposed to it,” the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.The Embassy said it also runs counter to the “self-proclaimed values” of openness and freedom of the US side.“China has always supported and provided necessary facilitation for foreign diplomatic and consular personnel, including those from the US, to perform their official duties in China,” the Chinese Embassy said while adding that we urge the US side to “correct its mistake, revoke this decision and provide support and facilitation for Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel in the US to perform their duties as well.”US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo on Wednesday announced that the Department of State will now require senior People’s Republic of China (PRC) diplomats in the United States to receive approval to visit US university campuses and to meet with local government officials.“The Department of State will now require senior PRC diplomats in the United States to receive approval to visit US university campuses and to meet with local government officials. Cultural events with an audience larger than 50 people hosted by the PRC embassy and consular posts outside of mission properties will also require Department of State approval,” Pompeo said.“The Department of State will also take action to help ensure that all official PRC embassy and consular social media accounts are properly identified as PRC government accounts, since the US Embassy is denied unfettered access to PRC social media and PRC citizens are blocked from using Twitter and Facebook, amongst other social media platforms,” he said.Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times with the two countries sparring over a range of issues including China’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea.Pompeo said the US insists on reciprocal access to educational and cultural institutions for the United States diplomats around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-embassy-in-us-criticises-move-to-impose-new-restriction-on-diplomats/story-OGPofAWvyeu8a1Gg7NUZMP.html

A leadership election is set for Sept. 14 with LDP lawmakers and regional party representatives casting votes.The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP’s parliamentary majority. Kono, 57, who has also served as foreign minister, said he wanted Japan’s next leader to focus on rebuilding public finances once the pandemic had ended.“We need to secure our social security, how we are going to provide social security, pensions, medical, childcare. I think that’s going to be very important, and that needs to be thoroughly discussed,” Kono said.      Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he has recently hosted live question and answer session on Youtube, unusual for Japanese politicians, to answer question ranging from national security to his personal tastes.Despite his reputation as a maverick he has, nonetheless, toed the line on key Abe policies, including a tough approach toward South Korea in a feud over wartime history. That has differentiated him from his father, Yohei Kono, a former chief cabinet secretary who authored a landmark 1993 apology to “comfort women”, a euphemism for women from Korea and other places forced to work wartime military brothels.Kono said he was ready “anytime” when asked when he wanted to be prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-defence-chief-kono-backs-suga-for-prime-minister-but-keeps-eye-on-top-job/story-9xfusgHnYIxvTICEBPSHbO.html
03-09-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine frontrunners will soon see their moment of truth||Drugmakers made big promises for a quick turnaround on coronavirus vaccines. The moment of truth for the front-runners is coming as soon as this month.The first results showing whether a vaccine can stop people from getting the virus could come by mid-September from AstraZeneca Plc, according to Airfinity Ltd., an analytics company that tracks drug trials. The drugmaker has pledged as many as 30 million doses to the U.K. by the end of the month.Also read: Canada abandons clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccine after China blocks shipmentTwo other contenders -- the US’s Moderna Inc. and the US-German partnership of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE -- may also have initial data before a key Food and Drug Administration meeting on virus vaccines scheduled for Oct. 22, Airfinity said. The federal government has told states to prepare for a vaccine by Nov. 1. A fourth candidate, China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., could have preliminary results shortly after the FDA meeting.These early results will be far from the full picture. They’re what’s known as interim readouts -- snapshots taken before a study is complete, with only a fraction of the data. The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned against approving a vaccine before its full risks and benefits are clear. But with the virus resurgent in Europe and continuing to spread in India and the Americas, the initial numbers will be an important early indicator.The first results should be enough to “give us a very good idea of where we’re heading,” Airfinity Chief Executive Officer Rasmus Bech Hansen said. “They are moving faster than one could have anticipated.”Airfinity’s projections are based on publicly available data on trial enrollment and design, together with infection rates in places where patients are enrolled.Also read: US states told be ready to distribute Covid-19 vaccine by November 1Each of these experimental vaccines has already shown promise in smaller trials designed to flag any serious safety concerns and show whether candidates can spur some response from the immune system. Early safety data is key; unlike drugs, vaccines are typically given to relatively healthy people and shouldn’t create severe risks.The real proving ground, though, is a study big enough to show with a high degree of certainty whether a vaccine candidate can work in the real world. This requires tens of thousands of participants, compared to the few hundred people who took the vaccines in early-stage trials.Drugmakers would usually wait for final results before requesting regulatory approval, and the trio of front-runners are on track to get that full data by the end of the year, Airfinity says. In the US, that might not be fast enough. Overwhelmingly positive interim results could lead to studies being stopped early and the vaccines being rushed to the public, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Los Angeles Times earlier this week.Political pressure will be high to approve a vaccine if even the initial snapshot of data from these trials is promising. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine is possible by the Nov. 3 election and accused the FDA of trying to slow the approval process.Commissioner Stephen Hahn said last week he’s open to clearing a vaccine under an emergency use authorization, which is based on more limited data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked states in a letter to prepare for vaccine distribution sites to be “fully operational” by Nov. 1. The agency declined to comment on the letter.Russia and China, meanwhile, have already cleared experimental vaccines for limited use before testing was complete.Also read: ‘Confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be developed by end of 2020’: Health minister Harsh VardhanPfizer has said it’s on track to have enough data for an authorization as early as October. Based on how quickly and where it’s currently recruiting people for its 30,000-person trial, it will probably be the first US drugmaker with interim data -- by Oct. 15 -- but won’t have full results until Nov. 17, Airfinity projects. A Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment on how many virus cases it will need to see in order to get results in the trial.Companies testing vaccines in the US, where the virus has spread more quickly than in Europe for the past several months, may have an advantage in potential volunteers and infections. AstraZeneca said it expects results later this year, depending on the rate of infection in the communities where it’s running trials. J&J said it still plans to start its late-stage test this month, with first batches of vaccine available for potential emergency use in early 2021, pending the study results. Sinovac declined to comment. Moderna declined to comment on the time-frame for its data readouts.The drugmakers have already made deals to supply hundreds of millions of doses to governments around the world.The WHO has said any vaccine should be shown to be effective in at least half the people who get it to gain clearance. It will be important to follow participants in the trials long enough to see whether serious side effects emerge, WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Monday. A premature approval would make it hard to continue studying the vaccine in randomized trials, she said. The agency counts 176 Covid-19 vaccines in development, of which 33 have entered human trials.“What’s going to be really important, I think, is to make decisions based on science,” Swaminathan said, warning that an “inadequately studied” vaccine could present either safety problems or “low efficacy, thereby not doing the job of bringing an end to this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-frontrunners-will-soon-see-their-moment-of-truth/story-ogjjpKFkLkn0nRSDZZya0L.html

Outside the Wuluo Road elementary school, life has returned to a semblance of normality, with one reluctant new pupil screaming at her father to take her home. People carriers clogged the roads, and the school macroeconomy of breakfast stalls and convenience stores was thriving again.“During the epidemic, the kids were at home for more than half a year and in all aspects couldn’t study as well as they could at school,” said Wei Fanling, who was eating breakfast with her 12-year old son. She said she was relieved her son could now return to class, likening it to “a monster let out of its cage”, but they would remain vigilant. “Though this epidemic is over, we still cannot take it easy,” she said. Nearby residential compounds had around 40 confirmed coronavirus cases, parents said. Wuhan’s death toll of 3,869 accounts for more than 80% of China’s total, but it hasn’t seen a single local transmission since the middle of May. While Wuhan’s educational institutions are trying to put a tumultuous year behind them, they are still taking special precautions, with children subject to regular temperature tests.The government has advised parents to avoid public transport as much as possible. Buses were half-empty, with students being driven to class by private car or on electric scooters. Wuhan University, though up and running for more than a week and preparing to accept a new cohort of students, has sealed off its campus to prevent unauthorised outsiders from entering. All university students will be tested before they are allowed back, and those returning from overseas will be quarantined in campus guesthouses for 14 days. Qiao Qiong, a 40-year old university teacher whose son studies at the Wuluo Road school, said she was pleased that months of home schooling were now over, but normality was still some distance away.“The virus is not a tiny thing, so I believe we still need some time,” she said. “Probably there will be some emergency situations but we are well-prepared for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/students-return-to-class-in-wuhan-but-parents-and-teachers-wary-of-coronavirus-risk/story-8bGwpS7OE6ayoQciCOIRwI.html
03-09-2020||World||Kenosha unrest: Joe Biden to test his promise to unify the nation||Campaigning for more than a year as a calming, unifying figure, Joe Biden and his core pitch for the presidency face the most intense test yet when he travels to Kenosha, Wisconsin, a city wrenched by police and protest violence that makes it a microcosm of the nation’s election-year reckoning with systemic racism.The 77-year-old former vice president, travelling two days after President Donald Trump visited the same city, plans to meet Thursday with family of Jacob Blake, who remains hospitalised after being shot seven times in the back by a white police officer as authorities attempted to arrest him. Biden also plans a community discussion that he indicated would draw business figures, civic leaders and law enforcement officials. “This is about making sure that we move forward,” Biden told reporters Wednesday. Also read: US President Trump defends police, slams protests as ‘domestic terror’He added that he’s “not going to tell Kenosha what they have to do” but instead encourage a community “talk about what has to be done.” Falling exactly two months before Election Day, the trip presents Biden both opportunity and risks as he tests his promise, made again and again for 16 months, that he can “unify the country” and find consensus even where it’s not readily apparent. The approach always has been an intentional contrast with Trump, a president who thrives on conflict. But the distinction has sharpened over a summer of nationwide protests — most peaceful, but some of them, as in Kenosha, turned violent and destructive.Biden is a white man propelled to the Democratic nomination by Black voters. Since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, Biden has called for an overhaul of US policing and embraced a national conversation on racism. The significance of the moment was a factor in Biden selecting California Sen. Kamala Harris as the first Black woman to join a major party presidential ticket.Trump, meanwhile, has countered with sweeping condemnations of protesters, an absolute defense of law enforcement and denials that Americans with black and brown skin face barriers that whites do not — moves aimed at his overwhelmingly white political base.The president continued his “law and order” mantra during his own Kenosha trip Tuesday. He toured damaged buildings and discussed ways to quell unrest with law enforcement officials. Trump was greeted by supporters who occasionally mixed with — and yelled at — Black Lives Matter organisers.“These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,” Trump said.Despite repeated questions from reporters, the president refused to address racism in the country or its police departments. Instead, he asserted anew that a Biden presidency would bring riots and destruction to American cities. That echoes Trump’s false charges that Biden backs violent protests and activists’ calls to “defund the police.” In fact, Biden has repeatedly denounced violence, from a June 2 speech after Floyd’s death up to a Monday address that his campaign quickly turned into a one-minute digital and television ad. The campaign has spent USD 45 million for the spot, which has English and Spanish language versions, to circulate on national cable networks and in local markets across Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Also read: Donald Trump wades into racial tensions with visit to KenoshaYet the ad’s necessity highlights Biden’s tightrope as he openly discusses the complexities of the moment while running against a president whose brief political career — and his business career before that — has been defined by loud absolutes.Biden on Wednesday repeated that “to engage in violence — burning, looting, the rest — in the name of protesting, is wrong. And that person should be held accountable for their actions.” But he stood by First Amendment guarantees that “protest is a right.” He praised law enforcement.“Look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honourable women and men. They put on that shield every morning. They have a right to go home that night safely — the vast majority,” he said.But then he uttered words Trump doesn’t say: “Bad cops.” Good officers, Biden said, “want to get rid of the bad cops more than anybody else does, because it reflects on them.” He stands by his proposals to overhaul policing – not to “defund the police,” as Trump falsely accuses Biden of supporting – but to require local forces to agree to certain best practices to get federal funding and to invest more in services, such as mental health counseling, intended to ease social problems that fall to police to handle, sometimes with violent consequences.Biden noted that he’s “gotten overwhelming support from law enforcement my whole career,” alluding to endorsements from police unions as a US senator and as vice president. But it was Trump who featured police union leaders and the relatives of fallen officers at his presidential nominating convention. And it was Biden on Wednesday calling for a “full investigation” into police shootings and saying the officers who shot Blake should be charged with a crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-unrest-joe-biden-to-test-his-promise-to-unify-the-nation/story-s9B3LeX7NQPw6SIeWP8rVL.html

The first flight under the arrangement, Air China Flight 746, arrived from Pnom Penh, Cambodia, just before 7 a.m.Beginning in March, all international flights to Beijing had been redirected to a dozen other cities where passengers were tested and processed before being allowed to travel on to the Chinese capital.China has gone weeks without new cases of local infection and the 11 new cases recorded Thursday were all imported.Beijing’s last local outbreak in July was linked to a wholesale food market, and the city’s customs department announced Wednesday it would test all imported frozen foods, along with other goods arriving from countries considered to be at high risk.Storage and transportation facilities for imported food would also be disinfected and Beijing customs would work with other cities to ensure the safety of the supply chain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-beijing-receives-first-international-flights-since-march-says-report/story-ENpcwUePFKACRJchBahVBL.html

According to a report by the official news agency, Xinhua, in Mandarin, Zhao visited the anti-terrorist and special patrol departments of the local police in Hohhot, the provincial capital.He also reviewed the “Warhawks”, the detachment’s commando force.The official media report said Zhao said the police should “…undertake the duties of maintaining stability and dealing with emergencies, and fighting terrorism and violence”.According to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Centre (SMHRIC), the local police have increased deployment in the capital city, Hohhot; exiled groups refer to Inner Mongolia as Southern Mongolia.“A short video taken by a Mongolian resident of Hohhot shows that hundreds of heavily armed riot police were waiting for orders in the city’s main square–Xina Hua Square,” the group said in a statement.“According to some posts published on social media, government officials and Communist Party members of Mongolian ethnicity have been ordered to send their children to school by September 3, or else they will be fired or expelled from the party. Any Mongolians, on social benefits, will also automatically become ineligible for renewal if they do not send their children to school by the same deadline,” the SMHRIC said.The change in curriculum in schools in Inner Mongolia, which was enacted this week, means that three core subjects – politics, history, language and literature – will now be taught in Mandarin, and not in Mongolian anymore.The vast mineral-rich province shares its international border with Mongolia and Russia.Also Read: Taiwan denounces China’s ‘vulgar threats’ towards Czech speakerRights groups say the move to change language in schools in Inner Mongolia mirrors what Beijing has done in Tibet and Xinjiang where, after local languages were replaced, the focus now is to sinicise even Tibetan and Islam – assimilate, even subsume, local ethnic communities within the majority Han population.The Hindustan Times has reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for a comment on the protests.Christopher P.

This policy will be formally implemented from the beginning of school, this 1 September, starting with ‘language and literature’ in first and seventh grade,” Atwood wrote in the journal, which is brought out by the Australian Centre on China in the World and the Australian National University.Next year, it will be extended to ‘morality and law’ and then to ‘history’ in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-police-minister-talks-terrorism-during-inner-mongolia-tour-amid-rare-protests-over-language/story-9jWpwHFERYZBXyZo7ciPJO.html

To produce the CBD, Pakistan plans to import a specific variety of cannabis seeds.“CBD compound plays an important role in therapeutic medicine. After 2016, a breakthrough research was unveiled which prompted China to set up a cannabis research department and is now cultivating hemp on 40,000 acres, and Canada is cultivating it on 100,000 acres,” Chaudhry told reporters during a press briefing in Islamabad.Also read: China threatened Czech leader for ‘crossing red line’. He jumps over anotherHe said that the plant Pakistan plans to grow contains legal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — around 0.3 percent or below. At higher levels, THC is intoxicating and illegal in many parts of the world.The minister said that hemp seeds are used for producing oil, leaves for developing medication, while stems are used for fibres which are gradually replacing cotton in the textile industry.“Worldwide, this fibre is replacing cotton. Clothes, bags, and other textile products are being made using this plant’s fibre. This is a $25 billion market and Pakistan can take a big share in this market,” Chaudhry said, adding, “this is under government control, so further research can be done and adequate safeguards through ministry of narcotics can be placed.”The minister expected the hemp market to generate $1 billion in revenue for Pakistan in the next three years when research, cultivation, production, and exports for medical and industrial purposes are underway. The ministry has scouted areas in the Potohar region in northern Punjab, which is considered adequate for growing hemp due to its climate.This is part of the science ministry’s larger initiative on precision agriculture under which niche projects focused on non-traditional agriculture are under development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-landmark-decision-pakistan-approves-industrial-use-of-cannabis-and-hemp/story-BNWRpToqe0eMKBASrnqq8O.html
03-09-2020||World||Merkel faces pressure to drop Russian gas pipeline after Navalny’s poisoning||Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure from within her own party to drop support for a controversial gas pipeline with Russia after links point to the Kremlin in the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.Norbert Roettgen, head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee and a candidate to head Merkel’s Christian Democratic party, said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline needs to be stopped because completing it would reward rather than punish Russian President Vladimir Putin.“After the poisoning of Nawalny we need a strong European answer, which Putin understands: The EU should jointly decide to stop Nord Stream 2,” he said Thursday on Twitter. “Diplomatic rituals are no longer enough.”Merkel said tests showed “unequivocally” that Navalny was poisoned by a military-grade novichok nerve agent and called on the Russian government to provide answers. The substance was used in the March 2018 attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil, prompting a concerted expulsion of 150 Russian diplomats.Merkel plans to consult with European Union and NATO allies to formulate a response in the coming days, but didn’t make a proposal.Alexander Dobrindt, the deputy caucus leader and a member of the Bavarian branch of Merkel’s bloc, demanded new EU sanctions against Russia. There will have to be a “common European response to this deed,” the lawmaker said at a press briefing Wednesday, as well as “uncomfortable and serious” discussions between the Russian and German governments.Before a special German armed forces laboratory confirmed Navalny’s poisoning with novichok, the chancellor decoupled the status of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from the attack on the Putin critic. The project is a joint Russian-European economic venture and linking it to the Navalny case “isn’t appropriate,” she said on Friday.The Nord Stream 2 consortium is led by Russia’s Gazprom PJSC. The group, which includes BASF SE’s Wintershall DEA unit and Austria’s OMV AG, has invested close to 8 billion euros ($9.5 billion) so far on the 745-mile pipeline. Even before the Navalny poisoning escalated tensions with Russia, the project was in limbo amid renewed efforts by US senators to torpedo its completion.Ralph Brinkhaus, head of the parliamentary caucus for Merkel’s bloc, raised doubts about whether it will now be possible to proceed with Nord Stream 2.“We will have to see in the next few days what kind of responses we get and what discussions will take place,” he said. “But this is indeed a very serious case,” Brinkhaus said Wednesday.After realizing his statement ran counter to Merkel’s position on Nord Stream, he rowed back, saying: “I didn’t construct a direct link between the Navalny case and Nord Stream, but just meant general German-Russian relations and what consequences this might have.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-faces-pressure-to-drop-russian-gas-pipeline-after-navalny-s-poisoning/story-cb4jKpOMpZf5hEYZVR7ibI.html
03-09-2020||World||Portland protests set up clash between journalists, police||The beam of a police officer’s flashlight swept across a group of 15 people standing on the sidewalk in downtown Portland, Oregon, recording and taking photos of the nightly protests that have roiled the city for three months. Most in the recent group wore helmets, reflective vests or shirts emblazoned with the word “PRESS” and had media badges dangling from their necks. But some were demonstrators, taking cover behind reporters despite orders to go home or face arrest. “Hey,” an officer yelled at his colleagues as they cleared streets and arrested people who weren’t leaving. “Half this group is not press. ... Purple mask isn’t press. Bicyclist not press. ... If they are not press, take them into custody.” For nearly 100 days, reporters have been covering protests that often turn violent in Oregon’s largest city, and in the chaos, some journalists have been injured or arrested despite press freedoms laid out in the First Amendment. The clash also led to a lawsuit against federal authorities sent in to help local police in July. Reporters — whether they’re from major media outlets, freelancers or self-proclaimed “citizen journalists” — say they are doing their job and law enforcement is hindering that work. Police say protesters have masqueraded as journalists and then set fires or thrown fireworks, making it a struggle to figure out who is a real reporter during the pandemonium. Suzette Smith, a freelance journalist who has covered the protests, recorded the August 29 encounter between police and reporters. “Blue mask,” an officer could be heard saying in the video Smith tweeted. Her mask was blue, and she held up her press badge. At least five people around her were detained, including someone else in a blue mask. Smith, who was arts editor of the Portland Mercury alternative newspaper but was laid off during COVID-19 pandemic, said it was the first time she has seen officers approach a crowd of journalists and arrest people around her. But protesters will stay behind reporters to try to blend in, she said. “Certainly that’s annoying as a press person when there is somebody behind you yelling,” Smith said. “I have definitely asked them not to yell in my ear or to stand so close.” Sergio Olmos, a reporter for Oregon Public Broadcasting, has been covering the Portland protests for months and has reported from other demonstrations in the city and civil unrest around the world. He said reporters have been treated differently during protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Olmos said police went from viewing reporters as professionals and neutral observers to demonstrators. While covering Portland’s protests, he says he has been pushed to the ground by police, hit in the lip with a baton and tear gassed. “(Journalists) who stay out there have made a mental commitment of ‘I might get beat or I might get arrested, and that’s just the cost of doing this job I guess,’ “ Olmos said. According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, made up of more than two dozen press freedom groups, over 740 aggressions against journalists have been reported during national Black Lives Matter protests this year. That can include attacks, arrests or equipment getting damaged, searched or seized. “What really has been striking about these weeks of protests is that there has not just been one incident that stands out,” said Kelly Simon, interim legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon. “It is such a high volume of concerning abuses of our constitutional rights, that there is no way we can sit on the sidelines.” In July, the ACLU of Oregon sued Portland police and federal agents on behalf of a group of legal observers and journalists. A freelance photographer covering the protests for The Associated Press submitted an affidavit saying he was beaten with batons, sprayed with chemical irritants and hit with rubber bullets. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction exempting journalists and legal observers from orders to disperse after authorities declare a riot. But an appeals court later suspended it. Police report that people with “press markings” have thrown commercial-grade fireworks, rocks and bottles at officers over the past two months and mingled with people in the crowd. In mid-August, police said an officer was seriously injured after a person with “press” on their clothing threw a 9-pound rock. Police declined requests for an interview. In a June video, Lt. Tina Jones said Portland police “continue to work with our media partners about the importance of following the lawful orders given by the sound truck, officers and social media so they can stay safe and avoid arrest and altercation.” While many reporters clearly identify themselves, officials have discussed if more can be done. US District Judge Michael Simon suggested redefining a journalist as “someone who is authorised by the ACLU,” saying the organization “could maintain a list of who they are giving vests to and give them appropriate guidance and instructions. That way we might be able to solve the problem of somebody just putting ‘press’ on their helmet or their shirt.” Media experts say it’s broader than that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portland-protests-set-up-clash-between-journalists-police/story-ghWvDyuuttwwmVYUlKsJzH.html

The Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi said this week he would pay a “heavy price” for visiting the democratic island.Vystrcil declared himself to be Taiwanese in a speech at Taiwan’s parliament on Tuesday, channelling the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s defiance of communism in Berlin in 1963, further angering Beijing but winning plaudits in Taipei.Speaking with Vystrcil by his side Taipei, Taiwan parliament Speaker You Si-kun praised his “stirring” speech at the legislature.Vystrcil “was gentle and elegant, a paragon of a cultured country, like spring sunshine, splendid and warn - Taiwan’s people were deeply moved”, You said.“Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s vulgar threats however were like a cold, unwelcome winter wind that cause discomfort.”Vystrcil said he had invited You to lead a delegation to Prague for what he termed a “working visit”, and dismissed China’s criticisms. “Of course I don’t like the statements, but I do not feel I have crossed a red line whatsoever, as I don’t think we did anything that was an infringement of the ‘one China’ policy as the Czech Republic has it within its foreign policy,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.“As I have always said, democratic and free countries should always cooperate. There’s nothing to be changed on that approach.”The Czech Republic, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. China demands countries it has relations with accept that Taiwan belongs to “one China”.Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-denounces-china-s-vulgar-threats-towards-czech-speaker/story-Q7j7MBLGaFwiADE5W0olbK.html
03-09-2020||World||China threatened Czech leader for ‘crossing red line’. He jumps over another||Czech Senate president Milos Vystrcil on Thursday morning met Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen during his visit to the self-ruled democratic island, defying China that has called the trip “an act of international treachery” and his statements, violation of Beijing’s ‘One-China policy’.The harshest Chinese reaction to the trip had come from foreign minister Wang Yi who is on a five-nation Europe outreach visit and told Vystrcil that he had “crossed a red line”. China treats Taiwan as its territory and objects to official contact between other countries and the self-governing island.ALSO WATCH | USA was naive, China won’t change; India real friend: Ex-US diplomat Nikki Haley“The Chinese government and Chinese people won’t take a laissez-faire attitude or sit idly by, and will make him (Vystrcil) pay a heavy price for his short-sighted behaviour and political opportunism.” the Chinese foreign minister said over the weekend..Wang was promptly rebuked by Germany, Slovakia and France.German foreign minister Heiko Maas, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, on Wednesday confronted Wang for his threat, telling him that Europeans offered its international partners respect and expected “the exact same” from them. “Threats don’t fit in here,” Maas said on Tuesday according to a Bloomberg report, standing next to Wang at a press briefing in Berlin.The French foreign ministry has called Wang’s comments “unacceptable”, a message echoed by Slovakia President Zuzana Caputova. “Threats directed at one of the EU members and its representatives contradict the very essence of our partnership and as such are unacceptable,” President Caputova said in a tweet. #Slovakia stands by the Czech Republic. #EU-#China relations are based on dialogue and mutual respect. Threats directed at one of the EU members and its representatives contradict the very essence of our partnership and as such are unacceptable.Milos Vystrcil, whose visit to Taipei triggered the diplomatic storm, landed in Taiwan on 30 August with a 90-member delegation, declaring that the Czech Republic would not bow to objections from Beijing that considers the democratically-ruled island a breakaway province.Also Read: China taking advantage of Covid-19 outbreak, India one such example: US diplomatOn Thursday morning, he stuck to his schedule and met Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen and other top government officials Thursday. Tsai presented a medal for Jaroslav Kubera, the late predecessor of Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil, who died in January before he could travel to Taiwan to accept the medal.“I do not feel I have crossed any red line whatsoever,” Vystrcil told reporters after the meeting, according to news agency Associated Press.Vystrcil said he hadn’t done anything that would be an infringement of the One China policy but underlined that “every country has the right to interpret the One China principle in their own way.”Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Taiwan is trying to maintain the status quo “and the status quo is that Taiwan does not belong to China. Taiwan is governed by its own people.” The two sides also spoke of plans to deepen cooperation in business, scientific research and democratic exchange.Vystrcil had on Tuesday angered Beijing when he, in his address to Taiwanese lawmakers, invoked a 1963 speech by US President John F Kennedy during a Cold War trip to West Berlin and emphasised democratic freedoms embraced by the Czech Republic after communist rule at the end of the Cold War.“In 1963, the American president JFK, in his famous speech ‘I’m a Berliner,’ clearly opposed communism and political oppression and supported the people of West Berlin,” Vystrcil said. “He said ‘Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.’”“Please let me use the same manner to express my support to the people of Taiwan: I’m a Taiwanese,” he said according to the AP report.On Thursday, Taiwan parliament speaker You Si-kun showered praises at Vystrcil for his “stirring” speech to lawmakers and described him as a paragon of a cultured country. “Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s vulgar threats however were like a cold, unwelcome winter wind that cause discomfort,” the speaker said, according to a Reuters report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-leader-on-taiwan-visit-gets-germany-s-support-snubs-china-again/story-mMkGSTXj1lh43nXe0OarUL.html

03-09-2020||World||Angela Merkel’s top diplomat warns China over Taiwan ‘threats’||A tense back-and-forth in Berlin on Tuesday showed how a planned Chinese charm offensive in Europe only appears to have backfired.On the final stop of Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s five-nation swing through Europe, he was confronted by German counterpart Heiko Maas for saying the Czech Senate president would pay a “heavy price” for his Taiwan visit. Maas said he’d spoken by phone with his Czech counterpart and emphasized that Europe wouldn’t be intimidated.“We as Europeans act in close cooperation -- we offer our international partners respect, and we expect the exact same from them,” Maas said Tuesday at a 50-minute press briefing in Berlin alongside Wang. “Threats don’t fit in here.”Wang stood his ground, saying that Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil’s visit was an intervention in China’s internal affairs and a violation to which the government in Beijing had to respond.“You’ve crossed a red line,” Wang said in Berlin, referring to Vystrcil and his 90-member delegation, including Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib, a Beijing critic who in January made Taipei a sister city to the Czech capital.During the press briefing, Wang was pressured on China’s stance on Hong Kong, the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, his assertive comments during his week-long European tour and China’s treatment of ethnic Uighurs in the far west region of Xinjiang. He issued an extended defense of Chinese policy, reiterating warnings that accusations against Beijing constitute an intervention in the country’s internal affairs -- and denying that China sought to disrupt relations.“We are not trouble-makers,” Wang said.The tensions overshadowed issues including an EU-China investment accord, which Angela Merkel’s government had aimed to complete by the end of the year. Maas said the 27-member bloc would assert its sovereignty and won’t become a “play thing” as the US, China and Russia shake geopolitical foundations.‘Unacceptable’More broadly, it showed China’s failure to win over Europe as it seeks to counter pressure from the Trump administration on everything from democracy in Hong Kong to data security over apps such as TikTok and WeChat.The Chinese diplomat had started the five-nation European trip saying relations with Europe shouldn’t suffer because of Beijing’s intensifying standoff with President Donald Trump, who has touted his strong stance against China on the campaign trail ahead of the November election. But his appearances tended to only ratchet up tensions with the region.In Norway, he suggested that the Nobel Peace Prize should not be issued to Hong Kong protesters, evoking memories of a cratering of relations a decade ago when the committee awarded the prize to a Chinese democracy advocate. Matters then escalated with the warning against the Czech politician, which only appeared to unify European countries.The French foreign ministry weighed in Tuesday, calling Wang’s comments on the Czech visit to Taiwan “unacceptable.”“#EU-#China relations are based on dialogue and mutual respect,” Slovakia President Zuzana Caputova said on Twitter. “Threats directed at one of the EU members and its representatives contradict the very essence of our partnership and as such are unacceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-top-diplomat-warns-china-over-taiwan-threats/story-xPVuRXn5OxpkTKRXiWd2AJ.html
03-09-2020||World||Beijing to permit international flights from Thursday after 6 months||The Chinese capital is opening up to international travel after a gap of six months following the Covid-19 pandemic with an official announcement saying that flights from eight countries, including its ‘all-weather ally’ Pakistan, would be permitted from Thursday. Beijing, which banned all international flights from March 23, on Wednesday announced plans to resume direct international flights beginning Thursday, signalling that the pandemic has been contained in the city. Flights connecting Thailand, Cambodia and Pakistan in Asia; Greece, Denmark, Austria and Sweden in Europe and Canada in North America -- countries with relatively small numbers of imported cases -- will resume. The first direct international flight to Beijing will depart from Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh on Thursday which will be operated by Air China. Meanwhile, India operated its fourth ‘Vande Bharat’ flight to China on Wednesday. The flight carried several Indian expats to Shanghai from Delhi and carried a large number of stranded Indians who wanted to go back home. India has so far operated four ‘Vande Bharat’ flights to Shanghai and Guangzhou besides three earlier to Wuhan to airlift Indians, mostly students, stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in February. China is gradually permitting flights from different countries, including the US to Shanghai and other cities mainly to bring back its stranded citizens abroad. After a break since late March, Beijing airports will open again to welcome passengers from eight countries directly into the city, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said. Since March, all international flights bound for Beijing have been rerouted to other Chinese cities, in a bid to prevent the imported cases of coronavirus. All international passengers entering Beijing like other cities in China would undergo 14-day collective quarantine periods for medical observations and take nucleic acid tests twice, Beijing health authority spokesman Gao Xiaojun told a press conference on Wednesday. Beijing reported no new case for 26 consecutive days as of Wednesday, according to local health authorities. It does not mean, however, that Beijing -- or other cities in the country -- could relax their prevention and control measures, as China has been seeing growing numbers of imported cases in recent months, according to some experts. With the experience of dealing with resurgent outbreaks in cities like Beijing and Dalian of northeast China’s Liaoning province, China is increasingly capable of handling imported cases, and Covid-19 prevention and control has become a regular task, Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-permit-international-flights-from-thursday-after-6-months/story-gAh9ToC5avbfUsvXEdx61J.html
03-09-2020||World||Thailand’s king Maha Vajiralongkorn reconciles with ousted consort||Thailand’s king has reconciled with his royal consort, whom he stripped of her titles last year after accusing her of seeking to undermine his official wife, the country’s queen.The restoration of Sineenatra Wongvajirabhakdi to the good graces of King Maha Vajiralongkorn was confirmed by an official announcement published Wednesday in the Royal Gazette. The announcement, dated Aug. 29, said she was being given back her royal and military titles.It said Sineenatra was not tainted by any wrongdoing, and the record should not show that she ever lost her privileges.Bloggers who follow royal news had reported last week that Sineenatra had been rehabilitated. She had not been seen publicly after her fall from grace last year and her whereabouts were never made clear.In July last year, Vajiralongkorn gave Sineenatra the title of chao khun phra, or royal noble consort, reviving an old palace tradition of taking a junior wife that had not been practiced for almost a century.In May last year, Vajiralongkorn named longtime companion Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya his queen when they were married a few days before his formal coronation. Vajiralongkorn assumed the throne after the 2016 death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years.Then last October, less than three months after making Sineenatra his royal consort, the king issued a command rescinding the appointment. In a statement, he accused her of misbehaving by actively seeking to block Suthida’s appointment as queen in order to take the position herself, and saying that when she failed to block Suthida, her “ambitions and aspirations” led her to continue to seek ways to promote herself.That statement said the king tried to alleviate the problem by appointing Sineenatra his official royal consort but that she remained unsatisfied and continued to compete with Queen Suthida.Both Queen Suthida, 42, and Sineenatra, 35, have served as senior officers in palace security units. Suthida was previously a flight attendant with Thai Airways, while Sineenatra was an army nurse. The 68-year-old king has seven children by three previous marriages, all of which ended in divorce.Sineenatra’s fall had been particularly stunning because only two months earlier, a palace website released scores of photos of her and the king, some in formal settings and others in markedly casual poses, such as taking part in flying, shooting and skydiving. Others showed her and the king holding hands, unusually intimate photos for members of the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-s-king-maha-vajiralongkorn-reconciles-with-ousted-consort/story-RXT5EiCD40gfGJwByiHnCN.html
03-09-2020||World||Macron throws 100 bn euros at French economic relaunch to ward off Covid-19’s effects||Emmanuel Macron’s government unveiled the long-awaited 100 billion-euro ($118 billion) stimulus plan the French president is betting on to transform the economy and his political fortunes with less than two years to go until elections.The plan, dubbed “France Relaunch,” includes wage subsidies, tax cuts for businesses and funding for environmental projects. It aims to shift away from the emergency spending of the Covid crisis to addressing longer term problems of weak investment and job creation in the euro area’s largest economy.The fiscal reboot -- much of which was announced over the summer -- will be spread over two years and is split in roughly equal parts between competitiveness, jobs and social policies, and financing the transition to a greener economy.It’s a high-stakes political move for Macron. The French economy was among the worst hit in Europe by lockdowns, and the initial rebound appears to be tapering off. Furlough measures have helped contain unemployment for now, but it could rise sharply in the coming months.Looming over the grim outlook are presidential elections in April 2022, leaving Macron no time for another shot at a defining policy transformation before he faces voters.Governments across Europe are planning additional stimulus as the coronavirus continues to hammer economies. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling bloc on Tuesday backed plans allowing for extraordinary deficit spending next year.But many countries have already stretched their finances. In France’s case, emergency spending has pushed the debt burden to around 120% of output -- a level the central bank has warned the government should not exceed. Already, France will rely on European financing for up to 40 billion euros of the stimulus plan.Around 15 billion euros will be spent on employment, including 7.6 billion euros on a long-term furlough combined with training for idled workers, and bonuses for hiring young people, officials said.Green spending will focus on low-emission transport -- particularly rail -- and renovations to make buildings more energy efficient. The industrial part of the plan is made up mainly of a cut to taxes on production, at a cost of 10 billion euros a year.“It’s a wise mix of short-term boosts to demand via job protection and longer-term supply via investment,” said Allianz Chief Economist Ludovic Subran. “But it’s very French in the way it aims to resolve everything in one plan. There are no contingencies for supporting businesses and households in response to a changing pandemic.”The government estimates that France Relaunch will return economic output to 2019 levels in 2022, according to officials at the prime minister’s office, while also having a lasting impact that will raise potential growth by one percentage point 10 years from now.Around half of the 400,000 jobs the government expects to be created in 2020 and 2021 will be attributable to the stimulus plan. Another 300,000 will be saved by a combination of emergency and long-term furlough mechanisms.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-throws-100-bn-euros-at-french-economic-relaunch-to-ward-off-covid-19-s-effects/story-ABQWsfJ5HdKNewzLPLxJ2O.html

The Islamabad high court on July 10 asked the ministry to decide on a PPP leader’s petition seeking deportation of the US blogger, her stay in Pakistan and the extension of her visa. The ministry told the court her visa had expired on August 31. The spat was triggered after Ritchie insinuated that slain former Prime Minister and PPP leader Benazir Bhutto ordered a woman’s rape after she suspected her of having a relationship with her husband and ex-president, Asif Zardari. Ritchie later accused a PPP leader and then minister of raping her in 2011 when the party was in power. She also alleged two other senior party leaders —a federal minister and former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani--manhandled her when the latter “was staying at the President House”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-rejects-us-blogger-cynthia-ritchie-s-visa-extention-plea-tells-her-to-leave-in-15-days/story-zAZGgsTrcFOrYl2PUJ5t5I.html
03-09-2020||World||‘Know a 78-year-old who’s not so sharp’: Trump takes jab at Biden during Victory of Japan day celebrations||As thunderstorms threatened, President Donald Trump sped through a V-J Day speech on Wednesday, trumpeting American strength and managing to squeeze in a swipe at Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump stood before an iconic World War II-era battleship to declare the port city of Wilmington, North Carolina, a World War II “Heritage City.” He pointed to a bolt of lightning and said it was God saluting the event.He honored war veterans, including 97-year-old Hershel “Woody” Williams, the sole surviving Marine from the war to receive the Medal of Honor. The West Virginia native fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima in the Pacific.“He’s 100 percent sharp,” Trump said of Williams, who traveled to the key battleground state with the president aboard Air Force One.“I know a 78-year-old who’s not so sharp,” Trump added, a clear allusion to Biden.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany had insisted earlier this week that there was no “political purpose” to Trump’s visit to North Carolina. But when the president landed in Wilmington, Trump lost no time in criticizing Biden.“This is the most important election in the history of our country. I really believe that, because we’re running against people that have got some big issues,” he told supporters on the airport tarmac. “They have got some big, big problems. They’re stone cold crazy.”Trump also encouraged those who cast votes by mail to cast two ballots in November’s election, one by mail and another in person as a check to see if the mailed vote was counted.“They’ll go out and they’ll vote and they’re going to have to go and check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates then they won’t be able to do that. So, let them send it in and let them go vote,” Trump said in an interview with WECT-TV at the Wilmington airport. “And if their system’s as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they’ll be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.”Trump made a similar appeal in remarks to supporters at the airport. “You can’t let them take your vote away; these people are playing dirty politics — dirty politics. So if you have an absentee ballot or, as I call it, a solicited ballot ... you send it in, but I would check it, in any event, I would go and follow it and go vote,” he said.Trump won North Carolina by 3.6 percentage points in 2016, but polls are showing an extremely close race taking shape in a state that generates 15 electoral votes for its winner.The president’s visit to North Carolina comes as county boards start sending absentee ballots to voters on Friday. Vice President Mike Pence will follow the president by visiting Raleigh on Thursday.Through Sept. 1, more than 591,000 ballot requests had been received, compared with approximately 36,500 through the same period in 2016, the state elections board said Wednesday.More than half of the absentee ballots, or approximately 313,000, have been requested by Democrats. Republicans have requested more than 93,000 and registered unaffiliated voters account for approximately 183,000 ballot requests.Biden released a statement in advance of the trip saying that Trump has not provided North Carolina with the roadmap and resources needed to protect businesses, schools and families from the coronavirus.“Instead of honoring the sacrifice of our front-line heroes, President Trump has repeatedly ignored public health guidance for political purposes,” Biden said.Wilmington has been home to the Battleship North Carolina since 1962. The ship is now a floating museum. On Sept. 2, 1945, Japan’s formal surrender took place aboard the U.S.S. Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay.Congress passed a bill earlier this year that included a provision requiring the secretary of the interior to annually designate one city in the United States as an “American World War II Heritage City.” Wilmington is the first city to get that designation.___Associated Press writers Jonathan Drew in Durham, N.C., and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/know-a-78-year-old-who-s-not-so-sharp-trump-takes-jab-at-biden-during-victory-of-japan-day-celebrations/story-KGUCDeZkfeSu8lgJFvm6YI.html
03-09-2020||World||US AG Barr calls mail-in voting ‘playing with fire’; experts differ||US Attorney General William Barr said on Wednesday that mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 election could be vulnerable to fraud, echoing an argument President Donald Trump has made to denounce the use of voting by mail.“People trying to change the rules to this methodology, which, as a matter of logic, is very open to fraud and coercion. It’s reckless and dangerous, and people are playing with fire,” Barr said in an interview with CNN.Voting by mail is not new in the United States - nearly one in four voters cast presidential ballots in 2016 that way. Experts say voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States.Barr cited a 2005 report by the Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, which concluded that absentee ballots are the largest source of potential voter fraud. “Since that time, there have been in the newspapers, in networks, academic studies, saying it is open to fraud and coercion,” Barr said. “The only time the narrative changed is after this administration came in.”He said there are a number of ongoing investigations into voter fraud, “some very big ones in states.” A record number of mail-in ballots are expected for the Nov. 3 election due to concerns about in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump has accused Democrats of trying to steal the election by pushing the use of mail-in voting. Democrats have said Trump and fellow Republicans are attempting to suppress the vote to help their side. In an interview with WECT-TV in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump suggested voters should vote twice, once by mail and once in person, to make sure their vote was counted. “So, let them send it in and let them go vote,” he said. “And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won’t be able to vote” in person. Voting more than once in an election is illegal. Barr said arrangements could be made at polling stations to protect people from the coronavirus and that people with pre-existing conditions who are particularly vulnerable could get an absentee ballot.He also raised the specter of a foreign government counterfeiting U.S. ballots, although he said he had seen no evidence of such an effort.Barr said he believes China is more of a threat than Russia when it comes to interfering in the election. “I’ve seen intelligence. That’s what I’ve concluded,” he said, without offering details.But Barr said there was “some preliminary activity that suggests” Russia might try to interfere again in the election. “It wouldn’t surprise me if Russia tries something again,” he said.Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia used a campaign of propaganda and hacking to boost Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ag-barr-calls-mail-in-voting-playing-with-fire-experts-differ/story-A98nHoo9NC6ZoWbot6AKVL.html
03-09-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic will push 47 million more women, girls into extreme poverty by 2021: UN||The Covid-19 pandemic will disproportionately affect women and push 47 million more women and girls into extreme poverty by 2021, reversing decades of progress to lift this demographic above the poverty line, according to new data released by the UN.The new analysis by the UN Women and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said the Covid-19 crisis will dramatically increase the poverty rate for women and widen the gap between men and women who live in poverty.The poverty rate for women was expected to decrease by 2.7 per cent between 2019 and 2021, but projections now point to an increase of 9.1 per cent due to the pandemic and its fallout.The “pandemic will push 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls. This will increase the total number of women and girls living in extreme poverty to 435 million, with projections showing that this number will not revert to pre-pandemic levels until 2030,” the UN agencies said.The projections show that while the pandemic will impact global poverty generally, women will be disproportionately affected, especially women of reproductive age. By 2021, for every 100 men aged 25 to 34 living in extreme poverty (living on USD 1.90 a day or less), there will be 118 women, a gap that is expected to increase to 121 women per 100 men by 2030.“The increases in women’s extreme poverty are a stark indictment of deep flaws in the ways we have constructed our societies and economies,” UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said. “We know that women take most of the responsibility for caring for the family; they earn less, save less and hold much less secure jobs – in fact, overall, women’s employment is 19 per cent more at risk than men’s,” Mlambo-Ngcuka added.She said that the evidence of multiple inequalities is critical to driving swift, restorative policy action that puts women at the heart of pandemic recovery.While the pandemic has posed a serious threat to the prospects of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of this decade, the reality is even grimmer as these projections of increased poverty rates for women and girls only account for the downward revision of the gross domestic product (GDP), excluding other factors—such as women leaving the workforce due to childcare responsibilities—that may also affect the sex distribution of poverty.“More than 100 million women and girls could be lifted out of poverty if governments implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving access to education and family planning, fair and equal wages, and expanding social transfers,” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said.He noted with concern that women are bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 crisis as they are more likely to lose their source of income and less likely to be covered by social protection measures. “Investing in reducing gender inequality is not only smart and affordable but also an urgent choice that governments can make to reverse the impact of the pandemic on poverty reduction,” he added.The fallout of the pandemic will shift forecasts of extreme poverty across regions. The report said that Central and Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (where 87 per cent of the world’s extreme poor live) will see the largest increases in extreme poverty, with an additional 54 million and 24 million people, respectively, living below the international poverty line as a result of the pandemic.“The expected rise of poverty in South Asia as a result of the economic fallout of the pandemic showcases the vulnerability of women and girls living in households that have only recently been able to escape poverty,” it said.The pre-pandemic female poverty rate in South Asia was projected to be 10 per cent in 2021 but is now expected to reach 13 per cent. Moreover, before the pandemic, projections for the region suggested that by 2030 only 15.8 per cent of the world’s poor women and girls would be living in South Asia. The revised projections now put that figure at 18.6 per cent.“Significantly more women than men in South Asia will be affected. In the 25-34 age group, there will be 118 poor women for every 100 poor men in that region, and that ratio will increase to 129 women for every 100 men by 2030,” the data said.The report noted that while these figures are alarming, the study estimates it would take just 0.14 per cent of global GDP - USD 2 trillion - to lift the world out of extreme poverty by 2030; and USD 48 billion to close the gender poverty gap. However, the real number could end up being much higher, especially if governments fail to act—or act too late. The unabated rise of other pre-existing gender inequalities will also impact these figures. Women are employed in some of the most affected sectors, like accommodation, food services, and domestic work. They have been particularly vulnerable to layoffs and loss of livelihood.Recommendations to prevent women from falling behind permanently because of the pandemic range from addressing occupational segregation, gender pay gaps and inadequate access to affordable childcare to introducing economic support packages for vulnerable women to countries increasing social protection measures targeting women and girls and expanding research and data available on the gendered impacts of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-will-push-47-million-more-women-girls-into-extreme-poverty-by-2021-un/story-g4lXYztCYP1EH2O2VqxuXJ.html

It shows that the COVAX facility is open for business and is attracting the type of interest across the world we had hoped it would,” he said. COVAX coordinators are in talks with China about whether it might also join, Berkley said. “We had a discussion yesterday with the (Chinese) government,” Berkley said. “We don’t have any signed agreement with them yet,” but Beijing has given “a positive signal,” he added.COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and is designed to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country. Its backers say this strategy should lead to lower vaccine costs for everyone and a swifter end to the pandemic that has claimed some 860,000 lives globally.Wealthy countries that join COVAX will finance the vaccine purchases from their national budgets, and will partner with 92 poorer nations supported through voluntary donations to the plan to ensure vaccines are delivered equitably, Berkley said.Participating wealthy countries are also free to procure vaccines through bilateral deals and other plans. The United States said on Tuesday it would not join COVAX due to the Trump administration’s objection to WHO involvement, a move described by some critics as “disappointing”. Berkley said he was not surprised by the U.S. decision, but would seek to continue talks with Washington.In what appeared to be a change of position on Wednesday, the European Union said its member states could buy potential COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX.COVAX coordinators sought to add flexibility to joining agreements to encourage greater participation, Berkley said. The WHO describes COVAX as an “invaluable insurance policy” for all countries to secure access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines when they are developed and approved. The plan’s coordinators have set a deadline of September 18 for countries signing up to make binding commitments.COVAX’s aim is to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021. It currently has nine Covid-19 vaccine candidates in its portfolio employing a range of different technologies and scientific approaches.A handful are already in late-stage clinical trials and could have data available by year end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-group-says-76-rich-countries-now-committed-to-covax-access-plan/story-cWLWE0nDFn2gEECSJD2naI.html

We call on all freedom-loving nations and companies to join The Clean Network,” said US State Department quoting Keith Krach, US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment.Krach’s remark comes after Indian government blocked 118 more mobile apps in view of the information available that they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity, defence and security of India and public order.Earlier this year, the Trump Administration rolled out the Clean Network program, a comprehensive approach to guarding its citizens’ privacy and its companies’ most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Nearly two months ago India had banned 59 China-linked apps amid the ongoing border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said in a release that the decision “is a targeted move” to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace.The ministry said it has received many complaints from various sources including several reports about the misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India.The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures, the MeitY added.It said there has been a strong chorus in the public space to take strict action against apps that harm India’s sovereignty as well as the privacy of our citizens.“On the basis of these and upon receiving of recent credible inputs that information posted, permissions sought, functionality embedded as well as data harvesting practices of above-stated Apps raise serious concerns that these Apps collect and share data in a surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to security of the State,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urges-freedom-loving-countries-to-join-clean-network-after-india-bans-118-mobile-apps/story-GXZum0qaEXsJ7vFMMWk6eK.html

In January, they had announced plans to be more financially independent and to pay for it themselves.Meghan, formally known as the Duchess of Sussex, has no plans to return to acting under the deal. She is a former star of the USA Network television show “Suits.”The couple already have several projects in development, including a nature documentary series and an animated series that celebrates inspiring women, Netflix said.“We’re incredibly proud they have chosen Netflix as their creative home - and are excited about telling stories with them that can help build resilience and increase understanding for audiences everywhere,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-and-meghan-sign-production-deal-with-netflix/story-I2iHiRMN84UwGmFpYBoF0L.html
03-09-2020||World||Duped by Russia, freelancers ensnared in disinformation campaign by promise of easy money||When freelance journalist Laura Walters submitted a 1,000 word article about Chinese political influence in New Zealand to her new editors at non-profit media outlet Peace Data, the response was emphatic.“I’d like to express our deep gratitude for your work,” wrote Peace Data communications manager Alice Schultz in a June 15 email seen by Reuters. “It’s hard to believe how totalitarian countries like China (or Russia) are finding their ways to meddle even in the strongest democracies around the globe.”But that email, from a person claiming to be Schultz, now appears to have been a small part of one such meddling attempt.Acting on a tip from the FBI, Facebook and Twitter said on Tuesday they had identified Peace Data as the centre of a Russian political influence campaign targeting left-wing voters in the United States, Britain and other countries.The website succeeded in tricking and hiring freelance journalists to write articles about topics including the US presidential election, the coronavirus pandemic and alleged Western war crimes, Facebook said.Email correspondence reviewed by Reuters and interviews with six journalists commissioned by the website show how the writers were approached on social media, paid up to $250 per article and some times encouraged to insert political angles into their work.A person who identified themselves as Bernadett Plaschil, an associate editor at Peace Data, told Reuters via email: “We’re really confused by these accusations and deny all of them.” The person declined to speak via phone or video call.The news about Peace Data follows warnings that Russia is attempting to sway the outcome of November’s election after what US intelligence officials have said was a concerted effort to boost the campaign of President Donald Trump in 2016.Russia has repeatedly denied those allegations and the Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Peace Data on Wednesday.“I actually referenced the Russian 2016 interference in the article I wrote,” UK-based Walters, who was paid $250 to write the story for Peace Data in June, told Reuters. “I appreciate the irony right now.” OLD SCHOOL TACTICSPeace Data “staff” approached Walters and other authors online, usually in private messages on Twitter or business networking site LinkedIn. They offered between $100 to $250 for an article and paid promptly via internet money transfers, the writers said.All of the writers contacted by Reuters, some of whom requested anonymity due to fears of professional repercussions, said they had no knowledge about the website’s Russian backing before Tuesday.Some of the journalists said they viewed the work as an easy way to earn money during the coronavirus outbreak. Others were aspiring reporters looking for a break. “My first published article on an independent news source,” one of the writers said when posting their work on social media in May.While some of the authors said there was no overt political direction from the Peace Data staff, others said the website’s editorial line made them uncomfortable.“There was an over-stated political angle put into my stories,” said one journalist who wrote for Peace Data about Turkey and the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.“It rapidly stopped being a news article as they kept asking for more focus on political topics with a particular spin,” the person added.Russia’s use of fake organisations to ensnare unwitting agents and activists as part of its propaganda efforts dates back to the Soviet Union, said Thomas Rid, a professor at John Hopkins University and author of Active Measures, a book about political warfare. As efforts to catch online influence operations have increased since 2016, “defaulting back to some of the old school tactics appears to be what they are doing to try to stay hidden,” he said.Walters said her experiences showed the importance of improving public awareness about efforts to deceive people online.“The level of sophistication, the effort that’s gone into it... they obviously think it’s worth it and it’s going to amount to something,” she said.“So I feel like if I can be fooled by something like this, anyone could be,” she added. “But it’s probably the most interesting thing that’s going to happen to me for a very long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/duped-by-russia-freelancers-ensnared-in-disinformation-campaign-by-promise-of-easy-money/story-KYnZGDBfZ6ZmQJbjIY0sHN.html
03-09-2020||World||US budget deficit to hit record $3.3 trillion due to Covid-19, recession||The federal budget deficit is projected to hit a record $3.3 trillion as huge government expenditures to fight the coronavirus and to prop up the economy have added more than $2 trillion to the federal ledger, the Congressional Budget Office said.The spike in the deficit means that federal debt will exceed annual gross domestic product next year — a milestone that would put the US where it was in the aftermath of World War II, when accumulated debt exceeded the size of the economy.The $3.3 trillion figure is more than triple the 2019 shortfall and more than double the levels experienced after the market meltdown and Great Recession of 2008-09.Government spending, fuelled by four coronavirus response measures, would register at $6.6 trillion, $2 trillion-plus more than 2019.The recession has caused a drop in tax revenues have fallen, but the changes are not as dramatic as seen on the spending side, with individual income tax collections running 11 per cent behind last year. Corporate tax collections are down 34 per cent. The economy shut down in the spring so people could be in isolation, in a failed national attempt to defeat the pandemic. That shutdown led lawmakers and President Donald Trump to pump money into business subsidies, larger unemployment benefits, $1,200 direct payments and other stimulus steps that have helped the economy in the short term.Most economists are untroubled by such huge borrowing when the economy is in peril, and the debt was barely a concern when a cornerstone $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed almost unanimously in March.But now that lawmakers and the White House are quarrelling over the size and scope of a fifth virus relief bill, Republicans are growing skittish at the enormous costs of battling the pandemic. The Democratic-controlled House passed a $3.5 trillion measure in May, though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, says she is willing to cut that figure to $2.2 trillion.Caseloads remain unacceptably elevated, however, as the virus exacts a painful, lingering toll on the economy and sentiment remains high for a fifth virus rescue package that would include money to reopen schools, patch state budgets and continue enhanced jobless benefits that have kept families afloat.Among Republicans, there seems to be less ardor for a deal — at least at what they see as unfavorable terms. GOP leaders had been pressing for a package in the $1 trillion range, but party talks during August have focused on a smaller package.The enormous deficit is bringing the federal debt, as measured by the size of the economy, near levels not experienced since the end of World War II, when explosive borrowing to finance the war effort caused a historic spike. But those levels quickly receded during the postwar boom — something that won’t happen now, since federal spending is now dominated by retirement programs like Medicare and Social Security, whose costs increase automatically with inflation and the ongoing retirement of the Baby Boom generation.Deficit scolds have long warned that rising levels of debt will serve as a drag on the economy in the coming years. If interest rates rise too high, servicing the debt will put significant strain on the budget. The Federal Reserve has stepped in to keep credit markets stable and interest rates low for years as debt levels have risen.“At a certain point, Washington’s insatiable borrowing needs will crowd out other investments and harm growth,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhatten Institute. “Washington should help end the pandemic and rescue the economy, yet must also address these unsustainable long-term deficits.” By year’s end, the publicly held national debt will total 98 per cent of the US gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services. That compares with 79 per cent of GDP at the end of 2019 and 35 per cent back in 2007.The CBO projected that the debt would exceed 100 per cent of GDP in 2021 and set a new record high of 107 per cent in 2021.CBO, the nonpartisan economic and research arm of Congress, predicts that deficit will total $13 trillion over the coming decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-budget-deficit-to-hit-record-3-3-trillion-due-to-covid-19-recession/story-URnAIx5Woi5RCDJLYTEhuL.html
03-09-2020||World||K-shaped recovery comes to emerging markets as rich get richer||Look no further than emerging markets for evidence that the K-shaped recovery is taking hold.Stocks and currencies from wealthier developing nations are outperforming their poorer peers amid the coronavirus outbreak, magnifying the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” of the global economy. The gulf may even get wider if the pandemic leads to deeper recessions in less wealthy nations due to their lower capacity for containing the virus.A Bloomberg study of 17 emerging markets has found a 42% correlation between gross domestic product per capita and stock performance since the virus-fueled risk sell-off began on Jan. 20 until early this week. The correlation between GDP per capita and currency returns was 31%.As long as the virus lasts the K-shaped divergence will continue, said Rob Subbaraman, global head of macro research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. “In the EM world with rapidly rising debt and deep recessions, the cost of servicing debt is going to get more burdensome and we cannot rule out some financial crises or major debt restructuring.”Wealthier emerging markets have been better placed to rebound from the March sell-off due to more advanced technology and governance that have given them greater flexibility to respond to the pandemic. They have have been able to limit the impact of lockdowns and social distancing, make larger fiscal responses, and are better equipped with the resources needed to curb the outbreak, such as hospitals, test centers and quarantine facilities.Countries such as South Korea and Poland have seen the smallest increase in economic disruptions, according to an effective lockdown index compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The gauge takes into account a combination of government restrictions that suppress activity and adds social distancing numbers based on Google mobility data. There has been a negative correlation of 54% between Goldman’s gauges and per capita GDP. In turn, countries with the lowest lockdown index have tended to see the best stock market and currency performance.Widest in AsiaThe rich-poor divide among emerging markets is widest in Asia. The stock returns from the four economies with per capita GDP above $10,000 last year -- China, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia -- has been 20% above that of the nations which fall below that level, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. While this is partly due to the number of technology companies listed in the former countries, it is also due to the fact that authorities there have been able to spend more to reassure citizens and investors.South Korea’s fiscal response to the pandemic, including three supplementary budgets, totals 270 trillion won ($228 billion), or about 14% of GDP, providing support to the stock market even as the local outbreak has worsened. In contrast, the Philippine government has said it’s unable to fund the 1.3 trillion pesos ($27 billion) stimulus package approved in June. The nation’s stock market is the region’s worst performer this year, dropping more than 25%.Looking ahead, lower rates of infection, greater policy space, and stronger health services may help more affluent countries maintain their lead in the economic recovery.Richer emerging economies are likely to gain access to effective coronavirus vaccines sooner, following the steps of wealthy developed nations. There is even a risk bigger economies will monopolize supply, a scenario that played out in the 2009 swine flu pandemic.“Not many emerging markets have access to cutting-edge technology, and they will continue to struggle,” said Tsutomu Soma, a bond trader at Monex Inc. in Tokyo. “We will continue to see the divergence in developed and emerging markets going forward.”Note: Simon Flint is an emerging-market strategist at Bloomberg News.

03-09-2020||World||On cam: Black man in US dies of suffocation after cops put hood on him||A Black man who had run naked through the streets of a western New York city died of asphyxiation after a group of police officers put a hood over his head, then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, according to video and records released Wednesday by the man’s family.Daniel Prude died March 30 after he was taken off life support, seven days after the encounter with police in Rochester. His death received no public attention until Wednesday, when his family held a news conference and released police body camera video and written reports they obtained through a public records request.“How did you see him and not directly say, ‘The man is defenseless, buck naked on the ground. He’s cuffed up already. Come on.’ How many more brothers gotta die for society to understand that this needs to stop?” Prude’s brother, Joe Prude, asked at a news conference Wednesday.The videos show Prude, who had taken off his clothes, complying when police ask him to get on the ground and put his hands behind his back. Prude is agitated and shouting as officers let him writhe as he sits on the pavement in handcuffs for a few moments as a light snow falls.Then, they put a white “spit hood” over his head, a device intended to protect officers from a detainee’s saliva. At the time, New York was in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Prude demands they remove it.Then the officer’s slam Prude’s head into the street. One officer holds his head down against the pavement with both hands, saying “stop spitting” as Prude’s shouts turn to whimpers and grunts. Another officer places a knee on his back. The officers appear to become concerned when they notice water coming out of Prude’s mouth.“My man. You puking?” one says.Prude stops moving and falls silent. One officer notes that he’s been out, naked, in the street for some time. Another remarks, “He feels pretty cold.”His head had been held down by an officer for just over two minutes.Medics can then be seen on the video performing CPR before he’s loaded into an ambulance.Spit hoods have been scrutinized as a factor in the deaths of several prisoners in the US and other countries in recent years.A medical examiner concluded that Prude’s death was a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” The report lists excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, as contributing factors.Prude was from Chicago and had just arrived in Rochester for a visit with his family. Police responded after Joe Prude called 911 to report that his brother had left his house and was experiencing mental health issues.The city halted its investigation into Prude’s death when state Attorney General Letitia James office began its own investigation in April. Under New York law, deaths of unarmed people in police custody are often turned over to the attorney general’s office, rather than handled by local officials.James said Wednesday that investigation is continuing.“I want everyone to understand that at no point in time did we feel that this was something that we wanted not to disclose,” Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren said at press briefing. “We are precluded from getting involved in it until that agency (the AG’s office) has completed their investigation.”One officer wrote that they put the hood on Prude because he was spitting continuously in the direction of officers and they were concerned about coronavirus.Still, activists demanded that officers involved with Prude’s death be prosecuted on murder charges and that they be removed from the department while the investigation proceeds.“The police have shown us over and over again that they are not equipped to handle individuals with mental health concerns. These officers are trained to kill, and not to deescalate. These officers are trained to ridicule, instead of supporting Mr. Daniel Prude,” Ashley Gantt of Free the People ROC said at the news conference with Prude’s family.Protesters gathered Wednesday outside Rochester’s Public Safety Building, which serves as police headquarters. Free the People ROC said several of its organizers were briefly taken into custody after they entered the building while Warren was speaking to the media.They were released on appearance tickets, said Iman Abid, regional director of the NYCLU, who was among those taken into custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-cam-police-put-hood-on-black-man-killed-by-asphyxiation-in-new-york/story-UFdaivNQMZowvsAcFRxBbL.html
03-09-2020||World||75th anniversary of end of WWII is mostly virtual amid virus||When Japanese military leaders climbed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, the battleship was packed with U.S. sailors eager to see the end of World War II.On Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the surrender, some of those same men who served the United States weren’t able to return to the Missouri in Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor because of the world’s new war against the coronavirus.The commemoration initially was supposed to be a blockbuster event with parades, movie premieres, galas and thousands of people honoring the veterans in their 90s or beyond, some who may be marking the milestone for the last time.Because of the threat of the virus, the ceremony was scaled down to about 50 people, with local veterans and government officials gathering on the USS Missouri in masks. The names were read of surviving WWII veterans, including 14 who were on the ship the day the Japanese surrendered.Jerry Pedersen, 95, was one of them, watching history unfold as a young Marine. He and his comrades who live in the mainland U.S. had to watch a livestream of the ceremony from home instead of on the decks of the battleship as planned.“Well, I was very disappointed, yes. I was hoping to maybe see a friend or two,” he said. “I just want to share with at least my family and a couple of other folks some of the feelings that I was going to express when I got there.”Those feelings are complicated, said Pedersen, who dedicated his life to peace after the war ended.“War must not happen again,” he said, recalling the words uttered by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the day the Japanese surrendered. But “we’re still oscillating on many of the things that are necessary to bring us peace.”Pedersen wore a blue Marine uniform recently sent to him for the ceremony as he watched the event from a laptop at his son’s house in rural West Sacramento, California. His three adult children, their spouses and some grandchildren gathered around the computer, clapping and hooting when his name was called. Pedersen smiled and gave a fist pump.“For me, it was the end of the killing, the war that had taken millions of soldiers and many, many, many millions of civilians in wars in Europe and finally in the Pacific that came to an end that day. And we were celebrating,” he told The Associated Press.“I had the feeling that day. I made a pact with myself that I’m going to be a peacemaker in my life,” said Pedersen, who went to college after the war, got his doctorate and became a minister.He watched remotely as WWII-era “warbirds” flew over Pearl Harbor and video messages played from veterans and others in a tribute to those who couldn’t attend or had passed away.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he was honored to “commemorate and reflect on the sacrifices and victories of our service members and allies who helped fight for and secure peace.”At the end of his keynote address, he built a case for a strong military for the future.“We honor the legacy of those who came before us and recommit ourselves to defending today’s international rules and norms so that the road is safer and is better for generations yet to come,” Esper said. “The United States’ commitment to the role today is the same one we made to the freedom-loving people of the world in 1941 — that we will remain ready to fight any foe and defend any friend.”The U.S. entered the war after Japanese warplanes attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Thousands of service members were killed and wounded, about half of them dying on the USS Arizona, which still sits submerged in Pearl Harbor next to the USS Missouri Memorial, a floating museum.Four years later, after massive losses on both sides that included the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese indicated they would surrender on Aug. 15, then met with Allied forces aboard the Missouri on Sept. 2 to sign the Instrument of Surrender.Hawaii Gov. David Ige said the country can learn from WWII veterans about targeting the problems of our time.“Some compare fighting a pandemic akin to fighting a global war,” Ige said. “What I do know is that we cannot go wrong in following their example in the face of any adversity. Their courage under fire, strength of character, resilience over time provides a clear roadmap for us to follow in all that we do, whether we are fighting a social injustice or a virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/75th-anniversary-of-end-of-wwii-is-mostly-virtual-amid-virus/story-EnchPruJrlQf670CWHPhHJ.html

In the clip, a masked stylist follows her.Critics, including President Donald Trump, called her a hypocrite and asked why she did not know the coronavirus-related rules in her home city.Erica Kious, owner of eSalon in the city’s upscale Marina district, told Fox News that she rents chairs to stylists and one of them informed her in advance that Pelosi wanted a wash and blow dry. California guidelines on salons vary by county, but stringent San Francisco officials have not yet permitted indoor salons to open.Kious said she considered Pelosi getting her hair done “a slap in the face” to struggling business owners. She did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.Health order violations can be punished by a fine, imprisonment or both. But San Francisco has stressed education over enforcement and has been reluctant to penalize businesses and individuals.Pelosi said Wednesday she would not answer any more questions about the visit and asked at one point whether reporters had any questions “about the fact that people are dying,” referring to the HEROES Act legislation she called the news conference to address.A reporter asked why she was not wearing a mask in the brief clip.“I just had my hair washed. I don’t wear a mask when I’m washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you’re washing your hair? I always have a mask,” Pelosi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-says-hair-salon-should-apologize-for-set-up-visit/story-SW8zx1N0wewlj6JB2gYiyH.html
03-09-2020||World||Britain to fund expansion of rapid Covid-19 test trials||Britain is putting 500 million pounds ($666 million) into trials of rapid Covid-19 tests and into population-testing for the disease, the health ministry said on Thursday.Health minister Matt Hancock has said he hopes mass testing using faster Covid-19 tests can be rolled out towards the end of the year, adding that they are key to restoring freedoms after months of Covid-19 restrictions.The funding will be used to expand existing trials of saliva tests and a rapid 20-minute test in southern England, while a new, community trial in Salford, northwest England, will assess the benefit of population-testing, under which people are regularly tested regardless of whether they have symptoms, so that any cases can be picked up before they have spread widely.“Innovative new tests that are fast, accurate and easier to use will maximise the impact and scale of testing, helping us to get back to a more normal way of life,” Hancock said.Currently, official health service advice is only for citizens to get a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, although more regular testing is available for certain professions, such as care workers.People contacted by the health service’s Test and Trace programme in England must self-isolate for 14 days if they have been a recent contact of a confirmed Covid-19 case, but they are not told to get a test unless they have symptoms.Similarly, travellers from certain countries must enter a 14-day quarantine.The guidance to self-isolate rather than get a test is because a negative test cannot preclude the possibility of getting symptoms later in the quarantine period, health officials say.“New testing technologies and methods are vital to keep the system evolving and improving, especially as we assess how routine testing could help pick up cases of the virus earlier,” said Dido Harding, who runs the Test and Trace scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-fund-expansion-of-rapid-covid-19-test-trials/story-OEw7Ucz0m0IurvnsfXWquO.html
03-09-2020||World||US states told be ready to distribute Covid-19 vaccine by November 1||The Trump administration has urged US states to get ready to distribute a potential Covid-19 vaccine by November 1 -- two days before the presidential election.Dallas-based wholesaler McKesson Corp. has a deal with the federal government and will be requesting permits to set up distribution centers when a vaccine becomes available.“The normal time required to obtain these permits presents a significant barrier to the success of this urgent public health program,” Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told states in an August 27 letter.“CDC urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities.”Redfield asked states to consider waiving requirements that would “prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by Nov. 1, 2020.”The CDC provided states with documents giving details of a vaccine rollout plan, adding that they would either be approved as licensed vaccines or under emergency use authorization.Recipients would probably require a second “booster” dose, a few weeks after the first, according to the documents.“Vaccine and ancillary supplies will be procured and distributed by the federal government at no cost to enrolled Covid-19 vaccination providers,” say the documents, which also went to New York City, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and San Antonio.- Serious side effects -Priority will be given to essential workers, national security officials, seniors and members of vulnerable racial and ethnic groups, according to The New York Times.Three Western drug makers are progressing with their Phase 3 clinical trials, involving tens of thousands of participants.The three are AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University in England; Moderna, collaborating with the US National Institutes of Health; and the Pfizer/BioNTech alliance.By the nature of the trials, it is difficult to predict when reliable results will emerge.Half of the participants in such trials receive an experimental vaccine, while the other half are given a placebo.Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait -- probably for months -- to see whether there is a statistically significant difference in the infection rate of the two groups.The US Food and Drug Administration however has raised the possibility that a vaccine might be given emergency approval before the end of trials. A request for such extraordinary approval would have to come from the vaccine developer, FDA chief Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times in an interview published Sunday. The FDA has faced mounting criticism from the medical community that it is bowing to political pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been pushing hard for a vaccine, saying one might be ready before the election.In March, the FDA gave emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 after Trump repeatedly praised its use; the authorization had to be withdrawn in June after serious side effects emerged.- ‘Safe and effective’ -More recently, Hahn delivered a far too optimistic appraisal, during a news conference with Trump, of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma against the virus. He said it could save 35 out of 100 patients; the more likely number, experts said, is five in 100.“This means mass vaccination nationwide could start in 59 days. FIFTY-NINE DAYS. Is any #COVID19 #vaccine likely to have completed Phase 3 safety and efficacy clinical trials, and gone through full scientific and @US_FDA review in 59 days?” award-winning epidemiology writer Laurie Garrett asked on Twitter.“To my knowledge, none of the US #COVID19 #vaccines have finished even enrolling test subjects for Phase 3 trials. Rushing this to completion within 59 days is DANGEROUS.”Hahn, however, has insisted he is not acting under pressure from Trump, arguing that any vaccine approval would be a “science, medicine, data decision.”Top government scientist Anthony Fauci has said on several occasions that a vaccine should be ready between the end of 2020 and the first half of 2021.“I believe that by the time we get to the end of this calendar year that we will feel comfortable that we do have a safe and effective vaccine,” Fauci told NBC.The US has registered more than six million Covid-19 cases -- almost a quarter of the global total -- and 185,000 deaths, according to Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-told-be-ready-to-distribute-covid-19-vaccine-by-november-1/story-ULmrDy2yYY5Ff7hiVZjGSL.html
03-09-2020||World||Health officials worry nation not ready for Covid-19 vaccine||Public health departments, which have struggled for months to test and trace everyone exposed to the novel coronavirus, are now being told to prepare to distribute Covid-19 vaccines as early as November 1.In a four-page memo this summer, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told health departments across the country to draft vaccination plans by October 1 “to coincide with the earliest possible release of Covid-19 vaccine.”The CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, also wrote to governors last week about the urgent need to have vaccine distribution sites up and running by November 1. Redfield asked governors to expedite the process for setting up these facilities. McClatchy first reported Redfield’s letter.But health departments that have been underfunded for decades say they currently lack the staff, money and tools to educate people about vaccines and then to distribute, administer and track doses to some 330 million people. Nor do they know when, or if, they’ll get federal aid to do that.“There is a tremendous amount of work to be done to be prepared for this vaccination program and it will not be complete by November 1,” said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education at the Immunization Action Coalition, a national vaccine education and advocacy organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota. “States will need more financial resources than they have now.”Dozens of doctors, nurses and health officials interviewed by Kaiser Health News and The Associated Press expressed concern about the country’s readiness to conduct mass vaccinations, as well as frustration with months of inconsistent information from the federal government.The gaps include figuring out how officials will keep track of who has gotten which doses and how they’ll keep the workers who give the shots safe, with enough protective gear and syringes to do their jobs.With only about half of Americans saying they would get vaccinated, according to a poll from AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, it also will be crucial to educate people about the benefits of vaccination, said Molly Howell, who manages the North Dakota Department of Health’s immunization program.The unprecedented pace of vaccine development has left many Americans skeptical about the safety of Covid-19 immunizations; others simply don’t trust the federal government.“We’re in a very deep-red state,” said Ann Lewis, CEO of CareSouth Carolina, a group of community health centers that serve mostly low-income people in five rural counties in South Carolina. “The message that is coming out is not a message of trust and confidence in medical or scientific evidence.”PAYING FOR THE ROLLOUTThe U.S. has committed more than $10 billion to develop new coronavirus vaccines but hasn’t allocated money specifically for distributing and administering vaccines.And while states, territories and 154 large cities and counties received billions in congressional emergency funding, that money can be used for a variety of purposes, including testing and overtime pay.An ongoing investigation by KHN and the AP has detailed how state and local public health departments across the U.S. have been starved for decades, leaving them underfunded and without adequate resources to confront the coronavirus pandemic. The investigation further found that federal coronavirus funds have been slow to reach public health departments, forcing some communities to cancel non-coronavirus vaccine clinics and other essential services.States are allowed to use some of the federal money they’ve already received to prepare for immunizations. But AP and KHN found that many health departments are so overwhelmed with the current costs of the pandemic — such as for testing and contact tracing — that they can’t reserve money for the vaccine work to come. Health departments will need to hire people to administer the vaccines and systems to track them, and pay for supplies such as protective medical masks, gowns and gloves, as well as warehouses and refrigerator space.CareSouth Carolina is collaborating with the state health department on testing and the pandemic response. It used federal funding to purchase $140,000 retrofitted vans for mobile testing, which it plans to continue to use to keep vaccines cold and deliver them to residents when the time comes, said Lewis.But most vaccine costs will be new.Pima County, Arizona, for example, is already at least $30 million short of what health officials need to fight the pandemic, let alone plan for vaccines, said Dr. Francisco Garcia, deputy county administrator and chief medical officer.Some federal funds will expire soon. The $150 billion that states and local governments received from a fund in the CARES Act, for example, covers only expenses made through the end of the year, said Gretchen Musicant, health commissioner in Minneapolis. That’s a problem, given vaccine distribution may not have even begun.Although public health officials say they need more money, Congress left Washington for its summer recess without passing a new pandemic relief bill that would include additional funding for vaccine distribution.“States are anxious to receive those funds as soon as possible, so they can do what they need to be prepared,” said Moore of the Immunization Action Coalition, a national vaccine education and advocacy organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota. “We can’t assume they can take existing funding and attempt the largest vaccination campaign in history.”WHAT’S THE PLAN?Then there’s the basic question of scale. The federally funded Vaccines for Children program immunizes 40 million children each year. In 2009 and 2010, the CDC scaled up to vaccinate 81 million people against pandemic H1N1 influenza. And last winter, the country distributed 175 million vaccines for seasonal influenza vaccine, according to the CDC.But for the U.S. to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of Americans, which translates to 200 million people and — because the first vaccines will require two doses to be effective — 400 million shots.Although the CDC has overseen immunization campaigns in the past, the Trump administration created a new program, called Operation Warp Speed, to facilitate vaccine development and distribution. In August, the administration announced that McKesson Corp., which distributed H1N1 vaccines during that pandemic, will also distribute Covid-19 vaccines to doctors’ offices and clinics.“With few exceptions, our commercial distribution partners will be responsible for handling all the vaccines,” Operation Warp Speed’s Paul Mango said in an email.“We’re not going to have 300 million doses all at once,” said Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Health and Human Services Department, despite earlier government pledges to have many doses ready by the new year. “We believe we are maximizing our probability of success of having tens of millions of doses of vaccines by January 2021, which is our goal.”Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it will take time for the vaccines to be widespread enough for life to return to what’s considered normal. “We have to be prepared to deal with this virus in the absence of significant vaccine-induced immunity for a period of maybe a year or longer,” Adalja said in August.In preliminary guidance for state vaccine managers, the CDC said doses will be distributed free of charge from a central location. Health departments’ local vaccination plans may be reviewed by both the CDC and Operation Warp Speed.The CDC spent two days working with vaccine planners in five locations — North Dakota, Florida, California, Minnesota and Philadelphia — to discuss potential obstacles and solutions.No actual vaccines were distributed during the planning sessions, which focused on how to get vaccines to people in places as different as urban Philadelphia, where pharmacies abound, and rural North Dakota, which has few chain drugstores but many clinics run by the federal Indian Health Service, said Kris Ehresmann, who directs infectious disease control at the Minnesota Department of Health.Those planning sessions have made Ehresmann feel more confident about who’s in charge of distributing vaccines. “We are getting more specific guidance from CDC on planning now,” she said. “We feel better about the process, though there are still a lot of unknowns.”OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY COULD HAMPER RESPONSEStill, many public health departments will struggle to adequately track who has been vaccinated and when, because a lack of funding in recent decades has left them in the technological dark ages, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.In Mississippi, for example, health officials still rely on faxes, said the state’s health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs. “You can’t manually handle 1,200 faxes a day and expect anything efficient to happen,″ he said.When Covid-19 vaccines become available, health providers will need to track where and when patients receive their vaccines, said Moore, the medical director of Tennessee’s immunization plan during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and 2010. And with many different shots in the works, they will need to know exactly which one each patient got, she said.People will need to receive their second Covid-19 dose 21 or 28 days after the first, so health providers will need to remind patients to receive their second shot, Moore said, and ensure that the second dose is the same brand as the first.The CDC will require vaccinators to provide “ dose-level accounting and reporting” for immunizations, so that the agency knows where every dose of Covid-19 vaccine is “at any point in time,” Moore said. Although “the sophistication of these systems has improved dramatically” in the past decade, she said, “many states will still face major challenges meeting data tracking and reporting expectations.”The CDC is developing an app called the Vaccine Administration Monitoring System for health departments whose data systems don’t meet standards for Covid-19 response, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit based in Rockville, Maryland.“Those standards haven’t been released,” Hannan said, “so health departments are waiting to invest in necessary IT enhancements.″ The CDC needs to release standards and data expectations as quickly as possible, she added.Meanwhile, health departments are dealing with what Minnesota’s Ehresmann described as “legacy” vaccine registries, sometimes dating to the late 1980s.A HISTORIC TASKOverwhelmed public health teams are already working long hours to test patients and trace their contacts, a time-consuming process that will need to continue even after vaccines become available.When vaccines are ready, health departments will need more staffers to identify people at high risk for Covid-19, who should get the vaccine first, Moore said. Public health staff also will be needed to educate the public about the importance of vaccines and to administer shots, she said, as well as monitor patients and report serious side effects.At an August meeting about vaccine distribution, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of Illinois’ health department, said her state will need to recruit additional health professionals to administer the shots, including nursing students, medical students, dentists, dental hygienists and even veterinarians. Such vaccinators will need medical-grade masks, gowns and gloves to keep themselves safe as they handle needles.Many health officials say they feel burned by the country’s struggle to provide hospitals with ventilators last spring, when states found themselves bidding against one another for a limited supply. Those concerns are amplified by the continuing difficulties providing enough testing kits; supplying health workers with personal protective equipment; allocating drugs such as remdesivir; and recruiting contact tracers — who track down everyone with whom people diagnosed with Covid-19 have been in contact.Although Ehresmann said she’s concerned Minnesota could run out of syringes, she said the CDC has assured her it will provide them.Given that vaccines are far more complex than personal protective equipment and other medical supplies — one vaccine candidate must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit — Plescia said people should be prepared for shortages, delays and mix-ups.“It’s probably going to be even worse than the problems with testing and PPE,” Plescia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-officials-worry-nation-not-ready-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-OI06bItnASmSjvILdz5NkL.html

Earlier, Saeen Taj Joyo, the father of missing Sindhi teacher and activist Sarang Joyo, had also declined the President’s Pride of Performance (Nisan-e-Pakistan) award on account of the disappearance of his son. Sarang Joyo was recently traced and claimed to have been tortured in captivity.In a social media post, Fahmida Riaz’s daughter Veerta Ali Ujan said that accepting an award from the Imran Khan government on her mother’s behalf would be an insult to her struggle for justice and equality. She added, “Harassers [are] being awarded. Karachi left to rot in sewage.”She said had her mother been alive today, she would have also refused to accept the award from the government. Born in Meerut in pre-partition India in 1946, Fahmida Riaz was among the leading Urdu poets.She was also an unrelenting social critic and had been active in several human rights movements. She was among the writers, who had campaigned against General Zia-ul Haq’s military rule and the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She had to suffer the wrath of the Pakistani authorities and also spent a period of self-exile in India. Riaz had died on November 21, 2018.

The Speaker’s announcement came a day after Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien said not having a Question Hour in Parliament was worst assault on democracy, prompting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of accusing the state’s ruling party of showing double standards. “The chairpersons of two houses of Parliament talk to all parties before deciding the schedule of a session. In Bengal, the session is being held only to abide by the norm (of having a session within six months). The government does not want to face questions on corruption or, its failure to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. It shows TMC’s double standards,” said Bengal BJP vice-resident Jay Prakash Majumdar. The state assembly is scheduled to hold its monsoon session from September 9-10. The Speaker also said that the legislators, assembly staff, security personnel and journalists will have to undergo rapid antigen test before they are allowed to enter the assembly. “The legislators will have to maintain distance and occupy specific seats earmarked for them. Elderly legislators will be seated in the main hall and younger members will be asked to sit in the galleries,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-question-hour-in-bengal-house/story-a6gvkOTU2WgF3u6gmCD3yO.html

The 7th, 8th and 9th additions to the park were published in preliminary notifications by the state government and include areas from where encroachment has been removed and suitable wildlife habitat in riverine islands. “It is a move to consolidate the wildlife areas anticipating better wildlife conservation and reduction in human-wildlife negative interactions in future,” said a release issued by forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya’s office. The new additions include 176 ha at Deosur, Palkhowa in Deosur protected reserve forest, 307 ha at Banderdubi - both in Nagaon district and 2570 ha at Mokua Chapori in Sonitpur district. “With the new additions, the total area of the park will increase to 914 sq km. The last addition to the park was in 2016 when 195 sq km at Bura Chapori, which connected Kaziranga with Orang National Park,” said P Sivakumar, director of KNPTR. Also read: Assam Police SI admit card released at slprbassam.in, direct link here“The 7th and 8th additions will connect Kaziranga with nearby Karbi Anglong district and the 9th addition will connect KNPTR with Nameri National Park. The fresh additions will help the movement of tigers from Kaziranga to Nameri and Orang and vice versa,” he added. The preliminary notifications on the fresh additions to the KNPTR comes less than a month after the Gauhati High Court had directed the principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Assam to submit a report on action taken on evictions of encroachments in areas earlier added to the park. On October 9, 2015, the HC had ordered evictions of encroached areas in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th additions to the KNPTR. “A total of 39,836.74 ha of the notified evicted areas have been delivered to the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) authority. However, possession of 1461.59 ha of land in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th to the KNP in the districts of Golaghat and Biswanath is yet to be handed over,” the August 17 letter by HC Registrar (Judicial) RA Tapadar stated. “You are, therefore, requested to submit a fresh ‘Action Taken Report’ with regards to the delivery of possession of the remaining land to the KNP authority on or before 23-11-2020,” it added. Kaziranga is the biggest habitat of endangered one-horned rhinos in the world.

The Russian commitment on no arms supply to Pakistan followed an Indian request, they said. “The defence minister got Russia’s assurance that it stands by India’s security interest,” they said. Russia also strongly supported the Make in India initiative aimed at self-reliance in the defence sector during the one-hour meeting that covered a broad range of areas of bilateral cooperation. “It was noted that this meeting coincides with the Indra naval exercises to be conducted by the Indian and Russian navies off the Strait of Malacca over the next two days,” the defence ministry said in a statement. Singh said the drills demonstrated the common interests of both countries in maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region. “There was substantial commonality in positions with respect to challenges at the regional and international levels in the areas of peace and security, reflective of the deep trust and confidence that both sides enjoy as strategic partners,” the statement said. Singh conveyed India’s appreciation for the steadfast support provided by Russia to address the country’s defence and security needs, it said. General Shoigu reiterated Russia’s commitment to engage actively with India on the Make in India programme, including substantial participation in the forthcoming Aero India-2021.

This is the third time that the Chinese defence ministry has sought a meeting with Singh after the standoff erupted in early May, they said. The Indian side is yet to respond to the Chinese request. Tensions flared in the sensitive sector after the Indian Army occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake five days ago to stop the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move. External affairs minister S Jaishankar is set to visit the Russian capital for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting on September 10. Speaking at a seminar organised by United States-India Strategic Partnership Forum on Navigating New Challenges, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat highlighted the threat of “coordinated action” by the militaries of China and Pakistan along the northern and western borders and stressed that the Indian armed forces were capable of handling the joint threat. Russia on Thursday reiterated that it would not supply weapons to Pakistan during a meeting between Singh and his Russian counterpart General Sergei Shoigu, officials said. The Russian commitment on nor arms supply to Pakistan followed an Indian request, they said. “The defence minister got Russia’s assurance that it stands by India’s security interest,” they said.

But Shirui Lily was rejected following changes in GI guidelines, he said.Tamenglong orange is a species of mandarin group is a unique fruit crop found only in Tamenglong district which contributes over 50 per cent of the state’s annual production.It is famous especially for its well blended sweetness and acidic taste. Usually each fruit contains 10-14 pods. Manipur has been celebrating the Orange Festival every December for the last 15 years to promote Tamenglong orange.Manipur black rice, a scented glutinous rice which has been cultivating in the state over centuries and it is characterised by its special aroma,bagged GI tag in May 2020. Authorities here are also targeting to take up GI process for a high protein content local pea variety-’Hawai-Tharak Makhyatmubi’.Earlier Kachai Lemon (Citrus jambheri Lush), a unique lemon variety which contains high ascorbic acid, has been accorded GI registration tag.

This is the first time the two ministers will come face to face since the standoff emerged in public, though they have participated in virtual meetings of various groupings and also spoken in the aftermath of the June 15 clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. They will also join a virtual meeting of BRICS foreign ministers on September 4.Responding to another question on whether China is in India’s way, Jaishankar said this wasn’t the “easiest of times” in the bilateral relationship, but added that it was “imperative and vital for both countries to reach an accommodation, and not just for themselves”.Also read: In stern warning to Pak, Gen Rawat says ‘India capable of handling two-front threat’Emphasising that he wasn’t underplaying the challenges of the boundary question, the minister said, “I’m totally convinced that the solution to the situation has to be found in the domain of diplomacy.”India and China have a long history, which is “very good in many parts, very indifferent in some parts, and very difficult in some parts”, he said, adding the “more difficult parts are more recent”.Jaishankar said he had taken a long view of ties in his book, which was written before the standoff began, and there are agreements and understandings on the border issue that must be scrupulously observed by both sides. “Neither party should attempt to change the status quo unilaterally, and the reality is what happens on the border will impact the relationship. You cannot separate that,” he said.Also read: Pakistan trying to politicise UNSC’s terrorist listing process, says IndiaHe ducked a question about his recent remarks that he didn’t understand why China has thousands of troops on the LAC, saying it was for Beijing to provide an answer on this issue.Jaishankar also said he wasn’t comfortable with terms such as “Himalayan cold war” or “hot peace”, and that the two sides have to “work our way through this”. He added, “ I am convinced that the way out is through diplomacy. That will happen if both sides see it is in their own interests that we don’t see what we have seen this summer.”Jaishankar also listed the rise of China and the changed approach of the US to world affairs as two of the most impactful shifts in recent times. While the US has pulled back from its “global project” and shifted from alliances, the velocity and impact of the rise of China has exceeded everything else, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imperative-for-india-china-to-reach-an-accommodation-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar/story-GfThaUEMa7q46xkKgU4dAP.html
03-09-2020||India||‘Not the first time Question Hour is being suspended’: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday defended the government’s decision to do away with the Question Hour during the upcoming monsoon session that starts on September 14. The party said that this was not the first time when a set procedure had been dispensed with owing to exigencies.While the government has given its nod to allowing unstarred questions, or written questions that ministers need to reply to instead of allowing answers to be given in person, the Opposition has criticised the move and alleged it as an attempt to throttle the Opposition’s voice in Parliament and amounted it to “murder of democracy”.As per BJP functionaries aware of the details, 160 unstarred questions will be answered by the government, apart from Special Mentions by MPs to bring matters of importance to the notice of the government.A senior functionary aware of the details said, “Question hour was done away with in the years 1962, 1975, 1976, 1991, 2004 and 2009 for various reasons. While in 1975 and 1976 it was on account of the Emergency.”Also read: No question hour at 2-day Bengal assembly session, BJP claims, it shows TMC’s double standardThe party has been vociferously defending the government’s decision by pointing out that the ongoing pandemic has imposed restrictions on every aspect of daily life and its impact can be felt on Parliamentary proceedings as well. The party also maintained that the decision has not been made without consulting other party leaders.“Almost all the opposition leaders accepted that the country is in an extraordinary situation because of this health emergency. The Presiding Officers of both the Houses have received a letter from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs informing that the government consulted different political parties and that there was a broad consensus, barring one political party, on doing away with the Question Hour. Based on that consensus among the opposition parties, the government requested the Presiding Officers to do away the Question Hour and Private Members Business for this session,” the functionary said.As per the expected schedule, Parliament is likely to take up issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state of the economy and other developments that will be brought before the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and agreed upon. Parliament will also take up as many as 11 ordinances that were passed between March and September.Congress party’s Adhir Ranjan Choudhary had written to Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla last week urging him to reconsider the decision and said curtailing the Question Hour and the Zero Hour by way of restricting the number of issues that could be raised and time earmarked would, therefore, not be in the interest of elected representatives.The BJP, however, lashed out at the Congress and the other political opponents including the TMC and the NCP, by pointing out that state assemblies, including Kerala, Rajasthan and Punjab, all non-BJP ruled states have held sessions where the laid down procedures were deviated from.“Punjab is ruled by the Congress party. In Rajasthan, where the Congress is ruling, the Assembly met just for 4 days. There was no Question Hour and No Zero Hour and 13 bills were passed without much discussion. In Maharashtra, where a 2-day session is proposed, there is going to be no Question Hour and no Zero Hour. In Uttar Pradesh, a bigger state, there was no Question Hour and No Zero Hour and also in many other states like Andhra Pradesh,” the functionary said.To counter posers that the business hours could be stretched to accommodate Question Hour, the party said with each House meeting only for 4 hours a day, it would take away the time required for transacting other business, including taking up ordinances.Referring to the disruptions that have led to the loss of working hours in both Houses, the party said during 2015-19, only about 40 percent of the total available Question Hour time was availed to raise questions and obtain oral responses of the Government during the Question Hour. “As a result, 60 percent of the Question Hour time went unused on account of disruptions etc. During 2015-19, Rajya Sabha held a total of 332 sittings. During this period, a total time of 332 hours was available for the Question Hour at the rate of one hour for each sitting,” the functionary quoted above said.The opposition parties, however, continued to attack the government. The NCP on Thursday accused the BJP of using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to cancel the Question Hour in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament to “hide its failures” on multiple fronts.Chakshu Roy, Head of Legislative and Civic Engagement, PRS Legislative Research said, “American Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis once remarked that sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman. The role of Question Hour in a legislature is similar. MPs by asking questions shine light on the functioning of the government. This parliamentary mechanism also allows government to widely disseminate authentic information about its functioning and dispel rumours. Effectively utilised, it enables MPs to discharge their constitutional duty of keeping a check on the functioning of the government.”He said responses to the questions of MPs also allows the government to review its work and determine whether it’s on the right path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-the-first-time-question-hour-is-being-suspended-bjp/story-UQ20MwONW5kX8urWlYxsPP.html

The group of ten parliamentarians from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were led by the leader of the opposition in the upper house, Ghulam Nabi Azad.Last week, Congress president Sonia Gandhi reconstituted the group for better coordination adding new members like KC Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Ahmed Patel from the Rajya Sabha and Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu from the Lok Sabha.

It will then brief the strategy group which includes party president, Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former party president Rahul Gandhi.

It is only continued in few countries like India,” he opined.The top court had on Monday imposed a token fine of Re 1 on Bhushan for his tweets against the judiciary. It asked him to deposit the fine by September 15, failing which he would attract a jail term of three months and debarment from law practice for three years.“I am not saying that there are no vile or scandalous scurrilous allegations being made against judges. They are. But they are dismissed for what they are. People understand that these are scurrilous and unsubstantiated allegations.“The respect for the judiciary does not stand on the ability of the court to stifle this kind of criticism even it is sometimes scurrilous and unfair,” Bhushan said.Talking about his tweets, he said it was what he felt was role of the top court.He said the contempt of court should be abolished and it was for this reason that he along with former Union minister Arun Shourie and veteran journalist N Ram filed a plea challenging the constitutional validity of a legal provision dealing with criminal contempt.“Initially the matter was listed before Justice D Y Chandrachud but later it was removed from him and sent before Justice Arun Mishra (retired Wednesday), whose views on this contempt are well known, and earlier also he had accused me of scandalising and contempt of court just because I had told former CJIs Justice J S Khehar, Dipak Misra and him that they should not hear a case due to conflict of interest,” he said.Renowned author Arundhati Roy also spoke at the event and said the right to free speech was “the most fundamental block of a functioning democracy”.She said that over the last few years the country has seen sudden demonetisation, introduction of GST, abrogation of section 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Citizenship Amendment Act and the Covid-19 lockdown.  These have been like silent attacks masked by pre existing illness, she said.Roy said the judiciary cannot be expected to repeal its power of contempt and citizens will have to strive to make it redundant by speaking their minds responsibly.Mumbai-based lawyer Iqbal Chagla FCC President S Venkat Narayan also spoke at the webinar.

03-09-2020||India||In stern warning to Pak, Gen Rawat says ‘India capable of handling two-front threat’||Amid rising tensions with China in the Ladakh sector after provocative Chinese actions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso and India’s counter-manoeuvres to occupy key heights, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Thursday said Pakistan could try to take advantage of any threat developing along India’s northern borders but warned that the Pakistani army would suffer heavy losses if it attempted any misadventure.Speaking at a seminar organised by the United States-India Strategic Partnership Forum on ‘Navigating New Challenges’, Rawat highlighted the threat of “coordinated action” by the militaries of China and Pakistan along the northern and western borders and stressed that the Indian armed forces were capable of handling the joint threat.The CDS said India’s military strategy to deal with a twin challenge would be based on identifying a primary and a secondary front for conducting operations.Also read: Amid impasse on LAC in Ladakh, India says only way forward through talksHis comments came on a day when Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane reached Leh for a two-day security review of the Ladakh sector where India and China armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas.The Indian Army has rejigged its deployments at multiple points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, including the northern bank of Pangong Lake, to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from making aggressive manoeuvres to unilaterally alter the status quo in the contested areas.Tensions flared in the sensitive sector after the Indian Army occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake five days ago to stop the PLA from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move. Brigade commander-ranked officers from the two sides met for the fourth time in Chushul on Thursday to de-escalate tensions but the talks were inconclusive with neither army prepared to make concessions.Also read: Don’t meddle in border dispute with India, China tells USOn Wednesday, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria visited frontline bases under the Shillong-based Eastern Air Command to review the air force’s operational readiness in the eastern sector. India has strengthened its military posture across the length of the LAC -- from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh - to deal with any provocation by the Chinese military.India is also keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict.Experts said collusive action by China and Pakistan was a possibility. “While hostility with Pakistan is out in the open, we are now witnessing military coercion by China in the Ladakh sector. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that they could collude militarily. They already have strategic collusion,” said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), a former Northern Army commander. Reports prepared by the parliamentary standing committee on defence over the last decade have delved into the threat China and Pakistan could pose together. Pakistan was likely to step up hostilities if China were to launch offensive operations against India, a senior military officer told the committee in 2014. He, however, stressed that China might not pose a collusive threat if hostilities were to break out between India and Pakistan.In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India’s sovereignty was supreme and if anyone threatened it — from the Line of Control (LoC) to the LAC — the armed forces would respond to them “in the same language”.Rawat said India has border management protocols with China to promote peace and tranquillity along the border but of late there have been aggressive actions by China that the Indian military is fully capable of handling. He said India was keeping track of the infrastructure development by China in the Tibet Autonomous Region and its implications were being considered while devising military strategy.The CDS referred to the Quad as a good arrangement to ensure complete freedom of navigation on the high seas and overflight, and unimpeded commerce. China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.Rawat said India and the US could soon finalise the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for sharing geospatial intelligence. He said India was seeking collaboration with the US to acquire high-end technologies in areas such as aerospace, space and artificial intelligence.He added there was tremendous scope for investments in India with the foreign direct investment limit raised to 74 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-stern-warning-to-pak-gen-rawat-says-india-capable-of-handling-two-front-threat/story-3coZHLxAyMnnd3rdPHz2QO.html

India is at the forefront of the research for Covid-19 vaccine, he said.The theme of the 5-day Summit that began on the 31st of August is “US-India Navigating New Challenges”.“Looking forward to address the @USISPForum #USIndiasummit2020.

In a statement sent to the media, spokesman of Maoist party central committee Abhay alleged that the “Ganapathi surrender” story was a conspiracy planned under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, central intelligence and state intelligence forces of Telangana and Chhattisgarh. Abhay said Ganapathi had voluntarily taken the decision to quit his post as the party’s general secretary two years ago due to age and common ailments. “It is a common thing in everybody’s life. It has no relation with this brutal lie (of his surrender to Telangana police),” he said. He alleged that the Modi government was maliciously propagating the surrender theory of Ganapathi to mislead the people and divert their attention from its failures. “The Modi government with saffron ideology has failed internally and externally on all fronts. In order to build confidence in the corporate forces and foil confidence of people in the Maoist party, the government has prepared this high-tension surrender story,” the Maoist party spokesman said. He claimed that the home ministry’s strategy of making New India by finishing the Maoist party by 2022 has utterly failed. “Our party and the movement have been growing strong in some states like Telangana and elsewhere. Our central committee is committed to the peoples’ cause and is strong with lot of ideological and political experience,” Abhay claimed and appealed to the people not to believe the Ganapathi surrender theory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-deny-ganapathi-surrender-reports-call-it-centre-s-conspiracy/story-8cg1VmiU3jTUYQwTJ6yvfK.html

Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong was responding to remarks on Monday by US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun, who had said Washington will push back against Beijing’s aggressive actions, including its “outsized” territorial claims on the border with India. Ji said China favours a “fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution through peaceful and friendly consultations”. The two sides have been in talks at various levels to seek a peaceful settlement of the boundary issue, she said. “China and India have the ability to resolve their border disputes bilaterally. We don’t accept countries outside the region pointing fingers, let alone meddling or making instigation, which will only endanger the regional peace and stability,” she added. Ji also rejected other remarks made by Biegun at the leadership summit organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum that were critical of China for its “outsized demands to claim sovereign territory in the Galwan Valley on the India-Chinese border or in the South Pacific” and its “assertion of national sovereignty over the territory and territorial waters of other countries”. Nations need to enhance mutual understanding and friendly cooperation, and it is regrettable that senior US officials had violated the norms of international ties and “picked up fights virtually on every front and exploited every opportunity they can to slander and smear China”, she said. “The Chinese side firmly opposes it. We urge the US side to respect facts and truth, stop smearing and spreading rumours,” Ji said. She reiterated China’s assertion that it has “never provoked a war or conflict over the past 70 years” and always insisted on resolving territorial and maritime disputes with neighbours through consultations and negotiations on the basis of respecting historical facts to maintain regional peace and stability. Ji described Biegun’s comments about “predatory practices from the Chinese economy” and “technical theft” as groundless, and said China has firmly maintained the multilateral trading system and an open global economy. Issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang are “China’s internal affairs” and “China does not accept external interference”, Ji said. Ji also noted that 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and India, and the two sides should adhere to the strategic guidance of the leaders of two countries, strengthen mutual trust and cooperation, and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation. “As large developing countries and emerging economies, both China and India are pursuing independent foreign policies. We believe that China and India have the ability and wisdom to handle bilateral relations properly and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-meddle-in-border-dispute-with-india-china-tells-us/story-eF0Nnmkz3m6tfWOL6DscII.html

He said test positivity rate was quite high in the last couple of days but it will stabilize soon once testing rate goes up again.“Some studies have pointed out that Covid-19 cases will peak by October. We should not let our guard down citing drop in daily cases. Reduced number is due to the lesser number of tests. Onam festivities led to a dip in tests,” he said. The CM said the state’s vigil and surveillance really helped in containing mortality rate to an extent but the threat is far from over.“Test positivity rate is above 8 now. We have to bring it down to 5. At least 50 percent of the total cases came up in last month. Though we managed to contain a massive spread, the threat remains,” he said, adding that earlier some experts had warned daily cases would go up more than 10,000 in August but the state managed it well.Also read: Five-day sero survey in Agra to begin from FridayMany independent experts believe that the state’s moving growth rate (MGR) for positivity is twice than the national average - 30-day MGR is 122 percent but the national average is only 64 percent in August. There are widespread complaints that many deaths failed to find a place in the government list.While the official Covid-19 deaths in the state are 316, experts said the number may be more than double. Experts attribute the recent spike to increased testing. Till July, daily test rate was between 10,000 and 15,000 but now the state is trying hard to hike it to 50,000.Meanwhile, the state has reported 1,153 fresh cases taking its Covid-19 tally to 79,568. As many as 57, 732 patients in the state have recovered from the deadly contagion while active cases stand at 21,516. With 10 more casualties, Kerala’s Covid-19 death toll has gone up to 316.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-likely-to-peak-by-october-warns-kerala-cm/story-5H17ilfSoZH3VadP3QC1wK.html

Now you only condescend to allow written Questions/Answers! Stop throwing crumbs. This is #Parliament Not the Gujarat Gymkhana,” Derek O’Brien had tweeted on Thursday afternoon. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) targeted the Trinamool Congress government for scrapping question hour at the West Bengal legislative assembly’s two-day monsoon session to be held on September 9 and 10 saying the state government was not willing to face people’s questions and not having question hour showed TMC’s double standards. Also read: Rajnath dials Opposition over Question Hour issue“The chairpersons of two houses of Parliament talk to all parties before deciding the schedule of a session. In Bengal, the session is being held only to abide by the norm (of having a session within six months). The government does not want to face questions on raging issues such as corruption in distribution of relief for people affected by Cyclone Amphan or, its failure to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. It shows TMC’s double standards,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. “The Speaker has not officially informed us that there will be no question hour. We have also come to know about this from sources. He will sit with all parties on September 8,” said CPI(M) lawmaker Sujan Chakraborty. Banejree said that it was not possible to have a question-answer session because of paucity of time as the session has been kept short in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Out of 294 seats in the assembly, the TMC has 221 while the BJP has 14 and the CPI(M), 21. The Speaker also said that legislators, assembly staff, security personnel and journalists will have to undergo rapid antigen tests on September 8 and 9 for which a medical camp will be set up at the premises. Only those testing negative will be given clearance to enter the building. “The legislators will have to maintain distance and occupy specific seats earmarked for them. Elderly legislators will sit in the main hall and younger members will be asked to sit in the galleries. We will not be able to accommodate all journalists as many seats in the media gallery have to be kept empty to ensure social distancing,” said Banerjee. No guests will be allowed during the session and vehicles have to be parked outside the main premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-question-hour-at-2-day-bengal-assembly-session-bjp-claims-it-shows-tmc-s-double-standard/story-CnsVB9aNqdXSZN3vtwSsUI.html

03-09-2020||India||PUBG Banned: The second wave hits gamers||Wednesday afternoon came as a shock for gamers who had breathed a sigh of relief when the Indian government banned Chinese applications in June. This was a part of the government’s response in the wake of growing India-China tensions at the border. In the second wave of blocking Chinese apps, the popular game PUBG has been shown door among other 116 Chinese apps. The game’s exit from the India will be hard to reel from for many gamers simply due to the immense popularity it enjoys. However, the larger consensus that this was well on its way, makes it comes as news less shocking for some whereas, for others this is a welcome move. But taking the lockdown into consideration, excluding the game - something of an entity among the youth - suddenly out of one’s lives will be difficult. “The game became very popular among people of my generation. It was so addictive that I used to lose track of time,” says a 17-year-old Aashay Kolhe who now is a bit disappointed with the game being banned. Government blocks 118 mobile apps which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, Defence of India, Security of State and Public Order: Govt of IndiaPUBG MOBILE Nordic Map: Livik, PUBG MOBILE LITE, WeChat Work & WeChat reading are among the banned mobile apps. pic.twitter.com/VWrg3WUnO8The government’s directive cites the banned apps as being “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity… defence of India, security of state and public order”, as the reason for this move. It added that “The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India… is a matter of very deep and immediate concern…”However, many remain indifferent, and have let the internet do its thing. Of those people, the topmost remain the memers. Just as the move was announced, the issue of the game being banned took precedence over everything that was trending on the internet. The internet was flooded with memes that’ve been shared and re-tweeted numerous times.Krishna Kumar, a 25-year-old professional, is of the opinion that “ it is doubtful that these measures can be considered as a severe blow”. He adds, “Moreover, the game has been popular for years. How does it suddenly become dangerous?” Suraj Pillai, who is an avid PUBG player himself, feels if not PUBG, it’ll be something else. “Those who’re rejoicing the ban will have to understand that there are many other games one might switch to and it will only be a matter of time before they get addicted to something else.” Tencent shares fall over 2% after India bans #PUBG game, other mobile appshttps://t.co/X1IOFTPjEP pic.twitter.com/sMLvoCAXezBut the fact that the game requires access to personal data remained a question mark for some. “It is a great game,” says gaming enthusiast Siddhanth Unnikrishnan, before adding that “it cannot be trusted with personal data and information. I, myself have enjoyed playing the game but I’ve noticed it requires access to the phone gallery and contact numbers. This is completely unnecessary as it has nothing to with the gameplay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pubg-banned-the-second-wave-hits-gamers/story-WIGnH7EQGpRvk72WPfOJJK.html
03-09-2020||India||Pakistan trying to politicise UNSC’s terrorist listing process, says India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of attempting to politicise the UN Security Council’s 1267 sanctions committee procedure after members of the world body rejected Islamabad’s call to designate two Indian nationals as terrorists. The UN Security Council had on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s efforts to get the two Indians designated as terrorists after Islamabad failed to produce evidence to back up its allegations. The proposal from Pakistan was “objected to by some Security Council members and thereafter, the secretariat blocked this proposal...and issued a notification”, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “What has happened is [that] Pakistan’s attempt to list four Indian nationals in this 1267 sanctions list has failed,” he said, adding the move was a “blatant attempt by Pakistan to politicise the working of this 1267 procedure by giving it a religious colour”. Pakistan’s move was widely perceived as retaliation for India’s success last year in getting Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar listed as a global terrorist by the 1267 committee, which focuses on the designation of terrorists linked to al-Qaeda, Islamic State, the Taliban and their affiliates. Pakistan has launched moves to designate a total of four Indians as terrorists since 2019, telling the UN Security Council they were allegedly involved in state-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan also alleged the men were part of an Afghanistan-based group that helped organise terror attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. The efforts to designate two Indians – identified by Pakistan as Venumadhav Dongara and Ajoy Mistry – were rejected by the Security Council in June and July, largely because of efforts by the US, Britain, France and Germany, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. A recent effort to designate two more Indians – identified by Islamabad as Gobinda Patnaik and Angara Appaji – were initially blocked through a “technical hold” by the US, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium as they wanted Pakistan to provide evidence to back its allegations, the people said. During consultations behind closed doors on Wednesday, when the term of the hold ended, Pakistan’s effort to designate the remaining two Indians was rejected by the Security Council after it failed to furnish any proof, the people added. India’s permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, tweeted: “Pakistan’s blatant attempt to politicise 1267 special procedure on terrorism by giving it a religious colour, has been thwarted by UN Security Council. We thank all those Council members who have blocked Pakistan’s designs.” Some of the Indians that Pakistan had sought to designate as terrorists had been working in Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly sought to rake up what it claims is India’s alleged role in fomenting terrorism on its soil at various UN bodies in recent months, but without any takers. It even made a false claim that its envoy to the UN had delivered a statement at a UN Security Council meet on terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-trying-to-politicise-unsc-s-terrorist-listing-process-says-india/story-mb7wh6UqHkW29pAnzOjjML.html
03-09-2020||India||India, Russia finalise AK-47 203 rifles deal: Report||India and Russia have finalised a major deal for manufacturing AK-47 203 rifles in India during Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s ongoing visit here, the official Russian media reported on Thursday. The AK-47 203 is the latest and most advanced version of the AK-47 rifle, which will replace the Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) 5.56x45 mm assault rifle.Also read: Rajnath Singh in Russia for SCO meet, no plan to meet China, Pak ministers: Officials The Indian Army has a requirement for around 770,000 AK-47 203 rifles, of which 100,000 will be imported and the rest will be manufactured in India, Russia’s state-run Sputnik news agency said. There was no official confirmation from the Indian government on the finalisation of the deal. The rifles will be manufactured in India as part of the joint venture Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL), established between the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), the Kalashnikov Concern and Rosoboronexport -- the Russian state agency for military exports, it said. The OFB would own a majority stake of 50.5 per cent in IRRPL while the Kalashnikov Group would have a 42 per cent share. Russia’s state-owned export agency, Rosoboronexport, would own the remaining 7.5 per cent, the report said.Also read: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reaches Russia for SCO meet The 7.62×39 mm Russian weapon will be produced at the Korwa Ordnance Factory in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, the report said.

03-09-2020||India||Banks to roll out stressed loans resolution scheme by Sept 15||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday directed banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to roll out their resolution schemes for stressed borrowers by September 15 post-moratorium period, but asked them to factor in Covid-19 related distress to assess creditworthiness of the borrowers, an official statement said.Businesses, particularly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), want the moratorium period on loan repayment to be extended. The moratorium period ended on August 31 as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not extend it.Experts said this is not the time to initiate the resolution process as MSMEs are the worst sufferers of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown. “Micro and Small enterprises have not yet been out of stress. They want the moratorium to be extended beyond August 31 as businesses have not yet returned to normal,” said Vinod Kumar, president at the India SME Forum. Mint reported on August 29 that the RBI decided against extending the moratorium period beyond August as it was concerned about changes in credit behaviour that could induce among borrowers and increase the risk of loan defaults.The report quoting RBI governor Shatikanta Das said the moratorium on loans was a temporary solution in the context of the lockdown, while a resolution framework would provide durable relief to borrowers facing Covid-related stress.The RBI had announced the loan moratorium to provide relief to pandemic-stressed borrowers in March 2020 initially for the three months till May 31, which was later extended till August end.“As and when the moratorium on loan repayments is lifted, borrowers must be given support and Covid-19 related distress must not impact the lenders’ assessment of their creditworthiness,” a finance ministry statement quoting Sitharaman said. The finance minister held the review meeting on Thursday with banks through a video conference to assess their state of preparedness for implementation of the loans resolution framework for Covid-19 related stress.The finance minister told banks and financial institutions to immediately put in place a board-approved policy for resolution while identifying eligible borrowers and reaching out to them. She also asked them for a quick implementation of a sustained resolution plan to revive every viable business, the statement said.She asked the lenders to launch a sustained media campaign to create awareness for borrowers after rolling out their resolution plans by September 15. She advised them to ensure that regularly updated frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the resolution framework are uploaded on their websites in Hindi, English and regional languages, and also circulated to their offices and branches.The lenders assured the FM that they were ready with their resolution policies. Lenders told her that they had started the process of identifying and reaching out to eligible borrowers, and they would comply with the timelines stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank is assisting in the resolution process, the statement said. Kumar, who is quoted earlier, said, “If banks start the resolution process, most of the smaller units will turn out to be stressed as they are not in a position to start paying debt. Those that are, have not taken the moratorium or have started paying already.”According to him, many small units have not yet attained normal business. “Despite the Centre having announced Unlock 4.0, it is not implemented at State and local levels and workers as well as supply chains have not resumed fully. This is not the time to initiate resolution processes. This is the time to extend a moratorium for survival of businesses,” he said.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP said, “The review meeting of the finance minister with the lenders is an indication that the moratorium may not be extended.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-to-roll-out-stressed-loans-resolution-scheme-by-sept-15/story-kapHByTnf8KcDrL0acz4SN.html
03-09-2020||India||Five-day sero survey in Agra to begin from Friday||The Uttar Pradesh government will begin five-day sero survey in the Taj city from Friday to ascertain the percentage of population with anti-bodies against Covid-19, said a top medical official. “We have constituted 10 teams with four members each including a doctor, lab technician, ASHA worker and ANM. The teams will collect samples from 45 locations earmarked for the purpose,” said Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer, Agra. An expert team from Lucknow too will join the survey, he said.The survey is to be undertaken across 11 districts of Uttar Pradesh and was scheduled earlier but dates were extended twice. The districts where the survey will be conducted are Meerut, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Agra. Also read: Researchers look to make the best of PPE wasteInitially, the plan was to collect 1,080 samples in three days but now with more days in hand 1,444 samples will be collected, Pandey added. “The purpose of sero survey, as conducted in Delhi and other cities, is to find how much of the population has developed antibodies against the virus. This would help in planning an effective strategy to counter the spread of the deadly virus,” said the CMO. The blood samples will be collected from the selected group of people and sent to King George’s Medical University (KGMU) laboratory in Lucknow to determine the presence of the antibodies through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test.

03-09-2020||India||Amid impasse on LAC in Ladakh, India says only way forward through talks||India on Thursday squarely blamed China for the tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)in Ladakh over the past four months and said the only way forward was through negotiations – reflecting the impasse created by Beijing’s fresh attempts to alter the status quo along the disputed border over the weekend. There was no word from Beijing on the latest situation on the LAC, though the Chinese foreign ministry cited Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and yoga’s popularity in the country to criticise New Delhi’s fresh ban on 118 Chinese apps and subtly warned India not to join the US “clean network” programme, an initiative for an internet without security threats. Complex talks being conducted through diplomatic and military channels to end the standoff that began in May suffered a blow when Chinese troops resorted to what were described as “provocative military movements” on the south bank of Pangong Lake during August 29-30. They were thwarted by counter-measures by the Indian side, which quickly occupied several strategic heights and hilltops, and talks between local brigade commanders since Monday to ease the fresh tensions have been inconclusive. “It is clear that the situation we witnessed over the past four months is a direct result of the actions taken by the Chinese side that sought to effect unilateral change of status quo,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “Now the way ahead is negotiations, both through the diplomatic and military channels. The Indian side is firmly committed to resolving all outstanding issues through peaceful dialogue,” he said. The Chinese side, Srivastava added, should “sincerely engage the Indian side with the objective of expeditiously restoring the peace and tranquillity in the border areas through complete disengagement and de-escalation in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols”. Without going into details, he said the local military commanders are still holding discussions to resolve the situation that had arisen from the attempt by Chinese troops to unilaterally change the status quo on the south bank of Pangong Lake. In Beijing, the foreign and commerce ministries criticised India’s ban on 118 Chinese apps and called for the “mistake” to be reversed. Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying even questioned whether India was working with the US on such issues and called for New Delhi to adopt an independent policy. The foreign ministry said that unlike the reason behind India’s decision to ban the apps, the popularity of Tagore’s poetry and the wide approval of Yoga among Chinese nationals didn’t mean that Beijing looks at such issues as “infiltration” or a “threat”. India on Wednesday banned 118 mostly Chinese mobile apps, including Tencent Holdings’s popular video game PUBG, citing data security and privacy concerns. These apps collected and shared data in a “surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to the security of the state”, the Indian side said. Hua said the latest ban would harm the interests of Indian users and the rights of Chinese businesses. Both countries are ancient civilisations with exchange going back thousands of years, she said, giving the example of Tagore, many of whose poems are popular in China. She quoted a line from one of Tagore’s poems: “We read the world wrong, and say that it deceives us.” She added, “Also, yoga is becoming more and more popular in China, including myself, I am very fond of Indian culture. But we do not think that Indian culture or the poems or other things are infiltrating here or posing any threat to Chinese culture.”Hua issued a subtle warning about ties between India and the US: “I have noted that the US state department on the same day said India banned more than 100 Chinese apps and called on other countries to join India to roll out the clean network initiative. “So, I don’t know if there is any correlation or interaction between India and the US. But India is an ancient civilisation with wise people. They should know what the US has done in cyber security, for example Dirtbox, Prism, Irritant Horn, Muscular and under-sea cable tapping.” Hua also said China hopes India will “stay committed to its precious independence [in] decision-making”. Commerce ministry spokesperson Gao Feng called on India to work with the Chinese side to maintain hard-won bilateral cooperation to build an open and fair business environment for international investors and service providers, including Chinese companies. External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava defended the ban on apps, saying they had engaged in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and defence of India. “What I can say is that we remain open, we continue to welcome FDI in the country, including in the area of internet technology. However, what we would like to say is companies, when they operate here, they have to operate in accordance with the regulatory framework of the government of India,” he added. India first banned 59 Chinese apps on June 29, days after a clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. Another 47 apps were added to the ban in July. Experts in China expectedly criticised India’s ban. Zhao Gancheng, director of the Centre for Asia-Pacific Studies at Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said while the ban will likely have a limited impact on the Indian economy, the “ill intentions behind the Indian government’s move to stir up tension and even a conflict with China are increasingly reaching a dangerous level”. “This is dangerous. The worse the Indian economy becomes, the higher the probability that a military conflict could be provoked by New Delhi. This is a very worrisome situation,” Zhao told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-impasse-on-lac-in-ladakh-india-says-only-way-forward-through-talks/story-8CXBgl0LNRRfAwNXxIauKN.html

There are many leaders of other parties who give inflammatory speeches. Facebook should also ban their accounts. I’ll write to Facebook for opening of my official account,” Raja Singh said.A Wall Street Journal report published on August 14 alleged that Facebook was going easy on hate speeches by BJP members and triggered a controversy.The report cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders and claimed the company’s senior India policy executive Ankhi Das intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on Raja Singh, whose posts targeted the Muslim community.Punishing violations by BJP politicians would damage the company’s business prospects, Das is reported to have told staff members.“We have banned Raja Singh from Facebook for violating our policy prohibiting those that promote or engage in violence and hate from having a presence on our platform. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove his account,” a Facebook spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-t-raja-says-will-approach-facebook-after-social-media-platform-bans-his-account-over-hate-speech/story-a5NszI4W6NtP3NLRfGctgI.html

I have many fond memories of the place. In fact, I visited Lucknow thrice this year,” said the ‘Swim Team’ and ‘Kehne Ko Humsafar Hain’ actor, speaking over the phone from Mumbai.Juggling between shoots, Pooja feels this is the best phase of her career. “I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Reaching here was never easy as I had to struggle to make a name. I remember after doing quite a few projects, I was not getting the kind of work I wanted and so it was leading nowhere. I was ready to pack my bags and leave. I had promised my parents that if acting did not work out I’d quit and leave Mumbai. It was on my husband, Sandeep Sejwal’s insistence, that I decided to try my hand at playing an antagonist for the first time and since then there has been no looking back.”The actor is happy with the kind of roles she is currently playing. “I’m enjoying playing negative roles as they give you a lot of room to perform as an actor. Also, life is such that no one can be Miss Goody Two Shoes all the time, and we as humans, have our good and bad sides too. My character, Rhea Mehra, from the show ‘Kumkum Bhagya’ is such and that’s the reason I’m loving it. She is young, bubbly and has strong likes and dislikes,” she said.Pooja has been frequently working on the web too. Talking about her OTT experience, the ‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay’ actor said, “Currently, OTT is the place to be and as an actor, it is exciting as well as fulfilling to be working on various platforms and getting numerous chances to entertain audiences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-was-ready-to-pack-my-bags-and-leave/story-kcLlq5AOt5LNZxF3Vfhx4N.html
03-09-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case has links with drug trade, says official||Investigators probing the Kerala gold smuggling case have found strong links with a drug bust in Bengaluru on August 28 and have approached the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for details, a senior officer who is part of the investigating team said Thursday. “The key accused in the drug case Anoop Mohammad was in constant touch with K T Ramees, an accused in the gold smuggling case and we suspect both had connections with the international drug cartel. We found Ramees had made several trips to Africa,” the official said. “He was also the main link between smugglers, drug cartel and subversive elements”. He said officials had initially suspected a link between gold smuggling and the drug syndicate and the latest incidents show their suspicion was justified. The National Investigation Agency which is heading the gold smuggling probe will question Mohammad soon. Anoop Mohammad, a native of Kochi, was arrested along with two others when the NCB busted a major drug racket in Bengaluru. In his statement to the NCB, which was later leaked to the media, he mentioned the name of Bineesh Kodiyeri, second son of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, and said he helped him a lot in his “business venture.” Bineesh Kodiyeri later acknowledged that he knew Anoop Mohammad since 2013 but he had no idea about his drug dealings. “I was really shocked after his arrest. I know him very well and funded him setting up a hotel. I never knew about his involvement in drugs,” he said. He claimed his name was dragged due to political reasons. There are also reports Mohammad took names of many film personalities in Kochi whom he regularly supplied some ecstasy pills nicknamed “Acid and Molly.” The NCB said Mohammad was active in drug business since 2015. The opposition Congress and BJP also said the gold smuggling and drug seizure were closely linked. “Anoop Mohammad is just a proxy of Bineesh Kodiyeri. Many other names including that of some film artists will surface soon,” said BJP president K Surendran. Kodiyeri on his part said he was ready for any investigation. Meanwhile the BJP has raised another allegation against the Left Front government saying an imposter had signed some files when chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan went to the United States for treatment in September 2018. BJP spokesman Sandeep Warrier said it was not a digital signature and asked the CM to reveal who signed important files in his absence. Vijayan yet to react to the latest allegation. At least 20 people have been arrested so far in tehgold smuggling case after the racket was detected on July 5 following the seizure of 30 kg of the yellow metal from a consignment came in the name of an employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-has-links-with-drug-trade-says-official/story-8kqc9vpokXfKRZaflBU1aL.html

03-09-2020||India||Give India another chance to appoint lawyer for Kulbhushan Jadhav: Pak court||A high court in Pakistan on Thursday directed the federal government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav as it adjourned hearing for a month. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) took up the case of appointment of lawyer for Jadhav to hear the review of the death sentence given to him by a Pakistani military court. Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in April 2017. Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan told the court that to comply with the orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan granted consular access to India, however, it has not replied to Pakistan’s offer to appoint a lawyer for him. The IHC, after hearing the arguments, ordered the government to send its order on Jadhav to India and adjourned the hearing until October 3 when the case would be heard again. Pakistan has introduced a special law to allow Jadhav to get his sentence reviewed as asked by the ICJ. India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran. India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-india-another-chance-to-appoint-lawyer-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-pakistan-court-to-govt/story-UWVozMx77BTVDCODPpioTM.html
03-09-2020||India||Tagore no threat to China, why should PUBG be a risk to India, asks Beijing||Beijing on Thursday cited Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and yoga’s popularity in China to criticise India banning 118 Chinese apps and subtly warned New Delhi not to join the US’s ‘clean network’ programme, Washington’s initiative for an internet without security threats.The Chinese foreign ministry said unlike the reason behind India’s decision to ban the 118 apps, the popularity of Tagore’s poems or the wide approval of yoga among Chinese citizens did not mean that China looks at these as “infiltration” or “threat”.India on Wednesday banned 118, mostly Chinese mobile apps, including Tencent Holdings Ltd’s popular video game PUBG, citing data security concerns.These “apps collect and share data in a surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to the security of the state,” India’s ministry of electronics and information technology said in a statement.The latest round of ban – India first banned 59 Chinese apps on June 29 – comes in the backdrop of fresh escalation in the ongoing border friction between the two Himalayan neighbours in eastern Ladakh.While the foreign ministry invoked Tagore and his poetry, China’s commerce ministry was less poetic. It said it strongly opposed India banning Chinese apps. “Indian actions violate the legal interests of Chinese investors and services providers and China asks India to correct its mistakes,” commerce ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said at a briefing.Gao said India has abused national security by imposing “discriminate restrictions” on Chinese companies,He said China has always asked its companies to comply with international and local rules and regulations in their overseas operations.“We hope that the Indian side will work with the Chinese side to maintain hard-won bilateral cooperation and development so as to build an open and fair business environment for international investors and services providers including Chinese companies,” Gao was quoted as saying.The Chinese foreign ministry, meanwhile, said neither country should hurt long-term interests because of short sightedness.“The Indian side decided to ban some great and popular Chinese apps. Indian user’s rights and interests are firstly harmed. And Chinese business’s rights and interests will also be harmed. So, what India has done is not beneficial to anyone,” spokesperson Hua Chunying said.“As I said both are ancient civilisations with splendid cultures that we are proud of, and the exchange between the two sides have been going on for thousands of years.”Giving the example of Tagore, Hua said many of his poems are popular in China, and then quoted a line from one of his poems: “We read the world wrong, and say that it deceives us”.“Also, yoga is becoming more and more popular in China; including myself, I am very fond of Indian culture. But we do not think that Indian culture or the poems or other things are infiltrating here or are posing any threat to Chinese culture,” Hua said.“What we believe is that the intermingling of different cultures is conducive to promoting people’s mutual understanding and friendship.”Hua also let out a subtle warning about ties between India and the US.“I have noted that the US state department on the same day said that India banned more than 100 Chinese apps and called on other countries to join India to roll out the clean network initiative,” she said.“So, I don’t know if there is any correlation or interaction between India and the US. But India is an ancient civilisation with wise people. They should know what the US has done in Cyber Security for example Dirtbox, Prism, Irritant Horn, Muscular and under-sea cable tapping. Indian people must have the wisdom to tell whether the US practice on cyber security is clean or dirty.”“We hope India could stay committed to its precious independence decision making.”Experts in China have expectedly criticised New Delhi’s move to ban the apps.Zhao Gancheng, director of the Centre for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies said while the apps ban will likely have a limited impact on the Indian economy, the “…ill intentions behind the Indian government’s move to stir up tension and even a conflict with China are increasingly reaching a dangerous level”.“This is dangerous.

The tweets came after the Twitter account of PM Narendra Modi’s personal website was hacked this morning.However, the party’s post on Twitter was not about any cybersecurity alarm but directed at the worrying state of the economy and the prevailing coronavirus situation. As one clicks on the image, the text inside reads, ”Now that we have your attention, we just want to let you know that India’s unemployment has hit 45 years high, GDP growth rate is lowest in 40 years and COVID-19 cases have hit 83000 in a day which is highest in the world.”  Alert‼️ pic.twitter.com/7Ni4vTC2MPDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led party brought to notice the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that contracted by 23.9% in April-June as the Covid-19 lockdown weighed on the already declining consumer demand and investment. He also pointed out that the jobless rate in the country is currently at a 45-year high and the GDP has dropped to a 40-year-low. The other reference that he made was to the surging coronavirus cases in the country. With daily Covid-19 cases crossing the grim milestone of 80,000 for the second time, India’s infection tally on Thursday went up to 3,853,406. The toll from the infection has risen over 67,000. Several Opposition parties, including the Congress, have criticised the Modi government for the dropping GDP.

Besides the CAPF, the AR and the NSG are also under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).As on January 1, 2019, the CAPF had an actual strength of 9,23,800 personnel, who played a vital role in guarding borders and assisting the central and state governments in the maintenance of internal security and curbing other illegal or unlawful activities, the NCRB stated.According to the latest data for 2019, 104 personnel lost their lives in various accidents, including road or rail accidents, and in action or encounters.Fourteen personnel were killed in action or operations or encounters in 2019, with more than half of them (eight) in Chhattisgarh (57.1 per cent), followed by six in Jammu and Kashmir (42.9 per cent), the data showed.However, the maximum of 62 of the 104 deaths (59.6 per cent) were under the “other causes” category, followed by 24 (23.1 per cent) in “road or railway accidents”, the NCRB stated.Of the 62 “deaths due to other causes”, 25.8 per cent and 16.1 per cent were reported in Jammu and Kashmir (16) and Rajasthan (10) respectively.Rajasthan accounted for 20.8 per cent (five) of the 24 “deaths due to road or railway accidents” in the country in 2019, the data showed.In 2018 also, the “accidental death” figures in the CAPF, the AR and the NSG stood at 104, the NCRB, which functions under the MHA, stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/104-security-personnel-under-mha-lost-lives-in-accidents-in-2019-2-006-in-six-years/story-gSWFc4eeMYaT5UoYKdlgkK.html

Also read: Facebook bans BJP legislator amid raging controversy over hate speech biasIn a mail to Congress general secretary in charge of the organisation, K C Venugopal, the social media company’s public policy director, Neil Potts, based in its headquarter at Menlo Park, California, said, “On the question of hateful content by public figures, we want to assure you that our Community Standards prohibit attacks against people based on their protected characteristics, including religion, caste, ethnicity, and national origin. In line with our hate speech policy, we have removed and will continue to remove hateful content by public figures in India on our platforms.” Venugopal had shot a letter last month to Facebook in the wake of the Wall Street Journal report that the social media giant’s key public-policy executive in India, Ankhi Das, didn’t allow pulling down a hate-filled post of a BJP leader. In its reply to the Congress, Potts said, “We are non-partisan and strive to ensure that our platforms remain a space where people can express themselves freely. We take allegations of bias seriously and want to make it clear that we denounce hate and bigotry in all forms.” He continued to explain that as part of Facebook’s policy development process, “we consult a community of external voices, including civil society organizations, academics, and subject experts. We also rely extensively on inputs from a broad cross-section of internal teams who understand both local and global contexts in the enforcement of our policies on hate speech and dangerous organizations and individuals.” “We have a team with deep expertise on terrorism and organized hate, who pay attention to global and regional trends and advise on these matters. These decisions are not made unilaterally by any one person; rather, they are inclusive of different views from teams around the company, a process that is critical to making sure we consider, understand, and account for both the local and global contexts,” the director said. The letter also cited that the latest Transparency Report showed how Facebook took action against violating content across its platforms. “We removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content from April-June in 2020, up from 1.6 million pieces of hate speech content removed in the last quarter of 2017. We know there is much more to do and will continue to invest our efforts to combat hate speech on our services,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-to-remove-hateful-content-facebook-assures-congress/story-bao4qmIGPrtIImqOO3nj0M.html
03-09-2020||India||Researchers look to make the best of PPE waste||At least four Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) institutes, along with several private firms, are working on recycling plastic waste from discarded PPE (personal protective equipment) kits, masks and disposable testing equipment. The researchers aim to utilise the recycled material to pave roads, make bricks or reuse them for biomedical purposes after a microwaved process of sterilisation, according to experts. As per estimates of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), 19,636 tonnes of biomedical waste is expected to be generated this year across the state. Almost one third of this waste will be in the form of disposable PPE kits, masks, testing swabs and pipes used in the management of Covid-19 patients. In view of the huge challenge to public safety, the manufacturers of disposable PPE kits have also been asked to devise ways to recycle and manage the waste produced by used kits. The research is focused on three safe options, including the construction of roads with used PPE kits. Experts from four CSIR institutes, Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun; National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune; Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), Durgapur; and Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), Lucknow, are working to convert discarded PPE kits and other plastic waste into pellets that can be used for road construction or moulded for other applications. Alok Dhawan, the director of IITR Lucknow, said, “Our Institute is working to ensure that discarded PPE kits are disinfected before being utilised to make other items. We will also ensure that the recycled material is used as per the regulations laid down by CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board).” He added that disposable PPE kits were made of plastic polymers and they could easily be recycled and used to construct roads. The idea is not new as plastic has been used to construct roads in various parts of the county for at least five years now. The production of bricks and construction material is another option. A couple of manufacturers of PPE kits are planning to make construction material like bricks and road tiles with discarded PPE kits. Dinesh Srivastav, a Mathura-based PPE kit manufacturer, said, “Making bricks of used PPE kits can be a profitable way to recycle them. A person in Gujarat has successfully made bricks out of used PPE. We are also working with plastic recycling experts to do the same. The plan is to make bricks and interlocking tiles with recycled PPE kits, which can be used in construction.” The manufacturers are confident that with help of experts they will be able to develop a prototype by the end of September. “Once the prototype is made, we will get it approved by UPPCB before starting production,” said Srivastav. “We are also working on a system to collect used PPE kits from hospitals in a safe manner to ensure that infection is not transmitted during the operation,” he added. Perhaps the most cost-effective method to reduce biomedical waste is to reuse PPE kits. Maser Technology, a start-up, has developed a microwave that can sterilise PPE kits and masks rendering them reusable. Monish Bhandari, the owner of the start-up, said, “We have developed a device named Optimaser that uses microwave technology to sterilise used PPE kits and masks. Twenty PPE kits can be sterilised within 20 minutes using Optimaser. The technology has been tested by AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences).” According to the manufacturers, one PPE kit can be reused 20 times after being sterilised in Optimaser after each use. The developers are working closely with experts from Lucknow-based IITR in developing the machine. The manufacturers are in talks with various state governments for installing the machines in Covid-19 care facilities across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/researchers-look-to-make-the-best-of-ppe-waste/story-dT2D5Z7ZiNKMw0fkXF7x6I.html

A letter of assurance by NMCG director general was handed out to Swami Shivanand Saraswati by the representatives of Ganga Vichar Manch, who arrived at Matri Sadan ashram premises on Wednesday late evening, following which the Ganga activist ended his fast.

Ganga Vichar Manch founder Bharat Pathak said that Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Shekhawat was in constant touch with him about Swamiji’s health and had a telephonic dialogue which led to the breakthrough. “After this assurance, we hope that soon concrete steps will be taken on demands made by Swami Shivanand Saraswati and another ashramites, who have been, off late, staging numerous agitations for the cause of protecting holy Ganga River and conservation of its ecology,” said Ganga Vichar Manch founder Bharat Pathak.

This comes in the backdrop of reports that KK Singh told Mumbai police in a statement that he believes his son might have “done suicide out of dejection.”The lawyer, however, refuted the claims saying, “At that point, we only protested that it should not be in Marathi. We did not know what was written in Marathi as none of the family members hails from Maharashtra.” Also read: ‘Mumbai police has a reputation, welcome plea by retired cops in Sushant case’, says ministerIn late August, as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) approached All India Institute Of Medical Science (AIIMS) for assistance, it formed a medical panel to look into the alleged murder angle in the case. “We will look into the possibility of murder.

03-09-2020||India||In Rajasthan, Congress’ ‘enduring plan’ to address discontent among MLAs||After overcoming the recent political crisis in Rajasthan, the state Congress has started working on an “enduring plan” to address dissatisfaction among MLAs and other party leaders.The party is planning to ensure maximum participation of MLAs, senior leaders and workers in the government and organisation. Around 1.30 lakh workers have been identified in districts and blocks. They will be given an opportunity to work with the government. The government will accommodate maximum legislators for governance – in cabinet, as parliamentary secretaries and chairpersons of boards and commissions, according to a senior Congress leader familiar with the development.Rajasthan can have a maximum of 30 ministers. At present, there are 22, including the chief minister.Recently, the Chhattisgarh government appointed 15 parliamentary secretaries. “In Rajasthan also, the possibilities are being explored, the parliamentary secretaries will assist the ministers in working,” the party leader said.Education Minister Govind Singh Dotasra has now been made state party chief, another minister Bhanwar Lal is unwell, the post of deputy speaker is vacant, eight posts of ministers are to be filled and some ministers on the basis of performance are likely to be replaced. “This way, around 13-15 in the ministry, including those who came from BSP and independents will be accommodated and a dozen can be made parliamentary secretaries,” the party leader said.He said the state government will bring an amendment in the Prevention of Disqualification Act to avoid office of profit violation, while accommodating MLAs in board and commissions. “The party leadership does not want repetition of what happened when 19 MLAs, led by Sachin Pilot, turned rebel. The move is to address resentment and ensure active participation in the government,” he added.Besides, the Congress leader said the party has identified over 1.30 lakh workers, who actively worked at booth level and helped the party in elections. “These workers will be accommodated at block and district level in various committees such as MGNREGA, Swasthya Rakshak, 20-point programme, school and hospital boards to help provide good governance,” he said.“A good number of senior leaders including ex-MLAs, ministers and chairpersons will be given positions in organisations, other than political appointments in the government, said the party leader.AICC general secretary and the party incharge for Rajasthan, Ajay Maken said when there are various statutory positions which have been occupied in past by the MLAs in Rajasthan as also in the Congress-ruled states such as Punjab has six advisors to the CM and Chhattisgarh has 15 parliamentary secretaries. “Holding such positions helps MLAs to exercise their authority more effectively for development. When provisions are available, why leave them empty,” he said. The appointments will be both a mixture of MLAs and non-MLAs, Maken said.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said in democracy, power sharing is a big thing, where workers feel themselves as part of the system, but stopping resentment through this is difficult. Till the time, the workers or leaders are ideologically dedicated, it will not solve the purpose. Power is not a solution for resentment, he said.BJP Spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said it is unfortunate that the state exchequer will have to bear the burden of Congress pleasing its MLAs.“To save their government, Congress is trying to please MLAs, the burden of which will come on state exchequer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rajasthan-congress-enduring-plan-to-address-discontent-among-mlas/story-1bCCP2v7Yu6ESmAQksg77I.html

The incident happened in the dense forests of Devallagudem of Gundala block at around 4.15 am. “We have seized a weapon and a motorcycle from the incident spot,” district superintendent of police Sunit Dutt said in a statement. Though the SP said that the Maoist is yet to be identified, the police suspect that he could be Dudi Devalu alias Shakar of Dulodu village of Kistaram area in Chhattisgarh state and was believed to be the guard of top Maoist leader Haribhushan. The encounter took place at a time when Telangana director general of police M Mahender Reddy is on an intensive tour of Maoist-affected areas of Asifabad-Kumaram Bheem districts for the last two days. Sunil Dutt said the police forces were combing the Devallagudem forests following a tip off that some action teams of Maoists were actively moving in the villages on the borders of Chhattisgarh. “At around 4.15 am on Thursday, Gundala Inspector of Police Srinivas and his team noticed two persons riding on a motorcycle suspiciously. When the police asked them to stop, they left the bike and started running into the forests. As the police chased them, the two opened fire at the police. In retaliation, the police forces also fired at them,” the SP said. Later, the police found the dead body of a 25-year old male Maoist. A firearm and the bike were seized, Dutt said, adding that several Maoists in the surroundings had fled the spot. “The combing operations are on,” he said. This is the second encounter in recent times in the district. An exchange fire had taken place on July 16 in the forests of Malletogu in Manugur mandal in the district in which a constable was injured. Meanwhile, the DGP held a series of meetings with senior police officials, including in-charge SP of Asifabad Satyanarayana, and discussed the strategies in the wake of report that top Maoist leader of Telangana regional committee Mailaram Odellu alias Bhaskar has intensified recruitment of cadre in the border areas of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. Earlier, the DGP had an aerial review of the forest areas abutting Pranahita river on Maharashtra-Telangana borders, along with Adilabad SP Vishnu Warrior.

Lives, livelihoods and jobs have been ravaged. Businesses and small and medium industries lie dilapidated. The Economy stands destroyed as GDP has been razed and mowed down. India is being pushed towards a ‘financial emergency’,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a press conference.Also read| Covid-19 ‘Act of God’, may result in contraction of economy: Nirmala Sitharaman“Modi Government has plundered the economy in the last 6 years by its ‘Acts of frauds’. The Government now describes its criminal ineptitude and culpable incompetence as an ‘Act of God’. Sadly, this is the only Government in the past 73 years which blames ‘God’ for its own frauds and bluster,” he said.Surjewala also said that by abolishing question hour in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning from September 14, the government is running scared of answering relevant questions. Also read: Shorter hours, new rules to mark this monsoon session of Parliament“By abolishing question hour in Parliament, govt is running scared of answering relevant questions. Modi govt doesn’t want to answer on brazen transgression by China onto Indian Territory, blunder of Indian economy, falling GDP and over 12 crore job losses,” he said. The Congress leader said that the Government of India is a “declared defaulter” for the first time in the last 73 years.“In the meeting of ‘Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance’ dated August 11, 2020 the Finance Secretary clearly said that Government of India is not in a position to give GST compensation to States. The latest SBI report of September 1, 2020, predicts a shortfall and revenue loss of 3 lakh crore in GST collections for the States. How will States meet their expenses? This is Economic Anarchy,” he said. Surjewala said that the Modi Government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court conveying its decision to not extend the moratorium on payment of EMI’s by salaried class and the middle class beyond August 31, 2020.“The Modi Government has refused to provide interest waiver also. All hopes of the middle-class lie shattered,” he added. “A government that pats its back in the name of farmers and labourers has pushed them to the doorstep of economic ruin and suicide,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-being-pushed-towards-financial-emergency-congress-targets-centre-over-economic-situation/story-uoSj2wiR2CIurAy6K0UzxO.html
03-09-2020||India||With out-patient services shut, doctors’ phones have turned into helpline||Work starts as early as 7am for Prof Kauser Usman, senior faculty member at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), as he takes patients’ phone calls at home. Most of these patients want to know about Covid and its symptoms. Prof Usman speaks to them patiently, offering medical advice and words of comfort. He is not the only one of his fraternity reaching out to patients in this manner. In fact, the number of calls to doctors has doubled ever since the pandemic began. An expert in medicine, Prof Usman gets calls from diabetics too as diabetes is a comorbidity that has been diagnosed in about 50% of those who have died in the corona wards of hospitals.As the regular OPD is closed, his phone has turned into a virtual helpline. He guides patients to the fever clinic, tells them how to get tests done and talks about home care if they are fit enough for home isolation.“Picking up the phone has two reasons. First, the quick response guides them to the correct diagnosis facility. Hence, the treatment response starts early and has been seen (to be) impactful. Second, if they are able to talk to a doctor, they feel confident, another important factor in fighting the infection,” Prof Usman says.In all, his phone became a medical helpline of sorts for about 150 patients, who could not visit KGMU OPD. Currently, about two dozen patients are consulting him amid the pandemic.Like him, other doctors give a patient hearing to patients, suggest tests, read reports on WhatsApp, recommend medicines and then do a follow-up on the telephone. It’s all in a day’s work. The patients are making calls irrespective of the doctors’ specialty.Dr Samir Misra, senior faculty, trauma surgery at King George’s Medical University, says, “If I answer the phone at midnight, the anxiety level is certain to go down as the patient is able to speak to a doctor, irrespective of the specialty.”“The first thing patients need is to clarify whether they have Covid or not. They need to discuss it threadbare. Hence, my cell phone keeps ringing with calls from old patients, who have visited my OPD,” says Prof Vinod Jain, also of KGMU.Prof Jain, who is in home isolation after testing positive, says, “Correct guidance ensures quick and correct treatment, which is necessary for a speedy recovery in case of the viral infection. If I can do it despite my illness, I feel satisfied to help.”Dr Abhishek Shukla, an expert in geriatric medicine, too, is attending patients in a similar manner.“Every fever is being assumed as Covid-19 and patients are isolating themselves immediately. The next thing they do is contact a doctor on the phone. A majority of my patients are in the risk group of above 60 years. WhatsApp is mostly used for communication (with them),” he says.“Statistically, the number of calls from patients seeking advice has doubled,” says Dr Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-out-patient-services-shut-doctors-phone-have-turned-into-helpline/story-b6MmQWLam3Qofrwja86muM.html
03-09-2020||India||Delhi HC allows breath analyser tests to be administered to air traffic controllers||The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed the breath analyser test (BAT) to be administered to air traffic controllers (ATCs) by using individual tubes, while modifying its March 23 order which suspended the tests in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.In March, the Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild (India) had filed a plea seeking directions to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Air Authority of India (AAI) to temporarily suspend the BAT to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.Justice Navin Chawla allowed the resumption of the tests after an application was filed by advocate Anjana Gosain, on behalf of DGCA, stating that with the resumption of the flights, it was important to administer the test to ATCs again.Seeking a modification to the March 23 order, Gosain contended that the rules of Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) of September 2019 state that a BAT must be administered. She also said that individual tubes are used for testing, an international practice.Gosain told the court that after much deliberation, it was concluded that BAT is the most efficient and reliable form of detecting alcohol on the breath, adding that other methods, such as testing blood and urine, are neither practical nor is there any provision for them in the CAR. The DGCA plea stated that it has been now recommended that once a breath analysing machine has been used to test someone, the person would not be tested for the next 12 hours.Following this, the court accepted DGCA’s application and gave the ATC’s Guild the liberty to suggest sanitisation and other preventive measures.Earlier, as the pandemic started to spread, the ATC’s Guild (India) had moved the court claiming that BAT violates their fundamental right to life and health. BAT was made mandatory as per directions issued by DGCA on September 16, 2019. DGCA directed the Air Traffic Management to administer BATs to employees of Air Traffic Control, aerodrome management, aircraft maintenance and repair, ground handling agency, aircraft operations every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-allows-breath-analyser-tests-to-be-administered-to-air-traffic-controllers/story-HoEMS5R9Oa8IW5cNo8wzrJ.html

Also read: JNU to accept admission forms for MBA, MPhil and PhD under JRF till Sept 21Vivek Pandey, an activist of All India Students’ Association (AISA), said the incident took place late Wednesday night when he was inside his room. He said he was attacked by student members of the ABVP who accused him of filing complaints against them at the security and the hostel warden’s office. “One person said I had filed a complaint against him for returning from home. I told him that I had not filed any such complaint and didn’t know anything about it. He then abused and punched me and repeatedly hit me on my head. They threatened me. My friend, who tried to rescue me, was also assaulted,” Pandey said. AISA national president N Sai Balaji shared a video on Twitter of Pandey narrating the incident. Balaji said they have filed a police complaint. Meanwhile, the ABVP has denied the allegations. Sujeet Sharma, a JNU student and ABVP Delhi executive member, said, “We got to know about the incident through social media. AISA and SFI activists engage in regular scuffles and this could be a political stunt before reopening of the campus.

03-09-2020||India||UP to cultivate Napier grass to provide nutritious fodder to cows||Officials in Bulandshahr have hit upon the idea of cultivating Napier grass at 92 locations linked with gaushalas to provide nutritional fodder to cows living in shelters across the district. Napier is a perennial tropical grass which needs little water and nutrients and can also thrive on land not used for crop cultivation. The project will be completed under grassland cultivation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS). The district administration has tied up with the Jhansi-based Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (IGFRI) to seek technical training for cultivation of Napier grass. Purushottam Sharma, principal scientist of IGFRI, said that cultivation of Napier grass had gone up in the past few years and many states had shown interest in it. “The Bulandshahr district administration also approached the institute with similar demand and we are providing them technical assistance for its cultivation,” he said. Sharma explained that Napier grass was also known as Uganda grass. It was a perennial tropical forage crop used as fodder. It was not a complete nutrition but a good source of energy, so it was fed directly to cattle or made into hay. It is grown throughout the year. Chief development officer (CDO) of Bulandshahr, Abhishek Pandey, who is responsible for maintenance and management of the 154 rural area gaushalas in the district, said that amid complaints of substandard fodder in gaushalas, an idea of providing the animals nutritional food through Napier grass came up and after seeking guidance of IGFRI, plan to cultivate Napier grass was finalised. Pandey claimed that Bulandshahr is the first district which has initiated Napier grass cultivation through MGNREGS under its grassland cultivation work. He said that after several rounds of discussions with district magistrate Ravindra Kumar and other officials, 92 of 154 locations linked with gaushalas were selected for cultivation of Napier grass and preparation was already underway at 39 locations. Sharma said that an online training on technicalities of cultivation and other requirements was held in July and field visit would also be planned as per the requirement. CDO Pandey elaborated that initially 240 quintals of grass had been demanded from the IGFRI for cultivation and its arrival was expected this week. “It has been delayed because a few staff at IGFRI were detected corona positive and work was stalled for a few days,” he said. To recall, Sanjay Sharma, BJP MLA from Anoopshahr constituency of the district had sat on an overnight dharna outside the gaushala of Nangal Karam village on Friday because villagers had lodged a complaint about supply of inadequate fodder and other problems in the cow shelter. “It is a great initiative of the district authorities. It would help in resolving non availability of fodder and provide nutritional food to cattle,” said the MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-cultivate-napier-grass-to-provide-nutritious-fodder-to-cows/story-bCUkcrWBCSHpcfMYCyyW1I.html

The authorities had called off that treasure hunt after the nearly 15-day-long exercise ended in vain at the time.The coins found on Wednesday date back to 1862, going by the year imprinted on them. Subdivisional magistrate (SDM), Safipur, Rajendra Prasad said 17 silver and 287 bronze coins were found and deposited in the Safipur treasury.The workers who found the pitcher had been engaged under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), officials said.A fight broke out among the workers after they stumbled upon the pitcher and found coins inside it, they added. The workers allegedly took some coins in their possession and ran away from the scene.In the meantime, someone informed the Asivan police, who conducted raids and managed to recover the coins from the workers.“We still feel there could be more (coins) with the workers, they will be recovered shortly,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mgnrega-workers-find-pitcher-full-of-silver-bronze-coins-from-1862-in-up/story-ttflgua4g3LE9XwS38ln6K.html
03-09-2020||India||‘Mumbai police has a reputation, welcome plea by retired cops in Sushant case’: Minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday welcomed a plea by retired police officers to the Bombay High Court seeking a restraint on the “media trial” in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. Deshmukh compared the Mumbai police to Scotland Yard Police, which is considered to be one of the best forces in the world, and condemned how they were “targeted” in Rajput’s case. “Maharashtra Police & Mumbai Police have a reputation. Maharashtra Police is compared to Scotland Yard Police. The manner in which Mumbai Police was targeted in Sushant Singh Rajput case, I welcome the PIL filed by retired IPS officers,” the state home minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Five former director generals of police (DGP) of Maharashtra, two former commissioners of Mumbai police and a former anti-terrorism squad (ATS) chief have moved a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court against the “media trial” in Rajput’s death investigation. Former DGPs PS Pasricha, K Subramaniam, D Shivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal, Satish Chandra Mathur; former commissioners of Mumbai police Mahesh N Singh, Dhananjay N Jadhav, and former ATS chief KP Raghuvanshi filed the PIL on Monday. Their plea accuses the media of indulging in biased coverage of the incident and trying to influence the probe by creating false propaganda. “This has created an air of suspicion in the minds of general public as to the facts of the case under investigation and also about the Mumbai Police, health services and other support services of the state,” the PIL states. The retired police officers have said that the “irresponsible media coverage” has led to damage to Mumbai police’s image. The plea also states that the “media trial” has resulted into a parallel investigation being carried out by private individuals, rendering opinions, exposing material witnesses and divulging crucial pieces of evidence which, in turn, hampers the work of investigating agencies.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is currently probing the death of Rajput who was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are also investigating the money laundering and drug-related angle alongside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-has-a-reputation-welcome-plea-by-retired-cops-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-minister/story-zcPugLHESytB8FaAPnu6WO.html
03-09-2020||India||UN Rapporteurs raise concerns over India’s draft EIA 2020||The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteurs have raised several concerns about the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020 and have asked the government how its provisions correspond with India’s obligations under international law.Also read: ‘Nothing disturbing in the clauses of draft EIA 2020’, says RP GuptaA communication dated August 31 and posted on the United Nations Human Rights Council website by UN Special Rapporteurs on clean, healthy and sustainable environment; on human rights; on right to food; on safe drinking water and sanitation stated that certain provisions of the notification could impact the effectiveness and transparency of the environmental regulatory framework in India.The three important issues raised by UN Special Rapporteurs are:• The draft notification includes under Clauses 14 (2) and 26 an exemption of several large industries and projects from public consultation — as part of the environment impact assessment process — such as chemical manufacturing and petroleum products; building, construction and area development; inland waterways and expansion or widening of national highways. “These exemptions are unwarranted given the substantial environmental and human rights negative impacts that can arise from projects in these areas,” they have said.• The draft notification does not require publication of information or holding of public consultation for projects labelled by the Central government as ‘involving strategic considerations’. “Regrettably, the draft notification does not provide clarification regarding the criteria for categorizing projects ‘strategic’ by the Central Government and hence could be open to excessively broad interpretations,” they have observed.• The rapporteurs have cited that a clause on “post-facto clearance” is worrisome. These are for projects that have started without obtaining the required environmental clearances or permissions. “This practice contradicts basic principles related to the environmental rule of law,” they have pointed out. “As it is our responsibility, under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, we would be grateful for the observations of the Indian government on the following matters: Please provide any additional information and/or any comment(s) you may have on the issues raised? How do the provisions of the draft notification correspond with India’s obligations under international law?” the communication stated.HT has sought a response from the Union Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on the UN communication. This copy will be updated with their response.Meanwhile on Wednesday, 500 scientists, researchers, and academics from the country’s leading institutions such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) wrote an open letter to the MoEFCC and urged it to withdraw the draft EIA, notification, 2020. They claimed that the move would threaten the country’s ecological and environmental security. “It’s going to take us a while to read through the objections we have received. A committee has been set up to study the objections that have come to us. The draft will not be finalised anytime soon,” said Geeta Menon, joint secretary, MoEFCC. The ministry had received around two lakh objections to the draft EIA notification, 2020 until August 11, which was the last date for the submission of comments and feedback..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-rapporteurs-raise-concerns-over-india-s-draft-eia-2020/story-J3zaRshwpPoQHPBNTXAYEJ.html
03-09-2020||India||Facebook bans BJP legislator amid raging controversy over hate speech bias||A new report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday claimed that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Telangana, T Raja, has been banned from Facebook, following an uproar over his comments that amount to hate speech. An earlier report from the WSJ had alleged that the social media giant had shown preferential treatment for the ruling party members by not taking action against them for posting content that violates the rules of hate speech. It also alleged that Facebook’s Public Policy executive Ankhi Das had shown support for the BJP. “We have banned Raja Singh from Facebook for violating our policy prohibiting those that promote or engage in violence and hate from having a presence on our platform. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove his account,” said a Facebook spokesperson.The Goshamahal legislator could not be reached for comment. BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya did not comment on the specific case of banning Raja from the platform, but said determination of hate speech has to be done in keeping with rules and laws of the land. “What constitutes hate speech in India will be decided by our constitutional framework and extant rules. It must be applied fairly to all irrespective of their political affiliation. Sonia Gandhi, whose divisive speech streamed live on Facebook, which led to wide-scale rioting, death, and destruction in Delhi recently, is equally guilty as is someone else. We can’t have double standards,” Malviya said. The Congress and the left parties have alleged that social media platforms show a positive bias towards the BJP and have cited the WSJ report to buttress their claim. The Congress wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zukerberg twice complaining of a bias and asking him to specify the steps being taken to investigate the charges against its India unit. The opposition party also threatened to pursue legislative and judicial actions to ensure that a foreign company does not create social disharmony in India. The Trinamool Congress also shot off a letter to Facebook alleging there is enough evidence in the public domain to substantiate the charge of Facebook’s bias towards the BJP. Earlier this week, union minister for Information and Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a strongly worded letter to Zukerberg, alleged that the platform is the “latest tool” being used to create “internal divisions and social disturbances” by vested groups. The minister said, “I have been informed that in the run-up to 2019 general elections in India, there was a concerted effort by Facebook Indian management to not just delete pages or substantially reduce to reach but also offer no records or right of appeal to affected people who are supportive of the right of the Centre ideology. I’m also aware that dozens of emails written to Facebook management received no response.” The BJP has lashed out at its critics for making allegations against it and has also insinuated that there are efforts being made by some FB employees to discredit the democratic process of the country. “Shaping public discourse can’t be the exclusive purview of the Left, who have since lost their monopoly and public support. Social media has democratised discourse and that is something they haven’t come to terms with,” Malviya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-bans-bjp-legislator-amid-raging-controversy-over-hate-speech-bias/story-thh1wpZQqg6S29nLlLPBkP.html
03-09-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh to create Udyog Bandhu-like body for farmers||Uttar Pradesh (UP) is all set to create a dedicated body, on the lines of Udyog Bandhu, to assist enterprising farmer producer organisations (FPOs) in investing in projects for post-harvest infrastructure management and community farming assets with the help of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) that the Centre had announced in August, sources revealed. Also read: UP RERA issues notice to Supertech over Supernova project in NoidaThe UP cabinet is likely to clear the FPOs policy, 2020 soon in the wake of the Central government’s decision to form 10,000 such units in the country by 2023-24. The Central government plans to make Rs 1 lakh crore AIF available to banks that will finance these projects. “The proposed policy seeks creation of an Udyog Bandhu-like dedicated agency for FPOs,” sources disclosed. Also read: Varanasi weavers go on indefinite strike over new power tariff“The new body will be headed by an official to be designated as the chief executive officer (CEO), who will be assisted by officials to be drawn from other departments such as agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, dairy development on deputation,” they added. The proposed policy also makes it mandatory for all government departments to chalk out action plans that are aligned to FPOs. “All government departments will incorporate in their action plans the measures that benefit FPOs,” sources said. “For example, the dairy development department will have to inform how many milk production committees are to be formed involving FPOs,” they added. The UP government will also coordinate with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to help FPOs get loans from banks either as working capital or to set up food processing units, cold stores, branding and packaging units, warehouses among others. Each FPO will be entitled to a maximum loan of Rs 2 crore. The FPOs can operate at district, state and national level for the product identified as per their requirement of processing, branding and marketing. One district, one product policy will get a thrust under this initiative. Devesh Chaturvedi, additional chief secretary (ACS), agriculture, UP, said that the FPOs Policy, 2020 would be sent to the state cabinet for its approval soon. “We have already made a presentation of the policy before chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Now, it will be sent for the cabinet’s approval,” he said.Chaturvedi said the policy would be a game-changer for the rural economy. An FPO, formed by a group of farm producers, is a registered body with producers as shareholders of the organisation. It deals with business activities connected to farm produce and operates for the benefit of member producers. “UP aims to set up 1,000 FPOs. Each block will have a FPO, comprising between 300 and 500 farmers,” sources said. The aspiring districts would get a priority in the formation of FPOs under the new policy, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-to-create-udyog-bandhu-like-body-for-farmers/story-TUZx8vGIwRpieD9xoVAY1K.html

In his latest video series on the Indian economy, Gandhi dubbed the 2016 demonetisation as an “attack on India’s poor, farmers, workers and small shop owners”. He claimed that the hidden agenda of demonetisation, which saw the scrapping of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, was to “clear the ground”. Also Read: India reeling under Modi-made disasters: Rahul Gandhi“Our informal sector works on cash. Small shopkeepers and workers survive on cash. The second target of demonetisation was to take out money from the informal sector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the nation that he wants a cashless India. If India goes cashless, small shopkeepers, farmers, and workers will be finished,” Gandhi said in his video series. The short videos are the new communication tools for the former Congress president to reach out to a larger audience on social media. Earlier, he had spoken on the India-China border conflict and the informal sector amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.India’s informal, or unorganised, sector absorbs about 95% of the county’s workforce and is the key to an equitable growth.

The deceleration reflected the economic impact of the 68-day Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions in the first quarter.Gandhi recounted the woes of millions of people, who suffered during demonetisation, and said that the exercise didn’t solve the black money problem. “What did the poor Indians benefit? Nothing. So who all benefitted? Only the country’s billionaires,” Gandhi alleged. “The government used your money to write off the loans of the billionaires,” he further alleged..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demonetisation-an-attack-on-india-s-poor-farmers-rahul-gandhi/story-bwZzUJEdu29oRmpVWQfSiM.html

The account which has over 2.5 million followers is the official Twitter handle for Modi’s personal website as well as the Narendra Modi mobile application.The tweets, which have since been taken down, asked the followers to donate to the PM National Relief Fund through cryptocurrency.“Yes, this account is hacked by John Wick (hckindia@tutanota.com), We have not hacked Paytm Mall,” another message had said.The hacker identified himself as ‘John Wick.’John Wick is a 2014 American action-thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad. The film John Wick stars Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Bridget Moynahan and many other Hollywood stars.The movie follows the story of an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that killed his dog and took everything from him.Part of a three series franchise, it began with the release of John Wick in 2014 followed by two sequels--John Wick: Chapter 2 in 2017, and John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum on in 2019.The hacker chose to use the code name John Wick on September 2 to hack PM Modi’s Twitter account, which happens to be Keanu Reeves’s birthday.Earlier, many hackers have taken up the name ‘Elliot Alderson’ from Mr.Robot, played by Rami Malek who plays a hacker, but John Wick isn’t shown as a cyber-security expert or a hacker in any of the movies. Happy Birthday to Mr. Wick himself, Keanu Reeves. pic.twitter.com/I9iSPmyyebOn August 30, cybersecurity firm Cyble had said hacker group ‘John Wick’ was behind a data breach at Paytm Mall, the e-commerce unit of Paytm.Paytm Mall had said it had not found any security lapses after investigating claims of a possible hack and data breach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/john-wick-how-keeanu-reeves-character-inspired-hackers-targeted-pm-modi-s-website-twitter-handle/story-2JyaLzB0A3meEPbQyy8pvM.html
03-09-2020||India||Hacked PM Modi’s Twitter account to make a point on PayTM Mall breach: Hackers||A Twitter account linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal website was purportedly compromised early on Thursday, with a series of tweets sent out by an individual or a group identifying themselves as ‘John Wick’ who later told HT that the hack was meant to clear their name in a separate breach involving a popular e-commerce website. Also Read: Twitter confirms PM Modi’s website page hacked, says ‘investigating’A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the page -- @narendramodi_in – associated with the PM’s website narendramodi.in was compromised. Shortly after 3am, several posts were made, including some urging people to donate to a cryptocurrency wallet that the hackers said was linked to the “PM National Relief Fund”. “There is no other intention to hack this account. Recently fake news of our name saying PayTM mall [was] hacked by us. So we have sent email to all news publishers in India [that] it’s not us, no one replied, so we decided to post something,” said a person who responded from the email address that was posted in one of the tweets after the hack. The tweets have since been taken down. To a query from Hindustan Times, a spokesperson from Twitter in an email said, “We’re aware of this activity and have taken steps to secure the compromised account. We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted.” An official of the Prime Minister’s Office, requesting anonymity, said the hack had nothing to do with the PM’s Twitter handle, but “only with his website”.“The website is managed by the BJP, but anyway, except to secure the password of the account, a user can’t do much with his/her own Twitter handle,” he said.Also Read: Elon Musk, Bill Gates: List of other Twitter accounts hacked before PM Modi incidentThe hackers did not respond to questions on how they carried out the hack and whether it was a compromise of the Twitter account itself, but identifiers seen on screenshots suggested the tweets were made using a tool titled “narendramodi_tweets_apps”. The hacker suggested that this was done by breaking into the website narendramodi.in, and not the Twitter account. “Yes, 100% not secured,” said this person, when asked if they exploited something called an API, which allows people to access and send out tweets without accessing an account through Twitter.com. “They have to increase the security and invest in people like us,” the hacker said.On August 30, cyber security firm Cyble reported that a hacking group identifying itself as John Wick “was able to gain unrestricted access to the entire databases” of PayTM Mall, an online retail venture of the popular payments app PayTM. PayTM later issued a statement saying it was investigating the breach and assured that user data was safe.A person aware of the preliminary analysis at Twitter, who asked not to be named, said “there was no indication or evidence at this stage of any correlation between this account compromise and the incident that took place in July”. The reference was to the breach of Twitter’s internal systems through which hackers similarly solicited payments in digital currency by making posts from the accounts of US presidential candidate Joe Biden and former US president Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk. The page @narendramodi_in is followed by 2.5 million users and is a platform for disseminating news about the PM’s activities, his statements and addresses. It was not immediately clear if any money was sent into the cryptocurrency account posted in the hacked tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hacked-pm-narendra-modi-s-twitter-account-to-prove-we-did-not-hack-paytm-mall-john-wick/story-b0bZp87CaiLnkRPnWEYMSI.html

Indrajit left home at around 10 am and reached the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guesthouse at 10.20 am. Also read: Malicious campaign by channels to defame Sushant’s family, benefit Rhea, says lawyerCBI, which has been investigating the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, has been questioning domestic helps, managers and friends of the late actor apart from Rhea and her family. CBI officials have been camping in Mumbai since August 20, 2020, and have collected all evidences from Mumbai police which had registered a case of accidental death and probed the case. In its investigation, Mumbai police had recorded statements of 56 persons. Meanwhile, the Narcotics Control Bureau continued to question two Bandra residents for alleged drug peddling and their suspected connection with the case. Apart from CBI and NCB, the Enforcement Directorate is also probing money laundering angle in connection with the late actor’s death. Rajput was found hanging at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. The post-mortem report ruled out any foul play. After a two-week quiet, a political controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart.The jurisdictional turf war spilled into the legal arena as the Supreme Court was approached to decide if CBI could investigate the matter. The issue became deeply acrimonious and divisive at multiple levels — between the Rajput and Chakraborty families, between the actors’ respective sets of fans, between the governments of the two states in question, and between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally Shiv Sena — and left the entertainment industry split vertically.The case opened up a raging debate in and about the industry, devolving into a war of words and allegations between two camps largely made up of “insiders” (with generational links to Bollywood) and “outsiders” (first-generation actors and filmmakers). Chakraborty and her supporters alleged that the Bihar government was trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-cbi-calls-rhea-s-father-for-questioning-again/story-f8uNbQ4ZsxRZHbMY7vntBL.html
03-09-2020||India||South India to witness extreme rainfall by end of this century: IIT study||The pattern of monsoon in India could undergo a major shift by the end of this century with southern India likely to register the maximum increase in extreme rainfall compared to states in central and north India, researchers from the Indian Institute of Kharagpur in West Bengal have said. The scientists have also projected that extreme rainfall may increase in the Arabian Sea and south-Asian countries, including Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia.“In the worst-case scenario of climate change, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India with the Himalayan foothills expected to receive the heaviest rain. In south India, rainfall could increase by 18.5 mm per day with the Western Ghats expected to be battered the most,” said Rajib Maity, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study.All these could be witnessed by the fag-end of this century, in the last three decades between 2071 and 2100. The researchers analysed data of Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation for close to five decades (1971 – 2017), considering the period between 1930 and 1970 as the base. The results have been published in the Scientific Reports journal brought out by the Nature publishing group. “Our analysis shows a change in the direction of the southwest monsoon winds blowing towards the east over the Indian Ocean. This directional change will intensify the already observed precipitation contrast in future between South and North India, and cause more extreme precipitation events in countries like Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia” Maity added. The researchers said that the Indian Ocean Dipole – popularly referred to as the ‘Indian Nino’ because of its similarity to its Pacific equivalent – is intensifying which could lead to increase in rainfall activity throughout India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to the difference in sea-surface temperatures in opposite parts of the Indian Ocean which, in turn, affects rainfall pattern.As the Indian monsoon plays a crucial role in agriculture, which engages nearly half of the country’s population a possible shift in the rains, as projected by the IIT study, could have a significant impact on agriculture. “South Asia, as we know, despite advances in irrigation systems, is highly dependent on the monsoons. Results of this study will be useful to the designers of water infrastructure and agricultural communities, especially in the southern parts of India and Himalayan foothills, to prompt a possible change in design criteria and agricultural practices including cropping pattern,” Virendra Tewari, director, IIT Kharagpur was quoted as saying in a statement. R Krishnan, executive director, Centre for Climate Change Studies at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said: “The possibility of such change can’t be ruled out but such projects need more research and analysis as the association between Indian Ocean Dipole and Monsoon is still not well defined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/south-india-to-witness-extreme-rainfall-by-end-of-this-century-iit-study/story-lnixLLTDv8YSJ7TJYmITsM.html

Not specifying the details of the hacking, a report by news agency Reuters said a series of tweets asking followers of the page to donate to a relief fund through cryptocurrency were put out.To a query from Hindustan Times, a spokesperson from Twitter in an email said, “We’re aware of this activity and have taken steps to secure the compromised account. We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted.”The incident comes after several Twitter accounts of prominent personalities were hacked in July this year.Hackers had in July accessed Twitter’s internal systems to hack some of the platform’s top voices including US presidential candidate Joe Biden, former US president Barack Obama, billionaire Elon Musk, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and used them to solicit digital currency.The posts, which appeared across multiple accounts in a matter of minutes, promised people they had 30 minutes to send $1,000 in bitcoin in order to be sent back twice as much in return. Some of the tweets were deleted, but re-posted again as Twitter scrambled to contain the incident.Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, said in a post that it was a tough day for them. “We all feel terrible this happened,” he tweeted. “We’re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.”Twitter said it was aware of “a security incident” and “taking steps to fix it”, but provided no more information. The hack unfolded over the course of several hours and the company disabled the ability to tweet from validated accounts, those with the official blue check mark. “You may be unable to tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident,” Twitter’s support team said in a post.Other targeted accounts include those of rapper Kanye West, reality television show star Kim Kardashian, businessman Michael Bloomberg, Uber, and a number of cryptocurrency exchanges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elon-musk-bill-gates-list-of-other-twitter-accounts-hacked-befor-pm-modi-incident/story-a76A640SX2zCOuYQu7DqDP.html
03-09-2020||India||India conducts over a million tests on three consecutive days||India recorded 1.17 million tests on Wednesday, the highest in a day so far. Over 1 million samples were tested each day for three consecutive days, according to data provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research. Delhi, which has one of the highest number of tests per million in the country, hit a record high of over 28,000 tests the same day. “A sustained number of tests over a period of days in several areas will enable us to diagnose cases early and facilitate seamless isolation and hospitalisation. This will eventually lead to a lower mortality rate,” said the health ministry. Along with the increase in testing, India has also seen a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, 81,934 cases were recorded across the country, according to the data from HT dashboard. “The increasing numbers should not worry us too much. Of course, if the government tests more people, we will find more cases. And, with the sheer population size in India, even if just 1% of the population is infected, in terms of absolute numbers, it will be huge. The good thing is, our mortality rate seems to be lower than the global average and most of the European countries and the US. We still do not know why, but it means that we should not be too worried. This does not mean people should stop following preventive practices like wearing masks, washing hands frequently and maintaining social distance,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital. A total of 1,026 deaths due to the infection were also recorded, taking the total death toll due to Covid-19 in the country to 67,478. This is the second day in a row that the country has recorded over a 1,000 deaths. The case fatality ratio (CFR)—fraction of people who die among those who tested positive—is on the decline. India’s current CFR stands at 1.75%, one of the lowest in the world. Globally, on average, 3.3% of those diagnosed with the infection have died of it. The number of recoveries has also seen an increase, with over 60,000 people with the infection recovering each day. The number of recoveries is inching closer to 3 million, over three times the active cases or those with the infection currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conducted-over-a-million-tests-on-three-consecutive-days/story-3WlPaF8TPUaGJTT1AdUPrK.html
03-09-2020||India||How Delhi is ramping up its Covid-19 testing||Delhi on Tuesday conducted 28,835 Covid-19 tests, the highest so far. The testing has been ramped up following a rise in Covid-19 cases since mid-August after Delhi became the first major region to register a sustained fall in the infections. The spike in cases prompted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to hold an emergency meeting on August 26, where it was decided that the rate of testing will be doubled from 18,000-20,000 daily to nearly 40,000 weekly.Also read: In biggest one-day jump, India records nearly 84,000 fresh Covid-19 cases, tally goes past 3.85 millionAccordingly, daily testing was increased from Monday when 24,198 tests were conducted. Here is a look at how the testing is being ramped up:1. 40,000 testing daily would be done in a “gradual manner” and is likely to be achieved in a week. “It is a multi-pronged approach under which testing is being increased at various levels,” the chief minister’s office said.2. To ramp up testing, the timings of all state-run dispensaries and seed PUHCs (Primary Urban Health Centres) have now been extended by two hours. “The Delhi government has 265 dispensaries and clinics in addition to major hospitals where Covid-19 testing is available for free. This is where we expect the testing numbers to go up mainly. All Delhi government dispensaries and seed PUHCs are now testing patients between 9 am and 2 pm – for five hours instead of three hours,” a government spokesperson said.3. On Wednesday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority decided to set up testing camps at all inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs), railway stations and also at major construction sites within a week. The idea is to test migrant workers returning to Delhi in search of jobs.A testing centre is already functioning at the Anand Vihar ISBT since August 13 to screen migrants back in the Capital, where 3,381 people had undergone rapid antigen tests till Wednesday, of which only 19 were diagnosed Covid-19.4. Lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday directed officials to simultaneously draft a policy to introduce a ‘test-on-demand’ programme, wherein people could call a helpline and fix an appointment at the nearest Covid-19 testing centre without having to wait.5. Health minister Satyendar Jain has asked his department to also explore ways through which some select mohalla clinics may be shut for general medical diagnosis and converted into temporary Covid-19 testing centres. Delhi has over 450 operational mohalla clinics as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-delhi-is-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing/story-ptKkzt8DCJ3lyFIxXkWzYN.html

Even though the workforce has started coming to the city, lockdown in states like Bihar and Jharkhand has limited the numbers,” said an MMRDA official on the condition of anonymity. At the beginning of the lockdown in March, MMRDA had around 11,000 workers at different sites. Apart from the metros, MMRDA is also implementing the 22-km sea bridge connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. While more than 5,000 workers were available at the site before lockdown, only 2,247 workers were at the site even at the end of July. For the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is executing the most complex, fully underground Metro-3 (Colaba-Seepz), around 8,100 workers are currently working at the site, instead of almost 15,000 workers who were present before the lockdown. In June-July, only 5,600 workers were available at the site, sources said. With a shortage in labour force, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thakeray in June had also asked state agencies to employ bhoomiputras or “sons of soil” in Metro and other infrastructure works to keep the work going and not depend on labourers who had left the state.On Wednesday, Maharashtra recorded its highest single-day spike of 17,433 infections (first in excess of 17,000), taking the count up to 825,739. The number of active cases in the state has also crossed the 200,00-mark with a case load of 201,703 cases. The state also crossed the 25,000-mark for Covid-19 casualties after 292 deaths were reported. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,622 cases, much higher than the daily number of cases seen in August, which ranged between 900 and 1,400. Its tally reached 148,569.

This count is more than the number of coronavirus disease cases in fifth worst-affected country Peru.According to World Health Organisation (WHO), Peru’s count of Covid-19 cases stands at 6,52,037. And next in the list is Russia with 10,05,000. And Maharashtra is not far behind the million mark.Maharashtra’s previous highest one-day count was 16,867 cases, reported on August 29.The reason for high caseload is the rate at which the infection is spreading in Maharashtra. It took 51 days for Maharashtra to reach the two lakh active cases mark; the number had crossed 1 lakh on July 12, 126 days from the first reported infection on March 9.The number of cases in Maharashtra is also nearly 22 per cent of India’s total Covid-19 tally. The state took the lead since the early days of the spread of the infection in the country and has maintained it since then.The state also reported 292 fresh deaths, 34 of them in Mumbai city, pushing up the fatality count to 25,195, the state health department said.Mumbai reported 1,622 new coronavirus cases and 34 deaths, taking its tally to 1,48,569 and the toll to 7,727. Pune city reported 1,706 fresh cases along with 28 deaths, pushing up the infection count to 1,04,555 and the toll to 2,607, the health department added.Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 3.5 per cent, the health department said. This is slightly less than Gujarat, which has the highest CFR in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-count-more-than-fifth-worst-affected-country-peru/story-SiMktQvNExeEbQ3zlUQk3O.html
03-09-2020||India||Build mangrove cells across all coastal states: Environment ministry panel||The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances has recommended the formation of a mangrove cell across all coastal states, similar to Maharashtra, for better protection of mangroves.Mangroves are salt-tolerant plants, trees, shrubs or ground fern of tropical and subtropical intertidal regions of the world. While being a breeding ground for a variety of marine animals, they also act as a natural buffer against storm surges, cyclones and sea level rise.Considering the need for their conservation, a dedicated cell under the forest department can help safeguard mangrove forest patches and appraise planned projects around them better through site verification on affected mangrove trees, the EAC said, adding, “In Maharashtra, a mangrove conservation cell administered by the forest department is effectively functioning and a similar model can be adopted by other coastal state governments.”A formal recommendation was sent to the Union environment ministry last week.“The committee desired that the matter can be looked into by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and in the interest of mangrove conservation, which plays a major role specially during extreme events in coastal areas, the coastal state governments or union territories’ administration may be requested to develop such dedicated mangrove conservation efforts,” read the minutes.This is a well-established model of the Maharashtra government where there is a recognised institutional framework constituted in protecting mangrove cover, said Deepak Apte, chairman, EAC (CRZ).“We have been highlighting this since our very first meeting and the Centre should take this forward in light of coastal and marine conservation. The Maharashtra model has appropriate accountability with the cell headed by a high ranking forest officer further reporting to the chief wildlife warden, and governing council state secretaries,” said Apte.The EAC made its latest recommendation while assessing the feasibility of a Rs 2286 crore six-lane highway project in Kerala (Talapady to Nileshwaram section of NH-66) that involved the loss of 266 mangrove trees.According to the Forest Survey of India, the country has 4,975 sq. km of mangrove cover. West Bengal (majorly Sunderbans) has maximum cover 2,112 sq km followed by Gujarat 1,177 sq km, Andaman and Nicobar Islands 616 sq km, Andhra Pradesh 404 sq km, Maharashtra 320 sq km, and Odisha 251 sq km, among major regions with mangrove forests.Maharashtra’s mangrove cell was constituted in 2012 based on an order passed by the Bombay high court in 2005 banning mangrove destruction across the state and construction within 50 m of trees. Over eight years, the cell recruited staff for on-ground surveillance. It now has 70 forest guards across six Konkan districts, 13 round officers, and a special team engaged in tackling mangrove destruction across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane called the Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit (MMCU) with 108 guards alone and a team of senior forest officers. Additionally, there is one range forest officer across all other districts including Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.The cell is responsible for the declaration and protection of the 16.9 sq km Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary and the protection of the Malvan Marine Sanctuary. It recently proposed the 2,011 sq km Angria Bank, a submerged plateau 105 km (56.7 nautical miles) off Malvan in the Sindhudurg, as a protected area, which was approved by the State Board of Wildlife last month. The state constituted the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation in 2015, an autonomous body that assists the mangrove cell in coastal marine conservation through research projects with mangrove cell chief as its executive director. Over five years, the foundation has undertaken numerous research projects to improve the livelihood of coastal communities as well as increase awareness and capacity building through marine biodiversity research along the Konkan coast.According to mangrove cell officials, the foundation is registered as a society where funds are allocated to offset environmental implications by project proponents as one of the conditions during wildlife clearance (mostly 2% of total project cost) issued by the National Board of Wildlife.“This money is sent to fixed deposits and the foundation uses the interest to fund its activities thereby not depending on government funds at all,” a forest official said.Apte added, “This is an effective mechanism wherein instead of companies spending money on their own (where effectiveness cannot be monitored), funds are allocated either for mangrove conservation or marine research through annual plans developed by this foundation. Thus, funds to offset environmental impacts for projects are channelised through a well-established structure governed ultimately by the state for coastal and climatic resilience.”Over the eight years since the inception of the cell and five years since the foundation was constituted, Maharashtra recorded the highest increase in mangrove cover (37%) across India between 2015 (222 sq km) and 2017 (304 sq km), and second highest increase in mangrove cover in India (by another 16 sq km) between 2017 and 2019. FIRST STATE TO DECLARE ITS OWN MANGROVE STATE TREEMaharashtra is set to become the first coastal state to declare a state mangrove tree species - Sonneratia alba or mangrove apple - based on a proposal by the mangrove cell, which was approved by the State Board of Wildlife during a meeting last month.The state is likely to publish the formal government resolution on the decision later this month. Known as White Chippi in Marathi, Sonneratia alba grow up to five feet with white flowers having a pink base, and bear distinct green apples as fruits used to make pickles. They often grow on newly formed mudflats playing an important role in combating land erosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/build-mangrove-cells-across-all-coastal-states-environment-ministry-panel/story-rWQhXgqZQW2ED5WcrnveNI.html
03-09-2020||India||Shorter hours, new rules to mark this monsoon session of Parliament||The upcoming monsoon session of Parliament, which will be held between September 14 and October 1 amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, will have many firsts.Also read: Written questions get nod at monsoon sessionThese include shorter hours, doing away with a set format of proceedings and many other such improvisations to ensure the safety of the Members of Parliament (MPs), the staff and media persons, who will cover the daily functioning of the session. The last parliamentary session was cut short on March 25 following the viral outbreak and the day the nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced for the next 68 days to contain the spread of the pandemic.Usually, though the monsoon session begins in July, it had to be pushed back to mid-September this year owing to the contagion. This session will see the House work for a shorter duration on a daily basis. However, there will be no break on weekends. Normally, after winding down business with the Private Member’s Bills on Friday, both the Houses used to reconvene on Monday after a two-day weekend break. As per the revised schedule, the Rajya Sabha (RS) will meet between 9 am and 1 pm and the Lok Sabha (LS) between 3 pm and 7 pm. On September 14, on the first day of the session, the LS proceedings will take place only in the first half of the day. The government has decided to do away with the Question Hour, an hour-long slot that is given to lawmakers to raise questions about issues related to various ministries. The Union ministries will provide only written replies to questions put forth by the MPs instead of ministers giving replies on the floor of the House.  While the Opposition parties have objected to this decision and dubbed it as the “murder of democracy”, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has defended the move on the grounds that the restrictions imposed by the pandemic have led to shorter work hours. The BJP has also pointed out that the Question Hour has been dispensed with in several state assemblies, including Andhra Pradesh (AP), Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra, because of the pandemic. Coverage of parliamentary proceedings by the media, too, will be restricted. Only a select number of media personnel will be allowed access to the gallery to record the daily proceedings. RS Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday held discussions with Union secretaries of Home Affairs, Health & Family Welfare, Defence Research and director-general, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on ensuring safety of MPs. Naidu suggested that MPs should undergo Covid-19 tests in their own interest. MPs will be allowed to wear masks inside the House and a frequent tab will be kept on ventillation to keep the viral infection at bay. Covid-19 awareness video clips will also be shown to MPs. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) authorities will provide a host of sanitisation services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shorter-hours-new-rules-to-mark-this-monsoon-session-of-parliament/story-5tC6pchHicrASp0KeXwrBO.html

03-09-2020||India||Twitter confirms PM Modi’s website page hacked, says ‘investigating’||Microblogging site Twitter on Thursday confirmed that a page which is linked to an account of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal website was hacked. While it did not specify the details of the hacking, a report by news agency Reuters said a series of tweets asking followers of the page to donate to a relief fund through cryptocurrency were put out. To a query from Hindustan Times, a spokesperson from Twitter in an email said, “We’re aware of this activity and have taken steps to secure the compromised account. We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted.” Questions to the Prime Minister’s Office about the alleged hacking did not elicit a response till the time of filing this copy. Persons aware of the details, however, said there is no indication or evidence at this stage of any correlation between this account compromise and the incident that took place in July, where hackers after accessing Twitter’s internal systems solicited digital currency from the accounts of U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden and former US president Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk. Screenshots of the alleged hacking, circulating on Twitter, claimed that the breach was carried out by a hacker claiming to be John Wick. The page @narendramodi_in is followed by 2.5 million users and is a platform for disseminating news about the PM’s activities, his statements and addresses. News report about the hacking generated a buzz on social media; with some users expressing concerns about the lax security features of social media sites while others posted memes about the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-confirms-pm-modi-s-website-page-hacked/story-5BsSts5UVF4bqHNeklBUYO.html
03-09-2020||India||The times when justice Arun Mishra made news||Supreme Court justice Arun Mishra retired from office on Wednesday, a day before he turned 65. Justice Mishra served as chief justice of the Rajasthan and Calcutta high courts before his elevation to the Supreme Court on July 7, 2014. His six-year stint in the apex court has been marked by a few controversies, including that created by one of his last verdicts , in the Prashant Bhushan contempt matter. Here are some other key examples.Spat in open courtThis happened on January 8, 2016 though it largely went unnoticed.Justice Mishra was sitting as a puisne judge ( a term used for a judge who is not the presiding judge on the bench) with justice MY Eqbal, who was heading the bench, when they had a disagreement. It stemmed from a hearing of a case argued by senior counsel Salman Khurshid. The case had come up for admission and justice Eqbal wanted to issue notice, but justice Mishra wanted to dismiss it. When things were at an impasse, justice Eqbal said he had been presiding over the bench for three years. Justice Mishra responded by saying he was not going to back off since he had equal rights as a puisne judge. Lawyers and visitors present in the court room watched the episode play out, one of the rare instances when judges engaged in a verbal exchange in open court.Medical college corruption caseTwo petitions had been filed, seeking the formation of a special investigation team headed by a retired Chief Justice of India to investigate an alleged conspiracy and payment of bribes for procuring a favourable order in a matter pending before the Supreme Court. A three-judge bench of justices RK Agrawal, Arun Mishra and AM Khanwilkar dismissed both petitions within two weeks. One filed by Supreme Court advocate Kamini Jaiswal was dismissed on November 14, 2017 and the other by NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) on December 1, 2017.The listing of the two cases stirred a hornet’s nest. The first petition filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation was initially listed before justice AK Sikri. However another petition was filed and mentioned before the second senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, justice Jasti Chelameswar, since then Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra was sitting on a Constitution bench. Justice Chelameswar listed that petition before himself the same day on which it was mentioned. When the case was heard, the bench headed by justice Chelameswar went on to pass an order that the matter should be heard by a bench of the five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. In a strange turn of events, CJI Dipak Misra constituted a five-judge bench the same day, and overturned justice Chelameswar’s order, saying only the CJI had the powers to list cases. Subsequently, both petitions were listed before the bench comprising justice Mishra, who dismissed the pleas. The bench imposed costs of Rs 25 lakh on CJAR.Case seeking a probe into death of judge LoyaThings reached boiling point in the Supreme Court in January 2018 because of the listing of the case surrounding the death of Judge BH Loya, who had been hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case. Current home minister Amit Shah was one of the persons accused in the case at the time Justice Loya was hearing it although he was subsequently discharged.Allegations were raised nearly three years later that the death of judge Loya was shrouded in mystery. A petition was filed in the Bombay high court seeking a probe into the death.But before the Bombay high court could pass any order, another public interest litigation was filed before the Supreme Court in January 2018 by a Maharashtra-based journalist, Bandhuraj Sambhaji Lone, mentioned before then chief justice Dipak Misra, and listed before a bench headed by justice Mishra. Related cases pending before other high courts were also transferred to the Supreme Court.On the day the matter was due to be heard by justice Mishra, four senior judges of the Supreme Court held the historic press conference alleging bias by the CJI in listing cases affecting the ruling dispensation. When questioned whether listing of the Loya case was the trigger for the press conference, justice Ranjan Gogoi, who was one of the four judges, replied in the affirmative.Justice Mishra eventually recused himself from the case, which was heard by another bench. But controversy stoked by the press conference and the manner of listing of cases hasn’t quite died down.Land Acquisition Act A Constitution bench headed by justice Mishra ruled in March 2020 that land acquisition proceedings initiated under an earlier law, the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (1894 Act), will not lapse even if compensation was not deposited by the government in court after owners declined to accept the money, as long the compensation has been tendered into the government treasury.Once the compensation amount is so tendered, the state’s obligation is complete with respect to the payment of compensation, a five-judge Constitution Bench held in a judgment, which was a blow to landowners who had declined to accept compensation, and benefited private companies on whose behalf the government sought to acquire land.In 2014, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising justices RM Lodha, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph had held that even if the award of compensation has been made under the 1894 act, unless the compensation is paid to the landowners or deposited before the court, the land acquisition will lapse. Deposit of the compensation amount in the treasury will not be sufficient to discharge the obligation, the bench had ruled.The three-judge bench headed by justice Mishra, in February 2018, delivered a judgment in which it took an opposite view.This 2018 judgment created a controversy because it held the 2014 ruling to be per incuriam, that is, a judgment delivered ignoring the law. Under established legal principles, if a bench disagrees with the judgment of another bench of equal strength, it should be referred to a larger bench, which was not the case in this matter.Immediately after the judgment was delivered, similar matters came up before a bench comprising justices Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph who were on the bench that delivered the 2014 ruling. They took a strong objection to the 2018 judgment. Justice Dipak Misra, who was then the CJI, formed a Constitution bench to settle the issue.Because the Constitution bench was headed by justice Mishra, there were calls for his recusal which he did not heed.Two benches, same facts, different viewsA bench by headed by justice Mishra, in May 2019, declined to entertain a plea by former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar, who was seeking protection from arrest in a case related to the Saradha Chit fund fraud. Kumar approached the Supreme Court directly because the courts in West Bengal were shut due to a lawyers’ strike. The bench headed by justice Mishra noted that the courts in West Bengal had started functioning and Kumar was free to approach any lower forum in West Bengal. “it is open to the petitioner to approach the concerned Court, as the Courts in the State of West Bengal are functioning,” the court noted in its order.This would have passed off as another routine order but for another ruling passed the same day by another bench headed by justice MR Shah. That bench was also hearing a plea seeking protection from arrest filed by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Praveen Agrawal who, like Kumar, also pointed out that the courts in West Bengal were not functional due to the lawyers’ strike.“It is very unfortunate that the strike is going on in all the courts in the state of West Bengal and due to which, ultimate sufferers are the litigants. By such a strike, the entire judicial function cannot be made paralysed and the litigants cannot be allowed to be suffered,” the bench said while granting Agrawal relief.Thus, two benches of the Supreme Court took diametrically opposite stances on the same day on the factual position of the functioning of courts in West Bengal.CJI sexual harassment caseFour news portals published reports about allegations of sexual harassment by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi. It was alleged that the victim, a Supreme Court employee, was terminated from service and her husband, a policeman, was suspended from the force after she raised allegations against the top judge.But what happened after the news was published caused great consternation among the legal fraternity. A three-judge bench headed CJI Gogoi listed a case titled “In Re Matter of Great Public Importance touching upon the independence of judiciary” in open court on a Saturday, rebutted the allegations and vilified the victim.Justice Gogoi sat on a bench in a case in which he was allegedly involved. One of the two other judges on the bench was justice Mishra, who threw his weight behind Gogoi and expressed his disapproval of the allegations.However, when the order in that case was uploaded on the Supreme Court website that evening, justice Gogoi’s name was not listed. Instead, it showed the names of only two other judges as being part of the bench – justice Mishra and justice Sanjiv Khanna.Later, justice Mishra heard the same case sitting in another combination and called for a report from a retired Supreme Court judge, justice AK Patnaik, on allegations that there had been concerted efforts to target the Supreme Court. Justice Patnaik submitted the report in October 2019, but the case has not been heard about since then.PM Modi a ‘versatile genius’In February 2020, at an international judicial conference organised by the top court, justice Mishra heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Prime Minister is a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally. India is a responsible member of international community under the stewardship of internationally acclaimed visionary prime minister, Shri Narendra Modi,” he said.The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which is the body of lawyers practising before the Supreme Court, condemned Mishra’s statements which it said reflected poorly on the independence of the top court and the judiciary. “The SCBA believes that any such statement reflects poorly on independence of judiciary and so calls upon Hon’ble judges not to make such statements in future nor show any proximity or closeness to the Executive including high functionaries,” the SCBA resolution read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-times-when-justice-arun-mishra-made-news/story-umPLZl5haT0SB7Ud9yEIfK.html
03-09-2020||India||Varanasi weavers go on indefinite strike over new power tariff||Demanding restoration of the monthly flat rate or fixed rate electricity bill, the weavers of the city went on an indefinite strike from Tuesday. The strike call was given by Uttar Pradesh Bunkar Mahasabha and Varanasi-based organisation Biradarana Tanzim. They claimed that the powerloom weavers were being charged as per electricity meters since January 2020 after the government withdrew the ‘flat rate’ subsidy. There are about 5 lakh weavers associated with weaving of Banarasi sarees, stoles and other clothes in the city and they claim the government move was burning a hole in their pocket. The groups have announced that all sorts of weaving would remain suspended between September 1 and 15. The effect of the strike was visible everywhere with powerlooms in all localities remaining closed. The weavers also formed a human chain and decided to stage demonstrations from Friday. Top members of the Tanzim, Maqbool Hasan and Ishrat Usmani said a strategy would be evolved to intensify the stir further if the government does not accept the demands. Weavers from across the state will collectively apply to get their electricity lines disconnected. Social worker and master weaver Mateen Kaifee said: “Under the flat rate scheme, Rs 145 each was fixed for every powerloom. But now weavers are made to pay per unit electricity every month. For example, if a powerloom consumes 300 units, the weaver will have to pay a bill for all 300 units.” In the new arrangement, he added, on consumption of 120 units by a half horsepower motor operated powerloom and one horsepower motor operated powerloom, the weaver will get monthly subsidy of Rs 350 and Rs 240, respectively. “The government should make it clear whether the weavers would get subsidy in their accounts or the amount will be adjusted at the time of deposition of the bill,” Kaifee said. He further said if the government thinks that Rs 145 monthly bill for each powerloom was very little, it may increase it to Rs 300 per month per powerloom. Echoing the sentiment, another weaver Saif Ansari said, “We need electricity at subsidised rates in order to survive and preserve the art of weaving which we have been doing for generations. If the flat rate system is not restored many powerlooms in the city would fall silent.” Opposition Congress has extended support to the cause and said they will take up the issue with the government. “Weaving is an art and weavers are the keeper of this art. The government should restore the flat rate in order to save this art. If weavers don’t get electricity on flat rate, many weavers may quit the field and look for other options to earn their livelihood. This will be a great loss,” former Congress MLA Ajay Rai said. He said the government representatives should speak to the weavers to assess the situation. He said on the invitation of weavers, Congress state unit president Ajay Singh Lallu had recently called on the weavers and assured them of raising their issue with the authorities and extended them all possible support. Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited, director commerce, OP Dixit, confirmed that the metered electricity bill was launched in January following government order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varanasi-weavers-go-on-indefinite-strike-over-new-power-tariff/story-1D4vrjQBCT4CeHS7uukwnO.html

Authorities suspect hoarding could also be one of the reasons behind the spiralling of prices. “We have formed four teams which would fan out in four directions and visit some of the biggest wholesale and retail markets in the city to check the prices of vegetables. The teams are expected to start visiting the markets from around 7:30 am on Thursday. These would be surprise visits,” said a senior official of the enforcement branch. The prices of vegetables have almost doubled over the past few days. This is pinching the pockets of the residents who are already at a loss with the pandemic. “The prices of most of the vegetables have shot up. For some, like potatoes, the price has almost doubled. Last year around this time, potatoes used to sell at Rs 14 – Rs 15 per kilo. No it is selling at Rs 27 – Rs 28 per kilo. A few days ago it had shot up to Rs 30 per kilo,” said Rabindranath Koley, general secretary of the West Bengal Forum of Traders’ Organisation and a member of the government taskforce. He said that while on one hand cyclone Amphan and the heavy rains during the monsoon have damaged several crops that have led to price rise; alleged hoarding of potatoes in cold storages have also led to a spike in prices.

We would be primarily checking the prices of potatoes as they have gone up drastically over the past few days. There would be four members in each team,” said a member of the team which would be visiting some of the biggest wholesale and retail markets in north and central Kolkata.

But what can we do if the price at which we purchase the items is high? The government should check the prices with middlemen who bring the items to the cities and the wholesale markets,” said Nitai Das, a vegetable seller in a market in east Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surprise-inspections-in-kolkata-to-check-vegetable-prices-going-through-the-roof/story-Op8qvzFNeidjhZeom6GutN.html
03-09-2020||India||India conducts over 1.17 lakh Covid-19 testing in last 24 hours: Govt||India has conducted more than 1.17 lakh Covid-19 testing in the last 24 hours, keeping in line with its ‘test, track, treat’ strategy to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the Union health ministry said on Thursday. The country crossed the milestone of conducting one million tests daily on August 21.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said, “Over 11,70,000 tests have been done in last 24 hours. High levels of testing sustained over a period of time in widespread areas enable to diagnose cases early and facilitate seamless isolation and hospitalisation. It eventually leads to low mortality rate.”As experts have suggested that aggressive testing is crucial to control the outbreak, states and Union territories are progressively increasing their testing capacity.The health ministry said in a statement Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are among others contributing the maximum to the overall number of test. “These three states account for nearly 34% of the total testing,” the ministry said.India on Wednesday recorded 78,357 new cases of the coronavirus disease which pushed the nationwide tally to 3,769,524, according to Union health ministry dashboard.The number of active cases reached 8,01,282, and those discharged from hospitals stood at 29,01,908 - a gap of 21,00,626. The death toll reached 66,333 after 1,045 people died due to the disease in the last 24 hours.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative 4,33,24,834 samples have been tested up to August 31, with 10,16,920 of them being tested on Monday.India’s daily testing capacity has crossed 10 lakh and the tests per million too have seen a sharp increase, reaching 31,394, the health ministry highlighted. Twenty-two states and union territories have tests per million better than the national average, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conducts-over-1-17-lakh-covid-19-testing-in-last-24-hours-govt/story-iX49C15N4U3TuMNW0ZPEyL.html
03-09-2020||India||Odisha to request Centre to grant classical status to Odissi music||The Odisha government on Wednesday passed a resolution requesting the Centre to accord classical status to Odissi music, calling it different from Hindustani and Carnatic music.The Odisha Heritage Cabinet in its second meeting today adopted a slew of seven proposals, including the demand to give classical music status to Odissi like Hindustani and Carnatic. Minister for tourism, Odia Literature, language & culture, Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi said while Odissi dance was recognised by Centre as a classical dance in 1964 and Odia language as a classical language in 2014, the music form is yet to find the same recognition. Incidentally, Odisha had recognised Odissi as a classical form of music in 2008. “Odissi music, like Odissi dance, is not only very ancient but has its own characteristic features for being reckoned as a classical form. It has its own tradition, texts, ragas, talas, gita and classical style of recital. As Odissi dance has got classical status, the Odissi music should also get the same tag as the dance is based on music,” said Panigrahi.State culture department officials said Odissi music has a rich legacy dating back to 2nd century BC when king Kharvela, the ruler of Kalinga, patronised Odissi music and dance. There is historical evidence in the form of musical instruments, singing and dancing postures of damsels in the Ranigumpha Cave in Khandagiri and Udayagiri at Bhubaneswar.“Odissi music has codified grammar. It also has a distinctive rendition style. While tabla and mridangam are the musical instruments of Hindustani and Carnatic music, respectively, mardal is the musical instrument of Odissi. It has also its own text like Gita Govinda of Sri Jayadeva, Sangita Sara of Hari Nayak, Gita Prakäsh of Krushna Das Badajena Mohapatra, Sangitarnava Chandrika of Nilakantha, Sangita Muktabali of Harichandana, Natya Manorama of Raghunath Rath and Sangita Narayan of Purusottam Mishra and many others. Odissi music gives great importance to the lyric where words are sung without fragmentation or distortion. All songs have specific ‘raagas’ and ;taalas’,” said an official.The classical status to Odissi music would enable setting up a centre of excellence in Bhubaneswar for promotion of the music.The Heritage Cabinet also gave its approval to a proposal for holistic development of the birthplace of Pandit Gopabandhu Dash at Suando in Puri district through a project involving a budget of approximately Rs 11 crore. It also approved development of Odisha State Museum and Ananda Bhawan Museum into virtual entities with digitization. The cabinet resolution also increased the amounts for the Atibadi Jagannath Das Samman, Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja Samman, Dharmapada Samman, and Byasakabi Fakir Mohan Samman be increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.Similarly, the amounts for awards to the various academies shall be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh and the amount of felicitations of various Academies would be increased to Rs 1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-request-centre-to-grant-classical-status-to-odissi-music/story-55o04hfIvKv1CBrpXoKBUM.html
03-09-2020||India||2 MP officials cleared sale of grain unfit for humans at govt shops, sacked||The state government in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday night terminated the services of two officers of Food and Civil Supplies department, suspended another officer while FIRs were filed with police against eight millers in two districts on the ground of a central government’s report that found that rice distributed through public distributed system (PDS) in these districts was unfit for human consumption and meant to be suitable for livestock and poultry, as per government officials. Earlier in the day, demanding an apology from the BJP government, leader Opposition in the state assembly and former chief minister Kamal Nath called the distribution of such rice among people ‘a criminal act against humanity’. An official communique from the state government released on Wednesday night said, “The services of quality controllers responsible for ensuring quality of rice in Balaghat and Mandla districts have been terminated, while the district manager of Balaghat has been suspended in the case. Action is being taken against the concerned millers by registering FIR against them.” Principal secretary Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, said, “So far FIRs have been lodged against eight millers. If we identify more millers responsible for distribution of such rice we will lodge FIRs against them too.” The state government’s official communique said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has given strict instructions against the guilty while taking the issue seriously of supply of poor quality rice in some places in Balaghat and Mandla districts. He clearly warned that those involved in irregularities and black marketing of ration, fertilizer etc. will not be spared and stern action will be taken by registering a criminal case against them.” As per the official information, as many as 51 joint teams of Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Food & Civil Supplies Corporation, constituted to test the quality of rice, took 1021 samples of rice from both the districts. As a result of preliminary investigation, 57 of these samples were found to be sub-standard. As per the provision of the State Custom Milling Policy, sub-standard rice given by the millers after custom milling will be returned and rice of standard quality will be obtained from him, said the government in a statement. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta released a letter dated August 21 of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution System written to the principal secretary of Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, Madhya Pradesh which stated, “..in total 32 samples (31 from depots and one from ration shop) were collected. The samples were analysed in the NABL accredited Central Grain Analysis Laboratory (CGAL), Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi….” “The analysis report of all the total 32 samples were found to be not just below the rejection limit as per the uniform specifications issued by the ministry but also beyond the PFA standards as per FSSAI. The stocks are found to be unfit for human consumption and in the categories of Feed-I which is meant to be suitable for livestock feed (such as goat, horse, sheep), Feed-II which is suitable for cattle feed and Feed-III which is suitable for poultry feed as per the guidelines for the issuance/disposal of the stocks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-mp-officials-cleared-sale-of-grain-unfit-for-humans-at-govt-shops-sacked/story-HO5p6w8TljgAS2UWtb6RCL.html

So to our friends in Beijing, I would ask them to follow their commitment to resolve these things through peaceful means and dialogue,” Stilwell said at a press briefing here. The Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs also reiterated Secretary Pompeo’s remarks that the United States hopes for a peaceful resolution to the border standoff between India and China.The US diplomat’s remark comes after the Indian Army thwarted Chinese Army’s attempt on the night of August 29 and 30 to transgress into areas near the southern bank of Pangong Tso.Indian Army said that on the night of August 29/30, PLA troops violated the consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo.On a question over the border stand-off between India and China, Stilwell added: “For the conflict in the Himalayas, like all things, especially related to the PRC’s differences of opinion with its neighbours, is we advise them to return to dialogue, resolve these things peacefully without coercion, use of force.”Further talking about China’s engagement in other areas, he said: “...many conflicts that are going on in China’s periphery right now. You mentioned Tibet. Xinjiang - very concerned still about what they’re doing there. Hong Kong activities, South China Sea - I could go on and on.”Earlier in the press briefing, Pompeo had slammed the Chinese Communist Party for engaging in a clear and intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbours.“From the Taiwan Strait to the Himalayas and beyond, the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a clear and intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbours. It is also evident in the South China Sea,” he said.“We are hoping for a peaceful resolution of the situation on the India-China border,” he added.India and China have been engaged in a standoff since April-May over the transgressions by the Chinese Army in multiple areas including Finger area, Galwan Valley, Hot springs and Kongrung Nala.Negotiations between the two sides have been going on for the last three months, including five Lieutenant General-level talks but have failed to yield any results, so far.

03-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, HT’s health editor Sanchita Sharma wrote, citing unreleased health ministry data that she sourced, that men account for 69% of all Covid-19 deaths in India, and people over the age of 50 for 76.7%. The data isn’t surprising — the same trend has been seen around the world. Older people who contract the coronavirus disease are more likely to die. How much more likely? According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those between the ages of 50 and 64 are 30 times more likely to die from the disease than those between the ages of 18 and 29; those between the ages of 65 and 74, 90 times; those between the ages of 75 and 84, 220 times; and those over the age of 85, 630 times more likely. FATALITIES AMONG YOUNGER POPULATIONS While only 8.2% of the people who succumbed to the disease in the US are under the age of 54, almost one in four of the dead in India are under the age of 50. It isn’t clear why, but the prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes in younger people could be one reason; as could access to health care. Cleary, this area merits further investigation. Similar data for India isn’t available, but there is a very significant difference between the US and India in terms of the mortality of younger people infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19. Only 8.2% of the people who succumbed to the disease in the US (till August 26) were under the age of 54 (data wasn’t immediately available for those under the age of 50, although mathematics indicates that it should be lower, making the difference with India even more significant). The Indian data is till August 22. THE GENDER DIFFERENCE There is also a difference between India and the US in terms of the gender of those who died from Covid-19. In the US, till August 26, 54% of those who died from the disease were men. The corresponding proportion in India, till August 22, was 69%. Again, there is no obvious reason for this and it merits more researchIt isn’t clear why almost one in four of the dead in India (23.4%) were under the age of 50. And almost 10% were under the age of 40. The prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes in younger people could be one reason. As could access to health care. This is clearly an area that merits further investigation, although a survey of scientific literature on Covid suggests that the trend seen in India is no different from that in other developing countries. On the flip side, some experts believe that India’s younger population can explain its low case fatality rate. There is also a difference between India and the US in terms of the gender of those who died from Covid-19. In the US, till August 26, data from CDC shows that 54% of those who died from the disease were men. The corresponding proportion in India (till August 22), was 69%. A 15 percentage point difference is significant by any measure. Again, there is no obvious reason for this — except that men in India may have had more chance of being exposed to the virus than women. This, too, is an area that merits more research. As an aside, the health ministry’s coronavirus dashboard should be updated in real-time with the ages and the gender of the dead. Recent studies in the UK, Spain, Italy, and Geneva in Switzerland, reported in Nature, claim that the Infection Fatality Rate (or proportion of those dead to those presumably infected) is near-zero for those under the age of 50. The numbers cited in this column with reference to India are all case fatality rates — only a nationwide sero survey (blood test for antibodies) can shed light on the number of those infected, although similar surveys, across a few states, do show that a significant proportion of the population has been infected (see back flap).While on the matter of fatality rates, all countries have managed to progressively reduce them as health care workers figure out more therapies that work. On Wednesday, an analysis of seven studies that was published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, confirmed that steroids help reduce fatalities by a third when administered to severely ill Covid-19 patients. The analysis covered steroids such as dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and methylprednisolone. A previous installment of this column reported one of the studies covered by a June analysis (a UK one that showed dexamethasone to be effective in the treatment of Covid-19). As that column pointed out, steroids are inexpensive and widely available in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-03I6EhqBOe05LbxyePvhTI.html

The Bilasipara sub-division court had ordered the release of the Bangladeshi nationals on Saturday following a request by the Bangladesh government that led to the police dropping pending cases against them. The 25 Bangladeshi nationals were sent back to their country through the Changrabandha checkpost in Cooch Behar district in West Bengal, a district official informed. Twenty six Bangaldeshi nationals were held by Dhubri police in May while they were trying to go to the neighbouring country. Assam shares a 267 km boundary with Bangladesh of which 90 km falls in Dhubri. The Bangladeshi nationals were carrying passports and visas. Few of their visas had expired during the lockdown. They were travelling from Jorhat district with lockdown passes issued for migrant labourers. They had told police that they entered India via the Changrabandha border with valid documents. But though they had T1 visas meant for tourists they were engaged in fishing activities in Jorhat. The 26 were booked under provisions of the Foreigners Amendment Act and Passport Act and lodged in Dhubri district jail while court proceedings were initiated. One of the 26, Bokul Miya (57) died in Dhubri civil hospital on July 1 after he complained of uneasiness.

The agency has identified more than 942 bank accounts and 554 shell companies used by Jain for moving the money illegally. It has also traced at least 337 foreign bank accounts, largely based in Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore where huge transfers have been made over the years. As of now, ED has recovered documents pertaining to 970 beneficiaries in India including some top corporate honchos who used Jain’s network for laundering their dirty money worth around Rs 18,000 crore apart from a forex trading firm whose executives have already been summoned by the agency. During searches at his two premises in Rohini and Vikaspuri in Delhi in 2018, the agency had recovered documents pertaining to Rs 96,000 crore and Rs 11,800 crore worth hawala transactions respectively which were being analysed for last few years. The ED had also recovered digital keys for several foreign accounts from Jain’s premises which suggested that his network was vast and he used telegraphic transfers apart from ‘hawala’ for transferring the money for the beneficiaries, said one of the officials cited above. He also used tour and travel firms for the money transfers abroad. “He is probably one of the biggest hawala dealers in the world having links in Europe, US, Africa, Middle-East, India and Pakistan,” said an officer. 61-year old Naresh Kumar Jain, a native of Panipat (Haryana), had first fled India in 1995 and remained in Dubai till May 2009. He started a company – M/s Kumar Trading CO in Dubai and started a trading commodity business. Over a period of time he got into Hawala transactions and would deliver any amount of money to any person in India, China or any other country across the globe. He invested either directly or through nominees and entities and made huge profits through transactions which were later on termed as ‘wash’ or unreal transactions by the US government, according to the second officer cited above. “Jain used the technique of ‘layering’- a money laundering technique that seeks to disguise the origin of funds. His network of money laundering through ‘Hawala’ transactions spread to Europe and even to African countries,” said this officer. His name first cropped up in money laundering in Europe in 2004 when Italian investigators busted a network of Albanian narcotics traffickers that distributed heroin and cocaine throughout Italy and other European countries and then used a network of money remitters in Italy, UAE and Pakistan, to launder their drug proceeds, said the second officer. “They utilized ‘Hawala transactions’- the informal network of money remitting business commonly used in the middle east to transfer money – to move their narcotic proceeds out of Italy and into a financial network based in UAE, among other places. Jain controlled some or all of these hawala,” said third officer. He was first arrested by Dubai police on February 20, 2007 along with 39 other associates. He jumped bail and escaped to India via Nepal in May 2009. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) first arrested him in India in December 2009 on the basis of which ED began investigating him for money laundering. Following NCB’s arrest in 2009, he remained in jail for over a year before coming out and since then he has been indulging in massive money laundering again, said the third officer. According to information shared by UK’s Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Dubai authorities, Italy and other countries with Indian counterparts over the years, Jain has a huge network in countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Turkey, Indonesia, Korea, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Canada and Afghanistan as well.

03-09-2020||India||GST revenue loss: Karnataka decides to choose first option offered by Centre||Karnataka has indicated its preference for the first option offered by the Centre to offset GST revenue losses under which it is expected to get Rs 18,289 crore including Rs 6965 crore from cess collected. The rest Rs 11,324 crore, it would be able to borrow through a special window from RBI with the full burden of principal and interest being borne of the cess fund to be collected in future.The decision was taken after chief minister BS Yediyurappa met senior officials of the state finance department according to a statement from his office. Officials said that the decision had been taken after weighing all pros and cons in the large interests of the state. “If Option 2 had been taken while Karnataka would have got Rs 25,508 crore, the interest burden would have to be borne by us. So Option 1 was the better choice,” finance department officials added. Both the main opposition parties Congress and JDS had asked the state government to reject both options and ask the Centre to borrow from RBI and make good the GST shortfall promised to the state.After the 41st GST council meeting, the Centre had offered two choices to all states to plug the shortfall in revenue which had arisen because of an ‘Act of God’ (ongoing Covid-19 pandemic). Under option 1, states were allowed to borrow from RBI an amount of Rs 97,000 crore in which both principal and interest payment would happen through cess collection. In option 2, the state could borrow collectively Rs 2.35 lakh crore but interest would have to be borne by them.Several states including Kerala, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Punjab have also asked the Centre to borrow directly from RBI and make good its commitment to ensure their GST share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-loss-karnataka-decides-to-choose-first-option-offered-by-centre/story-0r2Msb6yEW56B5KMX7mHMO.html

03-09-2020||India||Imran Khan project to get 2 Indians sanctioned for terror fails, UNSC throws it out||The UN Security Council on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s efforts to get two Indian nationals designated as terrorists under the 1267 sanctions committee process after Islamabad failed to produce evidence to back up its allegations. The move by Pakistan was widely perceived as retaliation for India’s success last year in getting Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar listed as a global terrorist by the 1267 committee, which focuses on the designation of terrorists linked to al-Qaeda, Taliban and their affiliates. Pakistan had launched an initiative to designate a total of four Indians as terrorists in 2019, telling the UN Security Council that they were allegedly involved in state-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan further alleged the men were part of an Afghanistan-based group that helped organise terror attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. The efforts to designate two of the Indians – identified by Pakistan as Venumadhav Dongara and Ajoy Mistry – were rejected by the Security Council in June and July, largely because of efforts by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The effort to designate two other Indians – identified by Islamabad as Gobinda Patnaik and Angara Appaji – were initially blocked through a “technical hold” by the US, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium as they wanted Pakistan to provide evidence to back its allegations, the people said. During consultations behind closed doors on Wednesday, when the term of the hold ended, Pakistan’s effort to designate the remaining two Indians was rejected by the Security Council as it failed to furnish any proof, the people added. India’s permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, tweeted: “Pakistan’s blatant attempt to politicise 1267 special procedure on terrorism by giving it a religious colour, has been thwarted by UN Security Council. We thank all those Council members who have blocked Pakistan’s designs.” Pakistan has repeatedly sought to rake up what it claims is India’s alleged role in fomenting terrorism on its soil at various UN bodies in recent months, but without any takers for its allegations. It even made a false claim that its envoy to the UN had delivered a statement at a UN Security Council meet on terrorism but this was later proved to be false. Some of the Indians that Pakistan had sought to designate as terrorists had been working in Afghanistan in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-fails-in-efforts-to-designate-two-indians-as-terrorists-at-unsc/story-QdAkirh2QTFgB6DjtygMSJ.html
03-09-2020||India||Why PUBG is wildly popular in India||Where will all the players go? The mobile and lite versions of the wildly popular multiplayer battle game PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s BattleGrounds) was among 118 Chinese apps banned by the IT ministry on Wednesday, part of a crackdown that began in June amid rising tensions with China in Ladakh. This ban probably has the most people upset since the action against TikTok in the first round of app bans. PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite together have an estimated 50 million active users in the country, with around 13 million clocking in every day Incidentally, the non-mobile version of the game, PUBG PC, is Korean-made and Korean-owned, but is now the least-played version in India. The two mobile versions were developed and are owned by the Chinese company Tencent Games. Multiple things made PUBG popular in the country — it’s easy to stream, you can voice chat with friends while you play, and the game is designed to get the adrenaline pumping and give you a rush. It managed to achieve the right blend of realism and gaming powers. India is the biggest user market for the game. But the game also carries a bulk of the Indian e-sports industry revenue. For a couple of years now, youngsters have been dropping out of school and college to play the game in professional leagues and tournaments, earning tens of thousands a month in prize money, sponsorships, endorsement fees and revenue from their fan followings online.  Some of these youngsters are represented by talent management agencies like Ebullient Gaming India and FNATIC India, dedicated to professional gamers — most of whom specialise in PUBG Mobile or Lite. Aman Garg, 22, cofounder of Ebullient, says half his revenue comes from PUBG streamers — that’s when people tune in to YouTube to watch other people play this game live, enjoy banter and live commentary, see how they will make it past various levels and who will beat whom. Money comes from sponsorships and viewer donations. “This ban is certainly going to be a setback to the Indian esports industry as a whole,” Garg said on Wednesday. “Pubg has done its job of instating the Gaming culture at large in India, now it’s time to see which game will take it’s place.” He estimates that will take about eight months to a year to fill the PUBG-shaped void.  Just this June, the Indian team Orange Rock won the PMPL (PUBG Mobile Pro League) South Asia, and came in second at the world league. “This was the first time an Indian team had won at that level,” says Garg. Season 2 of the PMPL South Asia round was set to take place on September 11 and 20 Indian teams were to participate. With the tournament organised by Tencent, it is not clear now what the status of India’s team will be. Top pro players like Scout (Tanmay Singh) and Soul Mortal (Naman Mathur) have said online that they are not worried. Like Garg, they believe this move will only make room for other games to grow. “Right now Free Fire and COD (Call of Duty) Mobile are blowing up,” says Garg. People have gotten accustomed to the PUBG format. Other games have different characters and different maps, but the viewers, gamers and streamers — they’ll all adapt.” It was, after all, just a game?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-pubg-is-wildly-popular-in-india/story-Lk3eub8ZeoYxhyFEHcGfYI.html
03-09-2020||India||Hawala kingpin arrested by ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday arrested Naresh Kumar Jain, an underworld money mover wanted in at least six countries including the US, the UK, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and the UAE, for allegedly facilitating illegal transfers worth over Rs 1 lakh crore over the past five-six years for several businessmen, drug mafia and other criminal networks, people familiar with the development said. The agency has identified more than 942 bank accounts and 554 shell companies used by Jain for moving the money illegally.

03-09-2020||India||NIA files charges against IS-linked group’s members for planning to provoke riots||New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against five operatives of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), including a Kashmiri couple Jahanzaib Sami and Hina Bashir Beigh, for allegedly conspiring to use the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests to instigate Muslims against the Indian government and planning to provoke riots. The agency said the couple was conspiring to create unrest during anti-CAA protests by coining seditious slogans, making graffiti at public places, and highlighting them through social and international media. The couple, along with others, also conducted reconnaissance at prominent places in Maharashtra that were frequented by foreigners, and attempted to make an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) for carrying out mass killings, the agency said in a statement. Jahanzaib Sami (36) and his wife Hina Bashir Beigh (39), both from Srinagar, were the first ones to be arrested in the case in March this year by Delhi Police’s Special Cell from Okhla, after which probe was handed over to NIA. Hyderabad based Abdullah Basith, a key ISIS handler in India, and two others from Pune - Sadiya Anwar Shaikh (20) and Nabeel Siddick Khatri (27) -- were subsequently taken into custody by the central agency. “Investigation has revealed that Sami, a B.Tech from Ferozpur, Punjab, got radicalised and inclined towards ISIS/ISKP by reading about it on the internet. He established contact with ISIS handler Huzaifa-al-Bakistani and latter’s father-in-law viz. Abu Usman-Al-Kashmiri (Head of Indian affairs of ISKP) in 2017 on a secure messaging platform,” NIA Spokesperson Sonia Narang said in a statement.“Huzaifa-al-Bakistani further introduced him to Abdullah Basith, another ISIS operative, who is already in judicial custody at Tihar jail in connection with another NIA case (ISIS Abu Dhabi Module 2018 case),” Narang said.“Hina Bashir, who had her higher education from Pune, also got radicalized since 2014-15 by reading ISIS-related content on social media. Sami and Bashir got married in 2017 as both supported the ideology of ISIS,” she added. The agency said Sami, Hina Bashir, Abdullah Basith and Shaikh were continuously in contact with ISIS operatives based in Khorasan and Syria. The NIA said Sami and Basith prepared a magazine titled ‘Voice of Hind’ inciting Muslims against non-Muslims and exhorting them to rise against the government of India, and that along with Bashir and Shaikh, were also provoking gullible young people to participate in anti-CAA actively. If the protests failed to provoke people, they were planning on setting government buildings and public property on fire, it added.The agency last month arrested another person, Abdur Rehman alias Dr Brave from Bengaluru, in the case. The agency said he was in contact with Sami as part of the conspiracy to promote the activities of ISIS/ISKP and had also visited ISIS medical camp in Syria in 2014.The couple’s lawyer rejected the charges. “The agency is making a mountain out of a molehill. There is no evidence in the case. It’s all a bundle of lies.” MS Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-files-charges-against-is-linked-group-s-members-for-planning-to-provoke-riots/story-b49OogGpbZoWr72Q8YnxtN.html

The facility should be in strict compliance with the protocols established by the ICMR and the NABL. One representative of state authorities of the airport will also be present in the waiting lounge.The guidelines state the airports should provide the option to the passengers to do online booking of the RT-PCR test through respective websites or other appropriate online platforms. A proper escort has to be ensured for the passenger from a help desk to the waiting lounge.Such on-arrival testing facilities can be extended to other passengers too, the order said.At present, scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 22. However, special international flights have been operating under government’s Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rt-pcr-tests-to-begin-soon-for-international-passengers-on-arrival-at-airports/story-8d3VCnF659P4yJy5aD6rBP.html
03-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: Written questions get nod||Unstarred questions, or written questions that ministers need to reply to, will be allowed during the monsoon session of Parliament, but question hour will remain cancelled, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.The decision has been taken at a time when Opposition parties have strongly protested against the move to not schedule question hour, calling the decision an attempt by the government to avoid being questioned, and describing it as an attempt to curb their rights.The unstarred questions will have to be submitted to the secretariat and answers will be provided on the day the question is listed (it will also be uploaded on the website), the people cited above said.owever, oral or starred questions will not be allowed -- in the interests of time, and to ensure that the number of people in Parliament is kept low (when a question from a ministry is listed to be asked as a starred one, key officials of the ministry are expected to be in Parliament). The session may also not allow private member bills—through which MPs seek policy or legislative changes—and the Zero Hour during which MPs raise current issues, might be limited to just half an hour. These changes have been necessitated by the fact that the session is happening against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to surge across India. The budget session of Parliament ended on March 23. The monsoon session, which usually starts around mid-July, is now scheduled to start on September 14 and end on October 1.“I have suggested to the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman to keep the duration of the zero hour at 30 minutes. They will take the final decision. Govt is ready to have discussions on every issue. We have also requested the Speaker to take unstarred questions,” said parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.This is the first time in the recent history of Parliament when the Opposition has questioned the process of a session apart from the usual political objections to the government policies.Question Hour, which normally lasts 60 minutes provides the only window for guaranteed answers from ministers and help MPs hold the government accountable in Parliament.Joshi defended the move to scrap Question Hour and claimed that almost all parties agreed to this arrangement. “Opposition parties are raising questions regarding question hour and zero hour. Arjun Ram Meghwal, V Muraleedharan & I spoke to every party regarding this and except for the TMC’s Derek O’Brien, everyone agreed [to scrap question hour],” he said.Earlier in the day, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien tweeted: “MPs required to submit Qs for Question Hour in Parliament 15 days in advance. Session starts 14 Sept. So Q Hour cancelled? Oppn MPs lose right to Q govt. A first since 1950? Parliament overall working hours remain same so why cancel Q Hour? Pandemic excuse to murder democracy.”Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted: “I said four months ago that strongmen leaders would use the excuse of the pandemic to stifle democracy&dissent. The notification for the delayed Parliament session blandly announces there will be no Question Hour. How can this be justified in the name of keeping us safe?”Biju Janata Dal’s Bhartruhari Mahtab maintained that “Question Hour is the individual right of elected members to make the government accountable. So if there is no Question Hour, individual members’ rights are curtailed. Some methodology should be found. Discussion under rule 193 that doesn’t entail a voting is good but sometimes the minister have not replied to such a debate.”The BJP hit back by claiming that the uproar over the suspension of Question Hour is “hypocrisy” by members of the opposition.A BJP functionary said with Parliament convening only for 4 hours daily, it is natural there is a paucity of time and Question Hour has been cancelled but that unstarred questions will be allowed.The BJP also defended the move by stating that State assemblies have functioned after March without question hour in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.“BJP is in opposition in most of these states and it did not raise a hue and cry there,” the functionary added on condition of anonymity.Frequent disruptions during the session were also flagged by the BJP, which cited that in the last eight sessions, out of the 162 hours allotted for Question Hour, only 59 hours were used and more than 102 hours were lost due to disruptions and adjournment.MPs may also not be allowed to bring private member bills. A Lok Sabha circular said, “In view of the request of the government owing to prevailing extraordinary situation due to Covid-19, the Speaker has directed that no day be fixed for transaction of Private Members’ business during the Session.”“Question hour is when governments are held accountable. it is part of the basic structure of parliamentary democracy. And the argument that Question Hour means presence of many officials in Parliament also incorrect as officials are not needed if ministers come prepared I never depended on officials”, said Congress leader and former minister Jairam Ramesh. DMK’s Kanimoshi tweeted, “BJP govt’s decision to suspend the Question Hour for an entire session conveys just one message – “Even elected representatives have no right to question the government”.Experts stressed on the importance of Question Hour.“The simple act of MPs asking questions of the government is the cornerstone of government accountability to parliament. Combined with zero hour it is an aspect of parliamentary functioning where MPs participation is not based on party politics. Questions be it starred or unstarred also open up data about the working and thinking of the government. Since the beginning of this Lok Sabha, approximately 15000 have been asked and answered,” said Chakshu Roy, head of PRS Legislative Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/written-questions-get-nod/story-1dN6pwGMjVCLebtqfaUo4K.html
03-09-2020||India||Questions raised over Char Dham road construction||The Union environment ministry has sought responses from the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and the Uttarakhand government about alleged violations of the forest conservation act during the construction of Char Dham road in Uttarakhand.The all-weather road is 889km long and will connect Hindu pilgrimage sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunothri and Gangotri in the Himalayas. Uttrakhand-based ecologist Ravi Chopra, the chairman of a Supreme Court-constituted high-powered committee (HPC), submitted a detailed report on August 13 to union environment ministry specifying alleged violations that occurred during the construction of the project.The issue of environmental violations in Char Dham project is also being heard by the SC, after it took suo moto cognizance of Ravi Chopra committee’s findings. The matter will be heard again on September 8.The Chopra report says that the project carried out extensive works, including felling of thousands of trees without a final forest clearance from the environment ministry. Project developer agencies started constructions only based on conditional Stage 1 forest clearance, and a working order was not issued for most stretches, the report said. Temporary work permissions issued for some stretches had lapsed long ago, it added.“The entire construction work in the above-mentioned projects, including cutting of thousands of trees therefore, started illegally and in gross violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980,” the report said.During committee said it found that wrong information related to project location was submitted to seek forest clearances. For many projects that fall under the eco-sensitive zone, instead of saying “yes”, the project proponent has said “no”, which is misleading and incorrect according to the report submitted by Chopra.The Chopra report has referred to letters sent by the Uttarakhand government to the project authorities which acknowledge that tree felling has taken place without compliance to norms. When contacted, a senior environment ministry official said that there is a “provision of taking a working permission from the forest department that is valid for a year for linear projects”.“But we have received complaints about various violations including dumping of muck in the rivers and forests. We have sought MoRTH and Uttarakhand government’s response. The matter is in court also,” he said, asking not to be named.Officials at MoRTH confirmed that they had received the enquiry from the environment ministry for which responses are being prepared, but they declined to comment saying the matter is sub judice.There was a controversy surrounding the HPC constituted last year by the top court when two separate reports were submitted to the environment ministry in July. Five members including Chopra suggested that “irreversible damage” was caused to the Himalayan ecology due to the project, while 21 other committee members submitted a separate report that said ecological damage can be “minimised”.“The evidence of legal workarounds for this projects have been in question ever since it was proposed. The accidents and damage during the construction of the project without studies and necessary precautions have already exposed the risks to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem across the entire stretch of this highway. It is not just law but environmental ethics in question,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/questions-raised-over-char-dham-road-construction/story-fatEhLynwk7jCRGsJYr1bN.html

One layout is for the entire Ram Janmabhoomi campus (open area) and the other is for the proposed Ram temple (covered area).The approval paves the way for the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to start construction work of the temple. The trust had filed its request for approvals on Saturday.Ram Temple PlanCOVERED AREA 3.67% of total campus GROUND FLOOR Temple: 2,628.50 sq metre Corridor: 7,343.50 sq metre Total : 9,972 sq metreFIRST FLOOR Temple: 1,850.70 sq metreSECOND FLOOR Temple: 1,056.60 sq metreTotal covered area: 12,879 sq metre FEE TO BE PAIDDevelopment charge: Rs 1,79,45,477 Approval fee: Rs 1,50,000 Construction approval fee: Rs 84,400 Inspection fee: Rs 29,73,307 TOTAL: Rs 2,11,33,184The first layout pertains to an area of 2,74,110 sq metre (approximately 67.33 acre) of the entire Ram Janmabhoomi campus and the second layout is of 12,879 sq metre for the Ram temple, which will be the focal point of the campus. Neeraj Shukla, vice-chairman of ADA, had to convene a board meeting to approve the layouts. The vice-chairman himself has the authority to approve layouts only up to 25 acres. For any construction above this 25-acre limit, the vice-chairman has to convene a board meeting. “The estimated construction cost of the Ram temple (covered area) was calculated on the basis of the public work department’s (PWD) schedule.

03-09-2020||India||Banned: PUBG, 117 China-linked apps||India on Wednesday banned 118 China-linked mobile apps, including widely popular game PUBG, two months after similar curbs on 59 apps, mostly Chinese, and a month after banning 47 more linked to that country, citing concerns over them being “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity… defence of India, security of state and public order” amid a months-long standoff with its northern neighbour at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).In late June, India banned dozens of mobile apps, including Bytedance’s TikTok, Alibaba’s UC Browser and Tencent’s WeChat over what it said were national security concerns. It banned some more in late July. India has accused Chinese troops of resorting to “provocative action” even as military commanders were holding talks on Monday to ease fresh tensions near Pangong Lake. The latest development follows the two sides trading charges of trespassing the LAC on the southern bank of Pangong Lake since the weekend, complicating the de-escalation process that has stalled at key friction points. On Wednesday, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) said the apps – including the mobile version of PUBG and other services provided by China internet giant Tencent – appeared to steal and surreptitiously transmit users’ data in an “unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India”.“The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,” it added.Tencent did not comment, while the Chinese embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government said it was invoking its power under section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009.A MEITY official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the ban was implemented under the “emergency provisions of the IT Act”. “We got report of the violations yesterday (Tuesday) and immediately blocked the applications,” the official added. The official also said that the same process that was followed for the previous app bans will be followed again. “They will be given a chance to put forth a representation on their behalf.”The banned versions of PUBG included PUBG Mobile Lite, a smaller version of the app, as well as PUBG Mobile Nordic Map: Livik, a recent game played on a Nordic terrain. The full version of the game PlayerUnknown’s BattleGrounds, popularly called PUBG, saw its user numbers rise sharply in India amid a lockdown brought on by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. With over 175 million downloads, India accounts for about a quarter of PUBG Mobile’s lifetime installs though revenues from the country are still minuscule, according to data from research firm Sensor Tower. In the game, 100 players battle with assault weapons until there is only one left standing.Other apps that have been banned include games, online payment services, dating sites and software to edit images. The list also includes China’s search engine leader Baidu Inc, and online payments giant Ant Group Co’s platform Alipay.PUBG was developed by a South Korean company for desktop PCs, but the mobile version that has become popular around the world was developed by Tencent. The list of the banned apps did not mention the PC version of the game.India has launched efforts to impose economic costs on China in the wake of continued Chinese aggression at the LAC in India’s signalling to China that this aggression cannot coexist with preferential economic ties, officials previously told HT.Apart from the banning of mobile apps, decisions have been made by various government departments to cancel contracts with Chinese firms. There have also been reports of imports from China getting stuck at ports, and in April, India tightened foreign direct investment inflows from neighbouring countries — with an eye on China — by requiring them to go through a more rigorous government approval process.Border tensions between India and China flared up in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 — the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the LAC in 45 years. The clash resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.Wednesday’s was the third round of app bans after India decided to take down TikTok and 58 other platforms on June 29. The second round of curbs came on July 23, when the government decided to take down mirror applications that were functioning despite the ban. The applications were banned for being a “threat to the sovereignty of the country and national security”. MEITY minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had called the bans on the applications a “digital strike against China”.On Wednesday, the government said the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre of the Union home ministry has also sent an exhaustive recommendation for blocking these “malicious apps”. “Likewise, there have been similar bipartisan concerns, flagged by various public representatives, both outside and inside the Parliament of India. There has been a strong chorus in the public space to take strict action against apps that harm India’s sovereignty as well as the privacy of our citizens,” it added.“On the basis of these and upon receiving of recent credible inputs that information posted, permissions sought, functionality embedded as well as data harvesting practices of above stated apps raise serious concerns that these apps collect and share data in surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to security of the state,” the statement said.“This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace.” Ramanjit Singh Chima, lawyer and Asia Pacific Policy Director at Access Now, an international digital rights group, said: “The wording of the current release uses verbatim text from the July order, even though there are a range of different apps and services named in this notification. It appears that the government has not clearly applied its mind when preparing this order, which makes it more likely that this web content blocking action is not legal under Indian law and the Constitution. The evidence referred to in the press release by the Ministry of Home Affairs and CERT-IN should also be made available. Indians deserve steps that directly serve clear cybersecurity interests and respect the rule of law and fundamental rights; it is this commitment that makes Indian democracy strong and different from those countries that disregard internationally protected rights.”Apar Gupta of the Internet Freedom Foundation said: “It seems that banning applications under various sections has now become the norm. Under the IT Act, emergency provisions have become an acceptable measure. It undermines the idea of graded penalties. It is increasingly becoming the option to address breaches of data privacy by the government. It has also become a tendency to issue press releases and not banning orders.”Cyber security experts have said that software providers based in China inherently pose a surveillance risk. “Every Chinese tech company has to comply with the Chinese cybersecurity law which allows the Chinese government to have access to the data these companies collect – this is part of the nationwide mass surveillance systems that are in place in China,” Victor Gevers, head of research at the Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), who discovered such databases in 2019, told HT on July 1.(With inputs from Bloomberg and AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banned-pubg-117-china-linked-apps/story-U4r2xuotpCeGfnZjX7VmyI.html
03-09-2020||India||Parliament panel grills FB officials||The parliamentary standing committee on information and technology held an over three-hour long meeting with Facebook officials and experts on Wednesday, with its members discussing recent allegations of political bias against the social media company before the meeting was adjourned with no conclusions. Facebook officials were summoned following a string of media reports in the last three weeks that showed that a key executive from its India operations team intervened to protect a politician linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from action over hate speech.“In response to overwhelming media interest in the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology that just adjourned, this is all I can say: we met for some three & a half hours & unanimously agreed to resume the discussion later, (including) with (representatives) of Facebook,” panel chair and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said in a tweet.The meeting was attended by Facebook India managing director and vice president Ajit Mohan. The committee decided to summon the social media company again. The panel, according to a member who asked not to be named, lapses on September 11 and Facebook has been asked to appear in front of the panel that will be reconstituted. According to a member present at the meeting, some members raised objections over why no one from Facebook’s policy team appeared as a witness. The recent allegations surround Facebook India’s public policy head Ankhi Das, who, according to a report by Wall Street Journal on August 14, intervened to stop a ban against BJP’s Telangana MP Raja Singh. “They have taken cognisance of so many violations, why has no action been taken?” said this member, asking not to be named. Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil reiterated his party’s stand seeking a joint parliamentary committee investigation into the allegations, while BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked for reports of what exactly transpired during the Cambridge Analytica controversy, this person added. The Cambridge Analytica controversy refers to the misuse of Facebook in the run up to the US presidential election in 2016 to glean political preferences of Americans and target them with misinformation, a concerted operation that involved Russia-linked individuals and is believed to have influenced the outcome of the polls. The Congress met with Cambridge Analytica before the 2019 parliamentary election but says it did not hire it. According to a second member, questions were raised at the meeting about Facebook’s neutrality and the backdrop of people working with the social media magnate. When asked about Das, who is at the centre of the raging controversy for alleged violation of Facebook’s hate speech policy, the company said it would respond in writing, this member added. Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday that the Opposition was pushing for a criminal inquiry into the company’s conduct and a termination of its contracts with the government. Electronics and information technology minster Ravi Shankar Prasad also wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, alleging company executives were biased against people who believed in BJP’s ideology. In the meeting, the members asked about Facebook’s ties with governmental organisations and the Election Commission, and its executive was asked why the company functions as a publisher in the United States but as an ‘intermediary’ in India. “Facebook asserted that it was maintaining neutrality and global standards,” said the second member quoted above. “They also said that political background had no bearing on their decisions.” “We thank the Honourable Parliamentary Committee for their time. We remain committed to be an open and transparent platform, and to giving people voice and allowing them to express themselves freely,” Facebook said in a statement after the meeting.Experts said the scope of the problem is larger than the current exercise can address. “We need the government to take a stand on content moderation,” said Jyoti Panday, researcher with Internet Governance Project, Georgia Institute of Technology. “This is only policy theatre, a PR exercise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-panel-grills-fb-officials/story-qjRhNmay6SeI5cyCVoBELL.html
03-09-2020||India||Metro to open in phases for asymptomatic users||Metro services across India , except in Maharashtra, will resume in phases from September 7 with all becoming operational by September 12, according to the ministry for housing and urban affairs -- a move that will significantly increase public transport capacity across India, and especially Delhi, but also one that comes against the backdrop of a surge in cases in the country. The ministry issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the resumption of Metro services under the so-called Unlock 4 guidelines. Metro services have been nonoperational since late March when India declared a lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. There are 15 Metro networks across India, and in Delhi, about 2.7 million passengers used the network daily before the pandemic. However, the trains will not stop at stations in containment zones, which will remain closed. It wasn’t immediately clear how many stations will be affected by this.  “Daily hours of operations may be staggered initially, which needs to be increased gradually with resumption of full revenue service by September 12. Frequency of trains to be regulated to avoid passenger crowding at stations and in trains,” the SOP said. It added that the air-conditioning in stations and trains would be tweaked to increase the circulation of fresh air. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will reopen its doors to passengers in three stages. In the first stage, the Metro will function for truncated periods — from 7am to 11am, and then from 4pm to 8pm. In the second stage, on September 11, this hours will be expanded slightly while from the following day, the network will return to its regular hours.Delhi Metro officials said upon restart, operations will be monitored in real-time, and staff will be tasked with ensuring distancing and minimising crowds. Trains will be allowed to skip a station if crowds are deemed too large and no further passengers will be allowed entry into a station if officials consider it to have hit peak capacity, a senior official said, asking not to be named.The government of Maharashtra has decided not to resume operations of the Metro in September. “Hence, Mumbai Line-1 and Maharashtra Metro operations shall commence from October or as state Government may decide further,” Union housing minister Hardeep Puri said at a press conference. Maharashtra is India’s worst affected state in terms of Covid-19 cases and deaths. Till Tuesday evening, the state had seen 825,739 cases and 25,195 deaths. Based on the guidelines issued by the Centre, the metro corporations of Delhi, Noida, Chennai, Kochi, Bangalore, Mumbai Line-1, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Maha Metro (Nagpur), Kolkata, Gujarat and UP Metro (Lucknow) have prepared their SOPs, the ministry said.The SOPs have been finalised following discussions with the managing directors of 15 Metro rail corporations on Tuesday and with the approval by the Union home ministry.Under its Unlock 4 plan, issued on Saturday, the home ministry allowed Metro services in a phased manner from September 7. In order to ensure social distancing, stations and train coaches will carry signages and labels. Passengers will have to wear masks at all times, as should staff of the Metros. Metro rail corporations may make arrangements for supply of masks on payment basis to the persons arriving without mask, the guidelines said. In most states, masks are mandatory. “There will be marking across stations for maintaining social distancing and even inside the trains on the seats. Passengers must ensure that they adhere to it; we are monitoring each and every location through video cameras through central control rooms and if at any station these norms are violated or crowding takes place the instructions are that metro trains will not stop at those stations. We have even added this in the SOP,” housing affairs secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said.Puri said the government may have to review the arrangements if resumption of services leads to crowding at stations and passengers are found violating social distancing norms. “Emphasis has to be on review and caution. We are very clear in our minds that this opening up in a graded and calibrated manner will need to be reviewed. If we find that the resumption of operations is not resulting in social distancing either at the metro stations or if there is crowding or trains are getting congested…we might have no option but to review all these arrangements. So I am appealing through the media to all the consumers that while we welcome the resumption of metro services, ...the buzz word is ‘caution’ and ‘care’…,” he added. The guidelines also said only asymptomatic people will be allowed to travel after thermal screening at entry. “Symptomatic persons should be advised to go to nearby Covid Care Centre/Hospital for testing/medical attention. Use of Aarogya Setu App will be encouraged,” the SOP said.The guidelines said that the use of Smart Cards and cashless/online transactions will be encouraged but tokens can also be used with proper sanitisation.“Adequate time at stations will be provided to enable smooth boarding/deboarding ensuring social distancing. Metro rail corporations may also resort to skipping stations to ensure proper social distancing,” Puri said.Provision of sanitisers will be made at entry into the stations for use by passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-to-open-in-phases-for-asymptomatic-users/story-gBYzjBZRkXLdtqvu12XMMK.html
03-09-2020||India||Antisocial media: Why Facebook’s missteps threaten internet and society||“It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered this apology to members of the US Congress in March, 2018 when he was called to explain how a third party, Cambridge Analytica, used its service to carry out psychometric analysis of Americans in a way that possibly influenced the 2016 US presidential election.This was not the first time Zuckerberg or his company said sorry (see box) - each time only to be followed by a new abuse of service that Facebook failed to stop. These have, in the CEO’s own words from the 2018 hearing, involved “fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well [threats from] developers and data privacy [breaches]”.In India, some of these harms have manifested as abusive troll armies, individuals inciting rioting and political support groups spreading coordinated misinformation to swing votes. In its latest controversy, the company has been accused of not acting against Bharatiya Janata Party politicians for violation of content policies, a decision purportedly influenced by a senior executive seen as being close to the party. Facebook and BJP have denied the allegations, and the ruling party has instead blamed the company of censoring its supporters. The company did not respond to requests for details on how it moderates content or what its stand is on such policies. “Across the board, we’ve watched as the company (Facebook) does whatever is in its profit interest, as it selectively chooses when to censor or otherwise subvert content and, conversely, when to do nothing about it even if it goes viral, so long as there is adequate commercial justification to take no action. This unwavering adherence to whatever policy serves the business model subjugates the democratic interest and must be corrected,” said Dipayan Ghosh, a former White House official who is currently the co-director of Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.The controversies around Facebook now reflect the complicated regulatory riddle: what are the rules of online speech? Who should write them? Who should enforces them? These questions, according to top cyberlaw and tech policy experts, will determine the future of the internet and the politics, culture and commerce it has come to shape since the turn of the millennium. This is because at present, Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram), Twitter, YouTube and such sites are not liable for illegal or hateful content – only the user posting it is. In India, under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, they need to act when notified by authorities in order to keep this immunity. “As businesses subject to government regulation, and in receipt of the de facto or de jure privilege of inflicting harm on private citizens without legal responsibility, the platform companies must constantly negotiate with political power. The resulting contradiction lies at the heart of the mess that presently existing social media are making of politics and society everywhere,” said Mishi Choudhary, legal director of Software Freedom Law Centre.OPAQUE RULESTo understand this contradiction fully, it is important to look at the rights and obligations involved. In almost all democratic nations, online speech enjoys the same privileges as offline speech. Social media websites, which primarily follow American law but account for some local legal obligations, follow a system of self-regulation.This is in part because it is not feasible to determine jurisdiction and apply filters on global communications, but is mostly to protect freedom of expression and civil liberties from state surveillance and censorship. This results in policies and guidelines they spell out for users. “They specify certain rules for their platforms and take down content either through algorithms – which Facebook claims is responsible for 95% of its takedowns – or when they are notified of complaints from users,” said Apar Gupta, executive director at the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), which has called on the Indian government to push for an international human rights audit of how Facebook combats hate speech.In addition to automated programs that look for keywords or observe how a post is reported, Facebook also deploys thousands of contractors who manually review flagged content for moderations.It is this prerogative that Facebook, and similarly popular content websites such as YouTube, have been accused of wielding unfairly, excessively or inadequately. “If you don’t follow your own policies consistently, it will lead to situations like these where Facebook has been accused of political bias,” added Gupta.NOT ENOUGH The problem becomes acute when it involves illegal content posted by people in position of prominence.In June, Facebook refused to hide or take down a post by US President Donald Trump purportedly inciting shooting as protests over the death of George Floyd escalated. Twitter hid the tweet. Zuckerberg said his company decided to let it remain. “...I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open,” he wrote.“I think it illustrates that content moderation involves 1 million impossible decisions, probably daily. And the more rules you have, the more difficult it is to enforce them consistently. Facebook is inevitably going to make a ton of mistakes, both in censoring too much and in not censoring enough,” said David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), one of the world’s oldest digital rights advocacy groups.Greene added that the decision to let the Trump post stay makes Facebook seem naive about how influential its platform is in the public debate, and how hard it is to undo harmful statements that spread widely through it.IN EXCESSWhile comments by prominent people are immediately scrutinised, Facebook’s algorithms and contracted moderators play a complicated role in censorship. In 2018, the OFFLINE-ONLINE project by EFF and Visualizing Impact detailed several instances where Facebook censored marginalised communities. These included takedowns of posts and images discussing racial injustice in the US, a ban on a native American tribe leader for his name seeming to be as fake, deletion of the Facebook pages of seven Palestinian journalists (which Facebook later admitted was a mistake) and account restrictions on multiple Rohingya activists.Experts see these as examples of the differential approach the companies may have to censorship, depending on the privilege of the voice involved. “They have risen above the law because they are fictionally supposed never to do what government constantly forces them to do. (But) they comply, and intensively moderate all content that passes through their hands. They do this in order to maintain their indispensable privilege of civil impunity,” said SLFC’s Choudhary.The company’s free speech defence is further overshadowed by the role its algorithms have played in amplifying content that are a threat to civil liberties.UK-based counter-extremist organisation Institute of Strategic Dialogue said in mid-August that its investigation found Facebook’s algorithm “actively promotes” Holocaust denial content. That typing “holocaust” in the Facebook search function itself, the report said, brought up suggestions for denial pages, which in turn recommended links to publishers that sell such literature.FUNDAMENTAL RETHINK?The problem of how to tackle online speech harks back to similar debates around offline speech. “It brings us back to the debate over what is problematic speech. Legal speech can vary across countries. Speech also involves a lot of context, often local, which could determine its acceptability,” said Jyoti Panday, researcher at the Internet Governance Project. The answer to this regulation is unlikely to rest with governments. “Something needs to change but more regulation will only help censorship by proxy for states,” said SFLC’s Choudhary. “Hard problems are hard and there are no silver bullets or one solution. The moment calls for a serious rethink not just new rules but public’s participation in making, interpreting and enforcing them, improved social policy based on a better understanding of the internet,” she added. The position was echoed by Greene of EFF. “History teaches us that when government takes over such practices, government uses it to censor its opponents. We do urge platforms to conduct their curation within a human rights framing, namely, the Santa Clara Principles,” he said. The Santa Clara principles are a set of guidelines that seek disclosure from social media companies of how many posts are flagged, what action is taken, the need for adequate notice before a takedown and clear avenues of appeals for users. “Companies need to be more transparent with these policies; knowing exactly how moderation takes place is crucial to find ways to work on it, improve it,” added Panday.Harvard Kennedy School’s Ghosh said updates to Section 230 of the American Communication Decency Act, “which is the norm of online speech regulation”, could be updated to address some of the issues. “Particularly, [the] carve-outs from the sweeping liability shields it affords internet platforms,” he said. It was the Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by one of EFF’s founders, American political activist John Perry Barlow, that in 1996 proclaimed the internet as a new domain of pure freedom to which laws of governments “have no meaning” and did not apply. Contemporary legal experts now believe the approach may have been utopian, and the internet has evolved in ways that the role of law may be inevitable, especially since harms from the virtual world extend to the offline space. “The ‘laws’ that increasingly have no meaning in online environments include not only the mandates of market regulators but also the guarantees that supposedly protect the fundamental rights of internet users, including the expressive and associational freedoms whose supremacy Barlow asserted,” writes Julie E Cohen, professor of law and technology at the Georgetown University Law Centre, in a paper titled Internet Utopianism and the Practical Inevitability of Law.‘A Natural Monopoly’“More generally, in the networked information era, protections for fundamental human rights—both on- and offline—have begun to fail comprehensively,” the paper added. In the particular context of Facebook, which has weathered the controversies with little implication on its earnings or user base, there are now calls to break it up. “Facebook has become a monopoly — a natural monopoly at that, whereby it benefits from powerful network effects that organically raise barriers to entry. This set of circumstances invites us to consider regulating it like a utility and, potentially, breaking it up in the coming years,” Ghosh said. A similar call was issued in May 2019 by a co-founder of Facebook who has since left the company. “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government... Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms... He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it,” wrote Chris Hughes in an opinion piece for the New York Times in May 2019.“We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American. It is time to break up Facebook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-missteps-deepen-legal-riddle/story-6jvWhL2JWtfSmb07ohqDML.html
03-09-2020||India||SC orders removal of slums around Delhi rail tracks, stops courts from staying eviction||The Supreme Court has ordered the removal of close to 48,000 slum dwellings situated along railway tracks in Delhi within three months, and to ensure compliance of its order, has stopped any court from passing an order of stay against such removal.In the event an order is passed, the same shall have no effect on the eviction proceedings, the court ruled.The court, which was hearing an application filed in the MC Mehta case relating to Delhi pollution matters, took this step on Monday, after the Indian Railways informed the court that despite a Special Task Force constituted to remove encroachments, political interference was coming in the way of getting the jhuggis removed. An order for removal of all encroachments passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on October 1, 2018 had led to the formation of the task force. The verdict was uploaded on the Supreme Court website on Tuesday night. Justice Mishra demitted office Wednesday.The court has passed the extraordinary order in exercise of its power under Article 142, which states, “The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.” In the past, the apex court has exercised this power to pass similar orders in the 2G spectrum scam case by restraining courts across the country from taking up bail pleas of those accused in the scam.Going through an affidavit filed by the Railways, the apex bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said: “There is predominant presence of jhuggies in Delhi along with 140km route length of railway track in the region of NCT of Delhi… Out of this, about 70km route length of track is affected by large jhuggie jhopri clusters existing in close vicinity of the tracks.” These clusters aggregated to about 48,000 jhuggies, most of which were present within the security zone of the Railways, according to the affidavit filed by Ashwani Kumar Yadav, additional divisional railway manager at DRM Office, Delhi Division, Northern Railways. There are no official estimate as to how many people live in such slums. NGOs say that the land owning agency, the railways in this case, will have to do a survey to ascertain the number of dwellers.“The encroachments which are there in the safety zones should be removed within a period of three months and no interference, political or otherwise, should be there, and no court shall grant any stay with respect to removal of the encroachments in the area in question. In case any interim order is granted with respect to encroachments which have been made along with railway tracks, that shall not be effective.” the order added.Shivani Chaudhry, executive director of NGO Housing and Land Rights Network, said: “Forcibly evicting people is never a solution. It results in greater impoverishment, homelessness, and marginalisation. This is also not the time to carry out evictions, given the serious public health emergency in the country on account of the pandemic.” “Forcibly evicting 48,000 households will result in a grave human rights emergency that could threaten the lives of affected people. The government should ensure that consultations are held with affected people, and plans for providing adequate housing are developed with their prior informed consent,” she added.A similar direction was passed by the court with regard to removal of plastic bags and garbage from the tracks. The court directed the Railways, the Delhi government, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and concerned municipal corporations to meet next week and draw an action plan for cleaning tracks. The municipal corporations were asked to tell their contractors to lift the garbage from the designated places where the Railways dumps waste. The court apportioned the cost involved for the long-term cleaning plan to be shared by the Centre and Delhi government in a 70:30 ratio.The apex court had involved DUSIB -- the agency that provides temporary/night shelters for the homeless in Delhi -- for preparing an action plan to remove garbage and encroachment, and enable rehabilitation of the people evicted from the jhuggis. When contacted by HT, a spokesperson of the Northern Railways said that it will “comply” with the order issued by the Supreme Court.In its report dated July 9, 2020, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) – an expert body assisting the top court on environment issues -- pointed out that Indian Railways is a bulk waste generator and, as such, it is required to comply with the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, which require the waste generator to operationalise a plan for waste management. EPCA urged the bench to direct the Railways to make a time-bound action plan for solid waste management in the Northern Region, starting with Delhi and its vicinity.Going by the EPCA report, the court was convinced that there was no action plan to rid tracks of the filth generated by trains and the surrounding human habitations. The bench remarked, “The picture painted in the EPCA report as well as in the reply filed by the Railways indicates that nothing has been done so far and waste is being piled up and at the same time, there is human habitation which has come in the same area in an unauthorized way, which are required to be taken care of.” The court will take up the matter for compliance after one month.Speaking to HT, senior advocate and environmental expert Raj Panjwani welcomed the court’s decision, saying: “This order may appear to have thwarted the alleged right of encroachers to seek further redressal. However, they are not without relief. They can approach the Supreme Court for grant of further time. As far as Delhi is concerned, for people who have encroached on land belonging to the government, there is a policy for rehabilitation. Even this approach can be looked into by the Railways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-removal-of-slums-around-delhi-rail-tracks-stops-courts-from-staying-eviction/story-rG2XRhGFXAs4M4lYH2XPMM.html
03-09-2020||India||Parliament to function minus weekend breaks||There will be no weekend break, no Question Hour and possibly no private members bill in the monsoon session of Indian Parliament to fit a tight schedule of legislative business and debate some key Opposition-sponsored issues. An internal note of the Lok Sabha, reviewed by HT, shows that the House will function every day, between September 14 and October 1, in daily shifts of four hours as it makes changes to work against the backdrop of the coronavirus disease. While Parliament has earlier seen special sessions on Saturday, according to officials, this will be the first time that a routine session will see Parliament working on Sundays .  Even with that, this monsoon session will last only 18 days. Typically, the monsoon session lasts for around 20-24 days spread across two months starting in July. On the inaugural day of the session, the Lok Sabha will start at 9am and continue till 1pm. After a gap of two hours, the Rajya Sabha will start at 3pm and continue till 7pm. But for the remaining part of the session, the Rajya Sabha will meet in the morning shift and the Lok Sabha in the afternoon. HT first reported on July 22 that daily shifts have been planned to ensure that MPs spend minimum time in Delhi for the session amid a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. The session, first amid a global pandemic of such magnitude, will see a logistical overhaul and an unprecedented seating arrangement where MPs of a House will spill over to the chamber and galleries of the other House as well. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in the air-conditioning system to inactivate microorganisms, 10 display screens for live proceedings, special communication cables linking both Houses, and designated seats only for top leaders are all part of this process. The Lok Sabha is also planning doorstep Covid-19 tests for MPs, offering the option to lawmakers to undergo real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at their home-base (even if it is outside Delhi), and to allow them to deliver speeches wile seated. Usually a session also sees large footfall in Parliament complex but this time, visitors will not be allowed, and staff and media presence will be reduced to ensure there is no large congregation. While the government needs to clear 11 ordinances—including key ones on agriculture and banking—the Opposition wants to raise the India-China border issue, the economic situation, and the alleged mismanagement of the Covid pandemic by the government. Both Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla have held a series of preparatory meetings for the session with officials, health experts and various government ministries.The secretariat has also asked ministers and MPs to display their radio-frequency tags and identity cards for hassle-free entry into the House as most of them are expected to wear masks. “In view of the prevailing instructions of wearing of face mask to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, a difficulty in proper identification of Hon’ble Members is experienced at the entry points of Parliament House. Therefore, to facilitate hassle-free entry, all the Hon’ble Ministers/ Members are requested to carry and display their RF Tags/ Identity Cards while wearing face masks which would help in identification on gaining entry into Parliament House Complex. Kind cooperation of Hon’ble Members is solicited,” said a House bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-to-function-minus-weekend-breaks/story-Mo9yxYF4AfM4FBa4zTW1PK.html
03-09-2020||India||In cost-effective green push, govt to do away with calendars, diaries||The Union government on Wednesday asked all ministries and departments to stop printing wall calendars, desktop calendars, diaries and greeting cards in a move aimed at the use of digital versions of these, and which will also save costs. There will be no printing of wall calendars, desktop calendars, diaries and other such material for use in the coming year by any ministry, department, public sector companies, state-run banks and all other organs of the government, the finance ministry said in a statement. Almost every ministry and department used to have its own calendar and diary. Data on the number of calendars and diaries printed every year by various government arms, and the amount spent on this wasn’t immediately available, although it is likely to be substantial. Apart from saving costs and encouraging digitisation, the move is also extremely environment friendly. “All such activity shall go digital and online,” the ministry added. The department of expenditure, an arm of the finance ministry, issued an order on Wednesday emphasising that the decision came into force with immediate effect.“Integrating technology into our work is in line with his (Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s) vision,” it said.“There is to be a concerted effort towards incorporating innovative methods in such matters. Using technological innovations for planning, scheduling and forecasting is well known to be economical, efficient and effective,” it added.The order also banned publication of coffee table books in the physical form to encourage appropriate use of e-books, it said. “Innovative digital and online solutions which will achieve the same result as physical calendars or diaries are to be prioritized and to be put into practice,” it added. Government officials and executives working in public sector companies said the decision will stop the practice of distributing diaries and calendars by government departments, public sector banks and state-run companies before the beginning of every new calendar year.The department of expenditure said the decision has been taken as “the world is increasingly moving towards adopting digital force multipliers for productivity and given the fact that using technological innovations for planning, scheduling and forecasting is known to be economical, efficient and effective”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-cost-effective-green-push-govt-to-do-away-with-calendars-diaries/story-4OpEDptUmmWoj3nEBDK5fP.html
03-09-2020||India||Appointments committee picks Rlys board CEO||The appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) on Wednesday formally approved the restructuring of the Railway Board and approved the appointment of VK Yadav, the current chairman of the Railway Board as its first CEO.In December 2019, the Union Cabinet in a move to reform the 150-year-old board of the Indian Railways, approved the restructuring of the apex body of the Indian Railways by cutting its strength to half, and unifying its eight services into a central service called the Indian Railway Management Service.While Yadav has been appointed the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO); Pradeep Kumar has been appointed Member, Infrastructure; PC Sharma has been appointed Member, Traction and Rolling Stock; PS Mishara has been made Member, Operations and Business Development. Manjula Rangarajan has been appointed Member, Finance.With this rearrangement, three apex level posts -- Member (Staff), Member (Engineering) and Member (Materials Management) in the Railway Board have been suspended and the post of Member (Rolling Stock) has been utilised for creation of the post of Director General (HR) in apex grade as per Cabinet Decision, the ACC said.Indian railways will now have only a five-member railway board that will act as “Chief Executive Officer (CEO)” along with four members responsible for Infrastructure, Operations & Business Development, Rolling Stock and Finance, respectively.The Railway Board is the apex body of the Indian Railways which reports to the Parliament via the ministry of railways. At present, the railway board includes eight members -- member (rolling stock), member (traction), member (traffic), member (engineering), member (staff), member (material management), members (signal & telecom) and financial commissioner.As per the new structure, the Chairman shall be the cadre controlling officer responsible for Human resources (HR) with assistance from a Director General level officer. Three apex level posts shall be surrendered from Railway Board, and all the remaining posts of the Railway Board shall be open to all officers regardless of the service to which they belonged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appointments-committee-picks-rlys-board-ceo/story-JXRmccRTpiD0YuXxCZgWoL.html
03-09-2020||India||Muted at justice Mishra’s farewell, says SC Bar head||Lawyer Dushyant Dave, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA),wrote a communication to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Wednesday, protesting against how he was treated during a ceremonial farewell function for justice Arun Mishra.Dave alleged that although he had been invited by the Supreme Court to attend the event through video conferencing and had logged in using a web link sent by the court registry, his microphone was deliberately muted by court officials, preventing him from giving a speech.It is customary for the president of the SCBA, the representative body of lawyers practising in the Supreme Court, to deliver a speech at farewell functions for Supreme Court judges.“I wish to place on record my strong disappointment and condemnation at what happened today in the Supreme Court of India during the farewell to Justice Arun Mishra. The entire episode leaves much to be desired on the part of this great institution. The whole attempt was to prevent me from addressing on behalf of the SCBA and its Executive Committee, after having invited and invitation having been accepted. This was clearly an affront to the Bar and to me personally,” Dave wrote in his communication, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Times.Dave lamented that Supreme Court has reached a stage “where judges are scared of” the lawyers, while reminding the CJI that “judges are temporary while the Bar is permanent”.“I must confess, the Supreme Court has come to such levels where the judges are afraid of the Bar. Please do remember, judges come and go but we the Bar remain constant. We are the real strength of this great Institution because we are permanent,” Dave said. Supreme Court officials said that there had been no deliberate attempt to mute Dave, calling it a technical glitch that prevented even some judges from connecting to the video conference. Dave maintained that he had connected to the conference and was visible on the screen and had also been able to speak before the bench assembled.“I was duly connected and cleared by technical team (which manages video conference hearings at SC) for video and audio. I interacted with the Attorney General and others for over half an hour. I waited and remained connected all through but was muted once the bench assembled. If I was to speak, the CJI would have at least inquired if I was there. They all could see me and I could see them too. The inescapable conclusion is that the Registry has issued a false statement,” Dave said. When a Supreme Court judge retires, the retiring judge sits along with the CJI on his/ her last working day and Bar leaders including the attorney general, SCBA president and senior lawyers gather to bid farewell.A separate, elaborate farewell function is also usually organized by the SCBA on the Supreme Court lawns. After Covid-19 broke out and physical functioning of the court ceased, the SCBA had been organising its farewell functions through video conference. Justice Mishra had declined to participate in SCBA’s farewell function, saying his conscience did not permit him to do so at a time when the world is reeling under the effects of the pandemic.The ceremonial function organised by the Supreme Court was the only opportunity for Bar leaders to bid farewell to justice Mishra.Dave, in his letter to the CJI, stated that he had received a link at 10.06 am to join the ceremonial Bench of the CJI at 12.30 pm where justice Mishra was to bid farewell.Dave joined the conference at around 12.20 pm before the bench assembled and was seen engaging in casual conversations with attorney general KK Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta ,who were also present to wish justice Mishra on the occasion of his retirement.Dave alleged that after the bench assembled and heard all cases, it invited Venugopal and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association president Shivaji Jadhav to speak, but he himself got disconnected frequently.“I persisted and rejoined each time. I saw and heard Shri Jadhav fully and at the end of his address again I was not requested to speak though Shri Jadhav acknowledged my presence in his address. After that Your Lordship (CJI) spoke which I saw and heard and then invited Justice Mishra to speak. At that stage, realising the game plan I exited in the larger interests of the dignity of the Bar and myself,” he wrote.Dave also said that he had contacted Supreme Court secretary general Sanjeev Kalgaonkar during the farewell, demanding to know why he was being muted, but did not get any response from Kalgaonkar in time.“Only at 1.02pm, he responded saying he is instructing Registrar to look into it , by which time it was too late and so I messaged him informing that I had exited,” Dave said.Dave has been a vocal critic of the Supreme Court in recent years and has engaged in heated exchanges with justice Mishra on more than one occasion. The most recent of such instances was when he was appearing on behalf of advocate Prashant Bhushan in the contempt case initiated against Bhushan for tweets criticising the court and CJI Bobde.What did Dave want to say during the farewell function?In his communication to the CJI, Dave also stated that he may have been prevented from speaking lest he say something unpleasant and went on to highlight what he wanted to say.“Let me tell you exactly what I was to say which I had written down: On behalf of the SCBA, the Executive Committee and myself, I wish you Justice Mishra happiness and bliss in remainder of your long life which by all accounts will be as fruitful and rewarding as it has been. May I pray to Lord Mahabaleshwar to bless you with strength to introspect and stir up your conscience,” the communication said.Dave’s communication ended by saying that he will not participate in any function organised by the Supreme Court until December this year when his tenure as the Bar president comes to an end.Haris Beeran, a Supreme Court lawyer, said if Dave’s allegations are true, it is a very serious issue. “The registry is saying that it was a technical issue but it appears to be a conscious decision to prevent him from speaking. At what level this decision was taken should be inquired into because it has always been a tradition at the Bar for the SCBA President to speak at the farewell of a retiring judge,” Beeran said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muted-at-justice-mishra-s-farewell-says-sc-bar-head/story-j6SvbWLc4Mv38Q0AVNxExI.html
03-09-2020||India||India rejigs deployment in Ladakh amid standoff||The Indian Army has rejigged its deployments at multiple points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, including the northern bank of Pangong Lake, to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from making aggressive manoeuvres to unilaterally alter the status quo in contested areas, officials familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. Tensions flared in the sensitive sector after the Indian Army occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake four days ago to stop PLA from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move.“Some readjustments of military positions have been carried out as part of precautionary deployment on the lake’s northern bank and other sensitive areas along the LAC. In the Finger area, we have moved up from our base at the lake level,” said one of the officials, asking not to be named. To be sure, the PLA holds dominating positions in the Finger area on the lake’s northern bank. The situation on the lake’s southern bank remains extremely tense with both armies sending in reinforcements to the area where the Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity -- India holds a series of positions near Black Top (a hill feature) and on Rezang La and Reqin pass. The PLA made a second provocative move on August 31 targeting these positions but the Indian Army’s swift defensive action thwarted the Chinese attempt. Both sides have concentrated a significant number of soldiers, tanks and artillery pieces; and are within each other’s rifle range, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday. Brigade commander-ranked officers from the two sides met for the third time in Chushul on Wednesday to de-escalate tensions but the talks have hit a wall with neither army prepared to make concessions, said a second official. “From Depsang to Chushul and Chumar to Demchok, we have strengthened our military posture in all sensitive areas and are on high alert to deal with any adventurism by the PLA,” he said. The latest developments have deepened the trust deficit between the two sides and dealt a blow to efforts to reduce tensions in the Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. Experts said the taking of heights on the lake’s southern bank and the ensuing readjustment of deployments to hold positions in the higher reaches in other areas was a calculated move by the army. “We will talk to China from a position of relative strength when military and diplomatic negotiations happen. The heights we have occupied on the southern bank are operationally very important as they offer a sweeping view of Chinese military activity in the sector,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.. Experts said the PLA would attempt to change the status quo in new areas and stressed that India has to stay prepared to fend off such moves. “We are in for a long haul. The development on the lake’s southern bank is not the end of the ongoing tussle. They will occupy heights in other areas and so will we. Friction will continue till talks yield results in the long run,” Bhatia said. Officials familiar with developments said New Delhi will continue to focus on finding a resolution to the border standoff even as it takes steps to thwart all Chinese efforts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC. “We want a resolution, which is something we have repeatedly said over the past few weeks,” said a third official who spoke on condition of anonymity. At the same time, he said, the Indian side will not accept any move by the Chinese side to transgress the LAC or to change the status quo in the Ladakh sector or elsewhere, as the external affairs ministry has pointed out several times. Although defence minister Rajnath Singh is in Russia to attend a crucial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), there are no plans to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Gen Wei Fenghe. Since the fresh face-off emerged in public over the weekend, the Chinese side has repeatedly claimed the Indian troops had transgressed the LAC on the southern bank of Pangong Lake and near Reqin Pass, and called for the immediate withdrawal of Indian troops. A fourth official said the Indian troops were in possession of strategic heights which were within the Indian perception of the LAC and there had been no transgression of the disputed border. “The Chinese side is making these demands because the Indian side has made key gains by taking these strategically positioned hilltops and heights,” he added. The PLA has sparked fresh tensions along the LAC at a time when military and diplomatic talks with China to implement a complex disengagement plan have hit a wall. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly the northern bank of Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains an area of key concern for the Indian Army. The Finger area is a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the lake. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers as an integral part of its territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejigs-deployment-in-ladakh-amid-standoff/story-Fj2HRceTMeB6HCZ6ua1TOO.html
03-09-2020||India||Researchers develop faster method to test for Covid-19||Researchers from the New Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) have developed a new method of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing that is faster, cheaper, and almost as accurate as the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, considered the gold standard of testing for the infection. The method eliminates the need for a biosafety lab, which makes it possible for it to be used at airports and railway stations to test passengers before they board a plane or a train. Instead of amplifying the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, the technique developed by researchers from IGIB uses mass spectrometry to detect two peptides (building blocks of the viral protein). Mass spectrometry can detect the presence and quantity of various organic and inorganic compounds by detecting the ions released by them. “The benefit of this method is that we do not need the viral RNA to be intact after sample collection because we do not need to amplify the genetic material. This means, after collecting the swab samples we can directly put it in a detergent that breaks down the genetic material of the virus leaving it unable to infect anyone,” said Shantanu Sengupta, senior principal scientist at IGIB.“For RT-PCR, the sample has to be carefully transported in a medium and taken to a biosafety lab to prevent those handling it from getting the infection,” added Sengupta, one of the corresponding authors of the paper, which has been published in the Springer Group’s Journal of Proteins and Proteomics. The specificity (the measure of a test’s ability to correctly generate a negative result for people who don’t have the condition) of the method is 100% and sensitivity (ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease) 90.4%, meaning all those who test positive using the method will be truly positive but there is about a 10% chance that a person might test negative despite having the infection. The researchers analysed 103 samples using the new method against the RT-PCR to calculate the specificity and sensitivity of the test against RT-PCR. This is much better than the alternative rapid antigen kits, currently in use in India for scaling up testing, that can throw up 20 to 50% false negatives. “This is the only method that directly observes the RNA as compared to RT-PCR where the proteins have to bind with a primer before we can detect it. This eliminates the possibility of a false negative if the quality of the RNA collected it not good and it does not bind or there is lysis (detergent) that prevents the RNA from binding. In our method, the only step that can go wrong is the digestion of proteins. And, to prevent that from generating wrong results, we have added a human peptide to the test as well, which will be visible even in negative tests where the preparation has been proper,” said Sengupta. After a swab sample is collected, the viral proteins that make up its genetic material has to be digested and prepared, which takes about 25 minutes. The mass spectrometry test itself takes just about 2.3 minutes, meaning from sample collection to delivering a result it will take only 30 minute, compared to five to six hours for the RT-PCR test. “We can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 min gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.4% sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR, highlighting the sensitivity of the technique. This method has the translational potential in terms of the rapid diagnostics of symptomatic and asymptomatic Covid--19 patients and can augment current methods available for diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, IGIB. Apart from the initial cost of setting up the mass spectrometry machine, which costs between R 50 lakh and Rs. 2 crore, the test can cost as little as a tenth of the price of an RT-PCR test.“The cost per sample analysis at the lab level is just Rs. 100, which will go down further if done at a mass scale. Plus, there are several mass spectrometers available at high-end diagnostic labs, academic institutions, and pharmaceutical companies. We have reached the saturation point when it comes to RT-PCR machines in the country, so we can now deploy other technologies,” Sengupta said. The method also allows for effective pooling of samples. “Around 2,000 samples can be tested in one go by intelligently pooling upto 10 samples together using an algorithm developed by my colleagues. This can be done even if the positivity rate is as high as 20%. However, people with symptoms are unlikely to travel from an airport or railway station, meaning the positivity will be lower still,” said Sengupta. Pooled testing is when samples from more than one person are mixed together and tested. And, if one of the batches comes back positive, the samples from only that batch are retested individually to detect the person who has the infection. This method helps save cost and scale up testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/researchers-develop-faster-method-to-test-for-covid-19/story-jCyr2CyyGy8GZUTbWEYLHJ.html
03-09-2020||India||Senior Karnataka IPS officer critical after bullet injury from service revolver||Director-General of Police Housing Corporation in Karnataka, R P Sharma, who is a senior IPS officer has been admitted to the Columbia Asia hospital in Bangalore with a bullet injury, said to have been inflicted from his service revolver. The incident is said to have happened in Kothnur police station limits and Sharma whose condition is believed to be critical according to hospital sources, is battling for his life.The controversial officer had earlier been in trouble after his letter to the then Congress-led Siddaramiah government criticizing its interference in the functioning of the department had been leaked. Some of his actions while heading the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force had also earned the ire of the then government. His family including his IAS officer wife was accused of not disclosing certain land deals.It wasn’t clear whether the bullet injury had been inflicted accidentally or was a suicide attempt. DCP North East Bheemashanker Guled claimed that preliminary inquiries indicated “that it looks like it may have been an accidental discharge of his service weapon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-karnataka-ips-officer-critical-after-bullet-injury-from-service-revolver/story-iGSRGYVIZuUnl36GSsSJUJ.html

That’s happening as it happens every time, nothing much,” Pande told Reuters from near Guwahati, the largest city in northeastern India.“As of now, there’s nothing to worry about on that front.”But Tapir Gao, a member of parliament from Arunachal, told Reuters that Chinese troops had been regularly crossing into Indian territory.“It’s a regular phenomenon, it’s nothing new,” he said, identifying the Walong and Chaglagam areas in Anjaw as the most vulnerable.In the 1962 war, India says its outnumbered forces “blocked the thrust of the invading Chinese” in Walong, and the area of mountains, meadows and fast-flowing rivers is now a government focus for settlement and road-building.“What we’re trying to do is create more possibilities and opportunities for villagers,” said Sudan, referring to plans for clusters of villages in the disputed area.“It’s a push to resettle people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-secures-its-east-after-western-himalayan-clashes-with-china/story-guFLdtJa5YbxkNV7J74YLL.html
03-09-2020||Editorials||Review the Char Dham project||The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has sought responses from the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and the Uttarakhand government about the alleged violations of the forest conservation act during the construction of the Char Dham Pariyojana in Uttarakhand. The ₹12,000-crore Pariyojana, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2016, aims to build an 889-km all-weather road, connecting the Hindu pilgrimage sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri in the Himalayas. The issue of environmental violations in the project is being heard by the Supreme Court (SC), and the case is due to come up on September 8.While there has been criticism of the project on environmental grounds (recent landslides in the state prove once again that it is risky to build in the ecologically-fragile zone), its plan of action illustrates how the Indian State has flouted procedures to push the project through. One, the government used a legal loophole to avoid conducting the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), including public hearings, to fast-track the project. Two, official agencies refused to abide by SC orders on stoppage of work. And, three, it suppressed a MoRTH’s revised circular on the contentious issue of road standards in hilly and mountainous terrains to go ahead with its road-widening plans.This is not all: A senior Uttarakhand government official tried to mislead MoEFCC by sending an “altered” report to the ministry, bypassing Ravi Chopra, the chairman of the High Powered Committee (HPC) set up by SC to look into the project. This “subterfuge”, as Mr Chopra wrote it in his letter to the ministry, was conducted because five members of the panel felt that the project will cause “irreversible damage” to the Himalayan ecology, while 21 others (mostly government representatives) said that the ecological damage can be “minimised”. The Chopra report has said that the project is an “act of irresponsibility and disregard towards the Himalayas”, when it is becoming clearer that any development devoid of “honest and uncompromising ecological concerns” will bring “devastation and disaster on our heads”. The Centre must take the Chopra report seriously, review its stand on the need for broader roads, and conduct a carrying-capacity study of the area. The government’s stand will also define how serious it is about complying with green norms in general, and the larger issue of the climate crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/review-the-char-dham-project/story-8GPqxU3OI1qjQaUKVLyZDM.html
03-09-2020||Editorials||When protests rock the world of sport||The first mask had the name Breonna Taylor — a black medical technician shot dead by plainclothes police in her home in Louisville during a botched drug raid this year. The second one had the name Elijah Mcclain — a black massage therapist from Aurora, Colorado — who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and being sedated by paramedics. These are the masks of Naomi Osaka; she has seven of them, one for each match she hopes to play at the US Open (if she goes all the way, and we are rooting for her), depicting seven Black lives lost to police brutality in the United States. Osaka is not alone. When cricket restarted with the West Indies tour of England, each match began with players and officials kneeling to a Black Lives Matter (BLM) banner. In F1, drivers are wearing BLM masks. BLM masks and banners were everywhere during the Champions League matches in Lisbon in August. There have been historic moments of protest in sport before, but they have always been met with crushing opposition. Most organised sport have rules against protests, citing a hypocritical adage that “sport and politics should not mix”. But the presence of national flags and anthems during sporting events makes sport political. The International Olympics Committee put a rule in place for the Tokyo Olympics, banning “any form of political, religious or ethnic demonstrations”. With the wave of protest culture running through sport now, it is time to lay these old notions to rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-protests-rock-the-world-of-sports/story-6VbmW4OfBHUyeYmmktf4zN.html
03-09-2020||Editorials||A new low for Indian television news||Over the past decade, the quality of Indian television news has sharply dipped. This can be traced to an obsession with ratings; a preference for contentious studio discussions and dilution of balanced reportage; a tendency to sensationalise news; and a broken business model. But, with its reportage on the Sushant Singh Rajput case, Indian TV news has hit a new low. Here is what should have happened — a prominent actor dies by suicide; the media covers his life and legacy; there is a conversation on mental health; there is due investigation; and there is closure. Instead, here is what has happened — a prominent actor dies by suicide; the media decides that it is not suicide but a product of either a deep-rooted conspiracy by an amorphous Bollywood power elite or an outright murder; conspiracy theories are peddled, reputations tarnished, and every norm of reportage is thrown into the bin; public opinion is manufactured; State agencies either willingly or due to this media-generated pressure enter the field; and citizens remain distracted. This is not to suggest that a fair probe is not needed. But by acting as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, on flimsy grounds, TV news has been irresponsible. Today, they have found one target; tomorrow, it could be someone else. There is no easy solution. Self-regulation isn’t working. But State-regulation could lead to control, which is not desirable. Finding a balance and reining in TV news is now essential to protect individual liberties, prevent mob justice, and have a civilised discourse — all of which are essential in a democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-new-low-for-indian-television-news/story-kARTAzGfsVwCGzsae70yHP.html
