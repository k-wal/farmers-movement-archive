12-09-2020||News||The quest for strong legislative oversight | Opinion||The government’s decision to dispense with Question Hour during the monsoon session of Parliament has irked the Opposition. They have accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to do away with an important instrument of legislative oversight of the executive. However, the fact remains that several Members of Parliament (MPs) are unable to make the best use of the Question Hour on account of frequent disruptions. A study carried out by the Rajya Sabha secretariat showed that nearly 60% of the time allotted to Question Hour over the past five years was lost due to disruptions.There is no specific rule in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business (Rules) of the two Houses for suspension of Question Hour. The leaders of all political parties in the Rajya Sabha had agreed to shift Question Hour to noon instead of the time-honoured “first hour of every sitting” or 11 am. This change was brought about in 2014 and continues till today. Every sitting of the Rajya Sabha begins with the so-called and undefined Zero Hour, in which MPs are allowed to raise matters of immediate concern with the permission of the Chair. If that is the stated order of priority of the members, the dropping of Question Hour but retaining Zero Hour should serve their purpose. In any case, before dropping Question Hour from the proceedings of the two Houses, the government held extensive consultations with various political parties and the majority, given the time constraints and the consequent need for shortening the agenda, was in favour of retaining a truncated Zero Hour, while dispensing with Question Hour.As regards grilling the executive and performing the function of legislative oversight, skillfully-drafted questions for written answers serve the purpose much more effectively. It requires a deep understanding of the topic and the current policies of the government on the subject. Moreover, there are several other instruments which can execute the task better. First and foremost is the notice for calling attention. Through this, a member may call the attention of a minister to any matter of urgent public importance and the minister may make a brief statement in reply.Then, there is the Half-an-Hour Discussion on a question, the reply to which can be oral or written. There is also a provision for Special Mention in the Rajya Sabha (rule 180A-180F) and “Raising a matter which is not a point of order” in the Lok Sabha (rule 377). The latter is a structured device whereby a member may read out or lay on the table a statement on a matter of public importance. The minister concerned, conventionally, responds to it within one month. These instruments, if used optimally and judiciously, are quite effective in enforcing accountability of the executive.However, in order to compensate the members for their inability to ask supplementary questions, follow-up questions on subsequent days and seeking more information on a question asked earlier may be also allowed, in relaxation of rule 47 (2) (xiv) of the Rajya Sabha rules and rule 41 (2) (xiii) of the Lok Sabha rules, which prohibit questions on subjects on which questions have already been answered during the session. Such questions may be admitted till the last day of the Monsoon Session, that is October 1 and replies sent by email or post subsequently. Further, the ceiling on the number questions to be admitted for written replies, which at present stands at 175 in the Rajya Sabha and 230 in the Lok Sabha, may be raised to say 200 and 300 respectively.Zero Hour too has been curtailed, but the members could perhaps make better use of the instrument of Special Mention /Raising a Matter to compensate for lost opportunities. As a matter of fact, Special Mention was introduced as a better-structured alternative to Zero Hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-quest-for-strong-legislative-oversight-opinion/story-R4RXgXhw6DXCofGmt2NqbK.html

According to Oshiwara police, the incident occurred on September 8 at around 7am when Hansa Bhagat was on her way to Crawford market to buy fish. Bhagat told police that she used to visit Crawford Market every day in the morning to buy fish for the shop she ran at Marol in Andheri (East). On September 8, her son dropped her to the bus stop at Jogeshwari (West), and while she was walking in the queue to board the bus, two men on a motorcycle came from behind and snatched her gold chain. Dayanand Bangar senior inspector from Oshiwara police station said, “Bhagat came to the police station on September 10 and lodged a complaint under section 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.” Assistant police inspector Kiran Pawar and his team arrested the accused within 24 hours. An officer said, “We scanned more than 30 CCTV cameras to identify the accused. We found the bike but the accused had tried to erase two digits from the number plate to escape detection. But while analysing the footage of MTNL junction, Goregaon, we found the missing numbers.” Oshiwara police with the help of traffic department police found the bike owner’s address and a team reached Orlem, Malad (west) where the police found a 55-year-old man who told the team that his son uses his bike and stays with his girlfriend at Ambawadi, Malad (west).

The court said the provisions of the law are applicable only when a child is harassed with sexual intent.“In order to attract the provisions of the Pocso Act, 2012, it is necessary to commit an act of harassment with sexual intent,” said justice Bharati Dangre while granting pre-arrest bail to Ravindra Khude.Khude was booked on the basis of a 17-year-old girl’s complaint on August 1.The judge noted the reading of the first information reports (FIRs) by the parties in the case against each other suggested petty rivalry between two families. Dangre said on account of some petty reasons, there was verbal altercation over some trivial issues. It aggravated and resulted into a scuffle, added Dangre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pocso-act-applies-only-when-a-child-is-harassed-with-sexual-intent-bombay-hc/story-JK6ig6GAMtio53pgo2IhAI.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||2.28 lakh students from Maharashtra to appear for NEET today||After months of delay due to national lockdown, followed by an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, undergraduate medical and dental aspirants will finally appear for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday, September 13. As per the final registration figures revealed by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in January 2020, over 15.93 lakh students have registered for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) as compared to 15.19 lakh in 2019. While total registrations rose by 74,000 (4.7%), the good news is that the total intake capacity at MBBS colleges has also increased by 9,900 (13.7%) this year. Keeping the current situation in mind, NTA has announced that safety precautions will be undertaken at every exam centre to ensure maximum safety of all stakeholders - staff and students alike. To implement appropriate distancing during exams, the total number of exam centres have increased from 2,546 last year to 3,843 this year. “Like JEE, we are sure NTA will ensure that best safety precautions are implemented across exam centres. However, there is a good chance that not all those who have registered will show up for the exam this year, especially in cities registering a high number of Covid-19 cases,” said Anuradha Singh, parent of a NEET aspirant. Once again, this year, maximum registrations for NEET-UG are from Maharashtra where 2.28 lakh students will appear for the entrance exam, followed by Uttar Pradesh (1.54 lakh) and Rajasthan (1.38 lakh). While 1.19 lakh students registered for NEET from Karnataka, 1.16 lakh students are from Kerala, among other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-28-lakh-students-from-maharashtra-to-appear-for-neet-today/story-fjTltEyCzqxY1KKUoDR3yO.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Tube wells come to rescue GK-II residents from seepage||After more than a month of perpetual seepage in their basements, residents of Greater Kailash-II are hoping to finally get a solution to their problem. To fix the issue, starting Friday three tubewell pumps installed in nearby municipal parks have been put into operation round-the-clock on a daily basis in GK-II till the water level recedes. Basements of at least 15 houses and several shops in M, S and E blocks have been facing this issue and residents fear that the intense seepage may weaken the foundation of their houses. In many houses the elevators have been damaged because of the constant flow of water. At least a foot deep water remains in the basements at all times even when there’s no rain. The GK-II Welfare Association had last week approached officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to find a way to pump out the water. A report by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) had suggested suggested deep pumping out of water with the help of pumps. According to Sanjay Rana, president of GK-II Welfare Association, after their request, the municipal corporation has put the pumps into operation in three nearby parks. “While one pump was started on Thursday, two others began working from Friday morning. The pumps are located in Tikona Park, Sehgal Park and Rock Garden. The water being pumped out is being released into the storm water drains,” said Rana. Also, he said a CGWB team has again started a survey of the groundwater levels starting Friday. “On our request, the CGWB will study the levels on a daily basis to assess if the water is receding at all,” said Rana. The draining of water through pumps is being carried out by the SDMC’s horticulture department along with electrical wing. Last month, the CGWB had studied the area and in its report had stated several factors such as disturbance in the natural groundwater movement and coming up of man-made structures that have obstructed the natural flow of groundwater causing it to flood the low-lying areas in the vicinity. The CGWB had suggested deep pumping out of water with the help of pumps and use it for water tanker supply. Subhash Bhadana, local councillor, and also deputy mayor, SDMC said that after the RWA’s request, a joint survey was taken up by corporation officials and the DJB engineers last week. “As suggested by the CGWB, it was decided that the tubewell pumps in the parks will be used 24 hours a day to pump out the water. The pumps are closed just for half an hour a day in order to give rest to the machine. It will take several days before the water level goes down, as the water table has risen,” said Bhadana. A senior DJB official, who did not wish to be named, said, “So far the issue is being dealt by the municipal corporation, as the pumps have been installed by them. The water quality has to be tested before it could be used for water tankers. Besides, not many tankers are in use at present, as the peak demand is only during summers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tube-wells-come-to-rescue-gk-ii-residents-from-seepage/story-9HkC0NMYg2kCK8lwE0opwO.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Despite unfavourable trial outcome, PGIMER to continue with plasma therapy||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) will continue to administer plasma therapy to Covid-19 patients even though the clinical trials by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) did not show promising results. A trial conducted across 39 hospitals in India has revealed that plasma therapy neither reduces the death risk nor does it slow down the progression of the disease from mild to severe stage. The paper, however, is yet to be peer reviewed.Pankaj Malhotra, professor at PGI’s internal medicine department, who was the principal investigator of the trial, said though the results are not encouraging, they will continue the therapy on a set of patients fitting into the criteria and wherever a physician feels that it can yield better results. “We have to understand that randomised trials did not have an impact on mortality, but we have to keep in mind that certain symptoms such as fatigue and fever were treated faster. Rather than doing nothing, we can actually do something and try this therapy,” he added. The institute currently has 10 plasma units ready, which can be given to any Covid patient, whenever needed. PGIMER had announced creation of a plasma bank facility to cater to the needs of patients admitted there as well as other government and private hospitals of the city on a first come, first served basis.Head of transfusion medicine department Professor Ratti Ram Sharma said, “For now, there is no set treatment for Covid-19 and everything is in the trial mode. The therapy should be given on the discretion of the physician and to those who fall in the category of treatment. It should not be used as an over-the-counter drug which this study has shown.”PGIMER was one of the centres of the ICMR’s national trial for convalescent plasma therapy. The institute had successfully enrolled nine patients, five of whom received plasma treatment and the remaining ones were on control arm. It was observed in some cases that the patients was taken off the oxygen therapy in just three days and gradually, their condition improved with the help of supportive care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-unfavourable-trial-outcome-pgimer-to-continue-with-plasma-therapy/story-TwJZOD4RUzgRR1EaEarUyK.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Man bites off employee’s finger after verbal spat in Mayur Vihar, doctors reattach it||A 40-year-old man bit off the finger of his employee in east Delhi’s Mayur on Saturday after an alleged heated spat over work timings and the issue of returning home on time.Investigators said the man bit off and then spat out the little finger of the victim, identified as Mohit Kumar, 34, on the floor. Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east), said that Kumar then proceeded to pick up his finger and rushed to a private hospital, where doctors reattached it. The DCP said the suspect, identified as Hemant Sidharth, who is absconding. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 10 years. According to the police, Kumar lives with his family in Ghaziabad and works for an insurance firm in the national capital. The incident, according to the victim’s statement, took place on September 4 when he met his boss Sidharth in Akshardham, from where the duo drove to Karol Bagh for some office-related work.“When they returned to Akshardham in the evening, Kumar cited some personal work and wanted to leave for home. He wanted to drive in his own vehicle that was parked in Akshardham. But Sidharth insisted that they go to Mayur Vihar first for some work,” said the DCP. Kumar reluctantly agreed to go with his boss, but on the condition that he would be dropped back to Akshardham quickly. Once in Mayur Vihar, the two men allegedly had a spat, which later escalated with Sidharth allegedly verbally abusing his junior, the officer said. “When I told him not to abuse me, Sidharth slapped me. When I tried to protect my face with my hands, he pulled at my hands and bit off the little finger of my left hand,” alleged Kumar, in his complaint. Sidharth then allegedly spat the severed finger on the floor even as the injured man dialled the police. He was later rushed to a private hospital by a police team, where doctors managed tor reattach his finger. On Thursday, Kumar approached the police to register a first information report against his boss, after which a hunt was launched for Sidharth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-bites-off-employee-s-finger-after-verbal-spat-docs-reattach-it/story-JMRFw44nTTaWqMw7fbEyVM.html

12-09-2020||Delhi||Doctors, health care workers to take part in week 2 of anti-dengue campaign in city||The second week of the Delhi government’s anti-dengue campaign will see doctors and health care workers getting involved in the drive, the chief minister’s office said on Saturday. The initiative, known as the ‘10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute’ (10-week, 10 o clock) anti-dengue campaign, was launched on September 6 with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inspecting his residence for stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. All MLAs followed him in the past one week.“In the second week, the doctors, who continue to remain the backbone in this fight against dengue, have come out in support of the campaign. They are assuring the citizens that Delhi will cope with dengue together. The doctors and other healthcare workers will spread awareness that the Delhi government provides free treatment and testing for dengue in all its hospitals and has also launched a telephonic and WhatsApp helpline to assist the public,” a senior official in the CM’s office said. Kejriwal on Saturday took to Twitter, urging people to actively participate in the drive on Sunday. “It is the second Sunday of Delhi’s mega campaign to fight dengue. We all have to check our homes for 10 minutes in the morning at 10. If there’s clean stagnant water anyway, then drain and change it. Together we have to defeat dengue,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. Dr. Ashish Goel, medical superintendent of Delhi government’s newly opened Burari Hospital, said he is one among several other healthcare workers who have pledged to promote the campaign this year. “All departments, doctors, and officials are caught up in preventing and treating Covid. It ultimately becomes the duty of every citizen to check their homes for water stagnation and maintain cleanliness. If they make it a habit to spend just a few minutes once a week to do that, we will be able to control dengue to a huge extent. We should cover our children to protect them, and ourselves, especially when we are going out to prevent mosquito bites. Just like wearing masks has become a habit, taking preventive measures like wearing clothes with full sleeves and inspecting our houses for 10 minutes every week to prevent dengue should be adopted as a habit. Adding kerosene oil or petrol to stagnant water is another effective way to prevent mosquito-breeding,” Dr. Goel said. A special helpline has been launched by the Delhi government for the public if they require assistance with dengue. People can call on 011-22300012 and WhatsApp on 8595920530.The campaign seeks to build greater awareness on the prevention of dengue in Delhi. The campaign was launched for the first time last September. Only 2,036 cases and two deaths due to dengue were reported last year, as compared to 2015 when 15,867 cases and 60 deaths were recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/doctors-health-care-workers-to-take-part-in-week-2-of-anti-dengue-campaign-in-city/story-9w2ReCDM9Nr2DdRfcXt7BM.html

He said over four lakh people from 1.1 lakh families in Mohali will benefit from the scheme. “The biometric authentication ensures food grain distribution to the actual beneficiary. End-to-end computerisation and digitisation of the entire process minimises the food grain pilferage and diversion. The intrastate portability feature of the card empowers the beneficiary to collect ration from the fair price shop of his choice. It marks the end of age-old monopoly of depot holders,” the minister added. While Balbir Singh Sidhu launched the scheme at the district level, simultaneous launch was also held at block levels. Smart ration cards can be used to withdraw food grains from fair price shops through e-PoS machines without carrying any additional document. A smart ration card will be swiped on the e-PoS machine to fetch the details of the family, after which the biometric authentication of the family member will be done. The details of the beneficiaries are integrated in a locked chip that can be read from authenticated e-PoS machines only. The cards have security features such as ‘micro text technology’. The QR code printed on the back side of the card is a combination of more than one field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/smart-ration-cards-distributed-in-mohali/story-xzHZtZkbEBtXi051LlbcpK.html

12-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad to tighten screening of patients requiring home isolation||In order to deal with the rising cases of Covid-19 in the district, which are being reported at a faster pace over the past two weeks than before, Ghaziabad officials have decided to carefully screen patients requiring home isolation as they account for about 46% of the total active cases in the district as of Saturday. Officials said as a result of the rise in the number of patients in home isolation, the government’s L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals, meant exclusively for treating Covid patients, currently have an occupancy of about just 30-40%. According to official figures, the Ghaziabad district has so far allowed 2,200 persons to remain in home isolation of whom 1,434 were discharged while 766 were still under treatment, as of September 11. The officials said 146 of these patients were also referred to L1, L2 or L3 hospitals and this referral rate is also high over the past two weeks. While the L1 hospitals treat asymptomatic patients, the L2 hospitals deal with patients having moderate complications and the L3 are meant for those with severe symptoms.Overall, Ghaziabad district has 146 patients who were referred from home isolation to Covid facilities. In contrast, the Gautam Budh Nagar district officials said so far, of the 966 persons allowed home isolation, only 15 have been referred to Covid facilities. “In order to monitor the patients in home isolation in a better manner, we have decided to rope in more teams who can be in regular touch with patients. Presently, we have three teams working in three shifts of eight hours each. Now, we have decided to double the teams since the number of patients is also on the rise,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Further, we have also asked our teams to properly monitor those aged over 55 years and other having co-morbid conditions. In case the teams have the slightest of doubt about a patient’s health condition, they should get that patient shifted to a Covid facility immediately. These steps have been planned to better manage people going into home isolation. It is our intent that there should be no health complication to any patient in home isolation and fatalities should be kept to a minimum,” he said. The UP government allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients on July 20. According to state health department officials, there were about 36,334 patients in home isolation across the state till September 11. They added that about 149,396 patients availed of home isolation and 113,062 of them have recovered from the illness. Ghaziabad officials are also worried about the referral rate when compared to Gautam Budh Nagar. Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of Gautam Budh Nagar district, said, “The rate of referral of patients in home isolation is low here because we have a strict screening procedure. Anyone who opts for home isolation is first brought to a Covid facility where (s)he is kept for two days and her health status screened. Only when doctors do they allow the person to go into home isolation. The process is tedious and time consuming but it has considerably reduced our referral rate.” In Ghaziabad, there is no such check.“We have plenty of vacant beds in our Covid hospitals while the number of doctors and health care staff deployed there is same as that for full occupancy. We will now be strictly monitoring people aged over 55 years and also those with co-morbid conditions,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-to-tighten-screening-of-patients-requiring-home-isolation/story-zHGcbkBQMOKnJYLrI01N6J.html

Her family, however, alleged she was being followed by two people on a motorcycle at the time of the accident, though the police did not include harassment charges in their report.The issue had caught national attention.“When Sudeeksha reached Chirora village, Syana Road in Bulandshahr, two persons riding a black Royal Enfield motorcycle overtook Sudeeksha’s motorcycle twice, and suddenly and deliberately applied brakes. My brother Satyendra lost balance and his vehicle hit another motorcycle. Sudeeksha fell on the road and was critically injured in the head. She was sent to a hospital where doctors declared her dead,” Jitendra had alleged in the FIR. The police had claimed that this was a road accident and denied charges of sexual harassment. On August 16, Bulandshahr police had arrested two suspects – Deepak Solanki and Raju – and recovered the Royal Enfield motorcycle used in the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bulandshahr-admin-hands-over-1-5-lakh-to-kin-of-us-student-killed-in-road-accident/story-bTWEi4cZ8EApyUfDBFbBZI.html

It will take some time to stabilise since it was suspended for a considerable time during the lockdown. Currently, all the 100 services are available, but people do not have proper information about it. We will launch a publicity campaign next week,” Delhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot told PTI.The 100 services to be provided at the doorstep of Delhiites include issuance of caste certificates, domicile certificates and marriage certificates, sewer connections, duplicate ration cards, learner’s licence, duplicate vehicle registration certificates and renewal of driving licence.The government has already hired a private company through which its services will be provided at the doorstep of the citizens and the company has hired “mobile sahayaks” (facilitators).A “mobile sahayak” will be equipped with all necessary equipment such as biometric devices and a camera. If a person wants to apply for a driving licence, he will have to call 1076 and give the details. Thereafter, the agency will assign a “mobile sahayak”, who will visit the applicant’s residence and get the required details and documents.The applicant has to pay Rs 50 more to avail the doorstep delivery of public services. The government has also set up a feedback system for the citizens availing the doorstep delivery of public services.

12-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad civic body plans five ‘garbage factories’ for recycling solid waste||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation officials have planned a “garbage factory” at each of the five zones of the city in a fresh strategy to deal with the disposal of solid waste generated daily. “Under the concept of garbage factory, we will be developing the facilities in each of the five zones under the corporation’s jurisdiction area. These will be developed on corporation land of about 5,000 to 10,000 square metres. Each factory will be able to process 250-500 metric tonnes of daily solid waste. Their capacity will be expandable to cater to 1000 metric tonnes in future and should suffice for the next 10 years. Presently, we have generation of about 1100 metric tonnes of solid waste generated per day,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The five factories will have boundary walls, sheds and green spaces where segregators will work on conveyor belts to sort out the daily solid waste. “The factories will have all facilities with two gates with one to be used for entry/exit of vehicles. Inside, there will be segregation of dry and wet waste. From the wet waste we will be producing manure while from the dry waste we will be hiring artistes, contractors who will be producing items from waste material. The five projects will be run on public-private partnership model with corporation providing land. A part of revenue will also be paid to the segregators,” he said.The corporation has started registering ragpickers who will be employed to segregate waste there by bringing them under the organised sector. According to officials, about 923 have registered so far since Monday. The city has about 10000-12000 unorganised ragpickers.  Tanwar said that the corporation has come up with the layout of a factory which is being fine tuned and request for proposal will be issued in another 10-15 days. The factories are likely to come up in the next six months. Once operational, door-to-door collection vehicles will not dump the collected waste outside localities at open dumping stations (from where it is further shifted to temporary landfill sites) but take it to the five zones for processing.. “This will also help in getting clean surroundings. Otherwise, the open waste attracts cattle and also ragpickers. We are hopeful that the things will work out as planned and we will be able to provide better cleanliness conditions in coming months,” Tanwar said. In the recently announced rankings under the Swachh Survekshan – 2020, the Ghaziabad city slipped to nineteenth spot from its thirteenth spot which it secured in 2019. One of the major areas where the city lost vital points was due to unscientific disposal of daily solid waste as its only landfill site at Pratap Vihar was closed down on directions of the UP solid waste monitoring committee last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-civic-body-plans-five-garbage-factories-for-recycling-solid-waste/story-rpLxvz9IqPjxtuxjaJHp6L.html
12-09-2020||City||Three held for credit card fraud in Delhi||New Delhi: Helped by three website designers who would procure details of credit card holders, and two other associates who would give bank accounts, a 23-year-old man duped credit card holders by promising them cash prizes and gifts on the points accrued on their credit spendings, police said on Saturday after nabbing three suspects. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said the prime accused, Manish Gupta, may have cheated 250 people over three yearseven as a probe is on to identify more victims. The crime came to the police’s notice when a CISF constable currently on deputation with CBI was duped of Rs 8,970 in January. The constable had received calls from a tele-caller offering him Rs15,000 cash rewards, some gifts and an opportunity to feature in a lucky draw for the points accrued on his credit card spendings. In his statement to Lodhi Colony police, the constable said he deposited nearly Rs9,000 in a bank account but did not receive the promised money. When he found the tele-caller’s phone number unreachable, he approached the cyber cell on September 6. When the cyber cell’s probe didn’t yield results, he again filed a complaint, but this time at the Lodhi Colony police station. When a new set of investigators began probing the crime, they realised the money was transferred to a PayTM account. “We soon got to know that the PayTM account was linked to a bank account,” the DCP said. The police soon tracked down the bank account holder, Ashish, who works at a garments store. “It emerged that Ashish and a civil defence volunteer, Abhishek, would lend their bank accounts to Gupta for receiving the cheated money. The duo would receive 20% commission on each amount that was deposited in their accounts,” the officer said. Soon, Abhishek and Gupta too were arrested. The police said Gupta had worked with a call centre until 2017 when he decided to quit that job and make quick money by cheating credit card holders. “He would receive details of credit card holders from three website designers who would receive a share of Gupta’s profits,” said the officer. Gupta too had allegedly opened nine bank accounts in his own name to receive the duped money. The police have so far frozen eight such bank accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-held-for-credit-card-fraud-in-delhi/story-F2JMxLSV7lnt6uOKfiBXhM.html
12-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s air quality remains‘moderate’, may dip further||With the air quality index (AQI) at 158 on Saturday, the air quality in Gurugram remained ‘moderate’ for the fourth consecutive day. After oscillating between ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ categories for weeks, the city’s air quality had dropped to the ‘moderate’ category on Wednesday.According to experts, air quality is expected to deteriorate further in the coming week.Saturday’s reading, as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board’s AQI bulletin, had deteriorated from Friday’s AQI at 143 (also in the ‘moderate’ category). The dip in air quality has been attributed to moisture in the air due to which pollutants are not getting dispersed. “There is a lot of moisture in the air, especially in the morning hours, due to which the pollutants are getting trapped. This time, we were lucky to have extended rains in August due to which a lower PM2.5 count had been prevailing until now. Lockdown restrictions in the earlier months, especially on construction activity and industries, also played a part in preventing an overall accumulation of pollutants initially. Later, the rains helped in washing them away,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist.Panwar added that pollution levels were expected to rise gradually, and the air quality might fall into the ‘poor’ category. “By next week or so, air quality might enter into the poor category,” he said.The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s most prominent pollutant, on Saturday, was at 119.3 µg/m³, according to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ category on Sunday.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature on Saturday was recorded at 37.1 degree Celsius, a marginal drop from Friday. The minimum temperature stood at 24.1 degree Celsius on Saturday. Gurugram’s maximum temperature is expected to hover around 36 degrees Celsius on Sunday, as per the India Meteorological Department’s weekly forecast. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 25 degrees on Sunday, as per the forecast. As per the weekly forecast, cloudy skies prevail until the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-air-quality-remains-moderate-may-dip-further/story-JYpC81SXj66Lw8DmboMFhJ.html
12-09-2020||City||Mohali: Covid patient declared dead, alive and then dead again||A miscommunication from a private hospital sent a Mohali family on an emotional rollercoaster ride on Saturday. It was around 7:30am that Sukhleen Singh Dhillon, a property consultant, received a phone call from Grecian Hospital in Sector 69 to inform him about his father’s death.His father, Ranbir Singh Dhillon, 70, a former president of the Phase 5 market association and also the truck union in Mohali, had been hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19. After informing their near and dear ones about the demise and making arrangements for the cremation, which was scheduled at 2pm, when the family reached the hospital to claim the elderly man’s body, something unusual happened. “At the time of clearing the dues, to our surprise, we were told that my father is alive and on ventilator,” said Sukhleen.However, when Sukhleen demanded to talk to the hospital management about this error, he was allegedly stopped by bouncers deployed there. This also led to a high drama near the hospital entrance in the afternoon. However, relieved that his father was still alive, he sent another message to all the near and dear ones, informing them about the development and asking them to pray for his speedy recovery. This relief was short-lived, as around 6pm, the family reportedly again received a message about Dhillon’s demise. The death has not yet been added to the district’s official Covid tally and there has been no independent confirmation from the hospital.However, earlier, talking about the error committed in the morning, its owner Dr Shivpreet Samra said: “It was a miscommunication on the staff’s part. We have issued a warning to the erring employee and directed all to be more careful. The staff is under tremendous stress these days.”The family, meanwhile, is making arrangements for the cremation to be held on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-covid-patient-declared-dead-alive-and-then-dead-again/story-nMyTJgZ2jEMY9d7y3yip2I.html
12-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Detailed project report for Khedla-Damdama Biodiversity Park to be ready in six months||Work on creating a detailed project report (DPR) for an upcoming biodiversity park near Damdama lake began on Saturday, with staffers from the district administration’s Gurujal department undertaking the first field survey of an eco-restoration site in Khedla village, in Sohna block, about 25 kilometres from the district headquarters. The proposal, being implemented under the Centre’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan, involves creating a native Aravalli forest on approximately 400 acres of hilly land over the next five years, officials said. Gurujal staffers on Saturday said that preparing the DPR would take at least six months, and that a final report would be submitted to the state government for approval by March next year. In the interim, environmental engineers, civil engineers, biodiversity specialists and community managers working under the Gurujal initiative will conduct extensive surveys to assess the current status of the area’s biodiversity and hydrology.In addition, a socio-economic assessment of Damdama and Khedla villages, whose 1,500-odd residents (as per the Census 2011) continue to depend on the forests for grazing animals and collecting fuelwood, will be conducted. Narender Raghav, sarpanch of the Khedla gram panchayat, said, “In other parts of the district, common lands are being privatised and encroached upon. That’s not what we want for our village. We agreed to give our common lands for the project because we hope to create employment for the village youngsters and also to give them a sense of pride.” Sachin Kumar, technical manager, Gurujal, said, “The total area of Damdama and Khedla villages is about 500 acres, of which 400 acres of common village land, which comes under the ownership of the two gram panchayats, will be restored. The area has the potential to a be rich forest with native vegetation. As part of our fieldwork over the next six months, we will be creating plantation management plan to identify which native species are to be planted, and how to control the growth of invasive weeds and trees. By March we are also hoping to set up a nursery on the site.” Sunil Harsana, an independent ecologist from Faridabad’s Mangar village, who led Saturday’s survey of Khedla site, said, “This particular area has a richer presence of native rootstock than other Aravalli patches in Gurugram, such as Bandhwari, which have been denuded due to mining and real estate.” While invasive species, such as mesquite trees, are also prevalent in the Damdama-Khedla patch, the vegetation is not as denuded, he explained, adding that the biotic pressures on this forest are mainly from grazing and collecting of wood, which is far more manageable than rampant encroachment. “It is the right place for eco-restoration.”Over the next six months, field staff will divide the area into 50 acre plots, which will be surveyed independently. The local biodviersity management committee (BMC), which has already been set up under the aegis of the gram panchayats, will aid the staff in creating a local biodiversity register, cataloging species of plants, wild mammals, reptiles and birds. This is the first step in a seven-stage process, known as biodiversity resolution.Following this, the Gurujal department will seek administrative approval for preparation of the DPR, after which the forest and land revenue departments will demarcate the area for ecorestoration. This will be followed by construction of a boundary wall along the site, setting up of a nursery, and ‘earth preparation’ work, and will be ultimately succeeded by a mass plantation drive aimed for the next monsoon season. “The plantation work, when it begins will progress plot-wise, and the park will be generated 50 to 100 acres at a time, over the next five years,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, programme manager, Gurujal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-detailed-project-report-for-khedla-damdama-biodiversity-park-to-be-ready-in-six-months/story-xcnle0zmliSchKCrpGMLzK.html

Pending issues concerning both allottees and land owners are being finalised”, said Yadav, adding that claims of those whose land was acquired by HSVP are also being assessed on priority. Plot buyers can also get occupation certificates, transfer property and also complete other formalities as required under the regulations. Santokh Singh, one of the landowners, who is also one of the petitioner in the case said they had filed the petition in the HC to get their land released. “This land was acquired forcefully by the then government due to political reasons. We will appeal against this decision in the Supreme Court, and are confident that justice will be done,” he said.In July over 100 plot owners in sector 57 had got relief from Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had vacated the stay on maintaining status quo and had granted permission for development of these properties. In the matter of sector 57, the land owner had petitioned for status quo and opposed the acquisition of his land as being in violation of rules. The acquisition of land in sector 52 and 57 was started in 2000 and majority of the land falls in Wazirabad village. The ownership of plots was offered from 2004 onwards. The plots in question are of different sizes and are in between four marlas (121 square yards) and one kanal (605 square yards).Land owners in Wazirabad had maintained that acquisition was in violation of rules and the compensation paid to them was quite less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-relief-for-146-plot-owners-in-sector-52-after-hc-vacates-stay-on-construction/story-1STqQ4ulhLEc2qpaLgjrLI.html
12-09-2020||Gurugram||Man posing as IPS officer, his friend held for stealing over 200 cars from Delhi-NCR||The Faridabad police have arrested two men — including a 24-year-old postgraduate posing as an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer — for their alleged involvement in over 200 vehicle theft cases from Delhi-NCR. According to the police, the suspects were identified as Abang Mehtab, the mastermind who posed as the assistant commissioner of police(ACP) of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and Kabir Khan — both hailing from Manipur. They were arrested from the Delhi-Faridabad border on Thursday while allegedly trying to cross the border in a stolen car, the police said.The police allegedly recovered one country-made pistol and six different kinds of identity cards from their possession. They were produced before the court on Friday and taken on an eight-day police remand, said the police.OP Singh, Faridabad commissioner of police, said that the suspects are good friends. They used to fly from Imphal to the national Capital and drove back with stolen cars. “Mehtab took advantage of his physical appearance and used his fake identity cards to skip paying tolls and avail free stays in hotels while travelling. When anyone asked him to show his identity card, he presented a fake IPS card. Even during lockdown, he travelled in different vehicles using a fake pass. Since he wore wear a uniform, he never got caught,” he said. The police said they would steal at least 10-15 cars every month from Delhi but, during the lockdown, they managed to steal only eight cars. They sold them to a dealer in Thoubal, Manipur. Mehtab has completed his MPhil in sociology from Manipur, said the police. Singh said the duo is involved in more than 200 car thefts of all high-end segment luxury cars. Mehtab used to allegedly drive while returning to Manipur with the stolen car. They used to reach their home town within three days covering a distance of nearly 2,500 kilometres. “They used to drive to Manipur and asked for an exemption at toll booths using the fake identity cards through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The suspects, along with their close aide who deals in second-hand cars, would tamper with the chassis number of the vehicles and forged documents to get them registered with transport authorities in Manipur. We are probing the involvement of car dealers and transport authorities in the racket,” he said. A case under sections 170 (impersonating a public servant), 419 (punishment for cheating by impersonation), 420 (fraud), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections of Arms Act has been filed at Sarai Khwaja police station. The crime unit of Faridabad’s Sector 30 team led by inspector Vimal Kumar arrested the duo. Singh said the mastermind had a collection of pictures stored on his mobile phone wearing a police uniform holding AK-47 and other weapons to influence people on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-posing-as-ips-officer-his-friend-held-for-stealing-over-200-cars-from-delhi-ncr/story-fHXalf19HA9h9mNSh9d6FJ.html

Gupta, who scored a 441 AIR, said consistency was key.The JEE Main is the qualifying exam for JEE Advanced, which is the entrance exam for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).A total of 6.35 lakh students had appeared for the exam that was conducted in two shifts from September 1 to 6. Gupta secured a 99.96 percentile, which is the highest in the city.Gupta, who wants to become an IAS officer, said it was important to remain focussed. “I took coaching from two private institutes. To attain a good rank, it is necessary to take guidance from experts to clear doubts. Regular tests, too, help improve scores.”The 17-year-old had attempted the paper once in January and scored 99.97 percentile and again in September “to improve my score”. He plans to pursue BTech in computer science from IIT Delhi.“If the government could allow the NTA to conduct the exam (amid the pandemic), they should have allowed students to visit coaching institutes to clear their doubts. I lost my momentum during preparation and used to miss interactions with my teachers and friends in class,” said Gupta.His father, Rajan Gupta, works in the insurance department at a private firm, and mother, Seema Mittal, is a mathematics teacher at NM Jain Senior Secondary School. He credited his success to his teachers and parents, who “supported and encouraged me”. A student of Kundan Vidya Mandir School, he even scored 96.8% in Class 12.The JEE Advanced exam scheduled to be held on September 27 will be held in two shifts—Paper 1 (9am to 12pm) and Paper 2 (2.30pm to 5.30pm).

At a meeting organised at a banquet hall in Dugri area on Saturday, the dealers said the central government had allowed 100 persons at gatherings from September 21, yet the state government had not lifted the restriction.They said associated businesses, including decorators and caterers, had extended support to their protest and will also keep their shops closed on the two days.The tent dealers complained that over 10 lakh people were directly or indirectly involved in the business and were struggling to make ends, as no events were taking place due to restriction on gatherings since the lockdown began in March.“We have been demanding that the government extend the limit to 200 or 300 persons, as we can make arrangements to maintain social distancing. But, the government is not even allowing 100 persons despite the union government permitting it,” said Shiv Shankar Rai, general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers Welfare Association.“No events are taking place due to the restrictions and dealers have suffered heavy losses. Most employees have lost their jobs, but the government is still not paying heed to our problems,” said Rai. The dealers said due to depleting funds, many of them had been forced to change vocation. While some were selling vegetables, a few were forced to work as drivers to make ends meet.“We are ready to follow the norms and help the government fight with the pandemic. But, the government should also be sensitive to our problems. Apart from keeping shops closed, protest marches will be organised at the district level and memorandums will be handed over to the administration and Congress MLAs,” said Raj Aggarwal, president, Ludhiana Tent Dealers Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-tent-dealers-raise-pitch-against-30-person-limit-on-gatherings/story-FPhLVhgvaKUdX1OQJSO2wN.html

The bio-methanation plant will recycle biodegradable waste from around 4,000 flats and 300 bungalows. The authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari opened the facility for operations officially along with the authority’s health department officials. “Our objective is to make waste management better in the city, and eventually make Noida the cleanest city. If residents will come forward to help, then the city will handle the waste in a better manner,” said Maheshwari.The authority has spent ₹60 lakh on the development of the plant that will recycle the household waste right in the residential area and also generate cooking gas and electricity from it. The federation of RWAs has also provided ₹12 lakh for this project. A private agency has been appointed by the residents’ body to run the facility.“As per the arrangement, the agency will provide us with 25% of the compost generated at the plant which will be used in our parks and green areas. They will sell 75% of the compost to generate revenue. Apart from this, the agency will supply electricity and biogas to a nearby hospital and school to get more revenue,” said Dharmendra Sharma, general secretary, federation of sector RWAs (sector 34). Sector 34 has 14 apartment complexes, each with its own apartment owners’ association (AOA) and 300 plotted houses. “We formed the federation and started the biogas plant so that the household waste except plastic or glass does not go out for the treatment. All associations and residents are supporting this project that will make our area better,” said KK Jain, president, federation of RWAs (sector 34 ).Each apartment association has also been provided one battery-operated e-rickshaw for the transportation of the biodegradable waste to the plant. Each rickshaw cost ₹2.30 lakh and a total of 14 e-rickshaws are engaged in transporting the waste from the households to the plant. “We have requested all citizens to segregate the waste at their homes, and hand put the biodegradable waste to the e-rickshaw, so that it reaches the plant for the treatment,” said Sharma. The federation of RWAs has decided to fund the daily operations of the plant. “Each association will work out an arrangement with residents and raise funds to support this project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/biogas-plant-in-sector-34-becomes-operational-waste-from-over-4-000-homes-to-be-recycled/story-H2YXQ0ztZSrybBr7XsJhTM.html

Officials said that with this development, bids for the civil construction work, which are pending, are being accepted, the last date for which is September 30.The project is proposed as a new highway which will serve as an alternate between Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and is likely to shorten the travelling distance by about 70km. As of now, commuters travelling to Dehradun from Delhi take an old route which is about 250km, navigating through Ghaziabad (Delhi Meerut Road) as well as congested stretches of Meerut, Muzffarnagar, Roorkee and Haridwar.According to NHAI, the new route will span about 180km and its first phase, which will be about 32km. The first phase will start from Akshardham in Delhi to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) interchange at Baghpat in western Uttar Pradesh. They added that in-principle approvals were given for the project in March.“We have now received financial approval for the first stretch – from Akshardham to EPE interchange at Baghpat. This comprises two packages – package 1 from Akshardham to Khekra (14.75km) in Baghpat and package 2 from Khekra to EPE interchange (16.45km) in Baghpat. The approval for package 1 is for ₹1,300 crore while that for package 2 is ₹1,900 crore,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.Under the project, the stretch in Delhi will have a six kilometre elevated section while about 12.5km of another elevated section will be under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh, officials said.They added that the financial approval came through last week by the NHAI board, which comprises officials of NHAI as well as that from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, as members. “With the financial approval now given, bids for civil construction work which were pending can now be submitted by September 30. Once work starts, we will be able to complete the project (phase 1) by the end of 2022. The other part from Baghpat to Dehradun is under stage of preparation of the detailed project report and tenders are likely to be called in next six months,” Garg added.Officials added that once the entire highway from Delhi to Dehradun gets complete, commuters will be able to cover the distance within a mere two-and-a-half hours, which otherwise takes about five and half hours.According to official estimates, the Baghpat to Dehradun stretch is pegged at a cost of ₹4,830 crore and is estimated to get completed in a span of three to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akshardham-to-baghpat-stretch-of-delhi-dehradun-highway-gets-financial-approval/story-PA8w9wj8RenIsn6Wdt5BxK.html

12-09-2020||Noida||Covid-19 cases cross the 10,000-mark in GB Nagar, 1,000 reported in just 4 days||In the worst ever wave of Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar district so far, the overall cases took just four days to rise from 9,000 and breach the 10,000-mark on Saturday. According to official figures, with 198 new positive cases on Saturday, GB Nagar’s overall tally is now 10,006. On September 8, the district had just crossed the 9,000-mark. District magistrate Suhas LY said despite the sudden surge in cases, his administration is ready to tackle the situation. “Our hospitals (L1, L2 and L3) have enough beds and ventilators to take care of patients. The ditrict’s case fatality rate (CFR) is only 0.47%, which is much better than the national CFR of 1.69% and the state CFR of 1.42%. The lowest CFR among the districts in Uttar Pradesh having over 4,000 cases, clearly indicates that GB Nagar’s sampling rate and recovery rate are going upward. Since all economic activities are open now, our role is to implement strict containment rules and reduce the CFR,” he said. The DM further said the administration has ramped up testing and started effective monitoring of patients under home isolation. “We are also ensuring early hospitalisation of critical patients and efficient infection control by comprehensive contact tracing and surveillance,” Suhas said. The state government, on the other hand, has asked all districts to hold ‘Complete Solution Day’ on every first and third Tuesdays of the month. “We will create awareness among the people about the use of masks and sanitizers, besides asking them to follow social distancing norms at all times,” he said. The district administration has come out with a fresh list of 405 containment zones, including 384 in Category-1 (where there is only one case) and other 21 in Category-2 (more than one case). Under Category-1, a containment zone in an urban area will cover all houses within a 250-metre radius of the patient or the entire mohalla (floor, in case the patient resides in a society). In Category-2, there will be an added 250-metre buffer zone (tower and common facilities, in case of a society). GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said as per the instructions given by the state health department, several measures are being taken to increase surveillance and minimise the fatality rate. “While reviewing the Covid-19 scenario in the district on Friday, state health minister also asked us to conduct at least 5,000 tests a day. Our team of doctors and paramedics are already on the job. It is obvious that when testing increases, so will the cases,” he said. It may be noted that in March and April, 38 and 100 cases were reported in the district, respectively. In May, 315 cases were recorded and 1,759 in June. It surged to 2,794 in July and 2,864 in August. But the 12 days of September have already seen 2,261 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-cases-cross-the-10-000-mark-in-gb-nagar-1-000-reported-in-just-4-days/story-p47LWxqBz6IWZT6AhMNbOJ.html

In the 12 days of September, the district has added 2,209 new Covid-19 cases, up significantly from the same period in August, when 1,524 new infections were added to the district’s tally. “The rise is on account of opening of activities after lockdown. We have asked officials to strictly monitor containment zones, and police officers will strictly enforce social distancing norms, and ensuring that people who do not wear masks get penalised. Even if cases rise, our prime focus will be on curbing fatalities. At present, we have the necessary medicines and equipment to deal with fresh cases and more resources will be roped in soon,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “We have also roped in mobile teams that will reach out to people in localities and check their health status. Further, awareness programs will also be organised,” he added. The district crossed 10,000 cases on September 10. “People are moving about freely, sometimes avoid wearing masks and fail to maintain social distancing. On our part, we are focussed on testing more people and sending them to isolation facilities if they test positive. Our surveillance activities are also going on a daily basis. The rise in number of cases is also seen in nearby districts,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-303-ghaziabad-sees-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-on-saturday/story-vFaeXYhE5zveSGKthKaA3K.html

12-09-2020||City||Panchkula citizens body to field member in upcoming mayoral polls||The members of Citizens’ Welfare Association (CWA) here have decided to ask one of its members to contest the upcoming civic body elections for the post of mayor.The decision has come after a collective resolution by the members of 37 Residents Welfare Associations (RWAs) affiliated to the CWA in Panchkula.“Political interference into MC’s day-to-day working and has caused major frauds at the cost of public money. Even after pointing out the matter to the high-ups and the state government, nothing has been done to rectify the same,” said CWA president SK Nayar, a Sector 15 resident.To work together for the betterment and development of Panchkula, the CWA has also formed a central working committee for which roles have been assigned to its various members. Nayar is the committee’s president (ex-officio member), while Sunil Jain of Sector 11 is the general secretary. Rakesh Sondhi of Sector 21 is the joint secretary and Bhagwan Das Mittal of Sector 25 and MR Syal of Sector 18 are members.“Despite raising residents’ issues time and again, the councillors have failed to resolve them. So, we have decided to support those who want to fight the MC elections,” the CWA president said.A meeting of the CWA members and RWAs will be conducted soon to discuss the matter in detail for the betterment of residents and development works required in Panchkula, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-citizens-body-to-field-member-in-upcoming-mayoral-polls/story-P8uSnpkMKqpt1lV3oC4B0I.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav named in Delhi riots supplementary charge sheet||The Delhi Police has named CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, economist Jayati Ghosh and Delhi University professor Apoorvanand in a supplementary charge sheet in the February riots cases, accusing them of “provoking and mobilising” anti-CAA protesters.Some of those named have also been charged with -- based on the statements of three students already arrested in the case -- asking the protesters to go to ¨any extreme¨, spreading “discontent” in the community by calling CAA/NRC anti-Muslim, and organising demonstrations to “malign the image of the Government of India”.Their names appeared in the supplementary charge sheet, a copy of which is with the PTI, filed by the police on the riots in North East District between February 23 and 26, which claimed 53 lives and left 581 injured, 97 of them having gunshot wounds. After repeated attempts for his comments, Yogendra Yadav said, ¨I notice that the passing reference to me does not even contain one sentence from my speech. I find it surprising that the Delhi Police has made no effort to see the recording of my speeches all of which are in the public domain.” These eminent personalities have been named based on the statements of the three students -- women’s collective Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, and Gulfisha Fathima of Jamia Milia Islamia -- in the Jafrabad violence, from where the riots spread to other parts of north-east Delhi.All three are facing charges under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Also read: Delhi riots: Former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain moves Delhi high court against 3-day ED custodyIn the charge sheet, which was made public just two days before the commencement of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, the Delhi Police has claimed that Kalita and Narwal admitted to not just their complicity in the riots but also named Ghosh, Apoorvanand and documentary filmmaker Rahul Roy as their mentors, who allegedly asked them to carry out the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and go to ¨any extreme¨.Their similarly-worded disclosure statements – mentioned in the charge sheet – claimed that the two JNU students said they organised the Daryaganj protest in December and the Jafrafad chakka jam (road block) against the CAA on February 22, 2020 at the behest of Ghosh, Apoorvanand and Roy.Reacting to the charge sheet, Yechury hit out at the government through a series of tweets. ¨The Delhi Police is under the Centre and the Home Ministry. Its illegitimate, illegal actions are a direct outcome of the politics of BJP’s top leadership. They are scared of legitimate peaceful protests by mainstream political parties & are misusing state power to target the Opposition,” he said. In another tweet, Yechury questioned as to why the “hate speeches” made during the riots were not investigated.¨There is a video of poisonous speeches, why are they not being processed? Because the government has ordered that the opposition be wrapped up, either way. This is the real face, character, tricks and thinking of Modi and BJP. There will be opposition,¨ he said. Delhi Police Additional PRO Anil Mittal said, “The names are part of the disclosure statement of one of the accused in connection with organizing and addressing the Anti-CAA protests. The disclosure statement has been truthfully recorded as narrated by the accused person. A person is not arraigned as an accused only on the basis of disclosure statement.” “However, it is only on the existence of sufficient corroborative evidence does further legal action is taken. The matter is currently subjudice,” he said.Kalita and Narwal also told the police that Ghosh, Apoorvanand and Roy coordinated with the Islamist group Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Jamia Coordination Committee to mentor the Pinjra Tod members to carry forward their campaign against the CAA, according to the charge sheet.Also read: Police framing anti-CAA protestors in Delhi riots cases, allege activistsThe police have used Jamia student Fathima’s statement to corroborate the ensuing events. The charge sheet claims that apart from Yechury and Yogendra Yadav, Fathima’s statement mentions Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Ravan, United Against Hate activist Umar Khalid and some leaders from the Muslim community including ex-MLA Mateen Ahmed, and MLA Amannatullah Khan. The document, quoting statements of those arrested, indicated that these people aided the conspirators.In her statement, Fathima said that she was told to organise the protest to “malign the image of the Government of India”, the police claimed. In her statement, included in the charge sheet, she says that ¨big leaders and lawyers started coming in to provoke and mobilize this crowd, including Omar Khalid, Chandrashekhar Ravan, Yogendar Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, and lawyer Mahmood Pracha, etc”.“Pracha said that the sit-in demonstration is your democratic right and the rest of the leaders filled the feeling of discontent in the community by calling CAA/NRC anti-Muslim” she said, as per the charge sheet. According to the charge sheet, Kalita added, “Umar Khalid had also given some tips for doing protest against CAA/NRC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-cops-name-yechury-three-others-in-supplementary-charge-sheet/story-PpetKduMkqzPXil3tjwYAJ.html

As per officials, the municipal corporation (MC) had received around 130 applications for regularisation of colonies under the policies floated by the state government on different occasions including the one floated in 2018.On September 1, RTI activist Kuldeep Sigh Khaira had filed a complaint with chief secretary Vini Mahajan stating that applications for newly-developed colonies had been accepted with backdate entries.Khaira had stated that only the colonies developed before March 19, 2018, could be regularised under the policy floated by the state government and the department had to dispose of the applications in two months after submission. He had alleged that the applications were pending for over a year now, adding that he would be forced to move the Punjab and Haryana high court if no action was taken on his complaint in 10 days.Apart from seeking FIRs against the colonisers under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA), 1995, Khaira had aso demanded FIRs against officials who accepted the applications. “On checking the date of issuance of stamp papers, authorities can find out whether the applications have been submitted with backdate entries or not,” said Khaira.MTP Surinder Singh Bindra said, “The department has till November end to dispose of the applications and the ATPs have been directed to verify the documents and stamp papers. Mayor Balkar Sandhu is also keeping a check. FIRs will be lodged against the colonisers if anomalies are found in their applications.”GLADA razes four illegal coloniesTaking action against construction of illegal colonies, the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) razed four colonies that were being developed illegally in Uchi Mangli, Kotla Afgan and Jandiali amid resistance by the colonisers.Sub-divisional engineer Ashish said, “The team demolished offices of colonisers and a few other buildings in the colonies.

It sure is a season that is seeing all sorts of crossing – from crossing of borders to Corona crossing the million or trillion mark to Trump, Tractors (tinsel town ones razing star offices) or Tirades (in Sushant sleuthing opera) crossing limits.Interestingly, as a subtext of the Lockdown and Unlock narratives, there has been another ‘cross’ action that has gone unsung. And it is being staged by none other than New Normal’s Digital Living Room – Zoom.It’s called the Great Indian Cross Talk Boom on Zoom.There is recession left, right and centre – in the economy at the macro level, in its malls, multiplexes or migrants’ livelihoods at the micro level; recession has not even spared the New National Lower Dress of India Unlocking, for under the visible elitism or formalism of white-collared shirts for #WFH webinars, there lurk the lower wear’s invisible receding hemlines – micro minis or micro shorts.Ah, but there’s one place that is showing signs of zero recession – The Big Loud Indian Boom on Zoom.Coming to the cross talk, it could be happening on any stage – the bedroom-turned-into-WFH office, balconies-turned-into-Lockdown’s Living Rooms, or crammed Condo life’s common corridors doubling as the new Pandemic’s Parks for Perambulations.The Great Indian Cross Talk Boom on Zoom is to the ‘Virtual is the New Real’ narrative what cross caterwauling among primetime panellists is to an Arnab Goswami studio.If you’ve been a Couch Potato-esque spectator to an Arnab show – Arnab and panellists all jibber-jabbering at cross purposes like amplified All India Radio shows stranded on or straddling jumbled airwaves – you’ll get a drift of the overlapping sub-narratives on Zoom, Google Meet & Co.Who better to bear testimony to it than our Lollitas, Lamba jis & Lally jis!Of pay cuts & peanutsPicture scenario One. Lollita is lolling in the living room, smartphone in hand, wish-list in the head and frown on the forehead, tapping the touchscreen fast and furious. Fast, because, on the one hand, she’s chattering into a Zoom call with her literati gang and with the other hand she’s frantically keying into the iPad her Long List of groceries, confectioneries or toiletries, to be appended to Lamba ji’s Long Short List for Big Basket. Furious, because of the insanely irritating responses she is begetting from Lamba ji, who is babbling on his Zoom with the office guy gang.Lamba ji’s one ear encased in the earphone, the other earphone is levitating between a northern and southern latitude, thanks to his lackadaisical attitude. Lollita divines in it a sign from a cooperating Cosmos that he’s lending her an ear.The conversation could be trundling on these lines:Lollita lulls her lungs to a whisper between her Zoom call, “Are these on the Short List … Dried Red Chilli?”“Oye Oye, Sheikh Chilli!” Lamba ji guffaws gregariously at some babbling bloke in his Zoom grid, thinking Lollita to be rambling to her literary gang, but treating her prattling as a prompting (with key words), to steer his Zoom chat.“Do I keep this on my Long List … Masala peanuts?”“Peanuts … that’s what my poor, pandemic pay slip looks like!” Lamba ji lapses into a lament about recession on his Zoom, not forgetting its fallout on the density of his cranial crop.“Dranex … Will ‘one’ instead of ‘two’ drain cleaners do?” Lollita whispers aside again.“Damn Downsizing! How our lifestyles are going down the drain!” Lamba ji babbles his boom into Zoom.The curious case of “Honey, I shrunk the Long Short List.”Of Pandemic’s Parks & Crammed CorridorsPicture Scenario Two. Lollita steps out on the seventh floor of their sky-rise into the common corridors, the Pandemic’s new parks.She’s hoping to kill two birds with a stone – catch up with cousins on Zoom and bestir bloating limbs into downsized Zumba.Behold, at the same time, the neighbouring Khullar jis, Khanna jis & Co sprint out on a similar mission, except they’re not only killing two birds with a stone, but doing bit of “bird” watching, too.“How I needed to stretch my feet!” Lollita chirrups into Zoom.“Five feet … chalegi chalegi,” Khullar ji jibber-jabbers into his Zoom call.“Sweetie, that deal, did you manage to close it?” Lollita asks her corporate cousin.“Close … Come close … give me a better view,” Khullar ji coos, ostensibly into Zoom.Lollita goggles at him with a glare as glacial as the Gangotri glacier.“These creeps, my foot!” Lollita thunders, half into her Zoom grid.“How many foot?” Khullar ji persists in prodding his property dealer for ‘specs’, as Lollita slips from the scene.The curious case of “Honey, I shrunk (away) from the Grids!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-my-big-loud-indian-boom-on-zoom/story-l2R8LoTRKeg62zP9V0oGgO.html
12-09-2020||City||Ludhiana MC floats tenders for e-auction of parking lots; BRS Nagar shopkeepers cry foul||The fund-starved municipal corporation (MC) on Saturday floated tenders for the e-auction of six parking lots in the city scheduled to be held on October 7. The total reserve price for the lots is nearly ₹2.39 crore.The lots up for auction include multi-storey parking near MC Zone A office (reserve price ₹80.5 lakh); tuition market in Model Town Extension (reserve price ₹28.3 lakh); BRS Nagar, near Orient Cinema (reserve price ₹18.5 lakh); Bahadur House (reserve price ₹27.5 lakh); Sarabha Nagar Block-I market (reserve price ₹4 lakh); and Feroze Gandhi Market parking lot (reserve price ₹80.1 lakh).The MC officials said the reserve price had been set as per the highest bids received last year. As the contracts of Feroze Gandhi Market and Sarabha Nagar Block-I market could not be allotted last year, the reserve price for both the lots was the same as last year.The previous contracts will end in the last week of September after a one-month extension was given to the contractors as compensation for the losses incurred during the lockdown.One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said the parking lot at Model Town Extension had been discontinued by the previous contractor due to low footfall amid pandemic. The MC was not expecting to get favourable responses this time either, the official added. MC secretary Neeraj Jain said the tender documents will be uploaded on the website: www.tenderwizard.com/DLGP so that interested parties could go through the terms and conditions. E-ticketing will be made mandatory at the lots. The technical bids can be submitted till October 5 (11am).BRS Nagar shopkeepers oppose paid parkingThe shopkeepers at BRS Nagar Block-F market on Friday submitted a memorandum with the MC, in opposition to paid parking.The shopkeepers said they were already reeling under losses due to low footfall in markets and paid parking would further push away customers.President of the market association, Dilbagh Singh, said, “The contract of parking lots is ending in the last week of September and we have asked the authorities to discontinue the same. The shopkeepers are already struggling to make ends meet and paid parking will further reduce footfall. We submitted a memorandum with zonal commissioner Kulpreet Singh on Friday and the authorities have asked us to visit MC office on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-floats-tenders-for-e-auction-of-parking-lots-brs-nagar-shopkeepers-cry-foul/story-DEiwUgPhPNuQhhV5l3ejGP.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Pied cuckoo Megh goes off satellite’s radar||The monsoons are ebbing and a historic project on bird migration is poised to take off this month. Two Pied cuckoos, tagged with satellite transmitters of 2g each and named Megh and Chatak, are expected to commence migration to Africa. Scientists are expecting to get their first definitive information on the paths they take. Associated deeply with Indian cultures and classical Sanskrit poetry as the harbinger of monsoons, the cuckoo flies into north India ahead of the monsoons to lay eggs in the nests of other birds, especially babblers. But a setback has got scientists worried as one of the tagged cuckoos, Megh, is not sending data. That means either a technical malfunction or the tag dropping off.The cuckoo research project is part of the Indian Bioresource Network (IBIN) project of the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. The IBIN project is funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). This research comes in the wake of conclusive findings by international and Indian scientists of the migration paths of the Amur falcon and Common cuckoo to Africa, after travelling through India, by tracking these species through satellite tags.Commenting on the Megh setback, Dr R Suresh Kumar of the WII told this writer: “That is something to worry about. It cannot be fixed unless I retrieve (the tag) and send it back to the company. The cuckoos don’t respond to call playback so have not been able to locate them. I have one person looking for them but he is observing three others and one is Chatak. Megh comes from a different area and he is unable to see it there. A Covid outbreak in the WII campus has constrained my movements in the field to trace Megh.”Dr Kumar is hoping the project will provide a clear perspective to speculation that cuckoos could be going in for an elliptical migration, ie, choosing different paths to come to north India from Africa and while returning to Africa. Or, could it be that a section of cuckoos do not return to Africa and stay put in south India after flying down there from north India in September-October? Finding Megh soon will be crucial to determining the truth about a wondrous bird that has engaged the Indian imagination since centuries like few avians have.SERPENTS OF PARADISE LOSTA startling manifestation of climate change is evident in the erstwhile paradise of India. Ever since epic floods swept Srinagar in 2014, snakes have surfaced in urban areas and these include the highly-venomous Levantine vipers, known in Kashmir as the ‘Gunas’. To meet the challenge of frantic calls from Srinagar residents, a courageous lady wildlife conservationist, Aaliya Mir, has rescued 110 snakes of six different species since 2014. As project head, Jammu & Kashmir, of the NGO, Wildlife SOS, Mir’s work has also shed light on the serpents of this blighted vale, which had escaped the detailed scrutiny of herpetologists due to their obscure habits and remote locations. The serpent-human face-offs got highlighted because they surfaced in the most posh avenue and venue of Sringar. Four vipers were spotted and rescued at former chief minister Omar Abdullah’s residence on the fabled Gupkar Road, one last year and three this year. Abdullah, who has declared he will vacate his residence as he finds himself in unauthorised occupation due to entitlement changes brought about by the state’s reorganisation last year, was quite tense about the intruders. “Omar Abdullah was tense and wanted us to find a solution so that vipers never come into his residence again. But I told him that since your residence is located in the Dachigam foothills, which is the viper’s main habitat, the snakes will venture down and it cannot be avoided. His residence’s large, landscaped garden has plenty of hedges and shrubs, in which vipers can hide easily,” Mir told this writer.At the end of Gupkar road stands an iconic hotel, the Lalit Grand Palace, that truly symbolises the grandeur of Kashmir’s tourist, golf and Bollywood legacy. Before the gun turned Kashmir into a living hell, the hotel was known as the Oberoi Palace and the favoured haunt of legendary actors. An exclusive mini-golf course for hotel guests landscaped with apple and Chinar trees adjoined the main premises.Zeenat Aman in her heydays would breeze through the hotel’s lobby leaving onlookers gasping while the villain actor, Ranjit, in black dress and black cowboy hat, would be found sipping chilled beer at the outdoor bar in the shadows of stately Chinar trees amid open-hand-sized Kashmir roses. Not to forget dashing Dharm paaji accompanied by his customary retinue, the suave Feroz Khan and his gorgeous sister, Dilshad, married into a Kashmir family and sporting waterfall tresses of almond hair.Their presence made the hotel a favourite buzz point for tourists wanting to gawk and giggle at filmstars in real life. Well, those memories haunt the hotel like leaves lost in Autumn’s fires and which summer shall not return, but snakes have taken up some of the vacated space. Mir has rescued a sun bingeing viper and two Himalayan Trinket snakes from the hotel’s postcard-perfect grand lawns that overlook the Dal lake’s grieving silence and empty shikaras. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-pied-cuckoo-megh-goes-off-satellite-s-radar/story-X5yG907QsfpsyNDS4f9obJ.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: We have to compel the media to change||“Those were the days my friend. We thought they’d never end!” Thus go the lines of the immortal Mary Hopkin song. And they convey a truism which is applicable to many aspects of our lives: Changing times usually lead old timers to bemoan the passing of their halcyon days.But in this write up I will focus on the turbulent times that the media has manufactured, much of it the result of its shenanigans and lopsided priorities. Gone are those golden days when upright and diligent media persons would earnestly go about their business of reporting fairly and objectively. Gone also are the days when the very dull but usually correct Doordarshan news bulletins would inform us without ever even pretending to entertain us.There are many media professionals even today who proudly hold aloft the torch of propriety, professionalism and probity. But it is a well-known fact that a large section of the mass media, particularly the electronic media, has gone berserk in seeking narrow gains, thereby forsaking larger objectives that should otherwise be its focus.Enough has been written and said about the abominable levels of debate which a few television channels dish out ad nauseam. They seem truly hell-bent upon adding venom to our minds and lives, come what may. Never is the tone of their so-called discussions even passable, as the French would put it. They are always loud, boorish, detestable and pathetic.But why should the nation watch them for so many collective hours? Why are their TRPs so high? Do we as a people take pleasure in the voyeuristic process of tearing down people’s reputations? Is there no responsibility that the viewer has? How will such channels sell their shoddy wares if the people at large shun them for being intolerable?Those media houses, particularly of the print media domain, which have avoided the temptation to profit by churning out utter trash, need to be recognised for their sense of rectitude. By calling a spade a spade and by focussing on the real issues of the day, of which there is no dearth, these valiant lighthouses are helping us stay afloat.It is no secret that large business houses directly control media channels these days. And they clearly have their own agendas. By not reining them in, the establishment is causing grave harm to the society at large. If controls are not implemented or strengthened, the levels of mass discourse in this country will plummet to unfathomable lows. And they are already well-nigh on the way towards those hellish destinations.A society which habitually focusses upon the real problems of the day, along with music, sports, the arts and creativity, would naturally be superior to one which zooms in on people’s dirty linen and criminal acts. The names of some fallen stars are being bandied about these days as if they have been a part of our folklore forever. Each sentence that people utter seems to contain their names, to the extent that one wants to avoid even mentioning them in this piece.We the people are ultimately responsible for the leaders we throw up, for the type of mass media we consume and for the atmosphere that we continue to create for ourselves. Our focus as responsible citizens has to be on constructive dialogue instead of derisive bombardment of other people.“Dearest TV media and vans outside my home. Please do not stress and work so hard!”, advised Amitabh Bachchan recently. All of us should actually make it clear to TV channels that they are overdoing their act by far. If they would suddenly do the unthinkable and practise calmness, the mood of the nation would improve drastically.As for me. I stopped watching the TV news long ago, much to the amusement of some friends. Why should I spend my evenings with channels whose despicable existence depends on how many people are watching them? I think my vote against them counts!“Whoever controls the media controls the mind,” Jim Robinson, American songwriter, said ominously. Let us make efforts to control our own minds, ladies and gentlemen, no matter who controls the media.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-we-have-to-compel-the-media-to-change/story-5IBuVMIeKHp3AkDWOqdtwJ.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: The endearing story of the lost girl named Love||The first time I set my eyes on the picture of the lovely Preet Nagar girl was way back in 1978 when, smitten by the love and legend of Punjabi poet, the late Shiv Batalvi, a friend and I decided to write a book on his life and times. We were visiting his wife Arun and she was showing us the album that held memories of her husband. She stopped at a page with a black and white portrait of a comely girl. Before we could ask, Arun said with half a smile: “She is Anu, Shiv’s friend”. We didn’t ask for more because the legend was well known, as were the beautiful songs the poet wrote pining for her: Ik kurhi jida naam mohabbat gum hai (A girl named Love is lost), or Main ik shikra yaar banaya(I made a bird of prey my friend) and many others.This month when Anusuya, the youngest daughter of the famed literary doyen Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, passed away at the ripe age of 84, a pandora’s box of the whys and hows of the rumoured romance opened. Speculation then started about a likely Kaidon (villain in the folk saga of Heer-Ranjha) who could have extinguished the flame. It started with a small, well-intended edit in Kitab Trinjan, a literary and cultural site for the two Punjabs of the subcontinent. The title of the short tribute read: Anusuya, the ‘first love’ of Shiv Kumar passes away. A leading Punjab paper picked it up along with the reactions of the family members to the Facebook post. Anusuya’s nephew dismissed it as “more of a myth created by Shiv”. Poonam Singh, editor of Preetlari came forward with a more convincing opinion based on woman-to-woman conversations with the aunt, stating Anusuya did admit to a passion for the poet, adding, “No, Shiv did not create a myth, but should have been more sporting perhaps, definitely he was hurt and felt sad.”“If a writer falls in love with you, you can never die,” is a quotable quote by American author Mik Everett. Thus this lost girl named Love lived in the collective consciousness of the Punjabi literati all these years and her passing away brought alive the romance which many of Shiv’s fans angrily said was nipped in the bud. However, family sources confirm that seeing the budding passion the father asked her if she wanted to marry Shiv and Anu, as she was called, declined despite the passion. As she reflected later: “I could not see myself as his wife”. The father then advised her to concentrate on her studies. Poonam says with reverence to Gurbaksh Singh: “This was not a Jatt family nor had the Jatt attitude for their daughters and daughters-in-law. He stood by all his girls.”But there is more to Anusuya than just this story of young romance. She was a student from the first batch of the Patrice Lumumba Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia (PFU) in 1960. The PFU was established in 1960 to provide higher education to Third World students. In university, she fell in love with Raul Jesus Estevez Laprea, who was studying physics. In 1965, they moved to Venezuela. Both of them taught in Merida University. She was a well-regarded professor of English and is survived by their two sons and a daughter. Her story would be incomplete without the obit note her eldest son Steve Esteves wrote for her. Commenting on skills and talent, he writes: “She wrote perfectly in four alphabets (Sanskrit, Arabic, Cyrillic and Latin), spoke perfect four languages (Punjabi, Russian, English and Spanish) and understood others. With love, he writes: “Very rarely have I met someone more cultured than her. At 15 years I had already had to read Anais Nin’s diaries, I knew the story of Henry Miller or Isadora Duncan’s scarf. When at 17 I went to see the great museums in Europe I already knew the paintings by heart because she told me about them.” The life of Anusuya, the rebel of the 1950s-60s, was indeed well lived and she visited Shiv’s family after his passing away and also in her last trip to the country. She also told Poonam that she had named a star after Shiv and gazed at it.And now, coming to Shiv, our beloved poet, what comes to the mind is yet another quote by the British expatriate novelist Lawrence Durrel in the Alexandria Quartet: “There are only three things to be done with a woman. You can love her, suffer for her, or turn her into literature”. Well, Shiv did all the three things, going on in life and marrying the amazingly supportive Arun, who lived the role of his wife with love, siring two lovely children till death intervened. That is how life moves on and Anusuya’s passing away should be remembered fondly as also Shiv’s for it was his choice. We have all seen the joys and sorrows of a lost love and this is certainly no time for quibbles. nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-the-endearing-story-of-the-lost-girl-named-love/story-he4xvtqmcl8T5jbbA9uRPP.html

At the GMCH doctors didn’t attend him properly and then deliberately declared him Covid positive. They shifted him to isolation ward where he passed away.” “He was not provided proper medical treatment. Though he was critical , he was not provided ventilator and later shifted to isolation ward on ‘flimsy grounds’. Later, he was taken to the graveyard in secrecy,” alleged the victims’ mother, adding that the Covid test came out negative. Additional district commissioner Ghanshyam Singh said he had gone to the hospital to pacify the family. Repeated calls to hospital authorities went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/4-year-old-falls-off-stairs-and-dies-at-gmch-jammu-kin-allege-doctors-negligence/story-LjyOTci7r65iSDkxYzVuGN.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: The making of a business-friendly city||Chandigarh, the much-pampered Capital of two states and India’s first planned city is, surprisingly, not a great place for business. It shared rank 29, same as last year (2017-18), in the fourth edition of Business Reform Action Plan rankings for 2019, released by the Union finance minister in New Delhi last week.Chandigarh tied with the eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim and Tripura at the 29th position.Andhra Pradesh topped the rankings, with Uttar Pradesh at second and Telangana at third positions in the rankings, launched in 2015 to introduce healthy business competition among states and UTs and attract investments for increased ease of doing business.Of the 187 reforms in The Business Reform Action Plan 2018-19, availability of land, environmental registration enablers, labour regulation enablers, and single-window system, Chandigarh implemented nine. These included points under access to information, getting electricity connection and environment.Local industry players who are disappointed with the rankings say all stakeholders have to be consulted to chalk out business-friendly measures.They have also called for implementation of the Chandigarh Industrial Policy 2015. Major issues faced by the industry are non-conversion of leasehold industrial plots to freehold and no increase in floor area ratio.The Covid-19 scenario has also hit businesses hard with manufacturing on hold during the lockdown and the migrant exodus. Calling for major impetus from the government in the short and long term, businesses have sought relief from tax and duties and moratorium on loans. The Centre needs to take Chandigarh’s unique position in the scheme of things. With its manufacturing activities restricted to small zones such as Industrial Area and huge land costs as well as expensive rentals make doing business here a difficult proposition. Carving out more space for new businesses, creating a one-window system for approvals and permits, discounts on use of electricity and water, and an additional stimulus package is the need of the hour, with industries guaranteeing adherence to labour- and environmental friendly norms. Desperate measures are needed in desperate times. UT authorities need to work on the problem minutely to see how the city gets back on track business-wise again. QUESTION OF THE WEEK: RIGHT STEPSWhat should be done for ease of doing business in Chandigarh? What steps should be taken to make Chandigarh a business-friendly city?

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||SAD appeals to Centre not to enact laws on farm ordinances till redressal of farmers’ fears||The SAD on Saturday appealed to the BJP-led Centre not to present the three farm ordinances for approval in Parliament until “all reservations” expressed by farmers are “duly addressed.” A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the SAD core committee which was presided over by Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal here.The core committee felt that it was its responsibility to get the reservations of the ‘annadaata’ (farmers) addressed and asserted that it was committed to taking up all issues raised by farmers with the Union government, said a party release here.The statement came, amid a widespread criticism by many farmers’ organisations of the three farm ordinances promulgated by the Centre. The appeal from the SAD for not enacting laws on ordinances came despite the party earlier maintaining that the Centre has assured that these ordinances will have no bearing on the existing crop procurement policy.Last month, Sukhbir Badal had even said that Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had written to him that there was no change in the present policy of the purchase of agriculture produce through Minimum Support Price through state agencies.Badal had even accused Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of trying to “mislead” people on this issue.Farmers have expressed apprehension that these ordinances would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP system and they would be at the “mercy” of big corporates. They have been demanding rollback of these ordinances.The ordinances are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.The SAD’s core committee noted that the SAD leadership met farmer organisations representatives and those of ‘khet mazdoor’ (farm labour) during the last few days. “It also held discussions with farm experts to take their views, besides taking the view of grassroots party workers as well as the senior party leadership,” the party said in a release.A considered view has emerged that the Union government should not rush for enacting laws on the ordinances till the apprehensions conveyed to the SAD were addressed, said the release. Badal conveyed to the core committee that he had also been approached by farmers as well as farm organisations from adjoining states and that all of them had expressed apprehensions about the central ordinances and urged the SAD to take up their issues and grievances with the central leadership. “Taking this into account, the SAD is also of the view that the concerns should be taken up for consideration by the Centre,” said the party.The core committee felt that it is appropriate that the SAD president lead a delegation to discuss the concerns of the farmers with the central government. The Congress-led state government, which is spearheading a campaign against the ordinances, had described these ordinances as a “blatant attack” on the federal structure.On August 28, the Punjab Assembly had passed a resolution, rejecting these farm ordinances.The CM had then said these are not only against the interest of farmers and landless workers and time-tested agriculture marketing system established in the state but are also against the Constitution of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-appeals-to-centre-not-to-enact-laws-on-farm-ordinances-till-redressal-of-farmers-fears/story-n5chlF4jC8PjtNquyaCNzI.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Online exams: PU to appoint nodal officer for Ladakh students||Panjab University has decided to appoint a special nodal officer for the students of Ladakh. The development came after the higher education department of Ladakh wrote to the varsity.The decision was taken on Saturday by a committee during an online meeting. The nodal officer will facilitate the smooth conduct of online exams. Online exams for final semester students of Panjab University’s (PU’s) undergraduate and postgraduate courses are scheduled to start from September 17.Ladakh Students’ Association (LSA) Chandigarh had also expressed the apprehensions that candidates might face technical problems during the online exams and demanded from PU to set up a nodal centre for the students of Ladakh.A committee member who attended the meeting said, “We have decided to appoint a nodal officer for the students of Ladakh who will facilitate them during exams if they face any problem.”However, the member said that varsity will not be able to set up a nodal centre there.The higher education department of the UT of Ladakh had earlier in a letter to PU said that LSA has approached them and the students stated that due to the lack of proper internet services and online examination facilities in Ladakh, they were concerned about technical difficulties they might face while taking the online exams and uploading their answer sheets.A student of PU’s defence studies department, Deskyong Namgyal, who hails from Ladakh, said, “Internet issues in Ladakh are common and it is obvious that many students may face this problem during exams as well. We have requested the PU to set up a nodal centre for us which can facilitate the smooth conduct of online exams.”According to the guidelines issued by the varsity, students have to upload the answer sheets which will not exceed 12 pages each within two hours after the time of exam is over. They may also send it by post to the varsity. About 40 nodal centres will be set up for the conduct of online examination by PU, four of which will be in Chandigarh.PU’s controller of examinations Parvinder Singh said that new email addresses — ugexam@gmail.com and pgexam@gmail.com — have been activated for around 20,000 private/USOL candidates to submit their answer sheets in the university secrecy branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/online-exams-pu-to-appoint-nodal-officer-for-ladakh-students/story-ZpU7PzyFDe04Q9r6GEeseL.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||MULTANI DISAPPEARANCE CASEMohali court issues arrest warrant against former DGP Sumedh Saini||MohaliA Mohali court on Saturday issued arrest warrants (non-bailable warrants) against former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in connection with the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case of 1991. Mohali judicial magistrate Ravtesh Inderjit Singh directed the police to arrest Saini and produce him in court by September 25. The orders were issued after the special investigation team (SIT) failed to arrest Saini despite conducting raids at various places, including neighbouring states, and moved court “to get assistance” from police of other states and districts to arrest Saini. Special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula said: “The arrest warrants were sought from the court because police from other states was not cooperating with the SIT in search and arrest procedures taken up by police teams.” In its application, the SIT stated that daily diary reports (DDR) have been registered at police station Hauz Khas, South Delhi, police station, Sadar Shimla, police post Pangana in Mandi, police station, north Chandigarh, police station, Sector 19, Chandigarh, and police station, Tanda near Hoshiarpur. “Perusal of the DDRs revealed that due to lack of arrest warrants, there is an obstacle in getting assistance from the police at various police stations by raiding party from Mohali. Thus application is allowed for facilitating arrest of Saini, who is evading arrest,” observed the court in its order of issuing non-bailable warrants. Recently, the former DGP moved the Supreme Court after Punjab and Haryana high court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. Saini was booked in May this year in connection with the disappearance of Multani, a junior engineer at Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) in 1991. Last month, the police had added the murder charge in the FIR after two former Chandigarh Police personnel, who were co-accused in the case, turned approver. Multani, a resident of Mohali, was picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini when he was the senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh in 1991. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from custody at Qadian in Gurdaspur district. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Balwant Singh Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani, a resident of Jalandhar. The case was registered against them under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali.Meanwhile, the SIT and Punjab Police are continuously conducting raids in neighbouring states, including Haryana, Himachal, Chandigarh and Rajasthan to apprehend Saini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-court-issues-arrest-warrants-against-former-punjab-police-chief-sumedh-singh-saini/story-B1jQWwZClE7fupLSWHkScO.html

12-09-2020||Election:||Former Union minister Tariq Anwar’s elevation in AICC hints at party’s focus on Bihar||The elevation of former Union minister Tariq Anwar in the All India congress committee (AICC) as general secretary and his inclusion in the top policy-making set up seem to have put Bihar on the party’s priority list ahead of the assembly polls.Anwar is the only face from Bihar to be elevated as the AICC general secretary after a gap of almost five years when Shakeel Ahmad was dropped from the position in 2014. Besides, he has also been included in the topmost policy-making body of the party - Congress working committee (CWC) - comprising of 23 leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, DK Diwar, said Anwar’s elevation in the Congress’s national body would help the party consolidate its position among the minorities. “Owing to his secular image, Anwar may also be instrumental in reviving the old party’s base among the upper castes and Dalits,” said Diwar adding that it was a strategic move of the Congress to project him as a strong minority face to the Grand Alliance (GA), which is lacking it right now.Also read: Bihar polls - Nitish, Nadda hold initial talks on seat-sharing, agree on earliest solutionThe Congress indents to contest the assembly elections in Bihar, due in October-November, under the Grand Alliance with RJD, left parties, RLSP and VIP as its constituents.Many senior state Congress leaders believed that aspirations of the state Congress leaders might get attention of the party’s leadership because of Anwar’s position in the AICC. Anwar, too, thanked the AICC leaders for bestowing faith in him and said that he would strive relentlessly for reviving the party’s old glory in Bihar as well as strengthening the organisation in Kerala and Lakshadweep.In keeping with his experience with the organisation, the party had wished to put Anwar in the forefront in Bihar politics by deciding to nominate him to the state legislative council election. However, owing to some issues, the party made Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) working president Samir Kumar Singh as MLC.Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said that Anwar was a towering face in Bihar politics and the party would benefit from his elevation. “Anwar has also been a Youth Congress leader and knows the organisation. His role in the run-up to the election would help the organisation salvage its lost glory,” said Mishra. Anwar, who had served as the AICC general secretary till 1997-98 before opting out and floating the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with Sharad Pawar, is known for the organisation. He won Katihar Lok Sabha constituency on the NPC ticket with support from the RJD and the Congress in 2015. He kept visiting Bihar and stayed in touch with Congress leaders even though he was in the NCP.Former BPCC president Anil Sharma, however, expressed reservations about Anwar’s ability to catapult the party’s fate in Bihar. “Upper castes hold key to success in the impending assembly elections. Besides Anwar, two minority leaders, Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Jawed, are already in the AICC. Meira Kumar and Ranjeet Ranjan, belonging to scheduled caste and other backward classes, are in the AICC from the state. However, upper-caste leaders have not been accommodated in the AICC from Bihar since long,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/former-union-minister-tariq-anwar-s-elevation-in-aicc-hints-at-party-s-focus-on-bihar/story-t7Z7izF5ySNRWTIkcrTEtI.html

The residential house of the then superintendent, Kot Bhalwal jail, Rajni Sehgal, in Jammu city was searched by a team of the crime branch after a search warrant was obtained from a local court. In June 2015, the crime branch had registered a case against four jail officials including Sehgal for allegedly trying to pocket nearly 400 gold and copper coins belonging to 12th and 13th century AD that were found by inmates lodged in the Central Jail premises while digging a patch for kitchen gardening in 2012.“It has been established that the antique coins recovered were handed over to Sehgal on the same day in by an official of the jail,” an agency spokesperson said. Though the coins were recovered in September, Sehgal did not inform her senior officers about the recovery till December 2012 in order to ‘misappropriate’ the ancient coins.“When the news regarding recovery leaked, she hurriedly handed over some coins to the officer of Archeological Survey of India (ASI), which as per records were less than what had been recovered,” the spokesperson said. As per the reports, Sehgal only showed the recovery of 107 coins in November 2012. The coins belonged to the era of Ghiyas-ud-Din Balban, the ninth sultan of Mamluk dynasty of Delhi, Ala-ud-din Khilji, the second ruler of Khilji dynasty, and Muhammad Ghori, the founder of the Turkish Empire in IndiaAn FIR has been registered under Sections of the Treasury Trove Act.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-jailer-s-house-searched-over-alleged-misappropriation-of-antique-coins-in-jammu/story-7hlMk3NpRPraEFc29LHTMK.html
12-09-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Nitish, Nadda hold initial talks on seat-sharing, agree on earliest solution||The much-awaited talks on seat-sharing for the forthcoming Bihar assembly elections between JD(U) and the BJP began on Saturday with both alliance partners deciding to reach an agreement on the issue “at the earliest.” The BJP delegation led by party’s national president JP Nadda interacted with chief minister and JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar for close to 45 minutes. The BJP delegation comprised Bihar election in-charge Bhupendra Yadav, party’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi. Chief minister Nitish Kumar was assisted by Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh.NDA sources said that Kumar voiced his annoyance over LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s utterance and emphasised the need of formalisation of seat-sharing at the earliest so that the message goes loud and clear to the people. Also read: Judges are now soft targets with advent of social media - Justice RamanaA BJP source said that it was the “initial round of talks.” A final call on seat-sharing formula would be worked out only after September 14 meeting between Union home minister Amit Shah and LJP president Chirag Paswan.“We want a respectable accommodation,” said an LJP leader, wishing not to be quoted. The LJP president already had three rounds of talks with Nadda in Delhi. According to highly placed BJP sources, Nadda has advised LJP president to tone down his attacks on Bihar government and “be realistic in assessing his strengths before taking on a political veteran.” Later in the day, BJP president Nadda, during the launching of Aatmnirbhar Bihar programme, clarified that the NDA alliance of BJP-JD (U)-LJP will contest elections under the leadership of Nitish Kumar and win with two-third majority. “People of Bihar have already made up their mind. Now, we have to decide how are we going to change Bihar. When Biharis can change place outside the state, why can’t they do so here,” he said. “The alliance of BJP-JD (U)-LJP and HAM-S is very strong,” said Sushil Modi, Bihar’s deputy CM.Sources in the NDA said two to three formulas were under consideration. BJP leaders believe that after distributing seats among allies, the BJP and the JD(U) should get theirs on the 50-50 basis as was the case during the 2019 national polls. “Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), HAM-S, which is likely to align with the JD (U), is likely to get seven seats. It will leave 115 seats for the JD(U). The BJP has been asked to adjust LJP from its quota and it is demanding no less than 42 seats,” said a person on condition of anonymity. In 2015, the JD(U) and RJD had contested the elections together on 101 seats each as part of the Grand Alliance. The partner, Congress, contested on 41 seats. In 2015, the BJP had contested 157 seats, LJP 42 seats, RLSP 23 seats and HAM got 21 seats. The BJP won from 53 seats, the LJP and RLSP won two seats each while the HAM could win only one. The BJP garnered 93,08,015 votes, highest among all political parties out of the 3,76,96,978 votes polled against the total 6,62,43,193 registered voters in Bihar. HAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi had contested from two seats – Gaya and Imamganj – but lost from Gaya. In the 2010 assembly elections, the JD(U) and BJP had contested 141 and 102 seats and won 115 and 91 seats respectively. The LJP was not part of the NDA then. In the November 2005 elections, the JD(U) and BJP had contested from 139 and 102 seats and won from 88 and 55 seats respectively. The BJP is considering these 102 seats as its own and planning selection of candidates accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-nitish-nadda-hold-initial-talks-on-seat-sharing-agree-on-earliest-solution/story-DYQaAoN80qs5EWKzxe3f7M.html

He added DNA samples of family members had also been collected to substantiate their claims, but reports had been delayed. “DNA samples were collected almost a month ago on August 13. The families have every reason to fear a cover-up, given the inordinate delay in receiving the DNA test reports. I hope their letter to the LG will result in progress now,” Omar tweeted on SaturdayThree young men, Ibrar Ahmad, Imtiyaz Ahmad and Ibrar Ahmad, who were also related to each other, had been gunned down in an encounter on July 18. DNA samples from families had been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) Srinagar, and the FSL at Chandigarh. Sources said the government had received the FSL report from Srinagar lab, but its content had not been made public.“Our children had left for Shopian on July 16, in search of work where one of our relatives Imtiyaz Ahmad works in the house of the ‘Lambardar’.

On August 13, a Shopian police team collected DNA samples from us. We were assured that the DNA report would be out within ten days. To date, we have not been informed about the reports,” the plea to the Lt Governor continues. “Our children had no connection with militancy. For this, we are even demanding an inquiry. They were killed in cold blood, and were merely students and labourers. We are demanding an impartial and fair inquiry into the killings as well as the DNA reports, so that things can be made public,” reads the letter, while seeking personal intervention of Sinha.

Inspector General of Revenue and Controller of Stamps (IGR), Maharashtra, Omprakash Deshmukh on Friday said that the RR hike and stamp duty cut with come into effect from September 12. Terming the RRR hike as negligible, Deshmukh said that it has been revised after two and a half years. Ready reckoner rates are assessments of property value by the state government on the basis of which stamp duty and registration charges are paid to the government which usually revises these rates every year. “We have decided to keep the hike negligible taking into account the stagnant economy and the present Covid situation. The new rates are a part of the rationalisation process initiated by the department and in accordance with the directions of the state government,” he said. The new RRR envisages an increase of average 2.81% for rural areas, 1.21% for municipal councils, 1.29% for nagar panchayat areas and 1.2% for municipal corporation areas. The maximum increase will be felt in Pune district where there has been an average increase of 3.91% followed by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) with 3.2% and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will see an increase of 1.2%. In Mumbai, the RRR increase in effect will be minus 6%, Thane (0.44%), Nashik (0.74%), Nagpur (0.1 %), Navi Mumbai (0.99%) and Raigad (3%). According to the IGR office, Covid-19 had a devastating impact with revenues dropping by 60% and registrations declined by 20%. The IGR office said that the rates were finalised after a meeting with district collectors and taking into consideration the feedback, objections and suggestions of elected legislators. Suhas Merchant, Pune chapter president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai), said, “We will be able to comment on the actual increase after studying the IGR office report. Even a minimum increase will be a burden for the real estate sector. The authorities should have lowered the RRR across the state as the realty market has been sluggish for the past four years.

It said provisions of the law are applicable only when a child is harassed with sexual intent. “In order to attract the provisions of the POCSO Act, 2012, it is necessary to commit an act of harassment with sexual intent,” said justice Bharati Dangre while granting pre-arrest bail to the accused.The accused was booked on the basis of a 17-year-old girl’s complaint on August 1.The judge noted the reading of the First Information Reports by the parties in the case against each other suggested petty rivalry between two families. Dangre said on account of some petty reasons, there was verbal altercation over some trivial issues. It aggravated and resulted into a scuffle, added Dangre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pocso-act-applies-only-when-a-child-is-harassed-with-sexual-intent-bombay-hc/story-XIGMJcx2dFDCinRHCphHEI.html
12-09-2020||Bhopal||Panna Tiger Reserve: Autopsy report indicates tiger was killed by poachers||The autopsy report of a beheaded tiger found in Madhya Pradesh’s Panna Tiger Reserve in August has indicated poaching and said the big cat’s claws and sex organs were removed even as authorities then maintained it was killed in a territorial fight. Principal chief forest conservator (wildlife) Alok Kumar said he has ordered a probe into the latest tiger killing in the reserve, where at least five big cats have been found dead over the last eight months. “...further action [will be] based on the findings of the inquiry. There were certain local issues at the park level. I have issued a warning to them to sort out the issues or face disciplinary action,” said Kumar.The reserve has been repopulated with big cats a decade after it lost all its tigers in 2009.Also Read: Those above 65, kids below 10 years not allowed to visit Corbett Tiger ReserveThe carcass of the beheaded 8-year-old tiger code-named P-123 was found floating in the Ken river in the reserve’s Hinauta range on August 9. K S Bhadauria, the reserve’s director, had then said P-123 was killed a couple of days earlier in a fight with another tiger during mating. The reserve management maintained a forest guard was a witness to the fight from a watchtower and that the corpse of the tiger was washed away and recovered about two kilometres away two days later. The autopsy report has belied the explanation. It said P-123 suffered head, neck, skin, muscle injuries and that its testes and penis were sharply removed from base of tail to abdomen after its death. HT seen a copy of the report.Wildlife experts say ordinary people cannot remove the sex organs of a tiger or they cannot be damaged in a territorial fight. They added the report indicates the presence of poachers in and around the reserve.Panna’s erstwhile royal family head, Jeeteshwari Devi, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the deaths of five tigers even as forest officials, including Bhadauria, have maintained they were killed in territorial or fights during mating.“There are attempts to cover up the killing of tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve. Why this is being done is a matter of inquiry. There are loopholes in the information given by the park management after the killing of tigers. There were attempts to suppress information regarding the beheading of the tiger as well. A CBI inquiry should be ordered and stringent action taken against the park management,” she said.Former forest conservator Jagdish Chandra said the argument regarding frequent territorial fights in a short span of eight months or so does not sound convincing. “Further, the latest incident in which the beheaded corpse of a tiger was found gives a strong indication about the presence of poachers. There should be an inquiry.”A forest department official, who did not want to be named, cited the Covid-19 pandemic and added it could have led to laxity on part of patrolling teams and allowed the poachers to get active again. “It is a matter of inquiry...”Bhadauria said the number of adult tigers has doubled over the past two years from 23 to 42. “There are around 15 cubs too... the core area of the reserve is about 578 square kilometres. In 100 square kilometres, there should be about six tigers. Hence, the growing number of tigers is the reason behind territorial fights. Of the five deaths, a couple of deaths took place in fights during or prior to mating. Hence, these deaths are not unusual.”Bhaduaria said checking man-animal conflict in the buffer zone is a challenge for them with a number of tigers growing in the same space. “Certain incidents took place in the past. Now, we are trying to educate the villagers around on how to avoid conflict with the tigers.” (With input from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/panna-tiger-reserve-autopsy-report-indicates-tiger-was-killed-by-poachers/story-RlG49REMNnVem3hcXdGwNN.html

Sameer Wankhede, joint director of NCB, confirmed the arrest.NCB officials did not comment on whether they found any drugs on Karanjeet or who he was in touch with. Karanjeet was brought to the NCB office in South Mumbai on Saturday morning and his questioning is going on, said NCB officials.

The issue became deeply acrimonious and divisive at multiple levels — between the Rajput and Chakraborty families, between the actors’ respective sets of fans, between the governments of the two states in question, and between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally Shiv Sena — and left the entertainment industry split vertically.The case opened up a raging debate in and about the industry, devolving into a war of words and allegations between two camps largely made up of “insiders” (with generational links to Bollywood) and “outsiders” (first-generation actors and filmmakers). Chakraborty and her supporters alleged that the Bihar government was trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ncb-arrests-one-more-person-from-bandra/story-FXSyK1DsI6USpjn67VaKMO.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi slum eviction: 11 slum dwellers file plea to join proceedings in Supreme Court case||A group of 11 slum dwellers living near railway tracks in various parts of the Capital moved an application to join the proceedings pending before the Supreme Court in the MC Mehta case. The court, on August 31, had directed the Railways to remove nearly 48,000 slums situated close to the safety zone of the Railways within three months. All courts were restrained from ordering a stay on their eviction.The slum dwellers, in their application, stated, “The impleaders (slum dwellers) work in the markets and industrial areas near their residence. It will be very difficult for them to earn their livelihood if they are removed from the said area in these difficult and unprecedented times of the pandemic.” The applicants are residents of Jhuggi Jhopdi (JJ) clusters of Sarai Rohilla, two camps of Kirti Nagar, and another cluster near Defence Colony.This application follows a separate plea filed by senior Congress leader Ajay Maken in the Supreme Court demanding alternate housing for the slum dwellers, nearly 2.4 lakh persons, under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopdi (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015, before they are removed. He sought urgent intervention by the top court as the Railways has proposed to start the demolition drive between September 11 and 14.HT was the first to report on the Supreme Court order on September 3.Advocate Lubna Naaz, who filed the application on behalf of the slum dwellers, said, “At present, 11 slum dwellers have applied, but any order by the Court will affect residents of 48,000 slums. In the current circumstances, these people need compassion and a little help from the Court for their suitable rehabilitation.”The slum dwellers, in their application, have annexed two documents that could be relevant to deciding the future course of action. The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) began a survey of the JJ clusters situated close to the railway tracks on land belonging to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Central government. This survey was meant to identify slum dwellers for in situ rehabilitation and redevelopment. Of 196 JJ clusters, the survey covered 158 clusters. The survey was stopped midway after DDA instructed DUSIB on October 23, 2019, to stop the survey in view of the Delhi Assembly elections that were held in February 2020. Another document annexed to the application is a communication by the Director, Railway Board, on January 7, 2016, which records a decision regarding the removal of jhuggis on Railways land. The document records a decision that no demolition is to be carried out without joint notice by representatives of DUSIB and Railways and without a rehabilitation plan for eligible slum dwellers.During the Supreme Court proceedings, which resulted in the eviction order, at no stage did the Court call upon the slum dwellers to be heard. In a February 28, 2020 order, the Court observed, “By the sides of the railway lines in outer Delhi region, heaps of plastic bags and garbage are lying on both sides and people living in the slums. The situation is pathetic.”Accordingly, it recommended that an expert body on environmental issues, EPCA (Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority), Delhi government and various municipal corporations should chalk out a concrete plan for the removal of the plastic bags, garbage and other waste along the tracks. EPCA, in its July 9, 2020 order, asked the Court to direct the Indian Railways to prepare a time-bound plan under the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 for all the waste generated.Prior to the August 31 order, Railways submitted an affidavit in Court stating that in dealing with garbage, solid waste and plastic waste, a major hindrance was the “predominant presence of jhuggis along 140 kilometre route length of track in the region of National Capital Territory of Delhi.” Such encroachments, the Railways said, “are not only adding to the present menace of accumulation of garbage, municipal solid waste, human waste along the Railway line but are a safety threat to the day-to-day operation of the Railways.” This became one of the factors for the Court to order the immediate eviction of close to 48,000 slums situated adjacent to Delhi’s railway tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-slum-eviction-11-slum-dwellers-file-plea-to-join-proceedings-in-supreme-court-case/story-JnDX4UtYeS8GkDp0KTAkfO.html

According to a reply filed by the home department during the ongoing monsoon session of the assembly, 249 rape cases were registered in the state in 2017, while 344 cases were registered in 2018 and 358 cases in 2019. This year, over 183 cases of rape have been reported till July 31. Mandi district, the home turf of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and second largest district in terms of population, recorded 162 rape cases in three years. Shimla was at the second spot with 159 rape cases, followed by Sirmaur with 149 cases. Kangra, the largest district in terms of population, witnessed 148 rape cases, while and Solan recorded 138 cases, including 51 in Baddi police district. Tribal Lahaul-Spiti district reported only two rape cases in three years. Chargesheets were filed in the court in 925 of the total cases and only 30 accused were convicted. The conviction rate remains a mere 3.25%. More crimes being reported: Mandi SPWhen contacted, Mandi superintendent of police (SP) Shalini Agnihotri said the high number of rape cases recorded in the district is an indication that more people are coming forward to report crimes against women in the district. Asha Thakur of the Himachal Defence Women Welfare Association, a non-government organisation, said decline in cultural values, drug abuse and unemployment may be some of the reasons behind the rise in such crimes. “However, this is not the trend confined to Mandi alone but also in the rest of the state and the country,” she said. She said that setting up of fast track courts and prompt punishment may act as a deterrent and bring down the heinous crime against women. Police reworks strategyMeanwhile, the Himachal Pradesh police department has introduced a new strategy to curb the crime against women in the state. From August 1, Himachal Pradesh Police started maintaining a register on offenders of crime against women and children. “Data of all criminals involved in crimes against women is being prepared and shared with all police stations to track them,” said director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mandi-reports-maximum-162-rapes-in-himachal-over-past-three-years/story-z55VpKwAnGcyZY38b20Z3L.html

Mohammad Aslam, state coordinator for MGNREGA said, “As migrant workers started returning to the state, we tried to expand avenues to give them jobs. We found work for them by converging areas of different departments. Following the same method, this project will be undertaken using the help of forest, labour and drinking water departments.” Aslam added that Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan has identified around 5,000 streams and recharge points in the hilly regions of the state that need to be rejuvenated. “A detailed report regarding the project has already been submitted to the state government and an order is soon to be released. Every stream or water recharge point will need a different kind of treatment depending on its location, and we would be engaging field experts who would help us understand what approach will yield the best results. Works like making trenches, ponds, plantation, rejuvenating catchment area will be carried out as part of the project,” said Aslam. On Tuesday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat announced that the government has started work to revive one Himalayan river in every district. “The goal is to revive one river in every district.

The lifeblood of the city’s public transport system resumed services on September 3. Rajendra Jagtap, chairman and managing director (CMD), of PMPML speaks to HT about running PMPML under the Covid-19 cloud. What has been the response to PMPML resuming services? Each passing day the response is increasing. When we started on September 3, passenger count was 65,000 and now it is above one lakh. Revenue which was around Rs 12 lakh on September 3, has crossed Rs18 lakh now. The number of breakdowns which were 36 on the first day, has gone down; it was 14 on Friday. Things are moving into a positive direction. People have started accepting PMPML buses as modes of travel again and we could see that when we crossed the one-lakh daily commuter count. There is a considerable population now moving via public transport. What safety measures is PMPML taking for commuters, as well as for driver and conductors? Under lockdown, our service was only limited to emergency service staff and then also all these precautionary measures were taken. Each and every bus is sanitised before going on route, sanitiser bottles are kept inside the bus for passengers and passengers without face masks are not allowed inside the bus. The same continues as the safety of commuters is of utmost importance to us. The driver’s cabin has been separated from the passengers and transparent curtains have been installed. Each of our drivers and conductors have been provided with face masks or face shields and gloves. At several major bus stands, thermal checks are conducted on passengers before they enter the bus. And most importantly, we have made seating arrangement in each bus, so that only 22 passengers are allowed in. What is your message to Punekars about using PMPML buses in this time of Covid? With response to Covid in particular, we have to live it now and take necessary safety precautions. We have to accept public transportation as a way to commute and be mobile within the city. This will save ourselves from traffic problems, as well as environmental problems in the city. We, on our part, must try to improvise our services in a better way each passing day, where we give assurances about safety, security, reliability and a cheap mode of transport – all this is assured from us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-has-crossed-one-lakh-daily-commuter-count-rajendra-jagtap/story-Jzer6FYy9Ww3Lm2EdiXNOI.html

12-09-2020||Pune||Unlock Pune: Swargate chowk’s bus hubs back to bustling schedule with social distancing at mercy of rush hour||Pune, as a city, does not, not sleep. In fact, the traditional Punekar legacy of an afternoon siesta is very much alive, to labour the oxymoron. And the city closes for the night, for the most part. There is one area in Pune that does not sleep: the Swargate chowk. Primarily, because it is the city’s hub for public bus services, both PMPML and the MSRTC. From the Swargate junction, daily, hundreds of PMPML buses run the various routes that snake around the city. And that is just the PMPL buses. The state buses also run out of here. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) Swargate ST stand is just opposite the PMPML bus stand in the chowk. MSRTC bus services began on August 21. Currently, at least 150 ST buses leave or arrive from here, daily. Now, the Pune Metro work is ongoing on one side of the Swargate chowk, and there are several PMPML stands on both sides of the Swargate chowk. Speaking of the bus hub, now in unlock mode post close to three months of Covid-19 lockdown, Momin Nadeem, the Swargate PMPML stand controller, says, “Earlier, our bus services were only limited for emergency services and staff, but from September 3, it opened for the public. Since then, the number of commuters is increasing day by day; but there is still a fear among people to come out and travel freely. Every bus is sanitised after it completes one journey. We have sanitisers inside each bus and seating is limited to only 22 per bus. During office hours there is a bit of a crowd.” Trupti Konde, a student and regular commuter from Swargate to Kharadi, said, “The arrangements made inside the bus are good and it makes us comfortable and gives us a sense of safety while travelling. They have installed hand sanitiser bottles inside the bus and alternate seating arrangements.”For Ramakant Sampat, a regular public bus commuter, it was a relief when the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), resumed services on September 3. “I work in a private office and need to travel from Swargate to Katraj twice a week. I used to travel by autorickshaw, but now as the PMPML bus service has started, we can travel easily and that too, with affordable fares. They have made proper arrangements inside the buses to maintain social distancing, but in the morning and evening rush hour it gets crowded inside the bus,” said Sampat. Rohan Nalawade, a commuter, said, “I travelled back to my hometown, Kolhapur, for a few days, as I work in Pune and had not gone since the lockdown started. Travelling by ST bus is safe. Social distancis maintained and safety measures are taken at the stand.” At the ST stand, hand sanitiser bottles are kept on every platform and passengers without face masks are not allowed to enter any bus. Also, seats, benches, and counters are regularly sanitised by cleaning staff. Part of the Swargate experience used to be a plethora of snack and tea stalls, round the clock. Malhari Jadhav, a fruit stall owner at the main bus stand, said, “I am at this stand for the last 15 years and due to Covid-19 pandemic we have suffered. After the lockdown, people are still not serious about their safety as social distancing is not maintained properly.” Currently, PMPML has a fleet of 1,600 buses, apart from 1,000 on rent, which include the e-bus fleet. A total of 500 buses are on the roads daily. What HT saw Despite all these arrangements, at one of the bus stands at Swargate chowk there was zero social distancing. People were waiting for a bus, cheek to jowl, despite PMPML staffers continuously urging them to maintain some distance. The majority of commuters at the bus stands wore face masks, though there were passengers without the necessary protection. PMPML bus drivers are also clashing with autorickshaws parked just next to the bus stands. Auto drivers were seen entering the bus lanes to attract pick up customers. Verbal arguments between PMPML workers and auto drivers were the ongoing order of the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unlock-pune-swargate-chowk-s-bus-hubs-back-to-bustling-schedule-with-social-distancing-at-mercy-of-rush-hour/story-bajkTSxRae1b9jPILzkxoL.html

Earlier in last week, we did 100 per cent testing of the population in Narayangaon and Manchar, and so the number positive cases were more on certain days. On similar grounds we will be carrying out this initiative called ‘chase the virus’, under which every person living in a hotspot will be tested,” said Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector.Giving the details of this initiative he said, “Compared to earlier months, the number of tests has increased now in September. For example, in the week of August 13 to 19, the number of tests conducted was 8,291. Now, in this week, September 3 to 9, it has gone up to 24,963 tests.”“So, it’s almost doubling every week and through our survey, we have noted that 85 per cent of the positive cases are from 65 gram panchayats,” he said.“To stop the spread of the virus in these specific areas we will be doing 100 per cent screening of the population out here. We have planned to test at of such hot spots in the Pune district which includes both, gram panchayats and nagar parishad areas,” he said.“We will be also focusing on effective contract tracing, tracking the co-morbid senior citizens and most importantly isolating the positive patients from other people,” he said.“It will be done in a phase-wise manner, in next eight to 10 days we will complete the testing of these areas and control the spread of the virus,” he added.In the last few weeks, the number of positive cases is increasing daily in Pune rural parts and Pune district in at the top list for Covid positive cases in the country.

12-09-2020||Patna||PM Modi to inaugurate three petroleum projects in Bihar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate an LPG pipeline project and bottling plants in Bihar on Sunday as the government pushes its development agenda in the poll-bound state. The projects include the Durgapur-Banka section of the Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur pipeline project and two LPG bottling plants, an official statement said. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will also be present on the occasion. The 193-km long Durgapur-Banka pipeline section, built by state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), is a part of the Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur Pipeline Augmentation Project, for which the foundation stone was laid by the Prime Minister on February 17, 2019. Durgapur-Banka section is the extension of the existing 679-km long Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur LPG pipeline to the new LPG bottling plant at Banka in Bihar. The pipeline of 14-inch diameter passes through West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar. While LPG is presently injected into the pipeline at IOC’s Paradip and Haldia refineries, the completion of the whole project would enable the facility to be also available from the Paradip import terminal and Barauni refinery. IOC’s LPG bottling Plant at Banka will help meet cooking gas demand of Bihar. The bottling plant has been built at an investment of around Rs 131.75 crore to serve the districts of Bhagalpur, Banka, Jamui, Araria, Kishanganj and Katihar in Bihar, along with the districts of Godda, Deoghar, Dumka, Sahibganj, and Pakur in Jharkhand, the statement said. With the LPG storage capacity of 1,800 tonnes and bottling capacity of 40,000 cylinders per day, this plant would generate direct and indirect employment opportunities in Bihar. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd’s (HPCL) 1,20,000 tonnes per annum LPG bottling plant at Harsidhi in East Champaran district has been built at a cost of Rs 136.4 crore. This plant has been constructed on 29 acres of land and its foundation stone was laid by the Prime Minister on April 10, 2018. The bottling plant will cater to the LPG requirement of East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Siwan, Gopalganj and Sitamarhi districts in Bihar, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-three-petroleum-projects-in-bihar/story-5WCXVfDfe4Dhr2qfVPOcjO.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM rolls out state-wide smart ration card scheme to cover 1.41 crore beneficiaries||Even as he launched the smart ration card scheme to cover 1.41 crore beneficiaries across the state, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced a separate state-funded scheme to provide subsidised ration to nine lakh beneficiaries not covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). With this, the total number of beneficiaries in the state will go up to 1.5 crore, the chief minister announced, while rolling out the smart card scheme under which 37.5 lakh cards will be distributed to the beneficiaries this month. Captain Amarinder Singh said the Centre had capped the maximum number of beneficiaries to 1.41 crore and, despite repeated requests, had not agreed to provide subsidised ration to nine lakh people not covered under NFSA. His government had, therefore, decided to cover all such left out eligible persons under a state-funded scheme, details of which will be announced shortly, he said. Launching the smart ration card scheme virtually, with connection to 100 places across the state, the chief minister said the scheme would help curb corruption and give freedom to the beneficiaries to buy ration from any depot. Describing it as a major step towards empowering the beneficiary, he said it will end the exploitation by unscrupulous ration depot holders. The smart ration card empowers the beneficiary to get his entitled quota of foodgrains from any ration depot in Punjab.FARM ORDINANCES WILL HIT FARMERS: CAPT The chief minister lashed out at the BJP-led central government for attempting to destroy the spirit of Punjab’s farmers, who have toiled for the country and fed the nation, through the farm ordinances. These ordinances are aimed at ending the MSP regime and will hit the farmers hard, he said. Referring to the Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal issue, Captain Amarinder said that was another problem that Punjab was facing and while he had recently had one meeting with the Union water resources minister and his Haryana counterpart, the problem continues to haunt the state. Pointing to the melting glaciers and the receding groundwater level in the state, he said the situation was critical and Punjab could not afford to give any water to other states. In a symbolic gesture, the chief minister handed over the smart ration cards to four beneficiaries at the Secretariat in Chandigarh, after which ministers and MLAs distributed cards in their respective districts and constituencies.TRANSPARENT SYSTEM TO CHECK PILFERAGE: ASHU Earlier, Punjab minister of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Bharat Bhushan Ashu said that the state government, in line with its promise to make the system transparent, had introduced the e-POS system to check pilferage. State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal termed the launch of the cards as the fulfilment of another promise despite the financial crunch. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said the journey to implement a transparent system of public food distribution had been an arduous one, as the previous government had put in place a corrupt and monopolistic system. Due to the step-motherly treatment of the Centre towards Punjab, the Rs 31000 crore CCL debt burden imposed by the SAD-BJP on the state was yet to be resolved, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-rolls-out-state-wide-smart-ration-card-scheme-to-cover-1-41-crore-beneficiaries/story-buxKdu3GqHIeACMpToAelI.html

The BJP leadership is also understood to have assured Kumar that it will intervene and iron out the differences that have of late cropped up between the JD(U) and the LJP on account of the belligerent stance adopted by the latter’s young president Chirag Paswan.The schedule for assembly elections in the state is likely to be announced shortly. The Election Commission has indicated that it would like to conclude the exercise before end of term of the present house on November 29.On the previous evening at a press conference here, the BJPs election in-charge for Bihar assembly Devendra Fadnavis had sought to make light of the acrimony between JD(U) and LJP and remarked “nobody is going to leave the NDA, though many may join us”.The former Maharashtra chief minister had also attributed the sharp differences that have emerged between the two parties to “diverse ideologies a reason why we all are separate political parties, though united in purpose”.Nadda, who arrived here on the previous evening on a two-day tour of Bihar, began his day by offering prayers at the famous Patan Devi temple in the old city, after which the Bihar capital is named.After the meeting with the chief minister, his itineraryincludes launch of “Atmanirbhar Bihar Abhiyan” at the partys state headquarters followed by a visit to Muzaffarpur district where he will interact with women farmers and litchi cultivators at the village named after the legendary “Kisan Chachi”, whose efforts at promoting entrepreneurship among rural women have earned her a Padma award.Nadda is thereafter scheduled to visit Darbhanga, and interact with farmers involved in fisheries and production of makhana (fox nuts), both of which are found in abundance in the Mithila region of north Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-jp-nadda-nitish-kumar-hold-seat-sharing-talks/story-tgg4wXlD2S01Cg8Ts5btwK.html

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra move to hike ready reckoner rates will adversely affect realty sector: Industry experts||In the wake of economic distress caused by the nationwide lockdown, the Maharshtra government’s move to hike the ready reckoner (RR) rates across the state from Saturday will adversely affect the realty sector which is already in a battered state, industry experts said.The RR rate, also known as circle rate, is the minimum price at which a property has to be registered in case of its transfer. In addition, all real estate calculations, be it premiums, tax collection or even income tax matters related to the construction sector, are determined by the RR rate.The CREDAI-MCHI (Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry), an association of builders, has warned that the move will have a detrimental effect on both the new launches as well as ongoing projects. “This move is bound to have adverse impact on the number of new launches and also put their viability in doubt,” said Deepak Garodia, president, CREDAI-MCHI.Also Read: Covid-19 lockdown cost Maharashtra state Rs 16 crore per day in stamp dutyThe National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) rued that projects costs will increase due to this move. “New projects will be impacted as the RR value governs all levies, duties and taxes payable by a developer,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, president, NAREDCO (national).Maharashtra, on Friday, announced the hike in RR rates after two years by an average of 1.74% across the state.This move is significant as on August 26, the government had slashed stamp duty to 2% until December 2020 and to 3% between January and March 2021 to boost realty sales, which reduced considerably during the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks action plan from economists, scientists to revive Maharashtra economyReal estate experts have called it a regressive and confusing step. “This increase, to a certain extent, is going to nullify the gains of the reduced stamp duty for the recently motivated customer. This increase is also going to force developers to pass on the additional burden of increased premium costs that are linked to the RR prices, onto the customers,” said Ram Naik, executive director, The Guardian Real Estate Advisory.However the state government has defended the move saying that the hike will not impact the realty sector. “It is a negligible hike which has taken place after 2.5 years. In markets like Mumbai and Thane where sales are down, the hike is within 0.5 %. We hiked the rates after studying the market conditions,” said Omprakash Deshmukh, inspector general of stamps and registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-move-to-hike-ready-reckoner-rates-will-adversely-affect-realty-sector-industry-experts/story-Z3YhgmqcuyIrUYEG9JlNaJ.html

12-09-2020||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot writes to Ashok Gehlot raising Gujjar issues in Rajasthan||Rajasthan’s former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot wrote to chief minister Ashok Gehlot over Gujjar issues on September 2, according to the letter released to the media on Saturday. This is one of the very few occasions when Pilot has been seen raising issues related to Gujjars, the pastoral community to which he belongs. Political experts link the release of the letter to the reshuffle in the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday. After the political turmoil spawned by an alleged rebellion by Pilot and 18 other Congress legislators blew away, it was being speculated that the party will induct him in AICC as a general secretary to compensate for taking away the position of deputy chief minister and state unit chief. However, Pilot was not given a central role in the reshuffle announced yesterday. “It has been brought to my notice that the 5% reservation to MBC (more backward class) is not being provided in government jobs. The Congress party promised this in its manifesto for 2018 Assembly elections and the Congress government in 2011 had also promised to keep 4% posts in government jobs reserved as shadow posts for MBC,” Pilot wrote. Pilot further said in the letter that development works under the Devnarayan scheme, a welfare scheme meant for Gujjars, had been put on ice. “People meet me personally to demand proper implementation and sufficient budget allotment to this scheme,” Pilot said. Also Read: At Rajasthan Congress feedback meet, slogans against minister, posters tornThe former PCC president claimed reservation to MBCs had not been applied for police constable recruitment - 2018, REET recruitment - 2019, panchayati raj LDC - 2013, technical helper - 2018, nursing - 2013 and 2018, jail guards - 2018, ASHA supervisor - 2016, commercial assistant – 2018 and second grade school teachers – 2018. The Rajasthan government provides 5% reservation to Gujjars and four other communities (Banjara/Baldia/Labana, Gadia-Lohar/Gadalia, Raika/Rebari and Gadaria) in jobs and educational institutions under the MBC category. Gujjars constitute about 5% of Rajasthan’s population, according to the 1931 caste census, and are present in 21 out of the 33 districts of the state. Traditionally, Gujjars have been BJP supporters but in 2018 assembly elections, the community rallied behind Pilot assuming that he would become the chief minister.

Political commentator Avadhesh Akodia said Pilot raising issues related to Gujjars was a significant political development.“So far, he has stayed away from such issues fearing getting labeled as a Gujjar leader. Maybe, now he realizes that the community that has stood behind him so far may also wean away if he is not seen to be raising their issues,” Akodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/sachin-pilot-writes-to-ashok-gehlot-raising-gujjar-issues-in-rajasthan/story-35WIFPEuOR9ORvUfh6l3pM.html

The petition said notifications issued in November 2017 and April 2018 banned both.Also Read: Coral patch being reclaimed at Haji Ali, allege Mumbai residents“In addition to being a highly ecologically damaging method of fishing, these purse seine boats require considerable manpower-- ordinarily 30 to 40 individuals on board to handle the operations, thus making it impossible to follow the Covid-19 lockdown norms.”Tandel said despite stringent restrictions imposed in view of Covid-19 lockdown, hundreds of boats without authorised licenses were found to be manoeuvring and trawling, using purse seine nets and LED lights in Maharashtra. He added a number of fishermen, who fish for the sustenance of their families, were targeted.“These illegal fishing activities allow the lawbreakers to unjustly profit at the expense of the entire fishing community which was forced to suspend operations,” said the petition. “This lack of action, especially considering the mandates banning purse seine trawling and the usage of LED-lights for fishing, is extremely disappointing to the fishermen community at large who are collectively fighting to curb this destructive practice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/fishermen-leader-moves-bombay-hc-complains-about-lack-of-action-to-stop-banned-purse-seine-nets-high-density-led-lights/story-19Un9RBHo7c40bdGXt06TP.html

But due to a lack of monitoring and implementation, the respondents continue to use excessive amounts of plastic in wrapping and packaging their sold items,” said the plea, filed through advocate Meenesh Dubey.Dubey’s plea had contended that the companies deliver items in cardboard boxes, which are too large as compared to the size of the items being delivered.“To ensure that the sold items do not move around in the outsized boxes, they wrap the items in multiple layers of plastic sheets and plastic bubble wraps and thereafter fill the large empty spaces in the boxes with additional sheets of single-use plastic,” it had said.Once goods are delivered, the plastic waste is thrown away in garbage and it ends up at landfill sites, leading to a burden on the earth and damaging the environment, it said.“Single-use plastic has emerged as one of the biggest environmental challenges for our planet. It is cheap, useful, ubiquitous and very deadly.  “The fact that it’s non-biodegradable and is recycled in very small percentages means that our planet with passage of time is becoming a big dumping ground for single-use plastic, which breaks down into smaller fragments known as microplastics and then contaminates soil and water,” the petition had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/recover-fine-from-amazon-flipkart-for-excessive-plastic-packaging-ngt-tells-cpcb/story-DVHv31qFqOZYN0eIt14wyK.html

It is not mandatory for international passengers to take the test at the airport. If a person tests negative for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at the airport, (s)he will be exempted from the mandatory institutional quarantine, officials said.Currently, all international passengers arriving in Delhi need to be institutionally quarantined. Those with a connecting Vande Bharat flight are allowed to quarantine themselves at their destination. Those carrying an RT-PCR negative report are allowed to journey onward and can seek exemption from institutional quarantine too. For this exemption, the RT-PCR test has to be conducted at least 96 hours before the journey.WATCH | Delhi airport first in India to get Covid test lab; how it’ll work: Explained Also Read: India’s Covid-19 recovery rate rises to 77.7%.

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Bharatiya Kisan Union chief, 300 unknown people booked for damaging property||The Haryana Police on Friday booked state BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and 300 unidentified people for damaging public property and violating prohibitory orders, a day after farmers clashed with cops during a protest here. Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and other farm bodies had blocked a national highway in Kurukshetra’s Pipli and clashed with police while protesting against three Union government legislations, which they claimed were “anti-farmer”. Police had resorted to a lathicharge when farmers coming from the Shahbad area pushed their way to the protest site. The agitating farmers smashed windowpanes of a fire brigade vehicle and pelted police with stones. Three separate FIRs were registered at the Sadar police station in Thanesar. “These FIRs have been registered against Gurnam Singh Charuni and several unknown people for unlawful assembly, causing damage to property and preventing government employees from performing their duty,” SHO Naresh Kumar said. The FIRs also include charges for the violation of the National Highway Act and the Disaster Management Act, he said. Meanwhile, the Shahbad Markanda police lodged cases against 300 unknown people. SHO Devinder Kumar said the attempt to murder charge was also added to the FIR as many tractor-borne farmers tried to run police personnel manning the barriers erected to stop them.The Kurukshetra administration had imposed prohibitory orders after the farmer bodies gave a protest call in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. However, farmers belonging to the BKU and other organisations reached Pipli in large numbers, defying the prohibitory orders. Top state Congress leaders, including AICC spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state party chief Kumari Selja, on Friday expressed solidarity with the farmers. Farmers in Haryana are demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, promulgated by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bharatiya-kisan-union-chief-300-unknown-people-booked-for-damaging-property/story-NyViATonMMDgVJQBfzV5oJ.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||HC reduces number of benches holding physical hearings amid Covid crisis in Delhi||The Delhi High Court on Saturday said it has reduced the number of benches that would be holding physical hearings due to the “alarming” rise in Covid-19 cases in the national capital and majority of lawyers preferring virtual hearings.According to a note issued by the office of Registrar General Manoj Jain, a full court of the judges of the Delhi High Court deliberated on continuing with physical hearings, which were started from September 1, and decided not to discontinue them completely. The full court decided that physical hearings would be conducted each day, from September 15 onwards, by one division bench and two single judge benches on rotation. Till now, two division benches and three single judge benches were holding physical courts on rotational basis. The decision was taken on the basis of statistics, submitted before the full court by the Registry, which indicated that around 94 per cent of the advocates had indicated their preferred mode of hearing as ‘virtual’ mode on the designated mentioning link/e-filing module of the High Court.“Most of the advocates, whose matters were listed before the benches constituted for physical hearing, expressed their inability, reluctance or unwillingness to appear physically and that requests, in large number, were received for taking up the matters through video conferencing. “The physical appearances were largely before the single benches, exercising criminal jurisdiction whereas the appearance before the other benches was relatively low,” the note said. It also said that the full court “also noted that the number of Covid-19 cases has been rising alarmingly in the NCT of Delhi”. It further said that regular medical camps were organised in the high court as well as district courts for testing and the results revealed that 45 officials of the high court (including contractual and outsourced staff) and 192 officers/officials of district courts have already contracted Covid-19. “The UCO Bank situated in the high court building had been shut down recently as its three bank officials tested positive,” it added. Delhi High Court Chief Justice D N Patel had recently said, during a hearing, that physical hearings would not be stopped completely and would be continued slowly. “Once things have started in this high court, they are not going to be stopped. We will not start and close like the other high courts,” the chief justice had said. His comments came after some counsels in a case before his bench sought that their matter be listed on a date when virtual hearings are held. The high court, according to the note, had decided to commence physical hearings “in view of persistent requests” by the various bar associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-reduces-number-of-benches-holding-physical-hearings-amid-covid-crisis-in-delhi/story-5MPsVkHYVnHVpViNcpSnzN.html

It also requires mentioning that in the present case, the applicant only seeks unlocking of the residential premises. It also requires mentioning that the fact that the applicant and her family are only residing in the residential portion of the property... has never been disputed by any of the opposite parties till date either during the hearing or in any of the replies filed,” the order said.The court also noted that after sanitization, the premises was locked as per the directions of the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and keys were handed over to police officials for facilitation as premises were required to be inspected by various agencies.“Even though, it is not mentioned in any of the reply filed, that the residential portion is a scene of crime or whether it has been inspected by concerned agencies for the preservation and evidence purposes, this court, will deem it appropriate to give one more opportunity to the investigating agencies to inspect the premises sought to be unlocked within five working days from the date of receipt of this order. Thereafter, keys should be handed over to the applicant against acknowledgment,” the order said.During the arguments, special public prosecutor argued that the property was not sealed under any provision of the law, but the premises sought to be unlocked was locked for the preservation of the crime scene. The prosecutor submitted that the keys are with the Delhi Police and investigation is still pending in the present case.The counsel for Khalida, mother of Maulana Saad, had argued that all the concerned officials have admitted the fact that the keys of residential premises are with Delhi Police and the applicant and her family have been denied access to her residential premises for more than six months now. The counsel argued that no person can be restricted/restrained for using residential property in any provision of law.According to the application, after the registration of an FIR on March 31, 2020, the entire Markaz premises was vacated and locked for the purpose of sanitization and disinfection by the authorities and keys of the premises were handed over to the police.“It is further averred in the application that the residential part of the premises is a four storey building and the said building is divided by wall into two section, wherein, in one section the applicant and her family resides and the entrance for both the sections of the building are separate and not interconnected,” the application said.

But with the local shopping scene taking a hit during the pandemic, how’s Sarojini faring? “I recently ventured out to shop at Sarojini after months and the shopping scene was lit! So many shops are offering discounts and deals that the shopper in me was forced to bring home an entire new wardrobe,” gleams Srishti Shrivastava, a banking professional who recently went to Sarojini market to shop for herself as “metro has resumed and now #girlsquad dates can start with my BFFs. But the one thing that’s most important in any girl squad date is the #OOTD. Luckily, with all the pay cuts, Sarojini is the new Zara for me.”The shopping scene at a street market like Sarojini has changed amid the pandemic. Customers and shop keepers are taking precautions alike. “Why I love Sarojini is because it’s a steal! Right from ₹50 to ₹7000, one can find beautiful bags, sandals, belts, accessories, clothes and jewellery. The only concern for me was about buying clothes from the stall without trying them. Before Covid-19, I didn’t have the fear of wearing a tee shirt on top of my clothes to check the fit. However, now, I wear gloves and trust my better sense at picking out the right size for myself. Sometimes I carry my old tee shirt and show it to the shop keeper and ask him to give me my size. Whatever clothes I buy from the stalls, I always come home and wash them first, adding sanitiser to the washing mix,” says Pooja Gupta, an IT professional. Sarojini Market has always been a bustling spot with some denizens visiting the place to specially grab a bite of their favourite street food. However, it looks like denizens might have to wait for the stalls to re-open again. “Momos, shakarkandi and bhutta are my go to snacks while shopping. I miss munching on them! Sarojini is a delight to shop and snack on budget! I recently bought some gorgeous jewellery and a pair of denim jeans for a steal! While buying clothes amid pandemic, it did cross my mind that so many people would’ve tried it on before me. But, jewellery ka aisa koi scene nahi,” says Akanksha Sharma, a blogger who has been enjoying shopping at Sarojini market in the unpredictable Delhi weather.“We are offering 10% off on all clothing. Youngsters have begun to come in increasing numbers amid unlock 4.0. From the shop keepers to the clients, everyone is taking precautions while shopping. From temperature checks to regular sanitisation, and masks being made mandatory inside the shop, we have taken all the necessary precautions. Achcha lag raha hai dekh ke ki ab market me thodi raunak hai itne mahino baad,” says Krish Kalra, owner of an apparel shop in Sarojini Nagar Market.

Kalimpong, a popular hill station, which has the second-lowest number of Covid-19 cases, has 40 such zones while Nadia has the highest--577--in the state. Jhargram is another district that has just one zone and it has recorded 349 cases, the lowest in the state.“If multiple cases are recorded from the same neighbourhood in one week, then it is tagged a containment zone. In Kolkata, there is only one such zone. The rest of the cases are more sporadic and coming from various locations,” said a Kolkata Municipal Corporation official.Also Read: ‘Corona is gone’, says Bengal BJP chief at public rally. Then rebuts himselfIn April, the authorities would cordon off an entire area after tagging it a containment zone if any case was reported. In May, the definition was changed and only a particular house or a housing society was tagged as a containment zone if any case was reported. The definition was again changed in July.“We are following a micro-zonation plan, wherein only those areas from where multiple cases are reported in one week are tagged as containment zones. A few houses in central Kolkata’s Girish Park area have been tagged as a containment zone in Kolkata,” said a health department official.In mid-July, Kolkata had 39 containment zones, which reduced to 17 in the second last week of August.The city has reported 45,500 cases, the highest in West Bengal.Also Read: Bengal observes September’s 2nd Covid lockdown, it will probably be the lastMeena Devi Purohit, a Bharatiya Janata Party councillor, accused the authorities of trying to suppress the Covid-19 figures to present a rosy picture. “Why else would they frequently change the definition of containment zones and reduce the number?

It added they had learned from one of BMC’s contractors about plans to reclaim sites where corals are present.Also Read: Citizens’ collective starts Biodiversity by the Bay campaign in MumbaiOn Friday, Vivek Kumar, a resident, noticed the reclamation work for the project was getting closer to the site where the coral presence has been documented. He shared images with the state mangrove cell highlighting the alleged violation. “Since September 2, daily dumping of debris by few trucks has been undertaken towards the left side of the patch leading up to Haji Ali. As the reclamation expands, the safety of these corals is at high risk,” said Kumar.In its letter to the chief engineer of BMC’s coastal road project last week, the cell said it has received several complaints regarding the destruction of reef-building corals, and a site inspection was undertaken with marine biologists on September 3 to check their status. “It was understood from the representative of the contractor that the area where corals are present is proposed to be reclaimed for the construction of the Coastal Road, without translocating the corals,” said the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Also Read: Oil exploration in forests to become cheaper, easierCorals are marine invertebrates that attach themselves to rocky intertidal regions. They have the same protection status as that of the tiger or elephants under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. Permissions are required from the state chief wildlife warden before the translocation of coral species.The letter said any destruction of coral species during the road construction would be considered a violation of the Act, and action would be taken against BMC and its contractor. “We received fresh complaints in this matter on Friday, and a team including forest officials and marine biologists from the Mangrove Foundation will be sent to Haji Ali to re-verify whether any species were harmed,” said DR Patil, divisional forest officer, Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit, who wrote the letter.HT reported on July 14 that Goa’s National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) has found the presence of six coral species along the south Mumbai coast.Marine researcher Shaunak Modi, who has documented coral presence in Haji Ali, said despite repeated complaints, BMC contractors have continued landfilling an area with multiple colonies of reef-building corals, which are protected species. “We have already lost all the coral colonies in the Mahalaxmi Bay, and if strict action is not taken by authorities, this patch will be lost as well.”Modi said while the NIO claims to have found only a few square feet of corals, surveys over the last three years have shown a much larger area of coral colonies across the city’s western seaboard. “Since these corals are small and the colonies are scattered, it sometimes may be difficult to find all of them in just a few surveys.”Since March, BMC has reclaimed over 53 hectares of the sea in south Mumbai for the 9.9-km coastal road. The civic body recently informed the Supreme Court of its intention to increase reclamation at sea from the original 90 ha to 111 ha.BMC’s deputy municipal commissioner, RS Kuknoor, said, “Allegations that corals have been reclaimed anywhere along the project site are false. Areas with coral presence are being carefully monitored and such zones have not been touched at all.”The NIO, in its September 2019 report, said it had found the presence of six coral species along the South Mumbai coast, dolphins, 17 bird species, and rich benthic marine life while developing the marine biodiversity conservation and monitoring plan (MBMP) for the project.NIO suggested an Rs. 2.9 crore budgetary plan for the MBMP including translocation of corals.But BMC said the funds had not been allocated yet and it was the responsibility of project contractors.In the report, NIO said the destruction of habitat, noise, and increased turbidity due to the movement of vessels threatened the presence of dolphins within a 10 km radius of the project site as well as the foraging behaviour of 17 migratory and resident birds. NIO said the destruction of corals should be avoided with transplantation and restoration of corals inside proposed project sites at suitable places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/coral-patch-being-reclaimed-at-haji-ali-allege-mumbai-residents/story-djzeBWTsCx4Mhialj9sTXM.html

This correspondent travelled in the Metro during the morning peak hour for a spot check. Around 6am, when the gates opened, there weren’t a lot of passengers. However, the crowd started increasing within a few hours, resulting in queues outside some stations, as all passengers were let in only after temperature screening and sanitisation of their hands and luggage. Also Read: All Delhi Metro lines functional, back to normal timings starting todayShikha Sharma, a passenger who was travelling from the Mayur Vihar Phase 1 interchange station to INA on the Pink Line, said that while there was a considerable number of passengers waiting for trains in stations, the crowd inside trains continued to be thin, which left enough space for everyone to travel while seated. “I had my apprehensions about safety and the frequency of trains, but the trains are regular, so passengers can skip a train if it is nearly full and catch the next one,” said Sharma.Compared to last week, the number of Metro officials and security personnel on the station premises was higher on Saturday to manage the larger ridership. Also Read: If you’re travelling in Delhi Metro, strictly adhere to social distancing rules“Since the Airport Express Line, which was reopened on Saturday, does not usually have a large footfall, we are anticipating the ridership to be similar to Friday’s.

The official also said that since it was Saturday, the number of people coming in could be lesser.

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Citizens’ collective starts Biodiversity by the Bay campaign in Mumbai||Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic, a citizens’ collective, has announced the launch of Biodiversity by the Bay campaign to highlight the need for sustainable development to enhance protection for the city’s environment.The group, which includes environmentalists and lawyers, has appealed state environment minister Aaditya Thackery to protect flamingos and their habitats, declare the entire 3,122-acre Aarey Milk Colony as a forest, increase protection for Mumbai’s green cover, ensure supportive policy for the livelihood of fishers, and increase open spaces and parks as part of the campaign.“A collective effort is needed to amplify diverse voices to safeguard Mumbai’s rich ecosystems and unique biodiversity,” said Bhagwan Keshbhat, founder, Waatavaran, one of the groups spearheading the campaign. “Our end goal is to create a youth-led climate movement including fisherfolk, indigenous communities, law and architect students and local communities.”Also Read: Aarey Colony areas adjacent to Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park to be reserve forest: Maharashtra governmentA study in July found a 42.5% drop in Mumbai’s green cover over 30 years with the ratio of green spaces to total geographical area falling from 46.7% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018 due to developmental activities. There is less than half a tree per person in Mumbai, according to NGO Praja Foundation’s data.Kanchi Kohli, an environmental governance expert at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the conservation of green spaces is directly linked with public health including access to clean air and water. “Urban planning at all levels needs to incorporate strategies to save public commons, protect natural areas like wetlands, mangroves, city forests and undertake ecologically informed programmes to enhance environmental quality. All of this will only be enhanced if done with a citizen-state partnership.”Urban planners said the development regulation dilutions were facilitating builders to create more concretised structures and reduce green cover. “The city’s existing open spaces is a meagre 0.9 square metre per person. It can be increased to 2 square metre per capita if all plots are developed under the development plan 2034,” said Pankaj Joshi, executive director, Urban Research Design Institute.One of the partner organisations, Civis, would collect citizen’s inputs on open spaces and parks as part of the campaign. “We will be sharing this with the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] so that they can assure greater accessibility and availability of such open spaces,” said Antaraa Vasudev, founder, Civis.Anushri Shetty, an architecture student, said public parks should not be seen from a purely utilitarian angle but should be a source of pride in the local communities. “Local art must be channelised to create landmark features that will help develop an interactive park culture...”The campaigners plan interactions with the environment department, artistic submissions reimagining a green Mumbai, music concerts, virtual conferences etc, for necessary policy interventions.Siddharth Singh, an energy and climate policy expert, said they need an urban renewal mission. “In the case of Mumbai, I believe that the flamingo can be a symbol of these changes, and indeed a symbol of the city itself.”The 21.9-hectare NRI Complex and 14-hectare TS Chanakya near the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary have been earmarked for the construction of residential, commercial buildings and a golf course. A record number of flamingos migrated there in April and May during the Covid-19 lockdown thanks to a lack of human activity.Shavasthi Siva, an entrepreneur, said the way to steer change is to keep asking authorities for accountability. “Other than that, we are individually responsible for our environment in our everyday choices that contribute to sustainability.”Proposed and under construction infrastructure projects threaten the remaining green lungs such as Aarey (393-acres slated for development) and the iconic south Mumbai coastline (111-hectares of the sea to be reclaimed for the coastal road project). Additionally, 28,951 illegal structures have been built inside as well as around the periphery of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, with over 25,000 structures inside the park, accounting for 11% of encroachments.Keshabat said the recent proposal to declare 600-acre of Aarey as a forest is a step in the right direction. “...our campaign hopes to encourage similar changes.”State forest minister Sanjay Rathod said they intend to declare mangrove forests in western suburbs as conservation reserves and enhance eco-tourism there. “We have expanded the buffer zone around Thane flamingo sanctuary to include more mangrove forests for protection. This is just the beginning of a host of measures planned for Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/citizens-collective-starts-biodiversity-by-the-bay-campaign-in-mumbai/story-59JmnLcpd8INln9RWBTv9L.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal colony right under Hoshiarpur municipal corporation’s nose and it doesn’t bat an eyelid||The Hoshiarpur municipal corporation (MC) and district revenue officials have failed to check construction work on an illegal colony for months. The matter came to light after Avtar Singh, the owner of Guru Nanak Colony, on Adamwal Road near Hoshiarpur, applied for regularisation under the existing policy and the MC had to reply.In June, Hoshiarpur MC assistant town planner (ATP) Lakhbir Singh wrote to Avtar Singh, the owner of the colony, informing him that Guru Nanak Colony would not be regularised under government policy, mentioning that no unauthorised colony which was developed on or after March 19, 2018, will be compounded. According to the letter, Avtar had applied for regularisation on October 18, 2018.Even after being declared an illegal colony, the levelling work continues on site. The revenue department has also done five land registrations in the illegal colony.The ATP’s letter cited lack of documents on the case file. “It has come to notice that there were attempts to build the foundation of the colony by levelling it, which is a violation of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995,” the letter to Avtar said, warning him against the illegal construction.Hoshiarpur MC commissioner Balbir Raj Singh says, “We have written to the sub-registrar (to stop the registration of the land) and to the police to take legal action against the owners.”Hoshiarpur tehsildar Harminder Singh admitted that five land registrations of Guru Nanak Colony had been done. “The MC informed us just two days ago that Guru Nanak Colony is illegal. We were unaware of its status. We have returned one new land registration case that came to us on Friday,” the tehsildar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-colony-right-under-hoshiarpur-municipal-corporation-s-nose-and-it-doesn-t-bat-an-eyelid/story-7o8H030FJm0Rr8RYvjU8zM.html

12-09-2020||Patna||Report seeks special financial help for resource-starved Bihar||A significant reduction in the Centre’s revenue collection will affect Bihar’s finances badly and it will be impossible for the state to compensate for the shortfall from alternate sources even if it tries to explore the possibility of generating more revenue from its own sources, a Patna think- tank’s report has said.The report titled ‘COVID-19: Issues and Challenges for Bihar’, was released on Friday at Patna’s Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI). It said the crisis has huge economic implication for Bihar with the limited fiscal space to provide financial support from their own resources. The report added the state has faced the dual challenges of handling the usual calamities of flood at the same time as the unprecedented pandemic. “Hence, the Bihar government cannot handle those challenges without special financial support from the Central Government, as the reduced transfer on account of lower tax revenue pool of the Centre will affect the fiscal balance of the State.”Also Read: Migrants in UP pack their bags as former employers lay out red carpet for their returnIt said there is also an additional dimension of the economic impact--the return of migrant workers and the loss of remittances that they used to send to their families in Bihar.“During the initial phase of lockdown migrants returned in huge numbers. MGNREGA [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act], a demand-based employment programme, proved to be an effective short-term relief measure for providing employment, especially for the rural and unskilled workforce. The state government took many short-term measures to handle the crisis but a lot more needs to be done to mitigate the impact in the medium to long term,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/report-seeks-special-financial-help-for-resource-starved-bihar/story-5ri7nyS9d4x6s07J5lC29K.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Lt Governor Manoj Sinha rolls out J&K grievance redressal system||In a step towards making grievance redressal robust and efficient, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha launched the Jammu and Kashmir Integrated Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (JK-IGRAMS) in Srinagar on Friday.The revamped system will decentralise handling and redressal of public grievances by making district collectors and deputy commissioners the primary level of receiving, disposing and monitoring grievances.The existing portal has been integrated downwards to the district level by mapping nearly 1,500 public offices in 20 districts of the Union Territories. From the existing 250 to the proposed 1,500 offices, this is the widest possible coverage that has been conceived and enabled in online management of public grievances in Jammu and Kashmir.Officials said that this makes it the first online grievance management system in the country which is linked to the central government (at the top level) and districts, tehsils and blocks (at the bottom level).The administrative secretaries of different departments are also linked to the mechanism.In addition to this, the new system will be available 24x7 with applicant OTP authentication, acknowledgement to applicant at each stage, feedback by complainant, and grievance submission through call centre via phone call between 9.30am and 5.30pm on all days except Sunday.The lieutenant governor said that the government is committed towards undertaking all radical reforms to put in place a people-centric good governance structure which will have an institutionalised grievance redressal mechanism.He added that it is the most important component of a well-governed responsive administration and an indicator of efficiency and effectiveness of all administrative processes.Terming it a step towards gaining peoples’ trust, Sinha said that an effective grievance redressal mechanism is the life of any good governance system and is the priority for the J&K administration. “The new system is initially being launched on a pilot basis for three districts of Jammu, Srinagar, and Reasi. It will gradually be rolled out in the remaining districts by or before October 2. It will replace the current portal which was launched back in 2018,” an official spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lt-governor-manoj-sinha-rolls-out-j-k-grievance-redressal-system/story-BdbUNh6tBFbof2nsgEVnXN.html

Flying squad teams of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Delhi Police will inspect the Metro routinely to ensure commuters do not violate social distancing norms. As part of the last leg of the graded resumption, DMRC has reopened its final line, the Airport Express Line (Dwarka Sector- 21 to New Delhi), and resumed its regular timings of 6am to 11pm. Saturday is the first day since March 22 when Delhi Metro trains are running on the pre-lockdown schedule. Also Read: If you’re travelling in Delhi Metro, strictly adhere to social distancing rulesSince the beginning of the week, when the Delhi Metro started reopening its network to commuters in a graded manner, the timings of the service have been limited to two shifts, morning and evening. This was primarily done to acclimatise commuters to the new rules of travel, meant to ensure social distancing. “The operations are being resumed fully from Saturday, but passengers requested to stagger their journeys so that there are no peak crowding hours,” said Mangu Singh, managing director, DMRC. Since the reopening of the Metro, passenger movement on all of its corridors is witnessing a steady increase, which also means that DMRC will, from Saturday, face a greater challenge in crowd management.

12-09-2020||Kolkata||Busting fake news is Mamata Banerjee’s key battle strategy for 2021 polls||With the crucial 2021 assembly polls approaching, the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal has started preparing for a battle against fake news and rumours that may be circulated through social networking sites and micro-blogging sites to project the ruling Trinamool Congress in a bad light. The chief minister had recently asked the Kolkata Police and West Bengal Police to strengthen their cyber-crime cells to tackle complaints of cybercrime at highest priority. The state criminal investigation department (CID) has already come up with a cyber-forensics and digital evidence examination laboratory. “Cybercrime has increased. We have to strengthen the cybercrime cell. All police stations need to be more alert when it comes to cybercrime. There should not be any dilly-dallying. Tackling cyber-crime is our priority,” Banerjee had said while addressing a program to observe Police Day on September 8. The warning came after a social media post, saying that the state government has imposed several restrictions during Durga Puja, was circulated. A few persons were arrested after the chief minister directed the police to crack down. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and polls in four state assemblies, the election commission of India (ECI) spotted more than 154 instances of fake news or misinformation on social media platforms. In the last five months alone more than 250 persons were arrested from across West Bengal for posting and forwarding allegedly harmful fake news and rumours. In West Bengal just before the Lok Sabha polls, an entire newspaper page of a vernacular daily was photo-shopped to spread fake news in which Mamata Banerjee was quoted saying that she would show how to make Hindus cry if she wins all 42 seats in the state. “The chief minister has asked to explore options if students from IIT and various universities could be roped in to do internships at the cyber-crime cells of the state police. All police stations have been asked to tackle all complaints of cybercrime and potentially harmful fake news on a priority basis,” said a senior police officer. The chief minister had recently launched a veiled attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT cell hinting that it was behind some such fake posts and rumors.

On August 31, the TMC had sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, complaining that hundreds of accounts of TMC supporters on the social networking site and on WhatsApp have been removed. In another letter, the party wrote that the blocking of pages and accounts points to the link between Facebook and BJP.

12-09-2020||City||Maratha reservation: We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the issue, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the Maharashtra government would speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Apex court’s interim stay on the reservation for the Maratha community in Maharashtra and request his intervention in the issue. The state government is also tapping the possibility of issuing an ordinance to safeguard the interest of students seeking college admissions under Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. The Supreme Court (SC), while transferring the plea challenging the quota to the constitutional bench on Wednesday stayed the reservation to the Maratha community. The decision has led to widespread discontent among community members as the ongoing admission process is largely affected. Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by Thackeray, swung into action after the decision and held a series of meetings over the past three days. Thackeray and his cabinet colleagues from the sub-committee on the reservation interacted with senior counsels and community leaders on Friday. During the meeting, Thackeray said that the central government should take a stand on the Apex court decision. “We will raise this issue in the Parliament as we are committed to safeguard the interest of the community. Not only Maharashtra, but even other states have been struggling with reservation-related issues, which the PM should look into. We have decided to request him to intervene,” CM said. Thackeray also said that the state government is also tapping the possibility of issuing an ordinance to ensure that the admission process was not hampered. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said that there was room for legal battle, though the reservation has been stayed by the Apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maratha-reservation-we-will-request-prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-intervene-in-the-issue-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-rboVKW4WeO7FvBXDt88ncL.html

12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Maize prices crashed this time, repeat feared during basmati, cotton season||The trends during the maize procurement in Punjab that ended recently were not encouraging with the farmers getting nearly 30% less prices for their produce than the last year. This also resulted in fall in revenues for the state government that gets market fee on the sale of the produce at the grain markets even as there was surge in arrivals this year. Maize was the first crop to reach the mandis after the Centre passed two agriculture sector ordinances in June. “The prices crashed from Rs 1,500 per quintal last year to Rs 1,100 this time. Market fee and rural development fund collected this year was Rs 1.44 crore against the last year’s Rs 1.84 crore,” HS Brar, a senior Punjab Mandi Board official said. Even more worrying is the fact that agriculture experts and farmer unions are apprehending a repeat of the trend during the cotton and basmati procurement for which arrivals are expected to start any time. “The prospects for cotton and basmati are not reassuring since the buyer is apprehensive to enter the market in the wake of the new ordinances,” said BS Rajewal, who heads a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “These two crops are not covered under the assured procurement system as is wheat and paddy. Therefore, the prices are governed by the market dynamics. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, have brought in uncertainty in the trading of agricultural produce,” said a mandi board official.In 2019, 2.57 lakh tonne maize was purchased from mandis in Punjab while 2.61 lakh tonne produce was procured this time, as per the figures compiled by the mandi board. Cotton arrivals are expected to begin in mandis soon as the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has fixed October 1 as beginning of the crop purchase schedule.Rs 5,710 has been fixed as minimum support price (MSP) per bale of cotton against the last year’s Rs 5,450. However, the private buyer who purchased just two-third of harvest paid the farmers an average Rs 3,800 per bale. Agriculture department officials said they succeeded in increasing the area under cultivation of maize, basmati and cotton and now the next challenge was to fetch good remunerative price for the these crops.“There is the need to effectively implement the MSP and assured procurement of all crops. The forthcoming procurement of cotton and basmati will be quite crucial,” said Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor BS Dhillon. WAIVE LEVIES ON BASMATI: EXPORTERS In a communiqué to chief principal secretary to Punjab chief minister, Suresh Kumar, the Punjab Basmati Exporters Association has demanded waiver of 2% market fee and of rural development fund on the purchase of the aromatic variety of rice. “If this does not happen, we will not be able to make purchases in the state, which comprises 40% of Rs 34,000 crore exports from India. We appeal to the state government to waive all levies and support the basmati growers,” association director Ashok Sethi said. The harvest of the 1,509 variety of aromatic grain has started and arrivals were reported in some places. Of at least 16 lakh acre under cultivation of aromatic grain, 40% is the 1,509 and the rest is the 1,121 variety. “We are paying 8.5% over and above the cost of grain, which includes 2.5% dami to arhtiyas, transport and labour charges and 4% states taxes. These taxes are not charges in other basmati-growing states,” added Sethi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/maize-prices-crashed-this-time-repeat-feared-during-basmati-cotton-season/story-j3OwueZoTN3UlIRdf5F3hO.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||After Supreme Court raps state, Maharashtra pollution control body admits rampant illegal activities are polluting Ulhas, Waldhuni rivers||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has accepted that illegal discharge of effluents by industrial units and absence of proper vigilance, which allowed violations to continue, are the main reasons behind the high pollution levels at the Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “There are two specific issues: first, industries may have permission to discharge effluents, but are carrying out illegal activities [discharging effluents without treating them or beyond permissible limits]. The second issue is units are functioning illegally without any consent,” said a senior MPCB official.The admission comes after the Supreme Court (SC) earlier this week highlighted the failure of state bodies to discharge their duties in improving the water quality of the rivers, despite repeated orders by the Apex court. “The material which has been produced on record demonstrates that the situation warrants urgent and immediate remedial steps. There has been a failure of statutory bodies to discharge their responsibilities under the law,” read the SC order published on Thursday. MPCB said it was formulating an action plan to address the issue. MPCB chairman Sudhir Srivastava said the pollution control body will increase vigilance. “Apart from sewage coming from towns such as Ulhasnagar, Badlapur, Kalyan etc, the main problem is the illegal activities being conducted by industries. This [pollution] is happening more at Waldhuni, which later meets Ulhas. Given the challenges pertaining to the illegal disposal of waste [into the rivers], we will increase vigilance, manpower and monitoring across the entire length of the two rivers. We are also following up with urban local bodies to ensure that their respective sewage treatment programmes are implemented swiftly,” he said. The SC bench of justices DY Chandrachud and KM Joseph on September 7 heard an interim application filed by environment group Vanashakti, alleging industries had dumped untreated effluents at several sections of the two rivers. While the Ulhas river turned turquoise (see image) and witnessed foam, between May and June water in Waldhuni turned deep red in some parts of MMR. Despite repeated complaints, there was no action on ground regarding their grievances, Vanashakti alleged. SC directed Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to file a report within three weeks (from September 7) after inspecting both the rivers to identify the units which are causing pollution and then formulate recommendations and steps that need to be taken by the municipal corporations concerned (which will include Ulhasnagar, Kalyan Dombivli, Kulgaon Badlapur and Ambernath), regulatory bodies and units to remedy the situation. The fact that MPCB has been kept out of the investigation was a clear indictment of its failure to do its duties honestly, said applicant Stalin D, director of Vanashakti. “MPCB has consistently failed to take credible action against polluting industries and has always offered a cover up,” he said. Ulhas and Waldhuni are among 53 of the most polluted rivers from Maharashtra – the highest for any state among the 351 most polluted rivers in India – according to the CPCB. The 122-km Ulhas River supplies drinking water to more than 30 lakh residents along the Badlapur-Thane belt. The SC is hearing the issue since 2017 and several orders were passed over the past three years directing the state to improve water quality. The SC bench on September 7 directed the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to file a compliance report for previous orders within two weeks. “The court will also review whether compliance has been made of the time-lines set out in the previous order for the completion and commissioning of projects (by the next date of hearing on October 7),” the order said. Zaman Ali, the counsel for Vanashakti, said a massive increase in industrial pollution in Ulhas river soon after the lockdown forced them to move SC. “Such high pollution levels, even when the matter is being monitored by the SC, shows that MPCB has remained incompetent to address this issue and that is why CPCB has been directed to take over the functions,” said Ali. SL Waghmare, MPCB regional officer (Kalyan), said the local common effluent treatment plant (CETP) responsible for violating water quality norms during the lockdown was fined ₹5 lakh. “We also shut down one unit which was using chemical dyes. The investigation into the other violators is under way,” he said. According to Stalin, industries under MIDC continue to operate without a CETP. “Instead of acting on violations, the MPCB tripled the consent capacities of the polluters. We are hopeful that the judiciary will ensure that the guilty officials are brought to justice,” he said. According to MIDC, there are 1,160 industries across Badlapur, Ambernath and Dombivli, of which 631 were classified as ‘polluting industries’. These discharge 25.7 million litres of effluents to five CETPs for treatment each day. In addition to it, untreated sewage is discharged from areas under municipal limits to the rivers. “The construction of a 7.7-km disposal line connecting effluent discharge from CETPs emptying into a creek away from both rivers is underway. This will reduce the pollutant load significantly and it will be completed by February 2022,” said Kalidas Bandekar, superintendent engineer (MMR), MIDC. ‘Samples from drinking water zone found unfit for consumption’ A water quality report from last year, based on samples collected from the drinking water zone of both the rivers showed that the water was highly acidic. The water was collected by members of the Ulhasnagar and Ambernath Citizens Forum and sent for testing to a private lab. “Drinking water was found not fit for consumption. Despite repeated interventions of the SC, numerous complaints to the CPCB and faulty investigations by local MPCB officials, the environmental quality of this entire region continues to deteriorate each day, with only industrial bodies profiting, even as the health of residents worsen,” said Satyajit Burman, member of the forum. Srivastava said MPCB shut down more than 500 illegal jeans washing units and also directed the closure of several textile units using chemical dyes near both rivers. “Violations have been booked but owing to fewer officials, cases have not been completely pursued and arrests haven’t taken place. With the execution of our latest plans, we will ensure that there is no illegal dumping of waste or effluents. In case of such activities, we will ensure strict action against violators to guarantee deterrence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-supreme-court-raps-state-maharashtra-pollution-control-body-admits-rampant-illegal-activities-are-polluting-ulhas-waldhuni-rivers/story-hiy5h9fyJRcWSNRvcwXG0M.html

This comes after an inquiry panel looking into the issue of the missing saroops from the gurdwara body’s publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, Amritsar, found that employees used to give the ‘birs’ illegally to people and pocketed the money. “We made some suggestions to SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal to prevent misappropriation in future. One suggestion was that the saroops should be printed as per requirement. The SGPC should first receive application and then send a team for verification to the place where the saroop is to be installed. The saroop should be printed accordingly,” Giani Harpreet Singh said on Friday. On the demand for the saroops in the foreign countries, he said, “Either these saroops should be sent from here with proper ‘maryada’ or they be printed by the Sikh bodies in the respective countries in collaboration with the SGPC.” “I have asked the SGPC to punish the guilty on the basis of the report of the inquiry panel,” said he when asked to comment on U-turn made by the SGPC on filing criminal cases against the employees indicted in the report.In the wake of the 400th birth anniversary of ninth Sikh master Guru Teg Bahadar next year, the jathedar said he had asked the SGPC to re-print its all the publications which are out of print for several years. “These publications include valuable books and tracts that should be read by the Sikh youth. For example, a kind of white paper was published by it on Sikh the genocide of November 1984, but it is not available now,” he added. Presently, the SGPC charges Rs 2,100 per saroop (large and medium size), said an office-bearer of the gurdwara body. “The amount is not charged as price of the holy saroop, but as offering. Otherwise, the cost of printing of a saroop is much higher than this,” he added. MISSING SAROOPS: SIKH BODIES BARRED FROM GATHERING AT GOLDEN TEMPLEA day after the Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, Punjab, and other Sikh bodies announced to meet at the Golden Temple on September 14 to chalk out the strategy to get justice in case of the missing Guru Granth Sahib ‘saroops’, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Friday debarred them from holding any gathering in the shrine complex. In a press release, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said since Manji Sahib Diwan Hall on the premises of the Golden Temple is a sacred place, any kind of demonstration cannot be allowed there. “Instead of playing politics on the issue of the holy saroops, activists of the Satkar Committee should tell first about the whereabouts of the saroops taken away by them from different places on the pretext of violation of maryada. The sangat wants detail about where these saroops and the items needed for the parkash (installation of saroops) are,” he said. He appealed to Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to get clarification from the committee in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-charge-money-for-installing-saroops-on-demand-akal-takht-to-sgpc/story-tmBfq4K2V2vo3SPL69likM.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||I have not got proposal from state for 12 nominations to legislative Council yet, says Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari||While there is speculation that Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was opposing the appointment of 12 members to the legislative Council from Governor quota, Koshyari on Friday equated the situation with the proverb ‘spirit is willing but the flesh is weak’ and clarified that there were no recommendations made by the government in the first place. Speaking to reporters at Raj Bhavan, he said that he has been hearing about the recommendations for the last two months, but he received no communication all these days.Koshyari also said that there were no differences between him and chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray or other leaders. “I share very cordial relations with the CM. He is a gentleman. I do not like to interfere in anybody’s work and give my opinion only if asked for. The state government has its commitment, and they try to obey it. Even If some people express their unhappiness over my style of working, they are all our people,” he said. The Governor also clarified that he was not unhappy over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s action against actor Kangana Ranaut’s office. He said that there was no substance in the media reports that he was unhappy over the demolition drive by the civic body at Kangana’s office. He said that he was not concerned about the Kangana episode and he never expressed his discontent over it. He was referring to the media report that claimed that he had summoned Thackeray’s principal secretary Ajoy Mehta and expressed his dismay on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-there-are-says-no-differences-between-him-and-cm-uddhav-thackeray-says-he-has-not-yet-received-proposal-for-council-nominations/story-bTEbiGfjmZCmCfSBUhJGBJ.html

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Non-removal of electric cables brings Dombivli ROB work to standstill||The work of long-awaited Dombivli Rail Over Bridge (ROB) has come to a standstill because the work of removing five electric cables is pending.The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has approached the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) asking it to remove the cables.   The work of the ROB was taken up during lockdown period by the civic body. However, it has now slowed down.“We cannot carry forward the work unless the cables are removed. We have asked the MSEDCL to carry out the work with priority and they have also agreed to it,” said Tarun Juneja, executive engineer, KDMC.Once the cables are removed, the civic body will take up the work of laying concrete for the bridge. The KDMC expect to complete the work by November.The repair work of the Dombivli ROB was initiated in June by the civic body and Central Railway (CR) after a major part of the bridge was dismantled in a span of 15 days, taking advantage of the lockdown period.The bridge was shut in September 2019 after it was declared unsafe by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay in May 2019 after an audit.The entire repair work will cost around Rs 10.50cr.As the repair work got delayed, there have been complaints from the commuters regarding the ordeal they face while taking the alternative Thakurli ROB through the narrow lanes in the city. There has been a continuous demand to take up the repair work.“The closure of the bridge has led to major traffic snarls in the city. It is high time it was repaired and opened for the commuters. Since the lockdown is relaxed, vehicles have started moving out and again there is congestion reported,” said Manohar Pillai, 36, a resident of Dombivli.An officer from MSEDCL who did not wish to be named said, “As per the requirement, we have asked the contractor to take up the work of removing the cables. We have directed the contractor to complete the work by September 27.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/work-on-rob-in-dombivli-near-mumbai-comes-to-a-halt/story-3So4BKdO1y4lUfPevKXKDM.html

Panvel Taluka health officer, Dr Sunil Nakhate, said that the mass testing will curb cases in the villages.The initiative was started on September 3. The front warriors, involving health workers, sanitisation workers, school teachers, anganwadi workers, ASHA workers have been specifically asked to go through the tests along with the residents.Nakhate said, “We have asked the residents to get their tests done. If found positive, they are asked to get quarantined. Some of them have the facility to quarantine themselves at their homes and choose that. Those who don’t are sent to our Covid facility centres.”Till September 10, around 1,516 people underwent the test. Of these, 132 were found positive and the rest negative. Of those found postive, 62 were symptomatic while the remaining asymptomatic. Twenty eight patients were above 50 years of age.Nakhate added, “We have received 3,000 kits so far. We will receive more as per our requirement. In the next batch of antigen kits that would be received by the taluka office, the first preference would be for the shopkeepers, vegetable sellers and others who have been providing essentials to the people.School teachers, anganwadi workers, ASHA workers are all together working to spread awareness as well among the people. In Ulwe, there have been announcements made by rickshaw drivers in the node about free antigen tests that is made available for the people.As per the state figures, the Raigad district has a total of 22,720 positive cases and 555 deaths. In NumbersTotal Antigen Kits received: 3000  Village             Testing kits      Testing Done  Positive casesGavhan            550      312      11Vavanje           250      212      16 Nere    775      284      26 Ajivali             575      310      61 Apta    550      356      18 Ulwe   300      42        0||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mass-antigen-tests-begin-in-rural-panvel-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-vA90iXLiEkDdJQ2U6TPCAL.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Bhiwandi civic body to test entire housing society even if one person tests positive for Covid-19||The Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) is conducting tests for entire housing society even if one person in it tests positive. Unlike earlier, residents are also eager to get themselves tested in Bhiwandi.Bhiwandi city civic chief Pankaj Ashiya said, “We no longer have cases in any particular area. There are sporadic cases. With increased travelling for work, most of the cases are from residential complexes. Hence, we have started antigen testing for everyone in the society even if a single patient tests positive. We will also begin 24-hour testing at all Covid care centres and hospitals while a mobile testing facility will also be operational. Our current focus is making testing easily accessible for locals; both antigen and RT-PCR are available.”The BNCMC reported 19 positive cases and two deaths on Thursday. Till now, it has recorded 4,723 positive cases. However, among the 23 deaths that took place in August, 15 of them were getting treated outside Bhiwandi. Similarly, from among the 180 active cases in the city currently, 30 are in facilities based outside Bhiwandi civic body precincts. The civic body has a positivity percentage less than 5%.“There are many from Bhiwandi who prefer getting treated in Thane or Mumbai, but we are making efforts to ensure that everyone avails treatment within the corporation. Through this, we can save on the transport distance and provide timely treatment, and also helps us monitor their health,” added Ashiya.Harsha Muduli, 49, resident of Varaladevi Society in Padma Nagar, said, “Earlier, even if there were symptoms, people would not get them tested or even visit a doctor. However, with increased testing facilities introduced through various means by the civic body; the residents seem eager. When we had a positive case in our society, all the residents cooperated and came forward to get them tested through the antigen facility.”  ‘Not to reject any patient’With fewer positive cases, two-thirds of Covid beds in the city have been given to patients from rural areas and other municipal corporations. “This has been our policy to not reject any patients. We have more than two-thirds beds available for other corporations. There are many from Badlapur, Shahapur rural, Bhiwandi rural and other places who visit our facilities for treatment. Similar trust is expected from those residing within the Bhiwandi civic body,” added Ashiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-civic-body-to-test-entire-housing-society-even-if-one-person-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-F3xpphBcUEZNyDW6S2HEVO.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation to start resurvey for new Development Plan||With the current Development Plan (DP) for the city completing 20 years in 2023, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has decided to start a resurvey of the city to prepare a new DP by that year. The corporation has tabled a proposal in the general body meeting to be held on September 18 to start work on the new DP. The corporation has so far implemented merely 35 per cent of the old DP.The work of formulating a new DP will include re-examination of the sanctioned DP, carrying out a fresh survey of the city in accordance with the provisions of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966, mapping the existing land usage, finalising provisions for the new DP of the city keeping in mind the projected population for the next 20 years.  The earlier DP was formulated in 1999 and implemented in 2003. The total area of TMC is 128.23sqm, the city has creek on one side and national park mountain on the other side. The city also has one of the biggest industrial belt at Wagale Estate. The new DP will have to take into account the real estate boom in the last two decades and the exponential increase in population.An officer from TMC said, “As per the rule, for the formulation of new DP, we will first have to carry out a survey of existing land use, how much of the land is encroached upon, the open spaces and the reserved plots among others. The map of this land use will then be drafted and published to invite suggestions and objections. The work of the actual DP will then start. This will require at least three years as we will have to conduct a Geographical Information Survey (GIS) of the city.”The proposal for the fresh survey is tabled in the general body for approval.   SALIENT FEATURES OF EARLIER PLAN The total area of corporation is 128.23sqm. The broad categorisation shows that 59.30sqm is developable, 36.82sqm non-developable while 32.11sqm is under green zoneThere are 11 planning sectors, where 804 are total reserved sites covering area of 12.67sqmThe area under road shown in the development plan is 7.42sqm. The area under residential zone is 26.65sqm, while that under industrial zone is 12.54sqmAs per 1991 prices, the cost of acquisition of entire land under reservation has been worked out as Rs 209 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-corporation-to-start-resurvey-for-new-development-plan/story-LmnFZIrBXUgNNwYqfebREP.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||804 industrial units in Taloja MIDC belt reopen; lakhs of workers rejoice||Around 804 industrial units in Taloja MIDC belt that had been shut for the past five months have received permission from the state government to start operations from Thursday.The entire Taloja MIDC belt is now operational for the first time since lockdown was announced. Lakhs of workers employed in the belt have heaved a sigh of relief. There are a total of 973 units in Taloja industrial belt. Of these, 169 had been operational as they provided essential goods and services. The remaining 804 had been shut resulting in hardship for the employees and the management. Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhari has stated that the industries permitted to be reopened in the Taloja belt will be monitored by her officials to ensure strict implementation of the Covid-related guidelines specified for the industries. She has also suggested that the managements will test each of their workers so that the virus does not spread. Speaking on the permission granted for reopening of the industries, Chaudhari said, “There was some lack of clarity in the guidelines that had resulted in the industries remaining closed. It said that the MMR non-essential industries will not be allowed to be opened. The guidelines were for MMR industries and Taloja is in the municipal corporation area. We had written to the state government to clarify on the issue.”She added that the state has permitted to open up the industries including those in Taloja. The district was keen to start the industries as it was causing employment issues. Chaudhari said, “The industries have to work with Covid-appropriate behaviour. We have our officers appointed to verify if the employees are being tested, masks are being worn, physical distancing being maintained, canteens not functioning and other multiple guidelines.”The Taloja Industries Association (TIA) had been following up on the issue with the state government to get the industries started. Satish Shetty, president of TIA, said, “We had been in touch with all levels of the government and gave representations to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary. We have finally succeeded in our efforts.” There are over two lakh workers employed in the belt. Most of them were unemployed as the units shut in lockdown period. Shetty added, “Several returned to their native places. Now there will be new job opportunities. We shall follow all the norms and guidelines given by the government and start our operations as we have received the requisite permission.” Mangesh Suryavanshi, a worker employed in a chemical factory, said, “Our prayers have been answered. I was having a very difficult time managing my family and had to take up some temporary daily wage jobs. Now I can look forward to a steady income.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lakhs-of-workers-rejoice-as-804-industrial-units-in-taloja-midc-belt-in-navi-mumbai-reopen/story-BryGUGsSO84CbeU7S94fkN.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Four years on, water woes of Kharghar residents may end||After facing water problems for four years, residents of Sectors 30 to 36 in Kharghar are finally free of water tankers.Thousands of residents residing on higher altitude in Kharghar can now get adequate water supply in their taps as three High Service Reservoirs (HSRs) at Owa hills in Kharghar are now commissioned.The three HSRs on the Owa hills were constructed around six years ago but have been commissioned to use only recently.Placed on a higher altitude of Kharghar node, Sectors 30 to 36 including Taloja jail require 68 to 70 million litres per day (MLD) of water supply. However, only 55 to 60 MLD of water had been supplied for over four years leading to an acute shortage. The three HSRs have now increased the supply to 63-65 MLD.Gajanan Dalal, chief engineer from CIDCO water department, said, “Previously, the water received at pump house in Kharghar directly pumped the water to the consumers in these sectors. The water was carried in horizontal pipelines. Thus, the pressure of water was less so as to reach the Sectors at higher altitude. Now, we are using HSR which are on the top of Owa hills.”According Dalal, the water from dam comes to pump house. This is first pumped to the three new HSRs that are inter-connected with a total capacity of 54 MLD. “When the valve of the HSR is opened, the water from the HSR uses gravitational force as pressure to flow down to the housing societies,” Dalal said.Dalal, however, refused to comment on the reason for delay in commissioning of the HSR, claiming that he took charge recently and the delay was not during his tenure.The Kharghar Taloja Colonies Welfare Association (KTCWA) had been writing to CIDCO officers and staging protests demanding regular water supply since the last three years.Mangesh Ranawade (51), chairman of KTCWA, said, “With the joint efforts of KTCWA and CIDCO officials, the Sectors between 30 and 36 were highly dependent on tankers. Now, we have finally become tanker-free. We were grappling with water scarcity for the last three to four years. By commissioning the new reservoirs, water is also distributed equally to the societies.”To solve the issues, KTCWA and CIDCO conducted a systematic study of more than 115 societies in the area with respect to number of flats and their meter readings.Girish Divekar, 39, a resident of Ventures Residency, said, “We used to face issues in all seasons except during rainy months. There was a major issue of unequal distribution of water. Since April, the situation has improved. CIDCO has committed to provide 675 litres per flat. Ours is a small society with only 24 flats, yet we needed tankers daily during summer.” Minor issues still unresolvedAnuj Tomar, 36, secretary of Ellite Homes Housing Society, said they were still facing issues due to the piping of the society. “We need to change the old pipelines in our society as the pressure of the water is now good and we too can get adequate supply. I am staying here since six years but facing water crisis for the last three years. The water scarcity started as the population in the area started increasing. Last year, our society had to get a bore well dug too,” Tomar said.Ranawade informed that the last 10 societies in these sectors were still facing issues and the forum is working to resolve them. He said, “After discussions with CIDCO on September 4, it was decided to change the piping of the societies as they were quite old. Once that is done, their issues too would be resolved.” Call for helpMembers of KTCWA have appealed to the societies in Kharghar Sectors 30 to 36 to contact KTCWA on WhatsApp number 7798833777, and give details if they were still facing water-related issues. In NumbersKharghar needs: 70 MLD  NMMC provides: 10 MLD  Hetawane Dam provides: 55 MLD  Shortage: 5 MLD   HOW THE PROBLEM OF SECTORS 30-36 WAS SOLVED?  Lapses in distribution identifiedSystematic study conducted of more than 115 societies in these areas with respect to number of flats and their meter readingsSocieties’ piping that were old and had less thickness changedUtilised High Service Reservoirs (HSR) at Owa hills  Direct supply from HSRs to Kharghar instead of from pump house High Service Reservoirs historyThe three HSRs on the Owa hills were constructed around six years ago and the piping work and commissioning of the same had been pending since then.

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra at 1 million: Covid-19 spreads in rural areas||Although Mumbai, Thane and Pune still remain the epicentre of the pandemic, Covid-19 infection is fast spreading in rural districts of Maharashtra, with districts once tagged as green zones owing to minimal cases, recording the highest growth rate in the past 10 days. Many districts have acute shortage of beds in intensive care units (ICU) and essentials, including drugs and oxygen. While Mumbai, Thane, and Pune constitute almost 54% of total Covid-19 cases in the state, the growth rate has come under control. Between September 1 and 10, Pune has recorded 22.3% growth, followed by Mumbai with 19.1% and Thane 12.6%. But districts like Bhandara, 908km away from Mumbai, recorded a 105.2% growth in the past 10 days, the highest in the state. On September 1, 1,173 Covid-19 cases were reported, which rose to 2,408 on September 10. Wardha, which was a green zone in April, has recorded a 96.7% rise, as the number of patients rose to 2,019 from 1,026 in the same period. Gondia registered 1,569 cases on the first day of September, which increased to 2,769 within 10 days. This counts as 76.4% rise in cases. In Chandrapur, cases surged to 4,697 from 2,639 (78.3%). Sindhudurg, which was again a green zone district, has gained the fifth top slot by registering 64.9% growth rate. The cases rose to 2,157 from 1,308 in 10 days. “Pandemic spreads like waves of the earthquake. It started with Mumbai and Pune, but has now spread to all districts. With the gradual unlocking of the lockdown, movement of people in the interiors have increased and so this was expected,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Many hospitals in these regions are facing acute shortage of medical staff and essential drugs. Dr Ajay Dawale, district health officer, Wardha, said, “We have enough beds with oxygen facilities, but we don’t have an adequate number of ICU beds. We are in talks with private hospitals to increase ICU and ventilator beds at the earliest. We have already tied up with 27 private hospitals. We need more medical staffers to treat patients in government hospitals.” Human right activists have complained there is an acute shortage of drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, which are an integral part of Covid-19 treatment. “It took me two days to arrange for a unit of Tocilizumab for a 54-year-old patient admitted at a private hospital. The government is just focussing on Pune and Mumbai. The sudden rise in cases in Bhandara has taken the government by surprise. We don’t have basic medical amenities like oxygen,” said Surendra Patil, part of the NGO, Jan Vidhan in Bhandara. Dr Milind Motghare, district health officer, said, “Initially, there were some shortages, but now we have enough stock.” To address the oxygen crisis, especially in far-off rural parts of the state, the health department has started control rooms in all districts. However, as cases are increasing in these areas, they often face problems in transporting oxygen when sudden need arises. “On Friday, we held a meeting with all district medical officers. We have already instructed them to procure dura oxygen cylinders on priority. After receiving the list of requirements from 16 districts, we have handed over the jumbo cylinders to them,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of health, Maharashtra. “We have also held meetings with the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for the procurement process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-at-1-million-covid-19-spreads-in-rural-areas/story-rkJBxSd0GHBr053ShF1o4L.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||You don’t demolish Dawood Ibrahim’s house, but you razed Kangana’s: Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis takes pot shots at Shiv Sena||Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Friday took pot shots at the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the demolition of actor Kangana Ranaut’s office by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for the alleged illegal structural changes. The civic body is ruled by the Shiv Sena. Fadnavis questioned why the house of underworld gangster Dawood Ibrahim has not been demolished.“The issue was blown out of proportion by you [Shiv Sena]. After you went to demolish her house, reports on illegal houses of Shiv Sena leaders are coming out. You don’t go to demolish Dawood’s home but you razed her [Ranaut’s] place,” the former chief minister (CM) said.“BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has nothing to do with her [Ranaut],” Fadnavis said in response to a question over his party’s links with the actor.He also said this was not a national issue. Fadnavis said Sena leaders behaved “foolishly” and are now putting the blame on the BJP.“In fact, her [Ranaut’s] mother in an interview said the family was related to Congress and were expecting support from the party, but when an attempt was made on Kangana’s life, the Bharatiya Janata Party provided her security,” he clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/you-don-t-demolish-dawood-ibrahim-s-house-but-you-razed-kangana-s-former-maharashtra-cm-devendra-fadnavis-takes-pot-shots-at-shiv-sena/story-tIG1McNR5prXqAOxnVvNLI.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||‘Covid-19 yet to reach peak in Maharashtra’||While Maharashtra went past 10 lakh Covid-19 cases on Friday, state health department officials said the pandemic is expected to rage on for two more months. Officials said the state has not touched the peak of coronavirus cases yet as districts are at various stages of the outbreak. In the past 15 days alone, the state has added 83,198 active cases, with a 46.67% spike in active caseload. On August 27, Maharashtra had 178,234 active cases which rose to 261,432 on September 10. Yet to peak Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said the state will continue showing a higher number of cases as tests have increased. However, Awate pointed out the “positives” stating that over seven lakh people have recovered so far and the case fatality rate (CFR) has seen a dip in September. He said the spread has moved from Mumbai-Thane belt to rural areas, adding that Nagpur and districts in western Maharashtra are seeing a high number of cases due to proximity to Pune district. “We will continue to see a record high for a few more weeks. But there are positive signs in districts like Parbhani and Sindhudurg, where discharges are more than new cases… It is a tendency of people to look at 10 lakh cases, but it should be highlighted that over seven lakh people have recovered. Of them, nearly two lakh have recovered between August 25 and September 10,” he said. Awate, however, conceded the concern for the state for the past few weeks is the spread of coronavirus in rural areas. “The spread in rural and semi-urban areas has seen an increase. For instance, the growth rate in Pune rural is 25%, while Pimpri-Chinchwad is 12%. The situation is similar in Solapur city and its rural part,” he said. Subhash Salunkhe, former director of health services in Maharashtra, who is also on the state-appointed Covid task force, said, “We will record more cases for two more months. We are still reaching the peak of the pandemic. In the meantime, public and private hospitals need to work together to supplement the shortfall of health infrastructure in rural areas. Besides, self-discipline is crucial to help contain the spread.” Deaths a concern The increasing number of deaths on a daily basis is another worry for the state. In September alone, Maharashtra recorded 4,092 fatalities due to Covid-19, which is nearly 15% of the state’s death toll due to Covid. The state has, so far, recorded 28,724 fatalities since the outbreak. Awate said, “The case fatality rate (CFR) in five districts, including Nagpur, Solapur and Mumbai, is higher than 3%. However, it will be brought under control with increased surveillance. On the positive side, CFR in September has been around 1.8%, which is lower than the overall rate (2.83%).” Salunkhe blamed the lackadaisical approach of the district and municipal bodies to trace and track high-risk contacts in time as one of the reasons for mortality. He said, “There are laid protocols and guidelines; there is nothing left to do to bring down CFR other than aggressive surveillance. Tracing and tracking are crucial. Besides, the health department should also train doctors. An intensivist treating a patient in Mumbai or Thane will be different than one treating in rural or semi-urban areas.” The state government has started tele-ICU initiative for doctors from rural areas to get assistance from Covid task force of specialist doctors for critical patients. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, said lack of manpower and late admission in hospital are key reasons for higher mortality rate. “People, especially with co-morbidities, need to get admitted in time. Generally, it is observed they get admitted four-five days after the first symptom appears, which is when they cannot get admitted on a normal oxygenated bed, but need ICCU beds. There is no skilled manpower. The government needs to think of training doctors and retrain them as the virus is changing patterns.” Way forward The state health department officials said people would have to get used to “living with the virus”, but with adequate precautions. A senior bureaucrat said, “Since unlocking of activities began, we had anticipated the increase in cases. Now with inter-district movement allowed, the cases have shot up. How can lockdown go on? People will have to carry on their activities, but they have to discipline themselves to save themselves from falling prey to the virus.”Salunkhe added that though cases are going up in Mumbai and Pune over the past few days, a limited period lockdown will be “counter-productive”. “Instead, self-discipline is needed. I still see people in Pune do not wear face masks,” he said. He added that despite the fatigue catching up, local bodies also need to continue surveillance. “People must remain alert for symptoms and get tested. People over the age of 60 must not step out; if any symptoms show, they need to get admitted to a Covid hospital,” he said. Pattiwar added the state government needs to create more awareness, more so in rural areas. “The government needs to constantly remind people of the dangers of Covid and the precautions. Unless this is done, unlock and lack of precautions will continue to give rise to cases,” he said. “Successive governments have ignored health infrastructure in the country and state. However, there are two ways to look at it – glass half full or half empty. Right now, we need to look at the half-full and tackle the other bit later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-yet-to-reach-peak-in-maharashtra/story-VDwyDBMC1s5cziqqmP7zWM.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Ready reckoner rates hiked in Maharashtra from today; realty sector unhappy||In a damper for the realty sector – which is already reeling under an acute slowdown – the Maharashtra government has hiked the ready reckoner rates by an average of 1.74% across the state from Saturday. The move will result in costlier properties, as the stamp duty is set to increase, apart from increasing the overall project cost for the builders.The move has evoked criticism from the real estate sector on Friday, with most stakeholders terming the move as uncalled for, given the current unprecedented crisis caused owing to the Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown. The decision comes after the state recently reduced the stamp duty for a temporary basis to boost property sales.Omprakash Deshmukh, inspector general of stamps and registration, termed the hike “negligible”.“The average hike is just 1.74% across the state and this will hardly affect the real estate sector. We have hiked ready reckoner rates after more than two years and the rates are from the time of 2017,” said Deshmukh.He justified the hike and said the increase in the rate in Mumbai was only 0.5 %, while for Navi Mumbai, Thane and Raigad the rates are revised to 0.99%, 0.44% and 3%, respectively.Deshmukh said the hike was implemented after studying various aspects such as the stamp duty registrations, sales data, local surveys, visits to property exhibitions and major transactions conducted over the year.Builders have condemned the hike as a “negative step”.“How can we reduce prices when the government is hiking the rates instead of decreasing them,” said Sandeep Runwal, director of Runwal Group.“All the factors such as premiums, stamp duty as well as income tax rates are linked to ready reckoner rates and this increase will have a cascading effect all across,” he added.Anuj Puri, the chairman of ANAROCK Property Consultants, said the sector was looking for cuts in the ready reckoner rates.“Hiking the ready reckoner rates limits the room for builders to cut down the real estate prices,” said Puri.The ready reckoner rate is a guide published annually by the state government, which determines the rate of properties in a particular area, on which stamp duty and registration charges are levied. In addition, all calculations related to real estate whether it is premiums, tax collection or even Income tax matters related to the construction sector is dependent on ready reckoner rates .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ready-reckoner-rates-hiked-in-maharashtra-from-today-realty-sector-unhappy/story-l4WUC82Yb6aow8xTUscvxK.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Herd immunity not proven, learn to live with the virus: Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra Covid-19 task force||As the number of Covid-19 cases in the state crossed the 10-lakh mark on Friday, experts are saying we will have to learn to live with this pandemic until the vaccine is out. HT spoke to Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid task force appointed for clinical management of patients to understand the way ahead. Dr Joshi admitted that the administration has failed to ramp up public health infrastructure adequately and contested the projection of herd immunity in Mumbai saying there was no proven pattern in the world. Excerpts:With unlocking measures rolled out by the government, the number of cases has gone up. Secondly, the spike is because of the high number of testing being carried out. In Mumbai, the number of daily tests has increased to 14,000 from 5,000. While cases are growing, the case fatality rate (CFR) is coming down. Our aim is to keep CFR below 1%. The vaccine is unlikely to be out before March 2021, and till then, we have to learn to live with the virus. No. In many places such as Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur, Kolhapur and Sangli, the infrastructure is not capable of taking up severely ill patients. We have had enough time during the lockdown for capacity building and ramping up healthcare infrastructure, but unfortunately, we have fallen short in many districts. We are short of intensive care unit and critical care beds at many places. After the unlocking, cases started rising and authorities were caught unawares. Besides, we need to have a hyper vigilant public health system which will ensure faster tracing of contacts. Failure on these fronts has led to local transmission, which could have been averted.We also need to have community participation to neutralise the stigma and fear. Our recommendations are save lives, diagnose early, treat fast. We also suggest that state machineries focus on supportive care with oxygen and ventilator availability. Number of cases may go up, but lives should be saved. This can also be achieved by community sensitisation with the help of a lot of information campaigns. Citizens should follow appropriate Covid-19 behaviour till the vaccine arrives. We have added two more points — sanitisation, and masking and social distancing — to the protocol and asked people to avoid crowded and poorly ventilated places and focus on no-touch policy. Elderly people and those with comorbidities should not venture out. I would not like to comment on it.I wish and pray we will eventually end up with herd immunity. But, we need to study to see whether the antibodies last that long. It is a new virus and it can spread some amount of immunity. Areas like Dharavi, Cheetah Camp, Govandi might already have some immunity. But, exposure to the virus with positive antibodies is not equal to antibodies needed for herd immunity. The concept has not yet been proven anywhere in the world, so currently it is speculative. The data published so far on the global level does not suggest antibodies to have lasted long.No, I think this is still the first wave. The number is high because of the rise in tests, and more tests are good as they help in containing the spread of the virus. As far as CFR is concerned, it is declining; there is no need to worry about that. It is going down in Mumbai and elsewhere in the state. We should have at least 1.5 lakh daily tests, with more rapid antigen tests rather than RT-PCR. The CFR should fall below 1% and the positivity rate should come down to 3-5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/herd-immunity-not-proven-learn-to-live-with-the-virus-dr-shashank-joshi-member-of-maharashtra-covid-19-task-force/story-H7ptiBOvBRE0zTT1X0DHWK.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||RTE admissions: BMC education department asks private schools in Mumbai to comply, grant admissions||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s education department has issued letters to some private schools in Mumbai after they failed to admit students under the 25% Right to Education (RTE) quota for the academic year 2020-21. The department recently sent out written orders asking such schools to comply with the admission guidelines under the RTE act and grant admissions to students before September 15, which is the last date to do so. “It has been found that despite several instructions and repeated reminders, these schools have not complied with the norms with respect to the RTE act. Complaints have been received against such schools from parents and local activists. We have thus asked them to grant admissions to eligible students at the earliest,” said an official from the BMC education department. Names of these schools were not divulged as they still have time to comply. But sources in the department said that nearly 3-4 schools were sent such letters. This year, the civic body is yet to complete admissions under the 25% quota in Mumbai. With the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown, schools have now been asked to grant provisional admissions to students whose names have appeared in the lotteries. Even with several relaxations, very few students have been able to confirm their admissions so far. This year, a total of 14,135 applications were made against 7,069 available seats under the quota in the city. Of these only 2,682 seats have been confirmed their admissions while 2,846 students have been provisionally admitted. Sudhir Paranjape, an activist from the Anudanit Shiksha Bachao Samiti, an NGO working for the disadvantaged sections said that with the entire admission process moving online, parents are having a tough time. “In addition to this, several parents who have applied for the admissions have got no allocation yet. Since so many seats lie vacant every year so we have demanded the government to allot nearby schools to these students. A letter has gone on behalf of over 2,000 parents in the city to the state government. We demand that at least in aided schools across the state, the RTE act be implemented entirely,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rte-admissions-bmc-education-department-asks-private-schools-in-mumbai-to-comply-grant-admissions/story-leFknkR85vcnObEedg99DM.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Decide on pleas of cooperative bank employees, seeking permission to travel by local, in 3 weeks: Bombay HC to Maharashtra government||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the Maharashtra government to take a decision on two representations of Cooperative Bank Employees Union, Mumbai, seeking permission for employees of cooperative banks in Mumbai and Thane to travel by suburban trains to reach their workplaces.The bench of justice KK Tated and justice NR Borkar directed the state government to decide on the representations of the union and communicate the decision to its members in three weeks.The union moved HC after its members were being stopped by police from boarding local trains. Advocate TJ Pandian, the counsel for the union, submitted that a vast majority of employees working in various cooperative banks in Mumbai reside at far off places. Before the lockdown, these employees used to travel to their respective workplaces on local trains. However, after the lockdown was imposed, they are not being allowed to travel by locals, despite the fact that employees in essential services are permitted to travel by trains. This is causing serious hardships to the bank employees in reporting to their places of work, Pandian said.He further submitted that the Union home ministry allowed employees of nationalised banks to travel by local trains, but the employees of cooperative banks are given discriminatory treatment.Additional government pleader Rupali Shinde said considering the present Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra, it is very difficult to allow the members of the union to travel by local trains.However, after the petitioner’s lawyer pointed out that their representations, dated June 15 and July 2, were not pending, HC issued the direction to the government to decide the representations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decide-on-pleas-of-cooperative-bank-employees-seeking-permission-to-travel-by-local-in-3-weeks-bombay-hc-to-maharashtra-government/story-xquNuavxWaNRcRVlx8uAOK.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||40-year-old stabs brother over property dispute in Mumbai, surrenders||A 40-year-old man stabbed his younger brother with a knife over a property dispute and later surrendered himself before Andheri police. The incident took place around 10am on Thursday when Andheri police received a call stating that a person was lying in a pool of blood. While a police team was sent to the spot at Telligalli in Andheri (East), the accused, Tanaji Dongre, walked into Andheri police station and confessed to the crime. The police team took Sandeep Dongre, 37, to Cooper Hospital. His condition is said to be stable. Sandeep’s wife Nikita has lodged a complaint against Dongre. Dongre told police that the dispute was over a room at Sai Wadi in Telligalli which belonged to their father. Sandeep was living with his wife in the house, where both the brothers had equal share. “Sandeep had told Tanaji (Dongre) that he would pay half the money of the total value of the house. But Sandeep used to ask for more time whenever Tanaji asked for money,” said a police officer. Dongre said he was in need of money and when Sandeep again gave excuses, he got angry and stabbed him. He has been booked under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/40-year-old-stabs-brother-over-property-dispute-in-mumbai-surrenders/story-rX6lHb6ZBv99eZiJJxE0mO.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses bail to quack booked for causing death by negligence||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has refused to grant any relief to a quack booked for negligently causing death of one of his patients. The accused, Padmanath Patil, allegedly practiced medicines claiming to be an Ayurveda graduate.Patil, 63, has been booked by Amalner police in Jalgaon for allegedly committing offences punishable under section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code and section 33 (practicing medicines without registration) of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961.The case was filed based on a complaint by Vidya Mahajan who alleged Patil had in January 2019 prescribed two allopathic medicines to her husband, Shaligram, although he claimed to have BAMS (Bachelor in Ayurvedic Medicines and Surgery) degree, and that her husband died due to adverse reaction to the medicine.Police booked Patil under section 33 of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961 after finding out that while he claimed to have finished his medical course before 1976, the certificate of registration did not mention the year.Patil had moved HC seeking quashing of the case primarily on the grounds that after the June 2014 amendment to the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961, even BAMS doctors can prescribe allopathic medicines, and therefore, he could not be prosecuted for prescribing allopathic medicines.The division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar, however, rejected the contention. The bench noted that the amendment requires BAMS degree holders to undergo training in allopathy before they are allowed to prescribe allopathic medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-quack-booked-for-causing-death-by-negligence/story-pcRD9bKreFWArkzRxjSPWN.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty, brother’s bail pleas rejected by special NDPS court in Mumbai||A special court constituted under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Friday rejected the bail applications of actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and four other accused arrested in the case actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The six are among nine people arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing allegations of drug abuse and distribution in the case. On Friday, the bail pleas of Chakraborty, Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Mira-nda, Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant, and Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar were moved. Public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said, “The bail pleas of all accused were rejected and we will share the detailed order once the order copy will come”. Chakaraborty and Showik’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde also confirmed the development. “Once we get a copy of the order, we will decide on the course of action about approaching the high court,” said Maneshinde In her plea, Chakraborty, who has been booked under section 27A (financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the NDPS ACT, said she was innocent and had been falsely implicated. “The allegations against the present accused would, at the most, make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug, which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender,” read Chakraborty’s plea. Showik has also been booked under section 27A of the NDPS Act. The defence also alleged that NCB had invoked section 27A against Chakraborty and Showik despite their alleged role in Rajput’s death being identical to that of another accused Kaizan Ebrahim. However, Ebrahim was released on provisional bail within a day of his remand by the magistrate court. On Thursday, the prosecution opposed pleas and stated all the accused are connected and they cannot be investigated in isolation. NCB also said that the quantity of the total contraband seized from all the accused becomes a commercial quantity and as a result, the offence is non-bailable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-rhea-chakraborty-brother-s-bail-pleas-rejected-by-special-ndps-court-in-mumbai/story-XaMiMk9XIEZdZl5y8kO0qN.html

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Aarey Colony areas adjacent to Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park to be reserve forest: Maharashtra government||Following a survey of Aarey Milk Colony on Friday by various state bodies and state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, more than 600 acres at the green lung adjacent to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) may be declared a reserve forest. The final declaration is expected by September 20. On September 3, Thackeray had announced 600 acres (one-fifth of Aarey’s 3,122 acres) near SGNP would be declared reserve forest area under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. On Friday, a state panel led by Thackeray, principal secretaries of forest and environment departments, Aarey administration, SGNP officials, and Dindoshi legislator Sunil Prabhu undertook a three-hour survey of areas in Aarey to be brought under protection. Thackeray said, “Friday’s survey was to see the place with our own eyes rather than just declaring it on paper. We wanted to see how much more area can be protected.” A state official said an additional 50-75 acres may be added to the proposed 600 acres. Milind Mhaiksar, principal secretary (forest), said they found areas devoid of construction within the proposed 600 acres. “We are going for the protection of this area in our first phase. Leopard movement is pretty much everywhere in and around Aarey, but our immediate focus is to provide protection for areas contiguous to SGNP where big cats have been spotted,” he said. Areas that will fall outside the protected zone include Film City, Royal Palms, and similar pockets where infrastructure projects have been proposed. Conservator of forest, SGNP, G Malikarjuna, who was present during Friday’s survey, said, “It was decided on Friday and we will see to it that major hillocks and green zones where leopard movement has been captured by us through camera traps, contiguous to SGNP will be included in this proposal,” he said. “As per the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, once this area is declared as reserve forest, there will be bar on accruing of any new rights, and any violations (tree felling, habitat destruction etc.) will be booked as an offence under various sections of the Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aarey-areas-adjacent-to-mumbai-s-sanjay-gandhi-national-park-to-be-reserve-forest-maharashtra-government/story-5pb4FtIwRamqryiA7Xu4eP.html

Video lectures by faculty from various IITs are now being telecasted through educational channels on TV.The video content has been prepared by all major IITs in the country to help engineering students who are unable to attend classes due to the Covid-19 lockdown.“Lectures are recorded at home by faculty members from many central universities. They are then telecasted through the Swayam Prabha channels,” said K Mangala Sunder, head of the department of chemistry at IIT-Madras, and chief coordinator, DTH Swayam Prabha.Swayam Prabha is a group of 34 direct to home channels launched by the ministry of education for telecasting educational programmes all through the day. The lectures from IITs on engineering courses will be telecast on channels 11 through 18. The first such lecture was broadcast on August 28.Classes for the online semester at IIT-Bombay (IIT-B) kicked off on August 10 and lectures delivered by faculty members were recorded. The institute has prepared videos for 30 courses for this semester and they will be telecast depending on slots available on the channels. “We are enthusiastic about this project and have completed recordings. We are now handing them over to Swayam Prabha,” said Kannan Moudgalya, professor, department of chemical engineering, and coordinator for the Swayam Prabha project at IIT-B.According to Sunder, the focus was to create crash courses with an emphasis on problem-solving approaches. The regular 40-50-hour lectures of an entire course were condensed to 10-15 hrs for fast assimilation by students during the lockdown. They were created to meet or exceed the academic standards set by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and other academic bodies such as the All India Council of Technical Education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/video-lectures-by-iit-faculty-now-available-for-all-engineering-students-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-ThxHV9TfByC26HiwYDEpNN.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 count crosses 1 million, only state in the world to cross the grim milestone||Maharashtra reported its first Covid-19 cases on March 9 and 187 days later on Friday, the state became the first in India to cross a million infections. With a record 24-hour spike of 24,886 cases, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 count rose to 1,015,681, making it the only state, province, or region in the world to cross the grim milestone. If Maharashtra were a country, it would be fifth on the list of nations with most cases. The number of active cases in state has now risen to 271,566, which accounts for 26.73% of the total infections, and the toll stands at 28,724 with an addition of 393 deaths on Friday.The state has also crossed the 200,000 cases-mark in just 11 days of September, with 223,068 infections being reported this month, at an average of 20,278 cases a day. Maharashtra has struggled to the control the spread of cases and curb fatalities even though it was the first in India to impose a complete lockdown, a day before the country-wide restrictions came into force in March. The state has formed multiple taskforces — comprising health experts and senior bureaucrats; capped testing prices to encourage people to get tested; acquired 80% beds at private hospitals for Covid-19 patients; and provided free insurance for treatment of all the citizens; among other things, but the numbers have still remained hiNO PEAK YETState officials expect the number of daily infections to increase further across the state as the government has announced fresh relaxations and with more people likely to step out of their homes during the upcoming festival season, the spread of infection may get worse.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said the cases are unlikely to come down in the near future. “With fresh relaxations and increased activities, a significant number of people have been exposed to the virus and that has resulted in a surge in cases. They will continue to get exposed and rise in cases will continue until the vulnerable section of the society is covered. Also, coronavirus has spread in most of the rural areas,” Salunkhe said. “It means the surge in cases will stay for over a month. It also means that the tally of infections will go up to 30,000 a day.”Salunkhe, who is also a public health expert, holds citizens responsible for making the situation worse. “A major reason for the increase in cases is irresponsible behaviour by people. Everyone is now aware what coronavirus is, but they just don’t care to take precautions. They don’t understand that the government has its own limitations. It has been more than six months and the entire health infrastructure and staff is completely exhausted. Until and unless people won’t come forward and take the pandemic seriously, the situation may not improve,” he said.From June 3, the state had started giving graded relaxations in lockdown. It is yet to allow local trains and Metro to begin ops for general public, educational institutions, restaurants (except for takeaway), theatres and places of worship to open. In containment zones, only movement for medical emergencies, supply of goods and essential goods shops are allowed.State officials said that they had no options but to relax restrictions as people cannot be kept under lockdown forever. “People had already started facing hardships owing to financial losses. Businesses were badly hit and the state’s economy also plunged to its lowest level. Survival in that situation had become impossible for everyone and thus the option of graded relaxation was adopted,” said a senior bureaucrat.SPREAD IN RURAL AREAS The rise in infections is a result of the state getting new hotspots, with a significant number of cases being reported in rural areas.Health officials admit that the state is still finding it difficult to beef up health infrastructure in the rural areas. “Whatever infrastructure we have in rural areas is not sufficient. We don’t even have an adequate number of health staff, including doctors, to fight the battle and efforts are on to improve the situation,” said a health department official.The current major hotspot districts in the state are Pune, Jalgaon, Satara, Raigad, Sangli, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar and Nagpur where fresh cases recorded were 1,555, 1,137, 893, 733, 603, 585, 550, 498 and 497 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-count-crosses-1-million-only-state-in-the-world-to-cross-the-grim-milestone/story-xXciOAEPaGZgUGUMUVs0aJ.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra at 1 million Covid-19 cases||A little over six months since the day it detected its first case, Maharashtra on Friday became the first and only state or province in the world to report more than a million cases of Covid-19. The state also set a new record for daily cases, with 24,886 new infections taking the state’s tally to 1,015,681.Brazil’s Sao Paulo province (874,754 cases) has the second highest infections of any state or province in the world.If it were a nation, Maharashtra would be on the fifth spot in the world in terms of total cases — just below Russia, which had 1,051,874 cases as of Friday night.Maharashtra has also seen the highest number of deaths in the country – 28,724 – and features among the states with the worst case fatality rates (CFR).India, meanwhile, reported 97,661 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections in the country to 4,657,371, and 1,203 new deaths pushed the total fatalities to 77,506.This means that one in every five cases diagnosed across the country has come from Maharashtra, and one in every three deaths can be traced to the state, a statistic that shows how disproportionately the state has been hit by the pandemic.Maharashtra has consistently been among the worst-hit Indian states through the six months of the disease’s run and has on its hands a fierce struggle to control the spread of the virus that has shown little sign of relenting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-at-1-million-covid-19-cases/story-LQT7N9KMN9o6zlMoyyX14N.html

12-09-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Special NIA court erred in allowing 90-day extension of custody: Teltumbde to Bombay HC||Dr Anand Teltumbde, one of the accused in the Elgar Parishad case who is currently lodged at Taloja jail, filed an application before the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday seeking setting aside of the July 12 order of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court which allowed an extension of his detention by another 90 days.The application challenges the NIA court order on the grounds that the extension granted was not as per the norms laid down under section 43(D) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and hence, the extension should be set aside and the special court should be ordered to grant bail to Dr Teltumbde. As the bench that was to hear the application on Friday recused, the application is expected to be heard next week.According to the application filed by advocate R Satyanarayanan, after Dr Teltumbde had surrendered on April 14, as per a Supreme Court (SC) direction, he had been arrested and detained at Taloja jail. On July 12, Teltumbde completed 90 days in custody but as the investigation had not been completed, the state had applied for an extension of his custody before the NIA court.The state had also sought extension of custody of co-accused Gautam Navlakha in the application. In its application, the state had averred that as the draft of the charge sheet was voluminous due to the Covid pandemic, it had not been able to file it before the appropriate court. The state application further said that interrogation of witnesses and perusal of forensic evidence was also pending due to the lockdown. Hence it needed an extension of Dr Teltumbde and Navlakha’s custody, based on section 43(D) of the UAPA Act. Section 43(D) of the UAPA Act states that extension of custody for 90 days can be sought on the grounds of progress in the investigation and compelling reasons showing a need for extension of custody.Dr Teltumbde’s application states that the special NIA court did not heed the information provided by the state in its application, which said that “sufficient evidence has been being collected”. Nor did the court abide by an SC order which states that a person cannot be detained beyond 90 days if investigators are unable to complete the investigation and file a charge sheet within the stipulated period.Dr Teltumbde’s application further states that as his custody would not contribute towards the recording of statements of witnesses or receiving forensic reports, the special court should not have granted extension of 90 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-special-nia-court-erred-in-allowing-90-day-extension-of-custody-teltumbde-to-bombay-hc/story-JaclRTHHtP9iUc5jeg10GM.html

He launched the nationwide ‘Rozgar Do’ campaign to highlight the issue of rising unemployment under the BJP regime and to demand that the government create job opportunities for them. Talking to reporters, Allavaru said the Modi government’s decision to demonetise the currency, ‘faulty’ implementation of GST and inept handling of the coronavirus crisis and the lockdown had destroyed the country’s economic structure. “The PM had promised the youth that he will give jobs to two crore youngsters every year. He sold a dream but the reality is that 14 crore people have become unemployed due to Modi’s policies,” he said, adding that India no longer had the capacity to provide employment to its youth. Allavaru also criticised the J&K government for abolishing the self-help group scheme, which has directly affected approximately 16,000 local unemployed engineers. He slammed the government for abolishing the results of the J&K Bank probationary officer (PO) recruitment and not filling the 50,000 vacancies announced by the then J&K governor on fast track basis among other issues. J&K Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the country was witnessing an all-time low economic growth and employment rate. He said that all sections of society in J&K were facing difficulties but the youth were the worst hit due to unemployment and anti-youth policies of the present dispensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indian-youth-congress-launches-rozgar-do-campaign-in-j-k/story-XC7c5btMCcwnFooDhn9OON.html

The Shimlapuri police had registered a murder case in this regard.In August, an OCCU team had nabbed Kancha’s accomplice Karanvir, alias Mani, in Muktsar. On a specific tip-off, the OCCU team was now able to arrest Kancha, the IGP added.He was produced before a Mohali court and sent to three-day police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wanted-in-murder-case-notorious-gangster-kancha-nabbed-by-occu/story-pVfbqmJjmWNe2Iz2syUldJ.html
12-09-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Custody of 3 Kabir Kala Manch members extended till September 19||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) special court on Friday extended NIA custody of three members of Kabir Kala Manch – Jyoti Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor – till September 19.Gorkhe and Gaichor were arrested by NIA on Monday, while Jagtap was arrested on Tuesday, for their alleged role in the Elgar Parishad case.As their custody ended on Friday, special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty sought for extension of their custody. Shetty contended that they got very less time to interrogate them.The prosecution argued that the case involves a deep-rooted conspiracy whereby the accused need to be confronted with the data recovered.NIA has so far alleged that the three accused, Jagtap, Gorkhe and Gaichor, “were propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology”, and were co-conspirators with others arrested. “It has also come on record that they were in contact with Milind Teltumbde, who is absconding, about the urban network of CPI (Maoist). It is established that during their visits [of Kabir Kala Manch members] in the jungle, they underwent weapon and explosive training, and awareness programmes on various topics related to the Maoist movement,” the agency had claimed in the statement released following their arrest.“It is also established that as per the evidence on record, in June 2018, Teltumbde discussed the Elgar Parishad programme which was organised at Pune, the subsequent in-roads made by the CPI (Maoist) in the organisation, and execution through the members of Kabir Kala Manch and other frontal organisations,” the NIA statement added.The three accused were named in the original first information report (FIR) registered by Pune Police against the organisers of the event held at Shaniwarwada on December 31, 2017. According to the FIR registered at Vishraumbaug police station, on January 8, members of Kabir Kala Manch had allegedly made provocative speeches, sang songs and performed skits that led to violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018.The initial investigation was conducted by Pune Police and two charge sheets were filed in the case. The probe was transferred to NIA earlier this year. The agency has so far arrested Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha and Hanybabu Musaliyavittil Tarayil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-custody-of-3-kabir-kala-manch-members-extended-till-september-19/story-1soUfID02AQXGpl4xBen3K.html

12-09-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram case fatality rate now stands at less than 1%||Despite a steady increase in Covid-19 cases over the past three weeks, the district’s mortality rate on Friday dipped below 1% for the first time in at least three months. With 143 deaths (against a total tally of 14,584 reported infections), Gurugram’s mortality rate on Friday stood at 0.98%.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gururgam, said, “It is only natural that the more we test, the more the mortality rate will fall. In any case, the case fatality rate is not an accurate yardstick of Covid-19’s deadliness, it is a function of testing. Even so, it is a positive development that less than 1% of the cases have turned out to be fatal. The credit goes to our rapid response teams that are monitoring the health of patients in home isolation, with the help of pulse oximeters to detect worsening symptoms. Pulse oximeters can detect the oxygen saturation level in blood. Further, five months into the pandemic, treatment protocols have also improved and have helped to reduce mortality.” With tests set to touch as many as 5,000 samples per day in the coming weeks, the mortality rate may dip even further, said Yadav.Experts too agreed with the opinion of the chief medical officer. “We already know that Covid-19 seems to be less deadly in India than elsewhere, for reasons that are still being investigated. But with an increase in testing, both mortality rate and recovery rate are affected. While a mortality rate of under 1% is reassuring, it only tells us about the extent of testing. The real measure of Covid-19’s mortality will come from looking at Gurgaon’s infection fatality rate, for which seroprevalence data can be used,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine, PGIMER. Of the 143 Covid deaths noted in Gurugram so far, 83 were among those aged 60 and above. However, only 1,422 reported cases belong in this age bracket. Another 42 deaths were reported in the 40-60 age bracket (as against 3,816 reported infections in the same age group). The largest number of reported infections were in the 20-40 age group (7,779), but there were only 18 deaths among this age group. Meanwhile, no deaths were reported out of 1,568 Covid-19 patients, who were between 0-20 years old, health department data shows.Meanwhile, with 289 new cases confirmed on Friday, the total number of active cases reached 2,040. The total number of active cases had last crossed 2,000 in the first week of June. Thereafter till mid-July, it fluctuated between 1,500 to 1,000 at a daily growth rate of 2.6% to 1.7%. Presently, the total count of infected persons stands at 14,4584. Out of 2,040 active cases, 1,820 are in home isolation, 21 in Covid Care Centres and 199 in various hospitals of the city. Till now, 143 have succumbed to the illness, with three deaths being reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-case-fatality-rate-now-stands-at-less-than-1/story-rOXLNPAgnY33dHa0JRZ6WP.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC ropes in experts from engineering college to test soil of Jainpur sports park site||The municipal corporation (MC) has roped in experts from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) for soil testing of the Jainpur site, where a sports park is being established on an area of 32 acre under Smart City Project. The proposal to shift legacy waste from the site has been scrapped.A meeting regarding the same was held at the MC’s Zone D office on Thursday wherein mayor Balkar Sandhu, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and councillor Mamta Ashu discussed the project with the experts.Sandhu said cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is regularly monitoring the project as there is a need to improve the sports infrastructure in the city. They decided that there is no need to shift legacy waste from the site as most of it has turned into soil over the years. The experts from GNDEC have been asked to commence soil testing so that the project can be started at the earliest. “Apart from a cricket ground, infrastructure will also be developed for hockey, lawn tennis and basketball among other games at a cost of around ₹52 crore,” Sandhu said.Earlier, the consultant company of Smart City Mission had tabled a proposal to shift the legacy waste from the site at a cost of around ₹20 crore. But, the proposal was dumped by Ashu and the mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-ropes-in-experts-from-engineering-college-to-test-soil-of-jainpur-sports-park-site/story-VtY1Ze8cIghieqG9XnF43O.html

On Thursday, the district had administered a record high of over 3,188 tests. The district health officials stated that they would be doing 5,000 Covid-19 tests in the coming weeks. On Friday, at least 2,601 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) were administered by government labs, while 937 tests were conducted private labs. Notably, the government lab collected at least 1,634 samples for RT-PCR, highest in a single day. Health officials said that the target is to conduct 60% RT-PCR and 40% RAT. With 289 new cases confirmed on Friday, the total number of active cases also reached 2,040. The total number of active cases had last crossed 2,000 in the first week of June. Thereafter till mid-July, it fluctuated between 1,500 to 1,000 at a daily growth rate of 2.6% to 1.7%. Presently, the total count of infected persons stands at 14,4584. Out of 2,040 active cases, 1,820 are in home isolation, 21 in Covid Care Centres and 199 in various hospitals of the city. Till now, 143 have succumbed to the illness, with three deaths being reported on Friday. At least 100 have died due to co-morbidities and 43 without co-morbidities. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Even though the overall number of active cases has been increasing, people are getting cured of the illness. The fatality rate has already come down to 0.97%, while the recovery rate is 85.37%. The health department is working on a plan to conduct 5,000 tests every day. Testing has to be increased to identify patients in the initial weeks of contracting the virus. Still, citizens should take care of the basic health hygiene to prevent infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-daily-tests-cross-3-500-mark-active-cases-cross-2-000/story-DmB9byxlf3GqxhuyhypXkL.html
12-09-2020||Gurugram||First ecorestoration project under Gurujal initiative complete, work ongoing to revive 15 ponds this year||Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on Friday inaugurated a pond site in Pataudi’s Mojabad village, marking it the district administration’s first completed eco-restoration project under its Gurujal initiative.The one-acre water body, officials said, has already begun to replenish the region’s groundwater reserves, which depleted by at least 1.5 metres between 2019 and 2020, as per data from the district agriculture department. “The pond will recharge groundwater every month by up to 3000 kilo litres a day (KLD). It has a depth of 15 feet. It’s mostly empty now, but that is because we have desilted the bed and water is percolating at the site much faster than we anticipated. It will take at least a year for a permanent water body to form,” said Yasin Khan, a civil engineer working with Gurujal, which is tasked with implementing the Centre’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan in Gurugram. . Situated about 40kms from Gurugram, and located on the outskirts of the village, the site is the lowest lying area of Mojabad village. “We have some 250 odd homes and 1600 people. Waste water from the homes used to accumulate here (at the pond site). It had become one large, open sewer though everyone in the village remembers that there was a pond here once,” said Keshu Ram, sarpanch, Mojabad.Fixing the issue started with draining the sewage, de-silting it and finally levelling the bed to better retain incoming water. “We constructed a 100 KLD sewage treatment plant (STP, to treat local sewage) which is dispensing recycled water here daily. Just adjacent to the pond is a temple area which we have developed for use as public space,” said Anjali Singh, associate community mobiliser, Gurujal.Seeing as Mojabad also suffers from erratic power supply, which would hinder the functioning of a standard electromechanic sewage treatment plant, officials opted for a ‘bio-STP’, which relies on phytoremediation and gravity to treat wastewater. “There are no chemicals or pumps involved. The sewers bring all the water to this low lying area, and it is treated by filtering through the root systems of plants before percolating down under the influence of gravity,” Khan explained, adding that this technology would also be deployed in at least two other villages where pond revival projects are in the works, including Palasoli and Dhaula villages in the district.In all, under the Gurujal initiative, a total of 72 water bodies identified across Gurugram are slated to be restored in a similar manner. “Work is presently underway at 15 other sites, including Kasan, Khentawas, Dhaula, Wazirpur, Navada and Dharampur villages. Mojabad is the smallest of these projects, while Kasan is the largest, in terms of scale. Most other ponds will be revived using traditional STPs with larger capacities, of about 250KLD,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, programme manager, Gurujal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/first-ecorestoration-project-under-gurujal-initiative-complete-work-ongoing-to-revive-15-ponds-this-year/story-d3bFF4EZGX5vRh8rSc8aiP.html
12-09-2020||Gurugram||Private labs prefer RT-PCR over antigen and antibody tests||Private labs in the city are conducting fewer IgM (antigen) and IgG ( antibody) tests as compared to government facilities. In the last one week, seven private labs together administered only 537 Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), as compared to government labs, which carried out 6,353 such tests. According to representatives of private diagnostic labs, such tests are not conducted unless the patient specifically asks for it. According to the district health bulletin issued on Friday, private labs conducted only 8% (75 antigen tests) of the total antigen tests conducted, while government labs conducted 33% (or 967) of the 2,601 antigen detection tests. “Patients visiting our lab are usually counselled by doctors first. As such, RT-PCR tests are generally prescribed by doctors as they are considered to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing. Since RAT is not reliable, we prefer not to administer it,” said Dr Santosh Kumar, microbiologist, MolQ laboratory. “We don’t see the point in doing two tests — first RAT and then RT-PCR. Also, people coming to a private lab have the capacity to pay for the RT-PCR test, which now costs ₹1,600.” he said.According to Kumar, the lab has hardly been conducting any antigen tests, while antibody tests are not being conducted as people are not asking for it. “Antibody tests do not help in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Antibodies can only be developed in the body two weeks after the infection. Therefore, it is not preferred,” said Kumar. The RAT detects proteins attached to SARS-CoV2 virus by testing the sample collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. It delivers result within 30 minutes. Antibody tests, on the other hand, is used to detect previous Covid-19 infection by taking blood samples. It looks for antibodies, which are developed in two weeks after the infection.Modern Diagnostic and Research Centre too confirmed that they are not administering the RAT. “If RAT results are negative then deciding whether to go for RT-PCR is challenging. For this, the treating physician has to take the decision. The lab cannot conduct the physical examination and take its own decision. Therefore, we are not conducting the RAT,” said Dr Rishabh Singh Rajput, microbiologist of the Modern Lab. “A sense of confusion can prevail if the person is both symptomatic and negative. Following up in such a case can be quite a task, especially if the person comes without a prescription.”Rajput said that their lab has been doing a limited number of antibody tests, only if a hospital approaches them. The state government has fixed the cost of antibody test at ₹250, lower than antigen test ( at ₹650) and RT-PCR ( at ₹1,600) for private labs. “It has come into our notice that private labs are conducting antigen or antibody tests only if there is any urgent case. Costs for the two tests can be an issue, while arranging for RAT kits also might not be easy,” said a district health official, who preferred anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-labs-prefer-rt-pcr-over-antigen-and-antibody-tests/story-X2GeNR4XS66rJXxCxZjdFI.html
12-09-2020||Chandigarh||School on Ludhiana agri varsity campus gets boundary walls after 40 years||: After 40 years, a railing-cum-boundary wall has been constructed at the government primary school on the Punjab Agricultural University campus. School head Amanpreet Kaur, said, “Boundary wall is must in every school. When we received funds for major repairs last month, I decided to first get a railing-cum- gate constructed, keeping in mind the safety of the students. Earlier, the school campus was an open ground, accessible to anybody.” With limited funds of Rs 65,000, the school head also contributed some amount, and got it constructed near the classrooms which will also cover the play area. A gate has also been constructed.The school is spread over an area of 500 yards and with these funds it was not possible to cover the entire area, so only the areas around the classrooms and office have been covered. For the last 10 years, the school authorities have been writing to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) office and the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) for a three-sided boundary wall, but to no avail. The school has a strength of 317 students studying in pre-primary to Class 5 and the enrolment has increased from last year’s 216 students.“Once the school reopens, we will require more classrooms to accommodate students,” Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-on-ludhiana-agri-varsity-campus-gets-boundary-walls-after-40-years/story-F3Xgt0gJAz3pPNw2buBrZP.html

Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said the number of deaths coming down to 11 on Thursday and 12 on Friday was a slight respite. “Hospitals are reporting that there is more awareness among people, and even those with the slightest symptoms were coming forward to get themselves tested. This is a good sign,” he said.SIX LIT STAFFERS FOUND INFECTEDAs many as six employees of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) were among the fresh cases on Friday. These include an SDO, a driver and four clerical and Class-four staffers. Estate officer Kuljeet Kaur said, “The tests were done as a precautionary measure on Tuesday and six employees tested positive. The office building has been sanitised.”THREE TEST POSITIVE AT FREE CAMP Three people were also found positive after samples were collected during a free testing camp organised by Bhai Ghanayia Ji Mission Seva Society on the invitation of the district administration in Kartar Nagar, Model Town, on Friday. The camp was organised in association with the Red Cross Society. Additional deputy commissioner (general) Amarjit Singh Bains inaugurated the camp.PPCB PULLS UP DMCH AGAINFinding anomalies in the disposal of bio-medical waste, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has directed DMCH authorities to hire a firm to properly dispose of Covid-19 related waste and also conduct a third-party audit regarding disposal of waste. The board will conduct an inspection after the audit. PPCB had earlier issued a notice to the hospital and a hearing of the case was held before chairman Satwinder Singh Marwaha on Friday. Officials said general waste was being mixed with Covid-19 waste by the hospital. PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said the hospital authorities had been told to segregate the waste properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-patient-tally-crosses-13-000-mark/story-Brkj8JcOeIS2THSVMhlLdP.html

However, with the increased tests, the case positivity rate fell from the previous day — from 7.38% on Thursday to 7.04% on Friday. This is a decline from 9.55% recorded on September 1. The seven-day average positivity rate in Delhi stands at 7.92%, a decline from 8.98% the week before. However, samples tested using the more reliable RT-PCR tests fell for the second straight day, with just 8,305, or 13.7%, tested using the gold standard diagnosis on Friday, as against 9,004 the previous day.Also read: Covid-19 respite for Mumbai unlikely till New Year says BMC, it has a logicThe number of hospitalisations on Friday due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi breached the 6,000-mark. The number of hospitalisations on Friday stood at 6,031, or 22.4% of total active cases. The last time it breached the 6,000-mark was on June 23 when 6,264 people were hospitalised in a single day. Additionally, in order to scale up testing further, the Delhi government has directed its mohalla clinics to start conducting tests from Friday after daily consultations are over at 2pm. The clinics will function as testing centres between 2pm and 5pm every day in addition to the 300 dispensaries and Delhi government hospitals that already conduct tests. HT was first to report on September 2 that the government plans to conduct tests at mohalla clinics to scale up testing to the 40,000 a day target. “In order to augment Covid testing drive, it has been decided to initiate Covid testing at all AAMC (aam aadmi mohalla clinics) from 2 pm to 5 pm on all working days with immediate effect. All CDMOs cum mission directors are requested to ensure AAMC empanelled staff is trained for testing procedure, including training for doffing/ donning,” read the communication by Dr Shelley Kamra, state nodal officer, Mohalla Clinic cell. There are 450 mohalla clinics in the city. Unlike government hospitals and dispensaries, where the staff are either government employees or hired as ad-hoc, mohalla clinics are run by private empanelled doctors and staff paid on a per patient basis. Also read: 6.4 million Covid-19 cases were estimated in India by early May, says first national serosurvey reportSimilar incentives will be given to the staff running the testing centres. According to the communication by Dr Kamra, a copy of which is with the HT, a doctor will be paid ₹30 per person tested and entered in the ICMR portal. An assistant will be paid ₹30, a pharmacists ₹15, a multi-task worker ₹15, and a data-entry operator will be paid ₹10 per patient. The CDMOs will be responsible for ensuring availability of PPE kits, support for disposal of bio-medical waste, and thorough sanitisation of each centre after testing to prevent the infection from spreading next day during consultations. “When there is an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, there could be two scenarios. One, we are detecting more cases because we are simply testing more and two, because the positivity rate is on the increase. Whatever be the scenario, we are getting more and more cases and the resources to treat them remain finite and that is a cause of concern. The government has been saying that we have enough beds, but I have heard of people who struggled to get one. The only encouraging thing is that the positivity rate is slowly going down, meaning we are likely to see fewer cases in the future,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/testing-crosses-60k-in-delhi-but-dip-in-rt-pcr-method/story-9RIZ9Ya982xsVmXV5okG2K.html

She survived the suicide attempt but has sustained serious injures, police said. The couple had been married for just about a fortnight.Her husband, Subham Khandelwal, a contractor in Ujjain district about 50 km away, had died by suicide on Wednesday, leaving behind a note that blamed two engineers of the local municipal corporation for his death.Sania Khandelwal, who is in her early 20’s and studying medicine at a private college in Ujjain, is hospitalised in Indore’s MY hospital. She has suffered injuries in her head and legs and is under observation of doctors in an intensive care unit (ICU), police said.Sania had come to Indore with her father who had came to take her home to Haryana’s Faridabad after hearing about his son-in-law’s death. She was to accompany her father to Faridabad on the outskirts of national capital Delhi. They were staying in a hotel in Indore’s Sarvate bus stand area and were scheduled to catch a flight on Friday afternoon.Early on Friday, Sania stepped out of the hotel, telling her father that she was going to get herself some fruit juice. But she reached the shopping mall in Vijay Nagar about 5-6 km away and jumped off the third floor, a police office said.She was rushed to a nearby hospital by some mall employees from where she was referred to MY hospital. Police said they found a note in which she said she wanted to be with her husband.“Prima facie, it is a case of attempt to suicide. The woman has been hospitalised. We are looking into the matter,” Indore city superintendent of police, Rakesh Gupta said.Sania’s attempted suicide in Indore on Friday morning put the spotlight on the circumstances that led to her husband’s death.Within hours, the Ujjain Police registered a case against two junior engineers of Ujjain Nagar Nigam - Naresh Jain and Sanjay Khujeni and another person named Chinnu - for abetment to suicide, said police.Subham Khandelwal had been found injured in his car that had met with an accident near Nalwa locality in Ujjain on Wednesday night. He died. Police initially treated his death as a case of suicide but later found a note in which he had said that he was committing suicide due to harassment by the three persons. Police said he had consumed some poisonous substance.Police said they were still investigating the 32-year-old contractor’s death.Rupesh Dwivedi, the additional superintendent of police, Ujjain, said Shubham Khandelwal “prima facie had committed suicide”.“A suicide note was found from his possession which is being examined. Some other evidence has been collected from the spot. An FIR has been lodged against two junior engineers of Ujjain Nagar Nigam - Naresh Jain and Sanjay Khujneri and one Chinnu under sections 306 and 34 of Indian Penal Code,” Dwivedi said, adding that no arrests had been made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/newly-wed-medic-jumps-off-shopping-mall-in-indore-2-days-after-husband-s-suicide/story-7cDg8WWrVMBrQ7RV7pqhJO.html

To ensure compliance of its order, the top court stopped any other court from passing a stay order on their demolition. In his petition, Maken termed the order “inhuman” and demanded that no slum resident should be evicted without being given alternative housing under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015. The policy categorically provides for the rehabilitation of JJ clusters before their demolition.HT was the first to report the Supreme Court order story on September 3.Maken’s lawyers have also moved an urgent request for listing the plea as the Railways had issued demolition notices against the 48,000 shanties and fixed the demolition drive for Friday (September 11) and Monday (September 14). A three-judge bench of the apex court headed by justice Arun Mishra (since retired) had passed the August 31 order in the MC Mehta case relating to Delhi pollution matters. Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde will have to constitute a bench to hear Maken’s application.Quoting a 1986 judgement of the Supreme Court, Maken, in his petition, said the SC order is violative of the principles of natural justice by which the affected slum dwellers were required to be heard either individually or represented by a group or organisation. In the Olga Tellis versus Bombay Municipal Corporation (1986), the apex court had held that there can be no justification for denying an opportunity of hearing to slum dwellers living on pavements or public properties.According to Maken’s petition, the order barring any court to grant stay amounted to “grave obstruction in the Right to Access to Justice”.Since the Railways and the Delhi government were heard by the top court before passing the order, Maken attacked both the Centre and Delhi administrations for keeping the court in the dark about the protocol for evicting slum dwellers approved by the Delhi High Court on March 18, 2019 on a petition filed by Maken. This protocol was prepared by the municipal corporations, Delhi government’s DUSIB (Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board), Railways and Ministry of Urban Development.The protocol provided that “all Jhuggi-Jhopri bastis in Delhi that came into existence prior to January 1, 2006 and jhuggis which came into existence in such bastis before January 1, 2015 shall not be demolished without providing alternative housing.” According to Maken, the 48,000 slum clusters sought to be demolished have been in existence for past 30-40 years and are home to over 2.4 lakh persons.On Friday, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the Delhi government has written to the Northern Railways that without rehabilitation any demolition will be unconstitutional and illegal. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had called a meeting with officials of the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi urban shelter improvement board (DUSIB) on Thursday to discuss the court order and explore ways possible ways to rehabilitate the displaced people. DUSIB had suggested rehabilitating the displaced families in its vacant flats for economically weaker sections. Maken, in his petition, said the railways had not challenged the high court decision but “has now circumvented the HC judgment by directly approaching this Supreme Court without mentioning the law laid down in that case”. Officials from the Railways ministry and Northern Railways refused to comment on the issue.The Master Plan for Delhi 2021 also provides for in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellers wherever possible and relocation of slum dwellers in other cases. The Rajiv Awas Yojna, renamed as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, also aims towards slum free India by 2022 and the scheme also provides for either in-situ rehabilitation or relocation in exceptional cases, Maken’s application said. These facts were not brought to the notice of the court before it passed the August 31 order, the Congress leader said in the petition.Maken requested the authorities concerned (Ministry of Railways, Delhi government, and DUSIB) to follow the Delhi Slum & JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015 and the protocol laid down by the Delhi High Court before evicting the slum dwellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maken-challenges-sc-s-slum-demolition-order-demands-rehabilitation-before-eviction/story-T0GAYg3B8FwhUJ8RvPXbaK.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Relocate, then demolish: Delhi govt’s slum board to railways||The Delhi government has written to the Northern Railway, urging it to not demolish slums situated along the city’s railway tracks without first rehabilitating its dwellers.The letter, from the government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), said the slum dwelling units, which the rail utility is set to demolish in pursuance of a Supreme Court order, are protected under the provisions of the NCT of Delhi Laws (special provision) Second Act, 2011. “It is clarified that as per provisions of ...of the NCT of Delhi Laws (special provision) Second Act, 2011,... JJ (jhuggi jhopri) bastis which have come up before 01.01.2006 are protected and shall not be removed without orderly arrangement for relocation and rehabilitation of JJ dwellers and the jhuggi jhopri clusters in the NCT of Delhi in accordance with the provisions of the DUSIB Act, 2010,” read the letter.“Accordingly, you are requested not to demolish the jhuggis situated on railway land without providing alternative accommodation as per provisions of the Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015,” it further said.The contents of the letter dated September 10, a copy of which was seen by HT, was approved by DUSIB vice-chairperson and urban development minister Satyendar Jain. DUSIB also mentioned that the slum dwellers are eligible for alternative housing under the Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015. The letter cited these rules while referring to the eviction notices sent by the Northern Railway to slum dwellers over the past few days. The action by the Northern Railway came after the Supreme Court, on August 31, ordered the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings situated along railway tracks within three months. To ensure compliance with its order, the top court also stopped all other courts from issuing a stay order on their removal. In its letter, the Delhi government also attached a list of 45,857 flats constructed by DUSIB under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), which it has now offered for rehabilitation of slum dwellers, though at a cost. It stated that the Railways, which is the land owning agency in this matter, will have to pay the cost of construction of alternative dwelling units; the cost of land, as per the institutional rate at which DUSIB purchased the land; and the cost of relocation. According to the Delhi Slum Rehabilitation Policy, the relocation charges range from ₹7.55 lakh to ₹11.30 lakh per flat, depending on the location of the flat.Of the 45,857 flats, 29,257 are “ready to move in” units located in areas such as Sultanpuri, Savda Ghevra, Bhalswa, Bawana and Narela. The remaining 16,600 flats are located in Tikri and Pooth Khurd, the government said, and these will be ready by December 2021.The DUSIB, however, said some of the funds given by the Central government for construction of flats could be adjusted towards the amount payable by the land owning agency (Railways). Repeated calls and text messages to the spokesperson of the Northern Railway for a comment on the matter went unanswered.According to the Delhi Slum Rehabilitation Policy, DUSIB is the nodal agency for rehabilitation and relocation of slums with respect to the lands belonging to the municipal corporations and the Delhi government and its departments and agencies. The policy insists on ‘in situ’ rehabilitation of slum dwellers in which the DUSIB has to either provide alternative housing on the same land or within a 5km radius of the original habitation. In exceptional circumstances, however, the DUSIB can also relocate inland, beyond the 5km radius, with prior approval from its board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/relocate-then-demolish-delhi-govt-s-slum-board-to-railways/story-J9dOjaX0F6xkRJYkIRWNDM.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||After SDMC move, east Delhi school teachers asked to boost student enrolment||The east municipal corporation has launched a special drive to boost the admission process in its schools and asked all its teachers to enrol at least 20 students each in their respective institutes by September 30, including it as a criterion in their annual performance assessment report (APAR). The south Delhi municipal corporation had launched a similar drive in August to increase enrolment in its schools. HT had on August 15 reported how the three civic bodies -- east, south and north-- are having fewer admissions this year. The north, east and south corporations run 765, 365, and 581 schools, respectively, and cater to children up to class 5. In an order issued to all principals of its schools earlier this week, the east MCD’s education department said, “As per the practice, an extensive drive is undertaken by the principals/teachers of the EDMC schools at the end of March every year for the enrolment of students. However, keeping in view of the prevailing situation of lockdown in March/April in the country due Covid-19, the practice could not be conducted during the current year affecting the enrolment of new students in the schools.” Every year, the admissions start in April but this year it had begun in July due the pandemic and lockdown.The east MCD directed its zonal education officers to take steps for maximum enrolment in its schools. “All heads of schools and teachers to conduct an extensive drive in catchment areas of their respective schools and to make an extra effort for new admissions, and at least 20 new admissions per teacher by 30.09.2020,” the order said. Alka Sharma, additional commissioner east MCD, said the civic body has added the “enrolment of new students” as a criteria to the annual assessment report of teachers. “After observing fewer admissions this year, we decided to launch the drive. We engaged all our contractual teachers in the drive and linked it as a criterion in their assessment report. We have around 4,000 teachers and if all of them get at least 20 new students each, we will have sufficient admissions this year,” she said. The south civic body said a similar drive proved to be successful for their schools. Mukesh Suryan, the chairperson of the south civic body’s education committee, said, “We managed to get over 84,000 new admissions in the last one month. We are expecting to cross one lakh by the end of this month. Before the drive, we were struggling. Since the 20 admission per teacher criteria is linked to their performance assessment, each and every one is participating in the drive with a lot of enthusiasm.” Ramnivas Solanki, president of the Delhi municipal corporation teachers’ association, said teachers do not have any issue with linking admissions with APAR. “If there are fewer admissions, the probability of engaging guest or contractual teachers will be less. We should all work together to get as many new admissions as possible. The north MCD should also launch a drive like this,” he said. A senior official at the north MCD said, “Our teachers are already working on boosting the admission process in our schools. There is no plan to link it with APAR as of now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-sdmc-move-east-delhi-school-teachers-asked-to-boost-student-enrolment/story-DAkEx2v0hu2XWtHfSxKwwO.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Shift slum dwellers to vacant flats or we will: BJP ultimatum to AAP||Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta Friday gave an ultimatum to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government to shift within 90 days the 48,000 families living in slums along railway tracks to the 52,000 vacant flats available with the state government. Gupta said if the Delhi government fails to do so, then the BJP will step in to shift the residents to these flats.The Supreme Court had ordered authorities to remove nearly 48,000 slum dwellings situated along railway tracks in Delhi within three months -- an order that has led to a fresh political slugfest between the BJP and the AAP.Also read: Kejriwal govt will give railway slum residents home if Centre doesn’t: Raghav ChadhaTargeting the AAP, the BJP said despite being in power for over five years, the ruling party has done little to rehabilitate slum dwellers. “This is an ultimatum for the Delhi government -- if they do not shift the slum dwellers within the next 90 days into those 52,000 houses lying vacant, then we will start shifting the slum dwellers into those vacant houses,” Gupta said.The BJP said the government has nearly 52,000 flats ready for slums dwellers in different parts of the city. Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said, “The central government bore 50% of the cost of constructing these flats. The Delhi government should relocate slum dwellers there.”Addressing a press conference on Friday, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the Delhi government has written to the Northern Railway, arguing that any demolition without rehabilitating residents would be “unconstitutional” and “illegal”. “This affidavit proves that Kejriwal is not only the chief minister of Delhi, but also the elder son to the families of the slum dwellers. Kejriwal will take up every responsibility of the elder son and will not allow any eviction unless the BJP-ruled Centre comes up with a proper rehabilitation plan. The ongoing case in the apex court is not even about slum demolition, but the BJP filed the affidavit in a bid to get a court order so they can demolish the slums as they were unable to do so earlier because of the Arvind Kejriwal government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shift-slum-dwellers-to-vacant-flats-or-we-will-bjp-ultimatum-to-aap/story-Lu1yhGBDka2pPFRBqBXbKI.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal govt will give railway slum residents home if Centre doesn’t: Raghav Chadha||New Delhi: Continuing its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the eviction of residents of slums along Delhi’s railway tracks, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government will provide homes to the displaced if the Centre fails to do so. Addressing a press conference on Friday, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the Delhi government has written to the Northern Railway, arguing that any demolition without rehabilitating residents would be “unconstitutional” and “illegal”. Chadha’s comments came a day after he tore eviction notices sent to the residents by the railways and said no one could raze their shanties “till Kejriwal is alive”.In Friday’s press briefing, Chadha presented an affidavit and an action-taken report submitted by the Northern Railways to the Supreme Court (SC) which stated that the mushrooming of slums along railway tracks is acting as a hindrance towards keeping them clean. “In its affidavit to the SC, the BJP government has noted that due to the slums and its dwellers, the railway tracks remain dirty, and therefore, the slums should be demolished. This is irrefutable evidence, which exposes the BJP’s anti-poor agenda,” he said.“The apex court was hearing a matter regarding the garbage-cleaning issue in Delhi. The Central government silently submitted this affidavit on August 18, in which it observed that people who stay in slums along the railway lines are the reason behind the filth on and around the tracks. This is why the BJP wants to demolish these slums,” Chadha said.The Northern Railway’s document mentions that it has been unable to evict the residents despite having a special task force ready sending numerous notices for encroachment removal due to various political interferences. The document, which HT has seen, reads, “There are circumstances prevailing upon Railways due to mushrooming of JJ clusters in the land adjoining railway land specially in and around Delhi areas and quite often goes beyond the control of the Railway authority, mainly due to the hindrance created by the local public representatives and sometimes due to stay orders passed by various courts in removal of unauthorised encroachment from the railway land to the unauthorised JJ cluster which have become the continuous source of MSW (municipal solid waste) where these encroachers burn garbage, MSW…” read the document submitted to the Apex Court by the Railways. Chadha, who is also the vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), said the AAP takes these admissions by the Railways “as a matter of pride”. “This affidavit proves that Kejriwal is not only the chief minister of Delhi, but also the elder son to the families of the slum dwellers. Kejriwal will take up every responsibility of the elder son and will not allow any eviction unless the BJP-ruled Centre comes up with a proper rehabilitation plan. The ongoing case in the apex court is not even about slum demolition, but the BJP filed the affidavit in a bid to get a court order so they can demolish the slums as they were unable to do so earlier because of the Arvind Kejriwal government,” he said. AAP also talked about the letter sent by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) to the Northern Railways requesting it not to carry out any demolition without rehabilitating the slum dwellers.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta on Friday alleged that despite being in power for over five years, the ruling party has done little to rehabilitate people living in slums in the Capital. “This is an ultimatum for the Delhi government that if they do not shift the slum dwellers in the 52,000 houses lying vacant within the next 90 days, then we will shift the slum dwellers in those vacant houses,” Gupta said.Repeated calls and text messages to the spokesperson of the Northern Railway for a comment went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-govt-will-give-railway-slum-residents-home-if-centre-doesn-t-raghav-chadha/story-NpOWEw5tC51POZh3eD3yBO.html

Police said Jain runs a soundproofing business.The victim, Sanjesh Awasthi, worked at a factory in Old Faridabad and lived with his family in Aali Vihar village near Sarita Vihar in south Delhi. He cycled to work every day, his family said.On Monday evening, when he didn’t return home by his usual time of 7.30pm, his family went looking for him. On Tuesday, they finally found the mangled remains of his bicycle and his footwear on the flyover.“They approached the Badarpur police station and registered a missing person complaint. We began investigating his disappearance,” Meena said.Meanwhile, in the south Delhi district, police received a call from Moolchand Hospital about a man being declared dead on arrival after a hit-and-run accident. A case of causing death by negligence was registered at the Amar Colony police station.“When we probed further, we got to know about the case registered at the Amar Colony station. So, we checked the CCTV footage from the hospital to identify the vehicle in which the victim was brought in. It turned out to be a Range Rover,” the DCP said.Police identified Jain as the owner of the SUV and arrested him. “He revealed that he was driving from Faridabad to his Greater Kailash home when his vehicle hit the cyclist. He then rushed the badly injured to hospital,” Meena said.“Awasthi was declared dead on arrival and Jain fled the hospital without sharing his credentials,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cyclist-fatally-mowed-down-by-suv-in-badarpur-driver-nabbed-using-cctv-footage/story-BfaXXB6BY18OUSe7rQgFMJ.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt hospitals move to increase ICU bed capacity||As the number of hospitalisations due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spikes, the Delhi government is working to increase its intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in at least three of its big hospitals dedicated for the treatment of the contagious pathogen. The number of hospitalisations in Delhi crossed 6,000 on Friday, the first time since the surge in cases in June. At least 2,203 ICU beds are earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in government and private hospitals in Delhi. Over 62.7% of these were occupied as on Sunday evening, according to data from the Delhi Corona App.Also read: 6.4 million Covid-19 cases were estimated in India by early May, says first national serosurvey reportA stock-taking meeting was held this week on how to augment ICU beds. “The CM had directed authorities to increase the number of ICU beds in the hospitals,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said after the meeting. The situation is worse in multispeciality private hospitals. More than 89% of ICU beds with ventilators in 11 biggest hospitals were occupied on Friday. And 82% of ICU beds without ventilators in eight large hospitals were filled. At the Delhi government-run 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, 55% of 300 ICU beds with and without ventilators were occupied, the Delhi Corona app showed. The government plans to increase Lok Nayak’s ICU capacity to 500. “Work has begun on increasing ICU beds. Most of these additional beds will have non-invasive ventilator equipment such as high-flow nasal oxygen (Bipap) as doctors have now seen that this is better than invasive mechanical ventilation for Covid-19 patients,” said a senior Lok Nayak official.Also read: Maharashtra at 1 million Covid-19 casesEquipment was purchased last month and recruitment of senior residents, paramedics and nurses has begun. “The hiring process of senior residents is over and 100 nurses will join from Saturday. Within two or three days, around 50 more beds will be converted into ICU,” said the official. At Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, 16% of the 200 ICU beds were occupied on Sunday. “The number of patients in need of ICU care is going up. We have been asked to increase the number of ICU beds. We have the equipment, and depending on manpower, we will scale up as much as possible,” said a senior doctor. Doctors said medical personnel are being directed from other hospitals to run the ICU. “The government is looking for resources at every nook and cranny and diverting it to the hospital. We are looking at ways to increase the manpower needed to run about 500 ICU beds,” said the doctor quoted above on condition of anonymity. At Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where 86% of the 100 ICU beds are occupied, the government has asked it to scale up the capacity by 28 beds. “Work is on to convert 28 high-dependence unit beds to ICU beds. However, where will we get trained nurses and intensivists to run ICUs? There is already an acute shortage of staff,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. The Delhi government did not respond to messages and calls for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-hospitals-move-to-increase-icu-bed-capacity/story-DUeOCkSpTAri8U9EaazE2O.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro to resume normal timings of 6am to 11pm from today||The Delhi Metro Friday resumed services in two more corridors -- the Magenta Line(Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden), and the Grey Line (Dwarka to Najafgarh) as part of its graded unlock plan. With this, it has now reopened all its major lines. The last line on the network, the Airport Express Line, will open Saturday, when the Delhi Metro will revert to its pre-lockdown operational timings of 6am to 11pm. The metro services were shut on March 22, in view of Covid-19 outbreakOn Friday, the Delhi Metro recorded a total ridership of 1,28,886 (till 7.30pm). The Magenta Line catered to 6,953 passengers and Grey Line to 514 passengers. The ridership on the Yellow Line (Huda City Centre to Samaypur Badli) was 41,689, while it was 38,623 on the Blue Line (Dwarka Sector-21 to Vaishali/Noida Electronic Centre). Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) got 8,678 passengers and Red Line 15,485 passengers. Around 11,119 people travelled on the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Ballabhgarh) and 5,825 on the Green Line (Inderlok/Kirti Nagar to Bahadurgarh). Anticipating a further increase in passenger footfall, Mangu Singh, managing director, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), sent out a video message to Delhi residents, urging them to “break the peak” and avoid crowding on the system. He also urged them to use the Metro system for travel only if necessary during the pandemic. “From tomorrow (Saturday) normal services will resume on the Delhi Metro. However, with social distancing norms in place, our carrying capacity has reduced drastically. Earlier, we could ferry around 300 passengers in a coach but that has now reduced to just 50. Keeping this in mind, I request you to stagger your travel hours,” Singh said. He continued in the video message, “If you avoid travelling during rush hours, DMRC will also be able to give you the best service. I also request all employers, to stagger your office timings and allow your staff flexible working hours. Do not think that the situation has returned to normal; people who are working from home, kindly continue to do so.” To ensure travel options for those appearing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday, the DMRC has also decided to start its services from 6am, instead of the usual 8am on Sundays, on all lines. However, the DMRC advised students to reach stations with ample time in hand for the process of screening and sanitisation at the gates and in view of the increased travel time owing to longer stoppage time at each station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-will-resume-normal-timings-of-6am-to-11pm-from-saturday/story-Bbqu4qKk70JRFQFaO8RmhN.html
12-09-2020||Delhi||Metro deploys flying squads to ensure commuters keep their masks on inside trains||With the Delhi Metro resuming full service on nearly all routes on Saturday, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) started deploying flying squads on all its corridors to ensure that passengers are wearing masks at all times and adhering to social distancing norms put in place to contain the Covid-19 spread. In a statement issued Friday, the DMRC said the decision to form squads was taken after it was observed that with more lines being thrown open, there were instances of passengers removing their masks after entering trains. “In view of such cases that were reported on social media, the DMRC has now decided to deploy flying squads across all lines to randomly check for violations and counsel people to follow rules for their own safety and everyone’s else’s,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said. Dayal said the squads have been formed with the primary intention of educating passengers on the importance of wearing masks at all times while using the Metro. However, in case a passenger refuses to follow directions even after being cautioned, then the DMRC will be at the liberty to penalise him/her under the Operations and Maintenance Act, 2002 (O&M Act) of the Delhi Metro. The Metro also has a Plan B -- filing FIRs against violators. On its first day, the flying squad counselled over 150 passengers who were found violating safety protocols and slapped fines of ₹200 each on 92 passengers, under Section 59 of the O&M Act for causing public nuisance. The fines were issued to only those who failed to adhere to directions and continued to break rules even after being counselled.“Since the Metro services have resumed only recently, we are hopeful that people will soon be well versed with the new rules and help the DMRC run its services without any health risk to any passenger,” Dayal appealed. The DMRC has also deployed around 1,500 Metro officials and civil defence volunteers to guide commuters and remind them of the new rules. The Delhi Metro had also installed LED screens in stations with high footfall to regularly display safety and precautionary messages. “As part of its multi-tier strategy, DMRC has not only introduced a new set of announcements, which are being made frequently at stations and on trains, advising public to wear masks throughout the travel, we are also running short films on new travel norms at major Metro stations and on trains that have LED screens,” Dayal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-deploys-flying-squads-to-ensure-commuters-keep-their-masks-on-inside-trains/story-7O7P1lHW888oWQDrhg1phP.html
12-09-2020||Noida||In Noida, 20% of all Covid cases reported in first 11 days of September||Of all the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases detected so far in Gautam Budh Nagar, 20% of them were reported in the first 11 days of September. According to official figures, of a total of 9,808 cases in the district till September 11, 2,063 cases were reported from September 1 to 11. Not only that, the number of patients discharged after treatment also went down to 1,071 in September (till 11). By contrast, in the entire month of August, as many as 2,864 new cases were reported and 2,174 patients were discharged.The data report reveals that the daily figure of active cases in the district has gone up six times in September so far, which up to August 31, had crossed the 200-mark only three times since March 8, when the first case was reported in the district.According to chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri, the recent surge in cases is due to an increase in testing. “Earlier, we used to test around 1,500 persons a day, but now it is around 3,000 people a day. The more you test, the more will come out positive. But, we are not worried as the fatality rate in the district is low,” he said.The district administration attributed this surge to the reverse migration of workers from their home towns to the industrial city of Noida, increased rate of testing as well as easing of movement restrictions, but the trading community felt that the rising tide of cases will prove an even bigger blow to industries than the lockdown.District magistrate Suhas LY said it being an industrial hub, Gautam Budh Nagar has a floating population, especially of migrant workers from other states. “Since the unlock process has been eased, they have started coming back to the city for work, and it is expected to cause the surge. The transitional season before winter has also increased the viral load these days. Hopefully, cases will start decreasing soon,” he said.The DM further said the main aim of the administration is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR). “We are successful from that point of view. The district’s CFR has gone down to 0.48%, which is much better than the national CFR of 1.71% and the state CFR of 1.43%. It clearly indicates that our sampling rate and recovery rate have been increasing day by day. Not only that, Gautam Budh Nagar has the lowest mortality rate among all districts of the state,” he said.Lalit Thukral, president of Noida apparel export cluster (NAEC), doesn’t appear to believe that reverse migration has caused the surge in Covid-19 cases. “Does the administration have any data on how many workers have been found infected with Covid-19 in the district? We are in a Catch-22 situation now. While our workers are scared to come back and we are continuing work with limited strength, our overseas buyers are apprehensive to give us orders as most of them feel that if the situation remains the same, the government may impose another lockdown,” he said.Sushil Kumar Jain, the president of Sector 18 market association, also said he felt that the surge in cases adversely impacted businesses. “The turnout of customers, which had increased in the last week of August, has again gone down. If the situation persists for long, traders will have no option other than to permanently shut shop,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-noida-20-of-all-covid-cases-reported-in-first-11-days-of-september/story-hpXrxv7XGFim2IjqWS7doL.html
12-09-2020||Noida||Noida: UP pollution control body sends notices to 13 high-rise societies over untreated sewage||The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has sent a show cause notice to a total of 13 high-rise societies of the city on why they are allegedly not treating sewage being generated at their premises, officials said Friday.Earlier this month, the pollution monitoring agency had inspected and collected samples from 20 high-rise societies in sectors 74, 75, 76, 78 and 137. Out of these, six did not have a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and the STPs of seven others were either not functioning or the plant was found to not have been treating effluents properly. Only seven high rises were following the norms.“We served notices to 13 high-rise societies earlier this week seeking a reply on why they were not treating the effluents properly or in some cases, why they don’t have an STP at all. They have two weeks’ time to respond. Following this, we will initiate the process of imposing environmental compensation, which applies on both type of violators, though the amount varies in case the STP was not functioning properly or there was no STP at all,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.He said the notices were served a few days back and another high-rise was inspected earlier this week in Sector 74 where the norms were not being followed either. “We inspected another high-rise this week and collected samples. Though there was an STP in the high-rise, it wasn’t operational. We have sought details of the high-rises from the Noida authority,” said Kumar. According to rules laid down by the Noida authority, all high-rises in the city must treat sewage generated within their premises through STPs. The treated water should be used for horticulture and washing purposes within the residential societies, and only leftover, treated wastewater should be released into drains. “For a society which does not have an STP, the fine is minimum ₹5,000 per day from the date of its occupancy. So if the society is operational for a year without an STP, which most of them are, the minimum environmental compensation they could see comes to around ₹18 lakh. For those which have an STP but did not follow norms, the compensation is calculated drawing different constraints like the degree of pollutant, volume of effluents, number of occupants, days of violation etc.,” said Kumar, adding that the high-rise societies often switch off their STPs and swiftly discharge untreated sewage in drains in order to save on the expenses of treatment. According to Noida authority officials, they had in July inspected a total of 33 high-rise societies, of which a list of 21 was forwarded to UPPCB for inspection and sample collection. The officials said soon they will forward a list of more suspected high-rises to UPPCB.“We will in a phase-wise manner inspect all high-rises of the city, which have occupancy, to check whether untreated sewage is being diverted in flood drains or treated. The second list of eight more high-rises is being prepared which will be forwarded to UPPCB for inspection as they have the expertise and can impose environment compensation. The UPPCB has sought details of high-rises already inspected, including the date of occupancy, to calculate the penalty. We have prepared the list and shall forward them soon,” said Avinash Tripathi, office on special duty, health, Noida.The estimated sewage generation in Noida is around 210 million litres a day (MLD). According to officials, the city has the capacity to treat 230 MLD of sewage through its six STPs. However, untreated sewer from high-rises often reaches up to Yamuna and Hindon rivers through flood drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-up-pollution-control-body-sends-notices-to-13-high-rise-societies-over-untreated-sewage/story-Dx17XEvc1x1XdJ8pk5pgAK.html

The action was carried out across all police zones in the city.While those not wearing masks at public places were warned under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) since Covid-19 cases broke in the city, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had not authorised the police to collect fines.The action was backed by fine after union minister Prakash Javadekar and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar urged the police to implement it pointing out that rising virus cases in the city.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) national directive for Covid-19 management states: “Wearing of face cover is compulsory in public places; in workplaces; and during transport”. The directive empowers the police to prosecute people without masks.After the state home department gave its authorisation to the police to take action against offenders, police stations, including the traffic branch, have been ordered to fine mask offenders. Standing instructions have been issued to lodge FIRs against persons who argue and obstruct government servants from discharging their duties.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has ordered municipal corporations to take effective steps to check virus spread and delegated powers to the city police to recover fine of Rs 500 from residents found not wearing mask in public places.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh said, “People need to follow virus prevention norms strictly.

Also read: Donald Trump looks west, eyeing new paths to White HouseTrump, who has admitted playing down the severity of the virus since it emerged early this presidential election year, said on Thursday he believed the United States was “rounding the corner” on the crisis.“I have to disagree with that, because, if you look at the thing that you just mentioned, the statistics ... they are disturbing,” Fauci said on MSNBC.Fauci said he hoped the country did not see a spike in cases after the Labor Day weekend as it did after other long holiday weekends since May. It was important to get those infection rates down before the autumn and winter seasons when people will be spending more time indoors. “You don’t want to start off already with a baseline that’s so high,” Fauci said.Asked about the outdoor campaign rallies Trump has resumed before his Nov. 3 matchup against Democrat Joe Biden, Fauci said they are “absolutely” risky.Also read: Will take Covid-19 vaccine on your show: Ivanka accepts TV host’s challenge“Just because you’re outdoors does not mean that you’re protected, particularly if you’re in a crowd and you’re not wearing masks,” he said.Fauci, who has contradicted Trump’s statements about the virus, denies the administration is pressuring him to keep quiet.“Anybody that tries to tell me what to say publicly, if they know anything about me, realizes that’s a fool’s errand,” Fauci said. “No one is ever going to pressure me or muzzle me to say anything publicly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-disagrees-with-trump-on-coronavirus-cites-disturbing-us-statistics/story-zxr2kgJUixPHi552C2xCDK.html
12-09-2020||World||Donald Trump looks west, eyeing new paths to White House||Pushing for new roads to reelection, President Donald Trump is going on the offense this weekend in Nevada, which hasn’t supported a Republican presidential candidate since 2004.Trump is confronting local authorities by holding public events Saturday and Sunday after state officials blocked his initial plans for rallies in Reno and Las Vegas because they would have violated coronavirus health guidelines. It’s the kind of political fight that Trump’s team relishes and underscores the growing importance of Nevada in Trump’s quest for 270 electoral votes as the race against Democrat Joe Biden looks tight in a number of pivotal states.Trump narrowly lost Nevada in 2016 to Hillary Clinton, and the state has trended further toward the Democrats in the past decade. But Trump’s campaign has invested heavily in the state, relying on its ground game to turn out voters. Democrats, by contrast, have largely relied on virtual campaign efforts during the pandemic, save for the casino workers’ Culinary Union, which has sent workers door to door.“The Democrats are scared. They know President Trump has the momentum,” said the state GOP chairman, Michael McDonald.Both candidates have spent about $4.5 million in Nevada, while Trump has made $5.5 million in future reservations in the state and Biden has allocated $2.5 million, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.The Trump team originally planned rallies at airport hangars in Reno and Las Vegas, but those were scuttled by state officials due to concerns the campaign would not abide by Covid-19 restrictions. State Republicans blamed Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak for trying to hurt the president’s reelection chances. Sisolak has limited in-person gatherings indoors and outdoors to 50 people since May, a recommendation based on White House reopening guidelines.Instead, Trump scheduled an event in Minden, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Reno, on Saturday night. He planned to host a “Latinos for Trump” roundtable Sunday morning in Las Vegas, followed by an evening rally at a manufacturing facility in neighboring Henderson.Privately, the Trump campaign welcomed the fight, believing it highlighted a reelection theme: Trump’s insistence that the nation has turned the corner on the pandemic, while Democrats, including Biden and governors, are hurting the nation’s economy and psyche with stringent restrictions. The pandemic, which has killed more than 190,000 Americans, still claims 1,000 lives a day.“The fact that Donald Trump is even considering holding these unsafe events in the midst of a global pandemic is just the latest example of his poor judgment and complete disregard for Nevadans’ public health and safety,” said Madison Mundy of the state Democratic Party.The White House announced Saturday that Trump will visit California on Monday to receive a briefing on the devastating wildfires racing through the region. He has largely been silent on the blazes, which Oregon’s emergency management director said was a possible “mass fatality event.”Some Democrats fear a possible Trump momentum gain in Nevada, with the president showing increasing support from Latinos and noncollege educated white voters, two important constituencies in the state.The tightening race in a number of the most contested states has led to a renewed effort for Trump to expand his electoral map.The campaign has lavished attention on three Great Lakes states that flipped his way narrowly in 2016. Several polls earlier this summer suggested Trump may be in trouble, but a handful in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin following the nominating conventions showed a close race.Polling in North Carolina and Florida also shows a competitive race, and there is increasing concern within the Trump campaign about Arizona. Once considered fairly safely in Trump’s column, Arizona has been ravaged by the coronavirus and the Trump team has grown worried about a slip in support among the state’s older residents.The president on Monday planned to return to Arizona, which he has visited multiple times since he resumed traveling during the pandemic.If Arizona slips away, Trump campaign officials privately acknowledge that it would complicate his path to 270 electoral votes. If he loses Arizona, winning Wisconsin — the most likely Midwest state for Trump to retain — would not be enough even if he keeps Florida and North Carolina. It would require him to win somewhere else, which has led to a renewed focus on Minnesota, New Hampshire and the at-large congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine.Nevada has become a particular focus, in part because Las Vegas is an appetizing location for Trump to raise money. He scheduled at least one high-dollar fundraiser there over the weekend — as well as one in Washington before he flies west — as he looks to assuage growing concerns that he could fall short of cash. Couples were asked for $150,000 for the Las Vegas fundraiser.The Republican National Committee said the $18 million expected to be raised over the weekend, including from an appearance Saturday at his hotel in Washington, would be shared by Trump’s campaign, the committee and several state GOP committees.Trump and Republicans raised $210 million in August, a robust sum but far behind the record $364.5 million taken in by Biden and his party that month. Though the Trump campaign has insisted that it has more resources on hand than it did at this time in 2016, whispers about a financial disadvantage led Trump himself this past week to suggest he may put some of his own fortune into the race.Nevada’s financial health is dependent on the national economy doing well because the state draws so much revenue from tourism. When the pandemic hit, Nevada’s casinos and all gambling shuttered for about 11 weeks, and the state is trimming about one-quarter of its budget at a time of sky-high unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-looks-west-eyeing-new-paths-to-white-house/story-xjR6dHuDgLcFXQ3239cvbK.html
12-09-2020||World||Iran executes man whose case drew international attention||Iranian state TV on Saturday reported that the country’s authorities executed a wrestler for allegedly murdering a man, after President Donald Trump asked for the 27-year-old condemned man’s life to be spared.State TV quoted the chief justice of Fars province, Kazem Mousavi, as saying: “The retaliation sentence against Navid Afkari, the killer of Hassan Torkaman, was carried out this morning in Adelabad prison in Shiraz.”Afkari’s case had drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrayed him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran’s Shiite theocracy in 2018. Authorities accused Afkari of stabbing a water supply company employee in the southern city of Shiraz amid the unrest.Iran broadcast the wrestler’s televised confession last week. The segment resembled hundreds of other suspected coerced confessions aired over the last decade in the Islamic Republic.The International Olympic Committee in a statement Saturday said it was shocked and saddened by the news of the wrestler’s execution, and that the committee’s president, Thomas Bach, “had made direct personal appeals to the Supreme Leader and to the President of Iran this week and asked for mercy for Navid Afkari.”The case revived a demand inside the country for Iran to stop carrying out the death penalty. Even imprisoned Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, herself nearly a month into a hunger strike over conditions at Tehran’s Evin prison amid the coronavirus pandemic, passed word that she supported Afkari.Last week, Trump tweeted out his own concern about Afkari’s case.“To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him,” Trump wrote. “Thank you!”Iran responded to Trump’s tweet with a nearly 11-minute state TV package on Afkari. It included the weeping parents of the slain water company employee. The package included footage of Afkari on the back of a motorbike, saying he had stabbed the employee in the back, without explaining why he allegedly carried out the assault.The state TV segment showed blurred police documents and described the killing as a “personal dispute,” without elaborating. It said Afkari’s cellphone had been in the area and it showed surveillance footage of him walking down a street, talking on his phone.Last week, Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency dismissed Trump’s tweet in a feature story, saying that American sanctions have hurt Iranian hospitals amid the pandemic.“Trump is worried about the life of a murderer while he puts many Iranian patients’ lives in danger by imposing severe sanctions,” the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-executes-man-whose-case-drew-international-attention/story-bgRm4JbAwOH8cHbFnkFftM.html
12-09-2020||World||Antarctica is still free of Covid-19. Can it stay that way?||At this very moment a vast world exists that’s free of the coronavirus, where people can mingle without masks and watch the pandemic unfold from thousands of miles away.That world is Antarctica, the only continent without Covid-19. Now, as nearly 1,000 scientists and others who wintered over on the ice are seeing the sun for the first time in weeks or months, a global effort wants to make sure incoming colleagues don’t bring the virus with them.From the U.K.’s Rothera Research Station off the Antarctic peninsula that curls toward the tip of South America, field guide Rob Taylor described what it’s like in “our safe little bubble.”In pre-coronavirus days, long-term isolation, self-reliance and psychological strain were the norm for Antarctic teams while the rest of the world saw their life as fascinatingly extreme.How times have changed.“In general, the freedoms afforded to us are more extensive than those in the UK at the height of lockdown,” said Taylor, who arrived in October and has missed the pandemic entirely. “We can ski, socialize normally, run, use the gym, all within reason.”Like teams across Antarctica, including at the South Pole, Taylor and his 26 colleagues must be proficient in all sorts of tasks in a remote, communal environment with little room for error. They take turns cooking, make weather observations and “do a lot of sewing,” he said.Good internet connections mean they’ve watched closely as the pandemic circled the rest of the planet. Until this year, conversations with incoming colleagues focused on preparing the newcomers. Now the advice goes both ways.“I’m sure there’s a lot they can tell us that will help us adapt to the new way of things,” Taylor said. “We haven’t had any practice at social distancing yet!”At New Zealand’s Scott Base, rounds of mini-golf and a filmmaking competition with other Antarctic bases have been highlights of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, which ended for the Scott team when they spotted the sun last Friday. It had been away since April.“I think there’s a little bit of dissociation,” Rory O’Connor, a doctor and the team’s winter leader, said of watching the pandemic from afar. “You acknowledge it cerebrally, but I don’t think we have fully factored in the emotional turmoil it must be causing.”His family in the UK still wouldn’t trade places with him. “They can’t understand why I came down here,” he joked. “Months of darkness. Stuck inside with a small group of people. Where’s the joy in that?”O’Connor said they will be able to test for the virus once colleagues start arriving as soon as Monday, weeks late because a huge storm dumped 20-feet (6-meter) snowdrifts. Any virus case will spark a “red response level,” he said, with activities stripped down to providing heating, water, power and food.While Covid-19 has rattled some diplomatic ties, the 30 countries that make up the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs teamed up early to keep the virus out. Officials cited unique teamwork among the United States, China, Russia and others.As a frightened world was locking down in March, the Antarctic programs agreed the pandemic could become a major disaster. With the world’s strongest winds and coldest temperatures, the continent roughly the size of the United States and Mexico is already dangerous for workers at 40 year-round bases.“A highly infectious novel virus with significant mortality and morbidity in the extreme and austere environment of Antarctica with limited sophistication of medical care and public health responses is High Risk with potential catastrophic consequences,” according to a COMNAP document seen by The Associated Press.Since Antarctica can only be reached through a few air gateways or via ship, “the attempt to prevent the virus from reaching the continent should be undertaken IMMEDIATELY,” it said.No more contact with tourists, COMNAP warned. “No cruise ships should be disembarking.” And for Antarctic teams located near each other, “mutual visits and social events between stations/facilities should be ceased.”Antarctic workers have long been trained in hand-washing and “sneeze etiquette,” but COMNAP slipped in that reminder, adding, “Don’t touch your face.”In those hurried weeks of final flights, the US “thankfully” augmented medical and other supplies for winter and beyond, said Stephanie Short, head of logistics for the US Antarctic program.“We re-planned an entire research season in a matter of weeks, facing the highest level of uncertainty I’ve seen in my 25-year government career,” she said.Antarctic bases soon slipped into months of isolation known as winter. Now, with the glimmer of spring, the next big test has begun.Everyone is sending fewer people to the ice for the summer, COMNAP executive secretary Michelle Finnemore said.In the gateway city of Christchurch, New Zealand, Operation Deep Freeze is preparing to airlift some 120 people to the largest US station, McMurdo. To limit contact between Antarctic workers and flight crew, the plane contains a separate toilet mounted on a pallet.The Americans’ bubble began before leaving the US in early August and continues until they reach the ice. They’ve been isolated in hotel rooms well beyond New Zealand’s 14-day quarantine. Bad weather has delayed their departure for weeks. It’s now planned for Monday.“We’re trying to do a really good job keeping up their spirits,” said Anthony German, the US Antarctic program’s chief liaison there.The US is sending a third of its usual summer staff. Research will be affected, though investment in robotics and instrumentation that can transmit data from the field will help greatly, said Alexandra Isern, head of Antarctic sciences for the US program with the National Science Foundation.The Covid-19 disruptions are causing some sadness, she said. “In some cases, we’re going to have to have contingents digging instruments out of the snow to make sure we can still find it.”Like other countries, New Zealand will prioritize long-term data sets, some begun in the 1950s, which measure climate, ozone levels, seismic activity and more, said Sarah Williamson, chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand. It’s sending 100 people to the ice instead of 350, she said.Some programs are deferring Antarctic operations to next year or even 2022, said Nish Devanunthan, South Africa’s director of Antarctic support.“I think the biggest concern for every country is to be the one that is fingered for bringing the virus,” he said. “Everyone is safeguarding against that.”Precautions extend to the gateway cities — Cape Town, Christchurch, Hobart in Australia, Punta Arenas in Chile and Ushuaia in Argentina. Each has quarantine and testing protocols for workers boarding planes or ships heading south.Antarctica always has its challenges, Devanunthan said, but when it comes to Covid-19 and the international community as a whole, “I would say this is on the top of the list.”A few weeks ago at McMurdo Station, workers carried out a drill to simulate what the rest of the world knows too well: mask-wearing and social distancing. “It will be difficult not to run up and hug friends” once they arrive, station manager Erin Heard said.He and the others will start wearing masks two days before the newcomers fly in, he said, “to help us get muscle memory.” For the masks, the team plundered McMurdo’s craft room, stocked with fabric, and found designs online.As colleagues arrive, Heard will leave Antarctica. He once might have planned to thaw out on a beach. Now he’s weighing the new normal.“Do I ask a friend to pick me up? I don’t know if I’m comfortable doing that,” he said as he imagined stepping off the plane. “It will be super weird, to be honest, to be coming from what feels like another planet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antarctica-is-still-free-of-covid-19-can-it-stay-that-way/story-TykiAzBxuGwDg7PZOlB7UN.html
12-09-2020||World||Oxford, AstraZeneca to resume coronavirus vaccine trial: Why it matters||Oxford University — one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine developers in the global race — resumed its trial for testing the drug it is developing with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca on Saturday. The resumption in proving the drug’s efficacy comes two days after it had to stop the trial after a UK volunteer reportedly fell ill.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the restart, saying in a tweet that it was “good news for everyone” that the trial is “back up and running.”The pausing of trial triggered concerns across the globe as several countries have pinned their hopes to defeat the pandemic by developing vaccines which can prove to be a cure for the outbreak which has infected 28,551,911 people and claimed 916,715 lives so far, according to John Hopkins university. Why it matters?The vaccine being developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca is widely perceived to be one of the strongest contenders among the dozens of coronavirus vaccines in various stages of testing around the world. It is also one of the nine candidates around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials.Additionally experts believe Oxford prioritised safety protocol by pausing the trial in case of reported side-effects, showcasing responsible decision-making in such critical times. Dr. Charlotte Summers, a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the pause was a sign that the Oxford team was putting safety issues first, but that it led to “much unhelpful speculation.”“To tackle the global Covid-19 pandemic, we need to develop vaccines and therapies that people feel comfortable using, therefore it is vital to maintain public trust that we stick to the evidence and do not draw conclusions before information is available,” Summers was quoted as saying by news agency Associated Press. Is a pause in developing vaccines normal?Pauses in drug trials are commonplace and indicate careful progression by assessing possible side-effects of a drug-in-making. Global organization WHO and scientists have asked to keep expectations to a minimum, stating that vaccine trials are rarely straightforward and can take a tediously long time to be developed. The Oxford-AstraZeneca study had been previously stopped in July for several days after a participant developed neurological symptoms that turned out to be an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis that researchers said was unrelated to the vaccine.In case of this trial, the university maintains that in large trials such as this “it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety.”How many people are included in testing this Covid-19 vaccine?Globally some 18,000 people have received its vaccine so far in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. Around 30,000 volunteers are being recruited in the US.By when is Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine expected?After the pause, AstraZeneca had said it remained hopeful that the vaccine could still be available “by the end of this year, early next year”, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-to-resume-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-why-it-matters/story-Xs8qlLLyiCZjfe9jxAuEoM.html
12-09-2020||World||Liberia declares rape a national emergency||Liberian President George Weah has declared rape a national emergency and has ordered new measures to tackle the problem after a recent spike of cases in the poor West African state.The moves comes after thousands of Liberians protested rising incidents of rape in the capital Monrovia last month, in a bid to draw attention to the country’s alarming rate of sexual assault.Late on Friday, Weah said he would install a special prosecutor for rape in Liberia, as well as set up a national sex offender registry, a statement from his office said.The government will also establish a so-called “national security task force” on sexual- and gender-based violence.The high rates of rape in impoverished Liberia, forced to contend both with war and the Ebola virus in recent years, has been a longstanding concern.A UN report in 2016 recorded 803 rape cases the previous year in the country of 4.5 million, and found that only two percent of sexual violence cases led to a conviction, for example.It was the resulting sense of impunity and the legacy of the 14-year civil war between 1989 and 2003, when rape was commonplace, that had created the current problem, it said.Incidents of rape appear to have risen sharply this year, however.Margaret Taylor, the director of Liberia’s Women Empowerment Network, told AFP last month that her NGO had recorded 600 cases of rape between June and August, for example.That was up from between 80 and a hundred cases in May, she said.Weah’s announcement of a national rape emergency follows a conference in the capital Monrovia on tackling sexual violence on Wednesday. Addressing the meeting, the footballer-turned-president said Liberia was “witnessing what is actually an epidemic of rape within the pandemic, affecting mostly children and young girls across the country.”Weah’s office said in the statement on Friday that further anti-rape measures will be announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liberia-declares-rape-a-national-emergency/story-jaSLBb6zmy6SRb309tVDUP.html
12-09-2020||World||UK: Indian-origin man guilty of estranged partner’s murder||A 23-year-old man who arrived from India as a partner for a woman in the east Midlands town of Leicester and later fell out with her and stabbed her to death in March, has been found guilty, awaiting sentence in the Leicester Crown Court on September 16.The Leicestershire police said on Friday that Jigukumar Sorthi had stopped a policeman in the street and made comments implicating himself in the March attack on his estranged partner, Bhavini Pravin, 21, in the latter’s home.At around 12.30pm on March 2, the police said Sorthi went to her address to speak to Pravin. They talked for a few minutes before Sorthi stabbed her multiple times and soon left the property. A post-mortem examination concluded Pravin died of multiple stab wounds.Detective inspector Kenny Henry said, “This was a vicious attack on a defenceless young woman. Bhavini Pravin was 21 years old with her whole life ahead of her; instead it has been cruelly taken away by an act so brutal it doesn’t bear thinking about.”Her father, Pravin Babu, released a statement on behalf of the family after Sorthi’s conviction, “Our daughter was only 21 years old when she was murdered… When our Bhavini was born, we felt that all of our prayers had been answered. She was the ‘Laxmi’ of our family.“Growing up, she gave us so much joy and purpose. She was our inspiration to better ourselves and to build a future. Soon after, our two sons, Krutesh and Yagnesh, were born. Even from a young age, Bhavini doted on her little brothers. We decided to move to England so that we could give our children a better future.“As parents, our aspirations were that our daughter would get a good education, pursue her childhood career choice of nursing, marry the man of her dreams, have a family and live happily ever after.“When Jigu (Sorthi) became engaged to our daughter, we trusted him to cherish, love and look after her forever. She was so precious to us. We showed Jigu nothing but love and acceptance. We brought him to England to give him a better life. We supported him, housed him. And how did Jigu return our kindness - he repaid us by killing our beloved Bhavini.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-indian-origin-man-guilty-of-estranged-partner-s-murder/story-DmR99hfhDwUZ1MuCkwOlvL.html
12-09-2020||World||Seize the opportunity, says UK on Afghan-Taliban peace talks||The Boris Johnson government on Saturday called on Afghan and Taliban participants in the peace talks in Doha to seize the opportunity to end decades of conflict in Afghanistan, hoping for a quick ceasefire in the war-ravaged country.Describing the UK’s military and diplomatic efforts as “critical” in supporting Afghanistan over the past 19 years, officials said British aid expertise had helped millions of children go to school and provided life-saving food to those in need.UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said, “Today is a moment that I hope leads to real, positive change in Afghanistan. All sides need to seize this opportunity to work towards an inclusive and sustainable peace. A comprehensive ceasefire should be agreed quickly for the sake of the Afghan people who have suffered for too long.”The UK, as the third-largest troop contributor to the Nato mission, has most recently supported the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces with training, mentoring and financial assistance.Over the last three years, the UK has pledged up to £750 million in humanitarian and development support, besides a recent aid package to tackle the combined threat from the pandemic and famine in developing countries.Part of this funding will help Afghans - who have faced shortages because of conflict, drought and the economic impact of the coronavirus - have enough money to be able to buy food for their families, officials said.Britain’s contribution to the international mission in Afghanistan began in 2001 to prevent terrorist groups using Afghanistan as a safe haven to launch terror attacks. The UK’s combat mission ended in 2014.Since then, the UK has been working in partnership with Nato allies to support Afghanistan’s security, development and governance, which officials said has been crucial to tackle threats to the UK, including from organised crime, drugs and international terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seize-the-opportunity-says-uk-on-afghan-taliban-peace-talks/story-r4SS1iAspqnodXfLgJLpyK.html

The committee “has concluded its investigations and recommended to the MHRA that trials in the UK are safe to resume”, AstraZeneca said.AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is one of nine around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials.In the United States, the company began enrolling 30,000 volunteers across dozens of sites on August 31, and the inoculation is being tested on smaller groups in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. The AZD1222 vaccine uses a weakened version of a common cold-causing adenovirus engineered to code for the spike protein that the Covid-19 coronavirus uses to invade cells.After vaccination, this protein is produced inside the human body, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if the person is later infected.“AstraZeneca is committed to the safety of trial participants and the highest standards of conduct in clinical trials,” Saturday’s statement read.“The company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-resumes-covid-19-vaccine-trial-after-uk-green-light/story-no6Y9g18CWsQalOSLY0nMI.html
12-09-2020||World||Expect US election to have consequences for troops overseas||President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden both say they want to pull U.S. forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan. But their approaches differ, and the outcome of the November 3 election will have long-term consequences not only for US troops, but for the wider region.During his election campaign four years ago, Trump pledged to bring all troops home from “endless wars,” at times triggering pushback from military commanders, defense leaders and even Republican lawmakers worried about abruptly abandoning partners on the ground. In recent months he has only increased the pressure, working to fulfill that promise and get forces home before Election Day.More broadly, Trump’s ‘America First’ mantra has buoyed voters weary of war and frustrated with the billions of dollars spent on national defense at the expense of domestic needs. But it has also alienated longtime European partners whose forces have fought alongside the United States, and has bruised America’s reputation as a loyal ally.Biden has been more adamant about restoring US relations with allies and NATO, and his stance on these wars is more measured. He says troops must be withdrawn responsibly and that a residual force presence will be needed in Afghanistan to ensure terrorist groups can’t rebuild and attack America again. That approach, however, angers progressives and others who believe the US has spent too much time, money and blood on battlefields far from home.“We’re getting out of the endless wars,” Trump told White House reporters recently. He said the “top people in the Pentagon” probably don’t love him because “they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.”He continued: “Let’s bring our soldiers back home. Some people don’t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.”Biden, the former vice president, has sounded less absolute about troop withdrawal. In response to a candidate questionnaire from the Center for Foreign Relations, he said some troops could stay in Afghanistan to focus on the counterterrorism mission.“Americans are rightly weary of our longest war; I am, too. But we must end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back,” he said.While both talk about troops withdrawals, each has, in some ways, tried and failed.Trump came into office condemning the wars and declaring he would bring all troops home. When he took over, the number of forces in Afghanistan had been capped at about 8,400 for some time by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. But within a year that total climbed to about 15,000, as Trump approved commanders’ requests for additional troops to reverse setbacks in the training of Afghan forces, fight an increasingly dangerous Islamic State group and put enough pressure on the Taliban to force it to the peace table.Biden was part of the Obama administration’s failed effort to negotiate an agreement with Iraqi leaders in 2011, and as a result the US pulled all American forces out of that country. That withdrawal was short-lived. Just three years later, as IS militants took over large swaths of Iraq, the US again deployed troops into Iraq and neighboring Syria to defeat IS.With an eye toward the election, Trump has accelerated his push to bring troops home. Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US military commander for the Middle East, said in recent days that by November, the number of troops in Afghanistan could drop to 4,500, and the number in Iraq could dip from about 5,000 to 3,000.John Glaser, foreign policy director at the Cato Institute, is skeptical of both candidates. He said Biden, if elected, will struggle with pressure to pull troops out, but will be drawn to getting things back to normal, “which means being there for allies, reupping our commitment to NATO.”Glaser said he believes Trump really wants to pull troops out, but is driven by his electoral self-interest. “He wants to get out but he doesn’t know how to do so in a way that doesn’t feel like tucking tail and running.”He added that if Trump is reelected, “I’m a little nervous that he will lose a little electoral incentive. If there aren’t votes to be against I frankly don’t know what he will do. He could slip into another conflict, given his belligerence on any given issue.”McKenzie and other military leaders, however, have consistently argued that conditions on the ground and the activities of the enemy must dictate troop levels. They suggest that the US must keep troops in the region to ensure enemies don’t regain a foothold.Michele Flournoy, a former top Pentagon leader who is often mentioned as a potential defense chief in a Biden administration, warned against any “precipitous” withdrawal from Afghanistan that could jeopardize peace. In remarks to the Aspen Security forum, she said that while the US doesn’t want to be in Afghanistan forever, a counterterrorism force should remain until a peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government is solidified.Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said Trump will provide more money for the military while the Democrats probably will try to cut the defense budget. But he also echoed troop withdrawal concerns, reflecting a broader reluctance on the committee to abandon Afghanistan while the Taliban continue to launch attacks and a stubborn IS insurgency threatens to take hold.“Everybody wants to be able to bring troops home from Afghanistan and elsewhere. I think the differences are largely about whether you only do it when certain conditions are met or whether you withdraw anyway and hope for the best,” said Thornberry. “Really what I’m thinking of is the way President Obama withdrew from Iraq. ... We withdrew and kind of said ‘Good luck.’ Obviously, things did not go so well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expect-us-election-to-have-consequences-for-troops-overseas/story-LKOO14o7GsGeFSm7Iipp3K.html
12-09-2020||World||US signs defence cooperation deal with Maldives amid China’s growing presence in Indian Ocean||The US has signed a framework for defence cooperation with the Maldives to deepen engagement in support of maintaining peace and security in the strategic Indian Ocean, the Pentagon has announced, as the Trump administration looks for strengthening alliances in the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s growing presence in the region.The framework for defence and security relationship was signed in Philadelphia on September 10 between Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia Reed Werner and Maldivian Minister of Defence Mariya Didi. .“The framework sets forth both countries’ intent to deepen engagement and cooperation in support of maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean, and marks an important step forward in the defence partnership,” the Pentagon said.The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region of Earth’s seas, comprising the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean.During discussions after signing the agreement, Mariya said the framework will strengthen defence and security cooperation between the two countries, Maldivian portal Sun Online reported.Mariya said that peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean region is tied to the best interests of both countries.She stressed the importance of bilateral dialogue and engagement, against a backdrop of growing transnational threats such as piracy, violent extremism, terrorism, and illicit trade, which she said remained relevant, even amidst the coronavirus pandemic.According to a statement released by the Defence Ministry, the framework outlines a number of bilateral activities, including senior-level dialogues, discussions, engagements, and opportunities in areas such as maritime domain awareness, natural disasters, and humanitarian relief operations, the report said.Mariya said that the Maldivian government sees the framework as an “important milestone” in defence and security cooperation between the Maldives and the US.Werner and Didi also discussed US support for the island nation in its response to Covid-19 and areas for future cooperation, and agreed to work toward scheduling the first Defense and Security Dialogue, the Pentagon said.Both sides reiterated their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that promotes the security and prosperity of all nations in the region, the Pentagon said. The Central Indo-Pacific includes the numerous seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans. The resource-rich Indo-Pacific region is where China has been trying to spread its influence. The US has also been pushing for a broader role by India in the strategically important region. China is eyeing to expand its influence in the Indian Ocean region. China has already taken control of Pakistan’s strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and with Japan in the East China Sea. Both the areas are said to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have overlapping claims in the waterway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-signs-defence-cooperation-deal-with-maldives-amid-china-s-growing-presence-in-indian-ocean/story-ZCktvP7yDQRLLNWPMU06QJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Istanbul introduces limits to gatherings as coronavirus spreads||The governor of Istanbul has banned boating companies from hosting weddings and similar gatherings as part of new measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 in Turkey’s most populous city.The governor’s office also reintroduced a ban on concerts and festivals in open spaces. A statement from the office late Friday said the restrictions were needed because people were not adequately heeding precautions like physical distancing and confirmed virus cases have increased.The bans were to go into effect on Saturday but were postponed until Monday.Coronavirus infections and deaths began increasing in Turkey after the government loosened restrictions on public activity in June, returning to levels last seen in mid-May.On Friday, the Health Ministry announced 56 more deaths and 1,671 new cases, bringing the country’s total death toll in the pandemic to 6,951 and cases to nearly 290,000.Officials have cited engagement parties and weddings as a key source for new infections and introduced restrictions on social gatherings. Some turned to holding celebrations on party boats that cruise Istanbul’s scenic Bosporus strait, which bisects the city of about 16 million.On Saturday, Turkish soccer team Besiktas announced that technical director Sergen Yalcin had tested positive for the coronavirus during a check ahead of the club’s next match.Besiktas is one of the top soccer teams in Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/istanbul-introduces-limits-to-gatherings-as-coronavirus-spreads/story-lvERK5KoPkyGboJKiCOyeJ.html
12-09-2020||World||US hospitals turn down remdesivir, limit use to sickest Covid-19 patients||US hospitals have turned down about a third of their allocated supplies of the Covid-19 drug remdesivir since July as need for the costly antiviral wanes, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed on Friday.Some hospitals said they are still buying the Gilead Sciences medicine to build inventory in case the pandemic accelerates over the winter. But they said current supplies are adequate, in part because they are limiting use to severely ill patients.The Food and Drug Administration has allowed more liberal remdesivir use, but 6 out of 8 major hospital systems contacted by Reuters said they were not using it for moderate cases.The slowdown suggests that a shortage of the drug is over and threatens Gilead’s efforts to expand use of remdesivir, which it sells under the brand name Veklury in some countries.An HHS spokesperson confirmed on Friday that between July 6 and September 8, state and territory public health systems accepted about 72% of the remdesivir they were offered. Hospitals in turn purchased only about two-thirds of what states and territories accepted, as previously detailed to Reuters by Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Gilead did not respond to a request for comment.A surplus of remdesivir - which costs $3,120 for a 6-vial intravenous course - marks a turnaround from earlier in the pandemic, when supplies of the drug had fallen short of demand in some regions.Government-led distribution of remdesivir will expire at the end of September. Hospitals said they have little information on availability after that. Remdesivir was first authorized by the FDA in May for emergency use in Covid-19 patients hospitalized and on oxygen support after data showed it helped shorten hospital recovery time.‘NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSED’The agency last month expanded use to hospitalized patients who do not require oxygen support, based on data published in the JAMA medical journal showing that the drug provided a modest benefit for those patients.The newer data has left many experts unconvinced.“I am not terribly impressed with the study,” said Dr. Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. He said he remains “skeptical” about using remdesivir in patients with moderate Covid-19, especially given the price.Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said his center has stayed focused on using remdesivir for the narrower population of seriously ill patients who need supplemental oxygen.“No one wants to be in a position of making treatment decisions based on drug availability,” he said.Houston Methodist Hospital is holding off on broader use of remdesivir, and instead is stockpiling it in case the pandemic flares up in winter - typically the peak season for respiratory illness.“At this point, we are buying far more than we are using because we are unsure about what will happen at the end of September,” said Katherine Perez, infectious disease pharmacist at Houston Methodist.There is no evidence that Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital for a day or two due to an underlying health issue, like diabetes or high blood pressure, would benefit from the drug, she added.Mark Sullivan, associate chief pharmacy officer at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University Hospitals & Clinics, said his institution also did not expand remdesivir use based on the newer JAMA data. “We have kept our treatment protocol the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hospitals-turn-down-remdesivir-limit-use-to-sickest-covid-19-patients/story-VnklaeD7sGaWk1drqGiQFL.html
12-09-2020||World||5 Indians who strayed across LAC were spies, says Chinese media ahead of their release||Five Indians who had strayed over the border in Arunachal Pradesh earlier this month and were detained by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were working for the Indian intelligence, a state media report said on Saturday, hours ahead of their release by the Chinese army.The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh went missing in early September.Union minister Kiren Rijiju and the Indian army have repeatedly said that the five were porters and worked for the armed forces to carry and transport goods for troops stationed in the Indian side of Line of Actual Control (LAC) or the McMahon Line in Upper Subansiri in Arunachal Pradesh, which separates it from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).On Saturday, Rijiju tweeted: “China’s PLA has handed over our five boys to our side here at Kibitu area. I appreciate Indian Army for the smooth return of our citizens. I thank Indian Army Chief, his office and the local Commanders for constantly following up the matter and regularly updating me on the matter.”The Hindustan Times has reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for details of the case.Ahead of their release, state-run nationalistic tabloid, Global Times claimed in a report that five were “spies” working for the Indian army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report said.“The Indian side often sends staff via this means to gather intelligence of China. This is how it encroaches China-controlled areas,” the report said, adding: “The Chinese side has detained, warned and educated the five persons, who will be released soon”.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet.“The Chinese side has detained, warned and educated the five persons, who will be released soon,” the report said.“China and India have a very long border and there are vast stretches that are unguarded. In recent years, India has taken an aggressive approach in China-India border areas, which poses a challenge for China to strengthen its border control,” it added. On September 7, when asked about the whereabouts of the five missing Indians, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: “China’s position on the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, or Zangnan--the southern part of China’s Xizang (Tibet), is consistent and clear. The Chinese government has never recognized the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally established on the Chinese territory. I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-indians-who-strayed-across-lac-were-spies-says-chinese-media-ahead-of-their-release/story-zG9nG4htXKdAyU4ZLE4qAJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Afghan peace talks open in Doha, 19 years after 9/11 triggered war||The opening ceremony for talks between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents began in Qatar’s capital Doha on Saturday, marking the start of negotiations aimed at ending two decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of combatants and civilians.The 19-year conflict is also the United States’ longest overseas military action, vexing three successive presidents.The ceremony began at 9 a.m. (0600 GMT) with a recitation from the Koran, followed by opening comments by Qatar’s foreign minister.Major players in the process, including Afghanistan’s peace council chairman Abdullah Abdullah and Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also scheduled to speak.Officials, diplomats and analysts say that although getting both sides to the negotiating table was an achievement, this does not mean the path to peace will be easy.“The negotiations will have to tackle a range of profound questions about the kind of country Afghans want,” Deborah Lyons, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, told the UN Security Council this month.The inauguration ceremony comes one day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.US forces intervened in Afghanistan on the orders of President George W. Bush a month after the attacks to hunt down their mastermind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who had been given sanctuary by the country’s radical Islamist Taliban rulers. They initially offered mainly air support to the Taliban’s local enemies.Although the Taliban regime was quickly toppled, they regrouped and have since waged an insurgency that has sucked in Afghanistan’s neighbours and troops from dozens of countries, including NATO forces.Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the United States and the Taliban in February in an attempt to find a political settlement to end the war.After months of delay, a dispute over the Taliban’s demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners was resolved this week.Ahead of the US presidential election in November, President Donald Trump is looking to show progress in his pledge to end the US involvement and pull out most of the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan.The United States has reduced its troop levels and by November is expected to have fewer than 5,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from about 13,000 when the US-Taliban deal was signed. More than 2,300 US troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 450 British soldiers.A European diplomat in Kabul said that a ceasefire - which the Taliban have so far rejected - should top the talk’s agenda.“The Taliban leaders will have to stop fighters from attacking Afghan forces and civilians, violence continues to degrade the atmosphere and potentially derail negotiations,” the diplomat said.How to include the Taliban, who reject the legitimacy of the Western-backed Afghan government, in any governing arrangement and how to safeguard the rights of women and minorities who suffered under Taliban rule are big challenges, experts said.Nevertheless many diplomats, victims of violence and members of civil society say negotiations are the only realistic way to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and hampered Afghanistan’s development, leaving millions in poverty.“Solutions will not be found on the battlefield, we know this,” Lyons said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-talks-open-in-doha-19-years-after-9-11-triggered-war/story-hXD4NmU0Nwc1XBWq5vK3EM.html
12-09-2020||World||Thousands left homeless by Greek refugee camp fire protest||Thousands of asylum-seekers have spent a fourth night sleeping in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos, after successive fires destroyed a notoriously overcrowded migrant and refugee camp during a coronavirus lockdown.Officials have said the Tuesday and Wednesday night blazes were deliberately set by some camp residents angered at quarantine and isolation orders imposed after 35 people in the Moria camp tested positive for Covid-19.With the camp gutted, Saturday morning found men, women and children sleeping under improvised shelters made of reed stalks, blankets and salvaged tents.Thousands gathered for a protest demanding to be allowed to leave the island, gathering on a road blocked by police buses. The demonstration was loud but peaceful, with mainly children and women at the front. Riot police observed nearby as protesters chanted slogans and held up improvised banners made of pieces of cardboard or sheets.“We need peace & freedom. Moria kills all lives,” read one.A few of the demonstrators wore masks in the tightly packed crowd of people who recently had lived in the camp, which had dozens of confirmed coronavirus cases before it burned down.Leaving the island would require a bending of European Union rules, under which asylum-seekers reaching Greece’s islands from Turkey must stay there until they are either granted refugee status or deported back to Turkey.The Moria camp was built to house around 2,750 people but was so overcrowded that this week’s fires left more than 12,000 in need of emergency shelter on Lesbos. The camp had long been held up by critics as a symbol of Europe’s failings in migration policy.Moria was put under a virus lockdown until mid-September after the first case confirmed there was identified in a Somali man who had been granted asylum and left for Athens but later returned to the camp.On Friday, 200,000 rapid-detection kits for the virus were flown to the island for an extensive testing drive that would include asylum-seekers and islanders.The World Health Organization said Greece had asked for the deployment of an emergency medical team. Two such teams, one from Belgium and one from Norway, were expected to arrive on Saturday and Monday.Authorities have said none of the camp’s residents — except for 406 unaccompanied teenagers and children — would be allowed to leave the island. The unaccompanied minors were flown to the Greek mainland on Wednesday, and several European countries have said they will take some of them in.Other countries have pledged assistance for a new camp to be built on Lesbos, a move neither local residents nor the former inhabitants of Moria want.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country has so far not offered to take in children from Moria, underlined his long-time hard line on migration in a video posted on Facebook Saturday.“Now, some migrants have set alight and destroyed the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos to create pressure so that they can get from Lesbos to the European mainland,” Kurz said. “And if we give way to this pressure, we risk making the same mistake as in 2015. We risk people getting up false hopes and setting off for Greece, the smuggling business flourishing and once again countless people drowning in the Mediterranean.”“What we want to and will do is help on the spot, so that humane supply and accommodation is ensured, so that people in the whole word can live in bearable conditions,” Kurz said.Soldiers have been setting up new tents to house about 3,000 people on a new nearby site, flown in by helicopter to avoid protests by local residents angered at the use of their island as a holding center for thousands of people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia arriving from nearby Turkey.Moria’s overcrowded squalor created tension both among the camp’s inhabitants and with locals, whose initially generally welcoming attitude during the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015 has waned over the years.Human Rights Watch said the Moria fires “highlight the failure of the European Union’s ‘hotspot approach’ ... which has led to the containment of thousands of people on the Greek islands.”“European leaders should share responsibility for the reception and support of asylum-seekers. Also, Greek authorities should ensure that respect for human rights is at the center of its response to this fire,” the rights group’s Eva Cosse said in a statement.Many of the asylum-seekers in Moria described life there as being worse than much of what they had endured on their long, often painful journeys toward what they hoped was a better life in Europe.“While in Africa, we walked from 7 p.m. till 5 a.m. in the morning to avoid the heat and the police. That was hard. But being here, stuck, I think is worse,” said Amados Iam, a 23-year-old from Mauritania. “I didn’t come all the way to stay here. (I) Want to leave Greece.”Iam arrived in Moria three months ago with his 19-year-old brother. Both have suffered severe stomach issues, and a doctor in the local hospital in Lesbos told them it was due to the poor living conditions, including bad quality water and food, in Moria, Iam said.The brothers left Mauritania in 2017, crossing north Africa on foot and then making their way by truck to Turkey. Drought had ruined their mother’s farm, so Iam couldn’t continue studying, and the brothers feared conscription or being killed by the various armed groups coming from Mali and roaming in the south and west of Mauritania, they said.All their paperwork had been completed but the brothers had heard nothing about the status of their asylum request, they said. Their intended destination was France or Belgium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-left-homeless-by-greek-refugee-camp-fire-protest/story-fTPFKFD4llTFu466DDUIPL.html
12-09-2020||World||Newsom calls for decarbonizing economy as fires ravage California||John Sykes built his life around his cabin in the dense woods of Northern California. He raised his two children there, expanded it and improved it over time and made it resilient to all kinds of disaster except fire.So when the winds started howling on Tuesday and the skies became so dark from smoke that he had to turn on his lights at midday, he didn’t hesitate to leave it all behind in an instant before any evacuation order.With the disaster two years ago in nearby Paradise, in which 85 people perished in the deadliest and most destructive fire in modern state history, still fresh on his mind, Sykes got his wife and a friend into his car and left with only a change of clothes each.“All I could do is look in the rear view mirror and see orange sky and a mushroom cloud and that told me it was hot and to keep going,” Sykes said on Friday. “It was a terrifying feeling.” Berry Creek was largely destroyed in what has become the deadliest fire of 2020, a year that has already shattered California records for the most area burned — more land than the state of Connecticut — and recorded the largest fire of all time in the state. Five of the top 10 biggest blazes in state history are still burning and fire season often gets worse in the fall.At least 10 people were killed, including Josiah Williams, 16, who couldn’t escape the flames.“He was alone, terrified and ran for his life,” his mother, Jessica Williams, told CBS13 Sacramento. “My son was a good, smart, caring young boy that died alone and it kills me thinking about what he was going through.” Neighbouring Oregon and Washington also have been besieged and air pollution is a major problem across the West. Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Friday said “dozens of people” are missing from the large wildfires that have burned across the state.California Governor Gavin Newsom toured the fire-ravaged region on Friday and strongly asserted that climate change was evident and pledged to redouble efforts to “decarbonise” the economy.“The debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes,” he said, citing the hottest August in state history, 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days, record-breaking temperatures, drought and millions of dead trees.The immediate good news, he said, was the weather was beginning to cooperate, with winds settling down and the possibility of modest rain.Bill Connelly, a Butte County supervisor, said about 90% of the homes had burned but most of the 6,000 people in that area got out.“It’s just as devastating as Paradise,” he said, referring to the town 10 miles (16 kilometers) away that had 26,000 residents when it was destroyed. “It would be worse than Paradise if there were that many people living there.” About 20 people were hospitalised with burns; others broke limbs in the panic to flee, Connelly said. Fire officials have estimated that more than 2,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed.Under heavy smoke, the search continued on Friday for 16 people missing in the rugged mountains 125 miles (200 kilometres) northeast of San Francisco.Berry Creek, which began as a stage coach stop during the California Gold Rush, was among the hardest hit communities.A bar, laundromat and two stores are gone. All that remained of a gas station were a pair of pumps and a sign listing prices. The school and volunteer fire station — with the engine still inside — were destroyed.“There was no fighting this fire,” Sykes said. “Those who tried to fight it are probably not here.” Most homes were reduced to smoldering piles of ash, twisted metal and blackened appliances, but others escaped unscathed. Chimneys poked from the rubble and burned out cars and pickup trucks dotted the landscape. Scorched utility poles and fallen wires lined the roads.Sykes, who became emotional several times describing his ordeal, said he has located all but two friends. Some dunked into ponds, others jumped into Lake Oroville, a massive reservoir, as hot debris rained down on them, he said.Sykes, a former logger and construction worker, had never evacuated his home during a fire before but said he was too old at 68 to stay put. Plus, he had to look after his wife Janet, the “love of my life,” and a close friend who has been ill and lived with them since her husband died six months ago.He didn’t want them to be trapped on the road leading out of town the way people had perished in Paradise.When they were 5 miles (8 kilometres) miles down the road heading to safety, a friend called to say that the home he left behind on Wood Smoke Way was burning.

12-09-2020||World||‘Alone, terrified and ran for his life’: Nine, including teen, dead in California fires; 19 missing||Smoke from massive wildfires that painted California skies orange was also helping crews corral the deadliest blaze of the year, but despite the progress there was concern that the death toll could mount as crews reach devastated areas.Nine people, including a 16-year-old boy, have been confirmed dead since lightning-caused fires that started weeks ago fused into a monster that largely destroyed Berry Creek, a tiny hamlet in the Sierra Nevada foothills northeast of San Francisco.Crews made progress Friday in chopping or bulldozing brush-free lines to control lne North Complex fire. In addition, gusting winds that whipped up the flames days earlier eased while smoke blocked out the sun and lowered previously scorching temperatures. Saturday’s high temperature was expected to top out at 80 degrees or less.Nearly 15,000 firefighters were battling 28 major wildfires across California, although 24 were sparked Thursday and quickly contained.The North Complex remained the deadliest this year, with nine confirmed deaths. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea had said 10 bodies were found but on Friday lowered the figure. Honea said remains found in a burned storage shed turned out to be from a resin model of a human skeleton that was used by an anthropology student.A search continued for 19 people who remained unaccounted for.More victims could be found when search-and-rescue teams join sheriff’s detectives in the rugged mountain area but firefighters said it was too dangerous to immediately begin work in some places.“Right now, the areas that we need to search are too hot,” Honea said.The sheriff said the victims included Josiah Williams, 16, of Berry Creek, who apparently died while trying to flee the flames in a vehicle.“He was alone, terrified and ran for his life,” his mother, Jessica Williams, told CBS13 Sacramento. “”My son was a good, smart, caring young boy that died alone and it kills me thinking about what he was going through.”The body of Millicent Catarancuic, 77, of Berry Creek was found by a car on Wednesday, and two other people who may have been associated with her were found in the same area, the sheriff said. He did not release their names.“We have information that those subjects were aware of the fire but chose not to immediately evacuate,” he said.Catarancuic’s nephew, Zygy Roe-Zurz, told the Reno Gazette Journal his family had been packed up and ready to leave before deciding to wait when it appeared the fire threat was easing. Then, it made an explosive run.“At the last minute they decided to stay,” Roe-Zurz said. “They decided they would wing it if they had to and that proved to be a really fatal mistake.”The couple lived in the home with his mother, Suzan Violet Zurz, a painter and former model, who remained missing, he said.This year already has seen shattered California records for the most area burned — more land than the state of Connecticut — and recorded the largest fire of all time in the state. Five of the top 10 biggest blazes in state history are still burning and fire season often gets worse in the fall. Some 4,000 homes and other buildings have been destroyed.In Berry Creek, most homes were reduced to smoldering piles of ash, twisted metal and blackened appliances, although some were unscathed. Chimneys poked from rubble and burned out cars and pickup trucks dotted the landscape. Scorched utility poles and fallen wires lined the roads.A bar, laundromat and two stores were gone. All that remained of a gas station were a pair of pumps and a sign listing prices. The school and volunteer fire station — with the engine still inside — were destroyed.John Sykes fled his cabin when the winds started howling Tuesday and the skies became so dark from smoke that he had to turn on his lights at midday. He, his wife and a friend left with only a change of clothes each.“All I could do is look in the rear view mirror and see orange sky and a mushroom cloud and that told me it was hot and to keep going,” Sykes said Friday. “It was a terrifying feeling.”“There was no fighting this fire,” he said. “Those who tried to fight it are probably not here.”California Gov. Gavin Newsom toured the fire-ravaged region Friday, strongly asserted that climate change was evident and pledged to redouble efforts to “decarbonize” the economy.“The debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes,” he said, citing the hottest August in state history, 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days, record-breaking temperatures, drought and millions of dead trees.Neighboring Oregon and Washington also have been besieged and air pollution is a major problem across the West. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Friday “dozens of people” are missing from the large wildfires that have burned across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alone-terrified-and-ran-for-his-life-nine-including-teen-dead-in-california-fires-19-missing/story-NfEYN73oLYINiA2BtXvtfK.html
12-09-2020||World||California governor pushing to speed up state’s effort to combat wildfires||California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing to speed up his state’s effort to fight climate change as wildfires rip through the region at a record pace and a 1,000-mile sheet of smoke drives air quality to dangerous levels.“This is a climate damn emergency. This is real,” Newsom said in a briefing Friday from a fire zone in Butte County, surrounded by charred trees shrouded in smoke.His comments came as air quality across the US West deteriorated in the wake of record-breaking wildfires that have consumed more than 3.1 million acres in California and 1.4 million acres in Washington and Oregon. Damage could top $50 billion, according to Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.And Oregon officials warn that the blazes may have claimed many lives, although they have not yet released a death count. In California, 20 people have died during the last month of relentless wildfires.“We are preparing for a mass fatality incident based on what we know and the number of structures that have been lost,” said Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. About 40,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and around 500,000 residents are under evacuation notice in the state.Newsom said the string of calamities striking the West Coast -- record heat waves, massive fires, smoke-filled skies blotting out the sun -- were exactly the kinds of problems long forecast by climate scientists, only they’re happening sooner than expected.He said he’d tasked the heads of the California Environmental Protection Agency and the natural resources agency with reviewing the state’s climate programs and finding a way to achieve 100% clean energy sooner than the current goal of 2045.“I think 2045’s too late,” Newsom said.The move, however, may garner pushback, as California’s aggressive push toward clean energy in recent years was partly to blame for blackouts during an August heatwave, the state’s first rolling outages in 20 years.The air quality index in Eugene, Oregon, neared the ceiling set by the US Environmental Protection Agency on Friday while Portland and Seattle had the worst air quality among major world cities, according to IQAir AirVisual pollution data.The gloom will last into the weekend before a Pacific storm bringing rain to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest and winds in Northern California may push the smoke eastward, according to the National Weather Service.While the weather system might move the smoke, there’s also the risk that winds could fan the fires further, especially over the Sierra Nevada mountains, said Hannah Chandler-Cooley, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento.Earlier this week, a wind storm prompted utilities in California and Oregon to proactively shut down power lines lest they be toppled by high winds and ignite new blazes. Utility PG&E Corp. said it found at least 52 instances of damage to its de-energized equipment from the wind storm.“The moisture is good for fire suppression, but the winds are not,” Chandler-Cooley said.​​There are no critical fire weather conditions present across the US and none forecast through the weekend, the US Storm Prediction Center said. However, low humidity in many areas of the West and high temperatures mean the risk of fire spreading will remain.The highest chances for rain will be in Oregon and Washington, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the US Weather Prediction Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-governor-pushing-to-speed-up-state-s-effort-to-combat-wildfires/story-z7SRh0vKrISi4gzwm7w09L.html
12-09-2020||World||China says Mars probe stable; no word on reusable spacecraft||China’s Mars probe Tianwen-1, which blasted into space in July, is now more than 15 million kilometers (9 million miles) from Earth en route to the red planet, the National Space Administration said Saturday.The administration said that Tianwen-1 was in stable condition, having completed its first mid-course orbital correction early last month. It will be about 195 million kilometers (118 million miles) from Earth when it arrives at Mars around February, having traveled 470 million kilometers (292 million miles) in all to get there.The administration, however, has yet to release information about a mysterious reusable experimental spacecraft that returned to Earth a week ago after a two-day flight.The spacecraft consists of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, and marks China’s most ambitious Mars mission yet as it seeks to join the United States in successfully landing a spacecraft on the planet. It was blasted into space aboard a Long March-5 on July 23 during a month when the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. also took advantage of a shortened distance between the planets to launch similar missions.China said the reusable spacecraft returned to its designated landing site last Sunday, calling the flight a breakthrough that will eventually provide convenient round-trip transport to space at a low cost. No other details on the mission or the configuration of the spacecraft have been released.That is also seen as an attempt to put China on the leading edge of space flight. The U.S. has for years been operating the secretive X-37B space plane that remains in orbit for months.China’s military-backed space program has developed rapidly since it became just the third country after Russia and the U.S. to put a man in space in 2003. Last year, China’s Chang’e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-mars-probe-stable-no-word-on-reusable-spacecraft/story-97K29WoQpOuTNO2wGR4heM.html
12-09-2020||World||Crackdown on journalists sparks criticism of Pakistan government||Pressure mounted on the Pakistani media on Friday after a journalist was reportedly arrested in Karachi for spreading hatred and maligning a state institution on social media. On the same day, sedition charges were filed against another journalist, in Jhelum.Bilal Farooqi, news editor at the English language daily The Express Tribune, was picked up by police from outside his home in Karachi on Friday, two days after a report was registered against him. He was released on Saturday morning on the personal bail of his lawyer Jibran Nasir. Bilal’s family confirmed that he has returned home.The journalist has been reporting on sectarian violence in the country.Tashfeen Farooqi, Bilal Farooqi’s wife, earlier told the media that her husband was taken away by the police from right outside their home. She reportedly said their landlord had asked Bilal to step out of the house with his identity card as the police were conducting a “survey” in the locality. “When he (Bilal) didn’t return, I went outside to find out what happened. Bilal wasn’t there. The landlord then told me the police took him away,” Tashfeen said, adding that according to the landlord, Bilal was driven away by two policemen accompanied by two men in plainclothes.Reports say that after a while, Tashfeen received a phone call from Bilal, who told her that he was being held at the Defence police station. Soon after, police officials visited Bilal’s residence and took possession of his mobile phone from his wife. Meanwhile, an FIR citing sedition charges against journalist Absar Alam was registered in Jhelum. Alam, a former chairman of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, was reportedly charged with using derogatory language against state institutions and personalities.Reacting to these two developments, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalist (PFUJ) said in a statement the government wants to suppress the media.PFUJ president Shehzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi said, “If both the fabricated and concocted cases are not withdrawn immediately, we will be left with the only option to call a strike and protest cross the country, which may harm the current government and tarnish the image of the country just because of ill-conceived ideas of the decision-makers.”Last week, Sajid Gondal, a joint director at the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, had gone missing and returned home five days later. Gondal is believed to have helped with a news story investigating the assets of Lt Gen (retd) Saleem Bajwa, the chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority and an information aide to Prime Minister Imran Khan.In July, Matiullah Jan, a journalist known for his criticism of the military establishment, was reportedly abducted from Islamabad in broad daylight. He returned home after several hours after the incident sparked a public outcry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crackdown-on-journalists-sparks-criticism-of-pakistan-government/story-dk47vacOKboJo5kfUUrhpI.html
12-09-2020||World||Changing Chinese positions on Ladakh||Although the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) under Commander-in-Chief Xi Jinping wants to expand the territorial map on the basis of Green Line defined by a 1959 map circulated by Prime Minister Chou En-Lai under leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese position on resolving the border issue with India has changed over the decades as per convenience of the ruler of Beijing.After Mao Zedong changed the facts on ground by building the Lhasa-Kashgar highway (number 219) through Aksai Chin in 1956, Prime Minister Chou En-Lai in 1960 offered his Indian counterpart Jawaharlal Nehru to resolve the border on “as it is where it is principle.” This meant that China was recognizing Indian sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh or North-East Frontier Agency as it was known then, while India would recognise Beijing’s claim to Aksai Chin south of Haji Langar pass. This was never accepted by India and was one of the most important reasons behind the Chinese aggression in 1962. Today, China is in adverse possession of more than 38,180 sq km of Indian land including 5180 sq km of Shaksgam valley gifted by Pakistan in 1963.ALSO WATCH | India, China formulate 5-point peace plan during Jaishankar & Wang Yi meet On February 14, 1979, then Vice Premier and later paramount leaders Deng Xiaoping met Foreign Minister (later Prime Minister) Atal Behari Vajpayee and offered a package deal for resolve the boundary issue. Deng said that Chinese were willing to make concessions on the eastern sector to India, while New Delhi should make similar concessions in the western sector. While the concessions were not specified, Deng said that the resolution of the border could be shelved to the next generation as long as both sides maintain a stable situation on the border. Deng reiterated this proposal in 1985 also.The Chinese position again took a radical turn after the 1986 Somdorong Chu incident in north Arunachal Pradesh. In 1987, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing told his Indian counterpart Secretary (East) A P Venkateswaran in New Delhi that China was looking for concessions both on eastern and western sectors in order to solve the boundary issue. Deng was the leader of China and Chairman of the all powerful Central Military Commission.Since then a plethora of agreements and protocols have been signed to maintain peace and tranquility on the 3488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. After the Special Representative dialogue was set up between India and China to resolve the boundary issue in 2005, 22 meetings have taken place between India’s National Security Advisor and Chinese State Councillor but the boundary issue has hardly moved towards resolution. China still calls Arunachal Pradesh South Tibet and India boundary in Ladakh claims all of Aksai Chin.While there is hope that the present stand-off between PLA and Indian Army may result in at least exchanging of maps in western sector so that each side knows the other’s positions and claims, the Chinese belligerence and deliberate provocation from Depsang to Pangong Tso this year does not augur well for peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/changing-chinese-positions-on-ladakh/story-TTgMelOWSwQfRvcWJUB0LJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Indian filmmaker Tamhane’s ‘The Disciple’ eyes success in Toronto||Mumbai-based film director Chaitanya Tamhane is currently in the first week of a mandatory quarantine in India after having retuned from Venice on Monday. That might be a small price to pay for being able to walk the red carpet at the Biennale as his 2020 feature film, The Disciple, premiered at the prestigious Italian film festival. In a year that’s been low-key for movies due to the coronavirus pandemic and related curbs, The Disciple is the only Indian selection at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Canada.In order to travel to Venice for the Biennale, Tamhane required “special exception” from the external affairs ministry. It was the first Indian film since Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding in 2001 to be selected in the competition category at Venice. With pandemic-related restrictions on non-essential travel to Canada in place, Tamhane will have to make do with only a ‘virtual visit’ to Toronto. He said in an interview, “It would have been great to present the film in person, but given this year and given the safety protocols that Toronto has in place, I totally want to respect that for my own safety and for the safety of others.”A contemplative exploration of the evolution of a Hindustani classical vocalist in Mumbai, The Disciple, which is in Marathi, is already being feted globally. The director said, “We’re so grateful and relieved that the film premiered at Venice and is now in Toronto. We’re just happy that even in this year, we could get a film out, and also, for us this is a great start. We couldn’t have asked for a better launch.”The film has also picked up the coveted FIPRESCI award, given by a jury from the International Federation of Film Critics, making it a rare occasion that an Indian film has become a prize-winner at a major festival in Europe.Tamhane took four years to complete the film, spending about half the time on research. “When I started out, I was fascinated with the anecdotes and the stories of eccentric geniuses and this idea of some secret knowledge and lost wisdom,” he said. The film’s cast comprises first-time actors, mostly trained classical exponents. It includes the exceptional performance of Aditya Modak, who plays the central role of Sharad Nerulkar, a young man torn between the ascetic sensibility required for his art and the pressures of reality and modernity. Casting non-professionals was a “very, very thorough” process for Tamhane. “You need to make sure they have screen presence and they have an intuition for acting because they ultimately they will be delivering scripted lines,” he said.The narrative of the meditative film is like a slow-burning flame spanning three time periods, as it tracks Nerulkar’s development over time. A striking feature of the movie is its incredible music, including the vocal art at its core, making it a work where sight and sound complement each other well.This is Tamhane’s first feature film since Court in 2014, and he was mentored by Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, winner of multiple Oscars for films such as Gravity and Roma. Cuaron is also the film’s executive producer, which for Tamhane was “almost too good to be true”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-filmmaker-tamhane-s-the-disciple-eyes-success-in-toronto/story-XwiYlINqkmx8dxQad7gSVL.html
12-09-2020||World||Taliban, Afghan government to restart peace talks: All you need to know||The Taliban and the Afghan government will resume talks on Saturday to bring stability in Afghanistan and try to end two decades of conflict in the country.The deal outlines a peace process which involves the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, reducing violence to ensure social stability in the nation, free close to 5,000 Taliban prisoners held by Afghan security forces and free 1,000 security personnel held by the Taliban.StakeholdersThe biggest stakeholders in these talks are the Afghan people. Their sentiments can be put into perspective in the words of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. “(Both sides must) deliver what the Afghan people are demanding -- a reconciled Afghanistan with a government that reflects a country that isn’t at war,” Pompeo said on Friday, according to Reuters.The Taliban and the Afghanistan government will surely differ on issues like women empowerment and education for all as the Taliban have made it clear that they would want a theocratic Islamic state which is contrary to what the Afghanistan constitution outlines.“The Taliban have always been clear about what they want and that is a pure Islamic government, which is incompatible with the current liberal democratic Islamic political order,” Nishank Motwani, deputy director at the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, told wire agency Agence France Presse.The 21-member team has women politician Raihana Azad and Fawzia Koofi, who recently survived an assassination attempt and along with Zalmay Khalilzad will negotiate how to protect minorities and women who are one of the prime stakeholders in this conversation.One of the unlikely stakeholders is US president Donald Trump under whose presidency the US has managed not to engage in war on foreign soil. Trump will look forward to keeping his election promise and ensure that US soldiers get to return home.ObjectivesThe talks will primarily aim to draw a timeline which will outline the withdrawal process of US troops, Nato soldiers and the private army men, according to the Council of Foreign Relations website.The discussions will also aim to ensure that the Afghanistan soil is not used for fostering terrorist groups. A UN report cited by the New York Times says that fighters from outfits like Al-Qaeda and terrorists from countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have found cover under the Taliban.Another primary objective will be to ensure that the ceasefire between Afghan forces and the Taliban terrorists continue. The intra-Afghan talks will also aim at making the Taliban recognise the achievements made by the democratic governments and to not bring back the reign of terror which was the norm when the nation was under the rule of the Taliban in the 1990s.Pompeo, US special representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, politicians from the Afghanistan government and Taliban forces will start talks aiming to restore peace and rule of law in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-delegation-and-afghan-government-to-start-peace-talks-all-you-need-to-know/story-Z6mEDU5qbjdQyk61U4ErAL.html
12-09-2020||World||About 8,800 unaccompanied children are expelled at US border||About 8,800 unaccompanied children have been quickly expelled from the United States along the Mexico border under a pandemic-related measure that effectively ended asylum, authorities said Friday.The Trump administration has expelled more than 159,000 people since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emergency order took effect in March, a figure that also includes more than 7,600 adults and children who crossed the border in families.The figures on children were reported for the first time in a declaration by Raul Ortiz, the Border Patrol’s deputy chief, as part of the administration’s appeal of an order to stop housing children in hotels.The administration “immediately” expelled most children and families to Mexico but more than 2,200 unaccompanied children and 600 people who came in families were held until flights could be arranged to return home, Ortiz said.The administration asked the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a ruling last week that found use of hotels skirted “fundamental humanitarian protections.”US District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles ruled that using hotels for long-term detention violated a two-decade-old settlement governing treatment of children in custody. She ordered border agencies to stop placing children in hotels by Tuesday.Justice Department attorneys argued that settlement doesn’t apply during the public health emergency and that hotels were appropriate.“While in these hotels, the government provides minors with supervision by specialists, recreation, amenities, and protective measures against Covid-19,” the attorneys wrote.Before the pandemic, unaccompanied children were sent to state-licensed shelters operated by the Department of Health and Human Services and often released to family members while seeking asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-8-800-unaccompanied-children-are-expelled-at-us-border/story-xr39CFIw2wS8qB01m6r0mJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Afghan peace talks to open in Doha, 19 years after 9/11 triggered war||Talks between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents start in Qatar’s capital Doha on Saturday with the goal of bringing an end to nearly two decades of a conflict that has laid waste to the country and killed tens of thousands of combatants and civilians.It is also the United States’ longest overseas military action, vexing three successive US presidents.Officials, diplomats and analysts say that although getting both sides to the negotiating table was an achievement in itself, it does not mean the path to peace will be easy.“The negotiations will have to tackle a range of profound questions about the kind of country Afghans want,” Deborah Lyons, the United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan, told the U.N Security Council this month.The talks open with an inauguration ceremony which will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It takes place a day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.U.S. forces intervened in Afghanistan on the orders of President George W. Bush a month after the attacks to hunt down their mastermind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who had been given sanctuary by the country’s radical Islamist Taliban rulers. They initially offered mainly air support to the Taliban’s local enemies.Although the Taliban regime was quickly toppled, they regrouped and have since waged an insurgency that has sucked in Afghanistan’s neighbours and troops from dozens of countries, including NATO forces.Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the United States and the Taliban in February in an attempt to find a political settlement to end the war.After months of delay, a dispute over the Taliban’s demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners was resolved this week.Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, President Donald Trump is also looking to show progress in his pledge to end the U.S. involvement and pull out most of the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan.The United States has reduced its troop levels and by November is expected to have less than 5,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from about 13,000 when the U.S.-Taliban deal was signed. More than 2,300 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 450 British soldiers.A European diplomat in Kabul said that a ceasefire - which the Taliban have so far rejected - should top the talk’s agenda.“The Taliban leaders will have to stop fighters from attacking Afghan forces and civilians, violence continues to degrade the atmosphere and potentially derail negotiations,” the diplomat said.How to include the Taliban, who reject the legitimacy of the Western-backed Afghan government, in any governing arrangement and how to safeguard the rights of women and minorities who suffered under Taliban rule are big challenges, experts said.Nevertheless many diplomats, victims of violence and members of civil society say negotiations are the only realistic way to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and hampered Afghanistan’s development, leaving millions in poverty.“Solutions will not be found on the battlefield, we know this,” Lyons said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-talks-to-open-in-doha-19-years-after-9-11-triggered-war/story-nkkgo7ekcy78qwnrE8D87O.html

12-09-2020||World||UN council members urge halt to Myanmar-Arakan Army fighting||A majority of UN Security Council members called for an immediate halt to fighting between Myanmar government forces and the Arakan Army guerrilla force following a closed council meeting on the latest situation in the southeast Asian nation. A joint statement from eight of the 15 council nations said the clashes in western Rakhine and Chin states are taking “a heavy toll” on local communities and risk escalating, and stressed that a halt to fighting is “even more urgent in light of the increased number of Covid-19 cases in Rakhine State.” The government has been embroiled for more than a year in an intermittent conflict with the well-trained and well-armed Arakan Army representing members of the area’s Rakhine ethnic group. The guerrilla force is posing the strongest military challenge to the central government of the many ethnic minority groups who for decades have sought greater autonomy. Human rights advocates have accused Myanmar’s army of using undue force and targeting civilians in their operations fighting the guerrillas. The fighting is continuing as an upsurge in coronavirus cases that began in August in Rakhine has since spread to other parts of the country. Myanmar on Friday re-imposed its toughest measures so far to control the spread of Covid-19, banning travel out of the country’s biggest city, Yangon, and grounding all domestic flights until October 1. Addressing the situation in Rakhine more broadly, the eight countries called on Myanmar to accelerate its efforts to address the long-term causes of the crisis that led more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh over three years ago “because of violence perpetrated by the Myanmar military.” Myanmar has long claimed the Rohingya are “Bengali” migrants from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. The eight countries — United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Dominican Republic and Tunisia — encouraged Myanmar to set out “a transparent and credible plan” to implement recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission, and the Independent Commission of Enquiry. The Rakhine Commission, headed by the late former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, called on Myanmar before the August 2017 attacks began to grant citizenship and ensure other rights to the Rohingya, and urged the government to promote investment and community-directed growth to alleviate poverty in Rakhine. The Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by Myanmar’s government, concluded in January 2020 that there are reasons to believe security forces committed war crimes in counterinsurgency operations that forced Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh but said there is no evidence supporting genocide. The eight council nations noted that Myanmar is required, under a ruling that same month by the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ top court, to do all it can to prevent genocide against the Rohingya people. Calling themselves “committed supporters of Myanmar’s democratic transition,” the eight council members said they recognized efforts made by its government on democratization and called Nov. 8 elections “an important milestone in Myanmar’s transition, which the international community has supported with funding and technical expertise.” “We underline the importance of ensuring individuals of all communities, including Rohingya, are able to participate safely, fully, and equally in credible and inclusive elections,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-council-members-urge-halt-to-myanmar-arakan-army-fighting/story-vkyeHbjz0yfL8GQ7SXYv1J.html

France recorded close to 10,000 cases on Thursday, the most since the lockdown ended in May. Spain, which has the most cases in Europe, reported 4,708 new infections over 24 hours, the most since mid-April. Macron said his government has important decisions to make to contain the disease, which is circulating actively in major cities including Marseille and Lyon. The uptick led to Europe surpassing the US in daily cases and making it a global hot spot again.UK city tightens curbs Authorities in Birmingham announced new coronavirus restrictions on Friday as the UK’s viral reproduction rate, or ‘R’ number, exceeded 1.0 for the first time since March.From next Tuesday, more than 1.1 million people will be banned from mixing with any other household, after the rate of infection in Birmingham rose from 30 to 75 cases per 100,000 people over a week in August.US: North Korea issues shoot-to-kill ordersNorth Korea has issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the virus from entering the country from China, according to the commander of US forces in South Korea.The North has not confirmed a single case of the disease that has swept the world since first emerging in China. Pyongyang closed its border with China in January.US Forces Korea commander Robert Abrams said that the border shutdown had increased demand for smuggled goods, prompting authorities to intervene.

12-09-2020||World||US marks 9/11 anniversary at tributes shadowed by virus||Americans commemorated 9/11 Friday as another national crisis reconfigured memorial ceremonies, dividing some victims’ families over coronavirus safety precautions, and a presidential campaign carved a path through the observances.In New York, victims’ relatives gathered Friday morning for split-screen remembrances at the World Trade Center’s Sept. 11 memorial plaza and on a nearby corner, set up by separate organizations.Standing on the plaza, with its serene waterfall pools and groves of trees, Jin Hee Cho said she couldn’t erase the memory of the death of her younger sister, Kyung, in the collapse of the trade center’s north tower.“It’s just hard to delete that in my mind. I understand there’s all this, and I understand now that we have even COVID,“ said Cho, 55. ”But I only feel the loss, the devastating loss of my flesh-and-blood sister.”Around the country, some communities canceled 9/11 ceremonies, while others went ahead, sometimes with modifications. The Pentagon’s observance was so restricted that not even victims’ families could attend, though small groups could visit its memorial later in the day.On an anniversary that fell less than two months before the presidential election, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden both headed for the Flight 93 National Memorial in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania — at different times of day. Biden also attended the ceremony at ground zero in New York, exchanging an elbow bump with Vice President Mike Pence before the observance began.In short, the 19th anniversary of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil was a complicated occasion in a maelstrom of a year, as the U.S. grapples with a pandemic, searches its soul over racial injustice and prepares to choose a leader to chart a path forward.Still, families say it’s important for the nation to pause and remember the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the trade center, at the Pentagon outside Washington and in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 11, 2001 — shaping American policy, perceptions of safety and daily life in places from airports to office buildings.“People could say, ‘Oh, 19 years.’ But I’ll always be doing something this day. It’s history,” said Annemarie D’Emic, who lost her brother Charles Heeran, a stock trader. She went to the alternative ceremony in New York, which kept up the longstanding tradition of in-person readers.Speaking at the Pennsylvania memorial, Trump recalled how the plane’s crew and passengers tried to storm the cockpit as the hijackers as headed for Washington.“The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall, and fight back,” the Republican president said.Biden visited the memorial later Friday, laid a wreath and greeted relatives of one of the slain crew members, First Officer LeRoy Homer.At the Sept. 11 memorial in New York hours earlier, Biden offered condolences to victims’ relatives including Amanda Barreto, 27, who lost her aunt and godmother in the attacks. She said Biden “wanted to let me know to keep the faith” and told her he understood what it meant to lose a loved one. His first wife and their daughter died in a car crash, and his son Beau died of brain cancer.Biden didn’t speak at the ceremony, which has a longstanding custom of not allowing politicians to make remarks.Pence went on to the separate ceremony, organized by the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, where he read the Bible’s 23rd Psalm. His wife, Karen, read a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes.“For the families of the lost and friends they left behind, I pray these ancient words will comfort your heart and others,” said the vice president, drawing applause from the audience of roughly 200.Formed in honor of a firefighter killed on 9/11, the foundation felt in-person readers were crucial to the ceremony’s emotional impact and could recite names while keeping a safe distance. By contrast, recorded names emanated from speakers placed around the memorial plaza. Leaders said they wanted to keep readers and listeners from clustering at a stage.As in past years on the plaza, many readers at the alternative ceremony added poignant tributes to their loved ones’ character and heroism, urged the nation not to forget the attacks and recounted missed family milestones: “How I wish you could walk me down the aisle in just three weeks,” Kaitlyn Strada said of her father, Thomas, a bond broker.One reader thanked essential workers for helping New York City endure the pandemic, which has killed at least 24,000 people in the city and over 190,000 nationwide. Another reader, Catherine Hernandez, said she became a police officer to honor her family’s loss.Other victims’ relatives, however, weren’t bothered by the switch to a recording at the ground zero ceremony.“I think it should evolve. It can’t just stay the same forever,” said Frank Dominguez, who lost his brother, Police Officer Jerome Dominguez.The Sept. 11 memorial and the Tunnel to Towers foundation also tussled over the Tribute in Light, a pair of powerful beams that shine into the night sky near the trade center, evoking its fallen twin towers. The 9/11 memorial initially canceled the display, citing virus safety concerns for the installation crew. After the foundation vowed to put up the lights instead, the memorial changed course with help from its chair, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Tunnel to Towers, meanwhile, arranged to display single beams for the first time at the Shanksville memorial and the Pentagon.Over the years, the anniversary also has become a day for volunteering. Because of the pandemic, the 9/11 National Day of Service and Remembrance organization is encouraging people this year to make donations or take other actions from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-marks-9-11-anniversary-at-tributes-shadowed-by-virus/story-DNnLAnkqKV3ZAiVV3bDspJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Warring Afghans meet to find peace after decades of war||Afghanistan’s warring sides started negotiations for the first time, bringing together the Taliban and delegates appointed by the Afghan government Saturday for historic meetings aimed at ending decades of war.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the opening ceremony in Qatar, where the meetings are taking place and where the Taliban maintain a political office. The start of negotiations was the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity by the Trump administration ahead of the US presidential election in November.“Each of you carry a great responsibility,” Pompeo told the participants. “You have an opportunity to overcome your divisions.”While Saturday’s opening was about ceremony, the hard negotiations will be held behind closed doors. There the sides will be tackling tough issues. This includes the terms of a permanent cease-fire, the rights of women and minorities, and the disarming of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and militias loyal to warlords, some of them aligned with the government.The Afghan sides are also expected to discuss constitutional changes and power sharing during the talks in Qatar’s capital of Doha.Even seemingly mundane issues like the flag and the name of the country - the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or as the Taliban’s administration was known when it ruled, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan —- could find their way onto the negotiation table and roil tempers.Among the government-appointed negotiators are four women, who vowed to preserve women’s rights in any power-sharing deal with the hard-line Taliban. This includes the right to work, education and participation in political life, all denied women when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan for five years.The Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harboring Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America.No women are on the Taliban’s negotiation team, led by their chief justice Abdul Hakim. The insurgent movement has said it accepted a woman’s right to work, go to school and participate in politics but would not accept a woman president or chief justice.Deeply conservative members of the government-named High Council for National Reconciliation, which is overseeing the talks, also hold that women can not serve in either post.At the opening ceremonies, there was some sign of Taliban changes in attitudes. Several Taliban jostled to to take photographs of leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar as he addressed the ceremony. Photography was banned during the Taliban rule as against Islam.Baradar said the Taliban envisioned an Islamic system that embraces all Afghans, without elaborating. He also urged patience as the negotiations proceeded, urging both sides to stick with the talks even in the face of problems.“The negotiation process may have problems, but the request is that the negotiations move forward with a lot of patience, with a lot of attention, and it should be continued with such kind of attention,” he said. “We want to give them (people of Afghanistan) this assurance that with full honesty we continue the Afghan peace negotiation, and we try for peace and tranquility, we will pave the ground in Afghanistan.”Abdullah Abdullah, who heads Kabul’s High Council for National Reconciliation, said in his remarks that the sides do not need to agree on every detail, but should announce a humanitarian cease-fire.Both sides will be “peace heroes” if negotiations bring about a lasting peace that protects Afghanistan’s independence and leads to a system based on Islamic principles that preserves the rights of all people, said Abdullaah..Pompeo warned that their decisions and conduct will affect both the size and conduct of U.S. assistance.He encouraged the negotiators to respect Afghanistan’s rich diversity, including women and ethnic and religious minorities. He said that while the choice of Afghanistan’s political system is theirs to make, the U.S. has found that democracy and rotation of political power works best.“I can only urge these actions. You will write the next chapter of Afghan history,” he said.Pompeo spoke the day after the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. He said the U.S. will never forget the 9/11, and that America welcomes the Taliban commitment not to host terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, which was responsible for the carnage.The intra-Afghan negotiations were laid out in a peace deal Washington signed with the Taliban on Feb. 29. At that time the deal was touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in 40 years of war.Yet Abdullah noted that since that agreement was reached, 1,200 people have been killed and more than 15,000 wounded in attacks across the country. The United Nations has urged a reduction of violence and criticized civilian casualties on both sides.The current talks had been originally expected to begin within weeks of the signed agreement between the Taliban and the US.But delays disrupted the timeline. The Afghan government balked at releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which was stipulated in the deal as a sign of good faith ahead of the negotiations. The Taliban were required to release 1,000 government and military personnel in their custody.Political turmoil in Kabul further delayed talks as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival in controversial presidential polls the year before, Abdullah Abdullah, squabbled over who won, with both declaring victory.The Taliban refusal to reduce the violence further hindered the start of talks.Still the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan does not hinge on the success of the talks.Washington’s withdrawal is contingent on the Taliban honoring commitments to fight terrorist groups, in particular the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, and ensure that Afghanistan cannot again be used to attack America or its allies.The U.S. has refused to give specific of the guarantees citing security reasons, but the withdrawal of U.S. troops has already begun. President Donald Trump has said that by November, about 4,000 soldiers will be in Afghanistan, down from 13,000 when the deal was signed in February.“Washington’s goals are very simple: It wants intra-Afghan talks happening as soon as possible, because these give the White House political cover for an imminent withdrawal,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Washington-based Wilson Center’s Asia program.“Trump likely wants a peace deal before the election, so that he can garner political benefits galore and pitch himself as a Nobel Peace Prize candidate. But presumably even he realizes it’s wildly unrealistic to expect a deal so soon. These types of negotiations tend to be measured in years, not weeks.”The talks in Doha follow the Trump administration-brokered recognition of Israel by two Gulf Arab nations - Bahrain on Friday and the United Arab Emirates in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warring-afghans-meet-to-find-peace-after-decades-of-war/story-XkcWK7v1cqiQkuQ6xeWkEJ.html
12-09-2020||India||Nitish, Nadda hold Bihar seat talks||Seat-sharing talks between ruling alliance partners Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began on Saturday for the upcoming Bihar elections due in October-November, according to functionaries aware of the developments.A delegation led by BJP president JP Nadda interacted with Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the JD(U) national president, at the CM’s official residence in a meeting that lasted 45 minutes.  The BJP team comprised its Bihar election incharge, Bhupendra Yadav, and deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, among others, according to officials aware of the matter. Later in the day, Nadda reiterated that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) too is a part, will fight the elections “unitedly”. His remarks came against the backdrop of a growing buzz on perceived differences between the JD(U) and the LJP.“People of Bihar have already made up their mind. Now, we have to decide how we are going to change Bihar,” Nadda said. According to NDA functionaries, CM Kumar voiced his displeasure at statements by the LJP president Chirag Paswan, who has been critical of the JD(U) of late, during his meeting with Nadda. A BJP leader, who did not want to be named, said it was just an “initial round of talks” and that the final formula will be worked out after discussions with the LJP, which was not part of Saturday’s dialogue. “We want a respectable accommodation,” said a LJP leader, requesting anonymity.In 2015, the JD(U) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) contested the elections together on 101 seats each as part of the opposition grand alliance. Their partner, the Congress contested, 41 seats in 243-member assembly.On the other hand, the BJP contested 157 seats, LJP 42 seats, and Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) 21 seats. The HAM, which later severed ties with the NDA, recently made a comeback.“The alliance of BJP-JD (U)-LJP and HAM-S is very strong,” Sushil Modi said on Saturday.Meanwhile, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren met RJD president Lalu Prasad in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi on Saturday and said they will fight the Bihar polls together. Soren spent more than an hour with Prasad at RIMS Director’s bungalow, where the RJD leader is staying. The RJD is a partner in the coalition government headed by Soren in Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-nadda-hold-bihar-seat-talks/story-h3f0KL4xB5VHQK6z4UF5qN.html
12-09-2020||India||Bhushan seeks right to appeal in contempt ruling||There is a chance of “arbitrary, vengeful, and high-handed decisions” in contempt cases where the apex court is the aggrieved party, but also the “prosecutor, the witness, and the judge,” raising the fear of bias, lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan said in a plea filed Saturday, seeking the right of appeal for himself and for others convicted in original contempt cases. Bhushan was convicted and on August 31 fined Re 1 for his tweets against the judiciary which were deemed contempt by the apex court. The plea, filed by lawyer Kamini Jaiswal , sought that a person thus convicted could appeal and be heard by a “larger and different” bench of the court. While Bhushan has said the right to appeal against conviction somes under Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty), and that it flows from the principle of natural justice, the procedural change being sought will also pave the way for him to appeal his conviction in the contempt case. Original criminal contempt cases are those which are heard directly by the Supreme Court in the first instance. In such cases, if a person is convicted, he or she is left with no further remedy as the Supreme Court is the highest court in the country.Bhushan has prayed that in such a case, the convicted person should get the right to an intra-court appeal, i.e. a larger bench of the Supreme Court — different from the bench which convicted the concerned person — should hear an appeal against such a conviction.“The right to appeal against conviction in original criminal cases is a substantive right under Article 21 and flows from principles of natural justice. The absence of such a right thus violates (right to life under) Article 21,” the plea said.Moreover, contempt proceedings are one in which the injured party is the Supreme Court itself and it acts as the prosecutor, the witness and the judge, thereby raising fear of inherent bias, the petition said. Thus, there is a need for intra-court appeal, it added.If an intra-court appeal cannot be allowed, review petitions filed against orders of conviction by Supreme Court in original criminal contempt cases should be heard in open court by a different bench, Bhushan prayed.The Supreme Court recently held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his tweets criticising the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. The court had on August 31 imposed a token fine of Re 1 as a punishment.Another contempt case against Bhushan, initiated by the top court in 2009 for his remarks that some past Chief Justices of India were corrupt, is also pending before the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-seeks-right-to-appeal-in-contempt-ruling/story-57TS3V2rhPNvaUfQhM2vOO.html
12-09-2020||India||DGCA warns of ban for photography||Mumbai: An airline’s service on a particular route can be banned for two weeks if it fails to act against crew or passengers in case someone violates rules such as the ban on photography mid-air, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) said on Saturday as it took note of an incident on an IndiGo Airlines flight where members of the media began video recording mid air.The flight on which the violations occurred took off on September 9 and had among its passengers actor Kangana Ranaut, who has recently been in the middle of a public spat with the Maharashtra government. Crews of several TV channels followed the actor on the Chandigarh-Mumbai flight and were seen jostling for her attention while still in the cabin once the aircraft landed at its destination.Shortly after the incident, the DGCA sought a report from the airline, which on Friday said the passengers did not obey their cabin and cockpit crew who repeatedly requested them to maintain social distancing and switch off video recordings.“As per rule 13 of the Aircraft Rules 1937, no person shall take, or cause or permit to be taken, at a government aerodrome of from an aircraft in flight, any photograph except in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of a permission... This permission is, however, not applicable when such aircraft is landing, taking off or on ground at a defence aerodrome. In spite of these regulations, it has been noted that at times, airlines have failed to follow these stipulations primarily because of lack of diligence on their part. Needless to say that such deviations result in compromise in maintaining the highest standards of safety and therefore, is not to be allowed,” said the DGCA order following the airline’s report. The order added that they have decided that in such violations on a scheduled passenger aircraft, the schedule of the flight for that particular route will be suspended for a period of two weeks from the next day and will be restored only after the airline has taken all the punitive action against those responsible for the violation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-warns-of-ban-for-photography/story-1BfidReWWC5Qudmqm9YXeO.html

Two days after the encounter, the Maoists released a press note and claimed that three of their cadres also got killed in the encounter.Also read: Jharkhand CM meets Lalu Yadav, says ‘will contest Bihar polls together’“On September 8, a joint operation was launched by Sukma police from Bheji and Elarmadgu camp towards Pentapad-Entapad jungle area based on an intelligence input about the presence of CPI Maoist cadres of Konta/Kistaram Area Committee. After the encounter, we recovered a few letters from the spot. The security forces, while translating one of the letters addressed to a senior cadre from South Bastar Division in Gondi dialect, learnt that the Maoists suffered huge casualties of 23 cadres during the Minpa encounter which took place on March 21, 2020. A couple of days after the encounter, the Maoists claimed through a press release that only three Maoists of PLGA Battalion No 01 were killed by security forces which was not correct,” IG Sunderaj told Hindustan Times. “We had information that around 30 Maoists were killed in the encounter and now the letter corroborated the fact. In order to keep up the morale of their lower cadres, Maoists normally don’t disclose the details about huge casualties they suffer during an encounter with the security forces. The police have gathered information in villages of Jagargunda and West Bastar Division area and learnt about the huge casualties suffered by Naxals in the Minpa encounter,” the IG said.The officer further stated that after the analysis of the recovered documents, it was revealed that the Maoists are experiencing tremendous hardship during Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown period. “They have an acute shortage of provisioning and supply network have been chocked due to 24×7 check posts of the security forces along the interstate and inter-district borders. Medicine and ration supply remains the main area of concern for the red guerrillas during this period,” the release stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-maoists-were-killed-in-minpa-encounter-which-took-place-in-march-bastar-police/story-zwedqUEqJPIqRKppIj0oCL.html

The five men from the Tagin tribe, who worked as porters for the army, were handed over at Kibithu after completing all formalities, officials said. “The individuals will now be quarantined for 14 days as per Covid-19 protocol and thereafter be handed over to their family members,” Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, a defence spokesperson based in Assam’s Tezpur ,said in a release.Arunachal chief minister Pema Khandu thanked the army and the Centre. “Absolutely glad to know that five of our Arunachali youths have been safely handed over to Indian Army by Chinese PLA. I am wholeheartedly thankful to the Govt of India and the Indian Army for their persistent effort in securing their return,” he posted on Twitter.The development came in the backdrop of simmering tensions between India and China with forces of the two countries locked in a face-off in eastern Ladakh over a border dispute.According to the army, this was the third such instance of people from Arunachal Pradesh living near the India-China border “straying inadvertently to the other side of line of actual control (LAC)” during “adventurous forays” this year.“Indian Army has always been proactive in tracing the lost locals and helping them return home. Three such incidents took place in the current year in Upper Subansiri and West Siang district including the latest one,” the army’s release said.“All such individuals were brought back home safely after consistent efforts and coordination by Indian Army in the past,” it added.In the latest incident, the five men — Tanu Bakar, Prasad Ringling, Ngaru Diri, Dongtu Ebiya and Toch Singkam — went missing on September 2, reportedly from Sera-7 in Upper Subansiri district on the Indian side of the McMahon line bifurcating Arunachal and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China.The brother of one of the missing men posted on social media that they had been “abducted” by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Similar accusations were made by Tapir Gao, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian from Arunachal East, and Ninong Ering, a Congress legislator from Pasighat, in their tweets.Responding to a hotline message sent by the Indian Army, PLA replied on Tuesday that the men were found on the Chinese side and their condition was fine.On Monday, China’s state-controlled Global Times tweeted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian as saying that the country “never recognized so called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’, which is China’s south Tibet region...”Family members of the five men thanked the army and officials of the Centre and the state government. “The release was arranged in a matter of a few days. I can’t thank the army, government officials and the PLA enough for their cooperation and goodwill gesture,” Reri Delak Bakar, the brother of Tanu Bakar, told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-hands-over-5-arunachal-men/story-FNvpdNjz5TIvhr1p4ymrYM.html

The conclave, which was attended by over 150 hospitals, was organised to share best practices and effective treatment strategies among government and private hospitals. The health ministry said that no Covid-19 patient must be denied admission and the treatment must be affordable and accessible to ensure that the mortality rate of the infection can be brought to below 1%. The ministry stressed the importance of timely treatment in co-morbid patients to reduce fatality. Hospitals were also asked to protect the healthcare workers by following infection control protocols. The ministry asked the hospital representatives to share their key concerns and challenges in management of Covid-19 in their facilities. The best practices shared included a tele-consultation session conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences through e-ICU and clinical rounds to enhance the clinical management capability of doctors across the countries. The government said that this along with various strategies for containment, prevention, and early identification has resulted in higher recoveries and a steadily declining mortality. Over 81,500 people recovered from the infection in 24-hours on Friday, according to data shared by the Union health ministry. Around 60% of these recoveries were reported from five states – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh – the same five states that have been adding to the total active cases in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/late-referrals-lack-of-insurance-key-concerns-for-pvt-hospitals-treating-covid-19-patients/story-nEHPY2OhT077tVaXRB604O.html

On Wednesday, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had said Rajput was an Indian actor, but the “BJP turned him into a Bihari actor” only to score electoral brownie points ahead of Bihar elections.“Rhea Chakraborty has been indicted not for abetment of suicide or murder or any economic offences; she has been arrested under NDPS, ludicrous,” he had said. Rhea's father is a former military officer, served the nation.

12-09-2020||India||Andhra govt hikes VAT on natural gas by 10% to offset revenue losses||The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday increased the Value Added Tax (VAT) on natural gas by 10 per cent with immediate effect on grounds of augmenting the revenue of the state. An order (GO No. 265) to this effect was issued by special chief secretary (commercial taxes) Rajat Bhargava. “The government has decided to increase the rate of tax on natural gas from 14.5% to 24.5% by revising the VAT rate under Schedule-V of the APVAT Act,” the order said. Apart from liquor, as many as five petroleum products – crude oil, natural gas, high speed diesel, petrol and aviation turbine fuel (ATF), are under the VAT purview, after the other items were subsumed in the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In July, the state government increased the cess on petrol from Rs 2.76 to Rs 4 (an increase of Rs 1.24 per litre), apart from VAT of 31% and on diesel from Rs 3.07 to Rs 4 (an increase of 93 paisa per litre), apart from a VAT of 22.25%, saying that the state’s own revenues had dried up due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the order, Bhargava explained in detail how the state government had been incurring huge expenditure on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, while continuing to implement flagship welfare schemes for various sections of people over the last few months. He said in April this year, the state had realised only Rs 1,323 crore through its own resources as against Rs 4,480 crore in April, 2019, which was 29.5% of the total expected revenue. Similar trends were also observed for May, June, July and August, 2020. He said the expenditure, on the other hand, had increased steeply on health services and welfare schemes such as Rythu Bharosa, Vahana Mithra, Jagananna Vidya Deevena, Jaganna Chedodu, Tele medicine, zero interest loan schemes to women, Amma Vodi and Nadu Nedu etc. “Considering the fact that the revenues of the state are plummeting on the one hand and the requirement for finances to implement the pro-poor schemes is escalating on the other hand, it has become imperative to augment the revenues of the state,” Bhargava said. Meanwhile, the chief minister’s office (CMO) clarified that the increase in VAT on natural gas from 14.5% to 24.5% has nothing to do with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which comes under GST purview with a tax rate of 5 per cent. “Natural gas is used as input in certain industries and in gas-based power projects. Though it is also used as domestic fuel as “piped natural gas” in certain areas of metro cities, the rate of tax on “piped natural gas” for domestic purposes is only 5% under VAT Act. The increased tax rate on natural gas is applicable only to the natural gas other than that used for domestic use,” the CMO clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-hikes-vat-on-natural-gas-by-10-to-offset-revenue-losses/story-hzWUf1Ov4tI3IK15i3issL.html

The minister also announced lifting of several austerity measures that had been enforced in April this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They include lifting of limit of 10 percent spending of establishment expenditures by departments, resumption of tax exemption granted to industries and spending of money from MLA development funds. However, several measures like ban on purchase of new vehicles, organising conferences, workshops and seminars, events in 5-star hotels, foreign visits by bureaucrats and ministers and 30 percent cut in salaries of ministers would remain.“I had met Union finance minister two days back and she assured new compensation formula for GST and release of revenue deficit grant. This will enhance the state government’s spending capacity. We are in a much comfortable situation to go forward with commitments made in our budget,” the minister said.In recent weeks, Sarma has announced regularisation of services of 46,000 teachers, several sops for students, teachers and educational institutes; funds for religious bodies and a scheme to give Rs 830 per month to nearly 17 lakh families in the state. Assembly elections are due in Assam in April next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-announces-infrastructure-projects-worth-nearly-rs-12-000-crore/story-hHa1dNHyFQd9tEIURwYCGM.html

At this rate, we would have around 90,000 new Covid-19 cases by the end of September,” he told journalists in Guwahati. Assam has recorded 1,38,339 Covid-19 positive cases till Friday with 1,08,329 recoveries and 430 deaths. The state has a recovery rate of 78.3% and a fatality rate of 0.31%. “We have conducted over 27 lakh tests at the rate of nearly 80,000 tests per million. The doubling rate of total Covid-19 patients in the state at present is 30 days,” said Sarma. Assam has been recording around 2,500 fresh Covid-19 cases daily for the past two weeks with Kamrup Metropolitan district, which includes the state’s biggest city Guwahati, being the worst affected with around 500-600 cases daily. Amid worries about scarcity of hospital beds due to rise in the number of cases, Sarma said that the government hospitals have enough ICU units and beds to cope with the surge for this month and initiatives are being taken to ensure that there is no dearth of beds in the coming months. “Due to an increase in requirement of oxygen for serious patients, we are constructing oxygen tanks at four hospitals in the state where we can store the commodity for at least 15 days,” he said. The minister said that though the death count of those who died due to Covid-19 in the state is 430 at present, there have been many cases where people who were declared negative died a few days later. Sarma informed that there was no data yet on the exact number of such cases. “Till date we are recording deaths as per ICMR guidelines. If tomorrow, we are told to include recovered patients who died, we will have to include them as well in the list of Covid-19 deaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-likely-to-have-nearly-90-000-new-covid-19-cases-in-sept-himanta-biswa-sarma/story-DI4MZweyhdb9859Yz3ihDO.html

And since most officers are now functioning with reduced capacity, people have been asking us to deliver their meals,” Talekar said. Currently, dabbawalas who can reach south Mumbai area on their cycles are able to deliver food to offices, he said, adding that meals are being delivered in keeping with all Covid-19 safety norms.“We have been demanding financial assistance of Rs 5,000 per dabbawala from the state government, similar to what the construction workers had received,” Talekar said, adding that the proposal was discussed in the state cabinet and was still on paper.There are about 4,500 to 5,000 dabbawalas who deliver two lakh tiffins every day from suburban areas to the heart of the city. “Never before in the 130-year-old history of the tiffin services, has there been a six-month break. We ensure that office-goers get their meals on time and take the empty lunch boxes back to their homes,” he said. In the last six months, social organisations and volunteers have supported the association financially, because of which dabbawalas, who have been out of work, were given money and essentials during the lockdown period, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dabbawalas-urge-maharashtra-govt-to-permit-them-local-train-travel/story-LmIoF9lMPpKoFUMYLac75N.html

12-09-2020||India||Prashant Bhushan moves SC for intra-court appeal in criminal contempt cases||Advocate Prashant Bhushan approached the Supreme Court on Saturday praying that an additional legal remedy should be provided in those cases where people are convicted by the Supreme Court in original criminal contempt cases.Original criminal contempt cases are those which are heard directly by the Supreme Court in the first instance. In such cases, if a person is convicted, he or she is left with no further remedy as the Supreme Court is the highest court in the country.Bhushan has prayed that in such a case, the convicted person should be afforded the right to an intra-court appeal, i.e. a larger bench of the Supreme Court, different from the bench which convicted the concerned person, should hear an appeal against such conviction.Also read: Judges are now soft targets with advent of social media - Justice Ramana“The right to appeal against conviction in original criminal cases is a substantive right under Article 21 and flows from principles of natural justice. The absence of such a right thus violates (right to life under) Article 21,” the plea stated.Moreover, contempt proceedings are one wherein the injured party is the Supreme Court itself and it acts as the prosecutor, the witness and the judge, thereby raising fear of inherent bias. Thus, there is a need for intra-court appeal, the petition said.If an intra-court appeal cannot be allowed, then as an alternative, review petitions filed against orders of conviction by Supreme Court in original criminal contempt cases would be heard in open court by a different bench, Bhushan prayed.Also read: ‘Asking questions from govt constitutional right’ - Chirag Paswan demands President’s rule in MaharashtraThe Supreme Court had recently held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his tweets criticising the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde.

12-09-2020||India||NEET to be held on Sunday amid strict Covid-19 protocols||Over 15 lakh candidates are expected to appear in medical entrance exam NEET on Sunday which will be conducted amid strict precautions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA).In order to maintain social distancing, the NTA has increased the number of exam centres from originally-planned 2,546 to 3,843, while the number of candidates per room has been reduced from earlier 24 to 12.The crucial National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is a pen and paper based test unlike engineering entrance exam JEE, has already been deferred twice in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The exam was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26, and then to September 13.A total of 15.97 lakh candidates have registered for the exam.“For ensuring social distancing outside examination halls, a staggered entry and exit of candidates has been planned. Adequate arrangements have also been made outside examination centres to enable candidates stand with adequate social distancing while waiting,” a senior NTA official said.“Candidates have also been issued an advisory guiding them about the ‘dos and don’ts’ for proper social distancing. We have also written to states governments to extend support in local movement of the candidates so that they are able to reach their examination centres in time,” the official added.The testing agency has also changed centres for a few candidates this week in compliance with social distancing norms and Covid restrictions. However, the city of the exam centre hasn’t been changed for any candidate. Making hand sanitisers available at the entrance of the examination centre and inside the exam hall at all times, replacing the process of checking the admit cards of candidates with barcode readers, increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plans, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the NTA has taken.“While all the candidates will be asked to come to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they enter the centre, they will have to use the masks provided by the examination authority. “Each candidate will be offered a three-ply mask at the time of entry and are expected to wear the same during the examination in order to avoid any form of unfair means at the time of examination,” the official added.While the governments of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have assured students that they will provide them transportation, a group of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) alumni and students have launched a portal to provide transport facilities to exam centres for the candidates in need.The Metro Railway in Kolkata is planning to run special services for NEET candidates on September 13 to help them reach their examination centres.There has been a growing chorus for postponing the exams amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the exam amid a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, saying a “precious year” of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on.Several opposition leaders, including Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik, DMK president M K Stalin and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had also demanded that this, as well as JEE, be postponed.When the JEE exams were just a few days away, the issue had escalated into a full blown political battle with ministers from Rajasthan and Punjab (Congress), West Bengal (Trinamool Congress), Jharkhand (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), Maharashtra (Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena) seeking postponement of the exams “in a manner that achieved the twin objectives of ensuring that the academic year of the students is not wasted and their health and safety is not compromised”.They has filed a petition in the apex court to review its order of conducting JEE and NEET UG 2020 during the novel coronavirus crises. However, the plea was dismissed by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neet-to-be-held-on-sunday-amid-strict-covid-19-protocols/story-jviEeOwBdBwLyMiHWdQ9oN.html
12-09-2020||India||I think censorship shouldn’t be decided by an external body: Shweta||Actor Shweta Tripathi has always chosen to tread the path that many otherwise would not choose to venture into. Be it her breakout film Masaan in 2015 or the experimental film Haraamkhor in 2017, Tripathi’s choices have been lauded by the audiences and the critics. Moreover, the actor is an active participant in the city’s theatre circuit and her last production Timeloss, directed by Akarsh Khurana had a digital premier, too. “More than the medium, what is really important to me is the story - what we’re saying and who the character is,” she explains forms the crux of her choices.The actor adds that thanks to her initial films, she understood the parameters with which one should choose his/her scripts. “In my opinion, “pushing the envelope” means trying out something new. Showing the audience something they haven’t seen before. It doesn’t need to be complex, it could be anything from emotions to using environmentally friendly props and sets,” says the actor. We were in Benaras for the premiere.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who joined the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha, Qatar, via video conference, reiterated India’s support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process and sought an immediate ceasefire in the war-torn country. WATCH | What’s at stake for India in Taliban-Afghanistan govt talks: Explained Teams comprising representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban will come face-to-face for the first time on Monday for peace talks in Qatar’s capital for a negotiated settlement after nearly two decades of war. The talks were to have begun in March but were delayed by differences over the release of prisoners. ALSO READ | ‘Peace process must be led, owned and controlled by Afghans’:India on historic talks between Taliban and Afghanistan. Read full statement hereJaishankar, who joined the event at the invitation of Qatar’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Mohammad bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, said: “Our friendship with Afghanistan is strong and unshaken, we have always been good neighbours and will always be so. Our expectation is that the soil of Afghanistan should never be used for any anti-India activities.” The peace process, he said, has to address the violence in Afghanistan and the neighbourhood and also protect the interests of minorities and women. Jaishankar said, “It [the peace process] has to respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan. It should promote the values of human rights and democracy that can foster development. The interests of the minorities, women and vulnerable must be ensured. “And most important, the issue of violence across the country and its neighbourhood has to be effectively addressed. The rising levels of violence cannot be allowed to continue and, like others, we support an immediate, comprehensive ceasefire.” India, which is the region’s largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan, has watched a recent spike in violence and attacks on minorities such as Sikhs with growing concern. Since 2001, India has undertaken projects worth $3 billion in Afghanistan, including $1 billion pledged in 2016 under the “new development partnership” scheme for a period of five years. Jaishankar referred to India’s role in development aid and talked about the infrastructure created by the Indian partnership that spreads across all 34 provinces, “be it the Parliament house for the nation, transmission lines and hospitals in Kabul, the friendship dam in Herat, the Afghanistan national agricultural science and technology university in Kandahar”. “Equally impactful have been capacity building projects, scholarships and training of youth,” he said, adding that India has supplied more than a million tonnes of food grains in recent years. To address the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, India provided more than 15 tonnes of life-saving drugs and medical equipment and facilitated the travel of Afghan citizens to India for medical treatment. He added, “These are but examples of our deep commitment to the welfare, prosperity and stability of the Afghan nation, and today, these are the very objectives that bring us here to discuss peace and reconciliation. Our approach in that regard has always remained consistent – any peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.” A senior official delegation led by JP Singh, joint secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran) in the external affairs ministry, also participated in the inaugural ceremony in Doha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-process-must-ensure-afghanistan-s-soil-isn-t-used-for-anti-india-activities-jaishankar/story-rulM6PbZJYiLwsARoFR7VK.html

The actor is believed to apprise the governor of the situation before she leaves Mumbai on September 14. The meeting is scheduled at 4.30pm.The Bollywood actor drew the ire of the Shiv Sena after she compared Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir in one her tweets regarding Sushant Singh Rajput death investigation case. The actor allegedly received threats from Sena leaders following which she was accorded Y plus security. On September 9, she arrived in Mumbai amid tight security. On the same day, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation conducted a demolition drive at her Mumbai office, razing the portions which were ‘illegally’ built. The Maharashtra government has, however, distanced itself from the demolition drive and said the government had nothing to do with the BMC decision.Also Read: ‘Even if they try hard to scare me’, Kangana shares meme.

The party too took a jibe at the actor in its editorial on mouthpiece Saamana, saying several artists have achieved success in the industry due to talent and not religion. Artistes from all over the country are benefitting from the fruits of the foundation laid by Dadasaheb Phalke, the editorial said.“Those who come to Mumbai to try their luck in this industry first stay on the footpath and then shift to Juju, Pali Hill and Malabar Hill to build their bungalows.“All these people have always been grateful to the city and the state which allowed them to chase their dreams and make it big. They have never betrayed Mumbai but have also contributed to the growth of the city,” the Saamana said.“Many artistes have been awarded Bharat Ratna and also Nishan-e-Pakistan,” it noted.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-to-meet-maharashtra-guv-bs-koshyari-tomorrow/story-Jf9m2RkRvSo176qRM792KO.html
12-09-2020||India||‘Asking questions from govt constitutional right’: Chirag Paswan demands President’s rule in Maharashtra||Maharashtra is feeling the heat of Bihar polls as the death case of ‘Bihari’ boy Sushant Singh Rajput and “attack” on Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut for raising questions on the state government continues to generate political responses.Lok Janshakti Party national president Chirag Paswan has demanded the imposition of President’s Rule in Maharashtra claiming the law and order situation in the state is continuing to deteriorate. He said that demolition by BMC of Ranaut’s property was an act of vengeance.Speaking to ANI, Paswan said that he is concerned about Biharis residing in the state. “People are concerned about their safety. Maharashtra is built by everyone including Kangana,” the LJP leader said.“If people are targeted like this, and this is precisely what I demanded and think, then there is no option but to impose President’s rule in the state as people are afraid of the government,” said Paswan.He also alleged that Late Bala Saheb Thackeray’s acumen of satire without indulging in violence is lost on Shiv Sainiks.“The way North Indians are being targeted, the way Kangana was targeted because she asked a few questions, the way the ex-Naval officer was thrashed by alleged Shiv Sainiks because he forwarded a sketch is abhorrent. Late Bala Saheb Thackeray used to make beautiful sketches to express satire, tolerance level has gone down in his party members. Those who thrashed ex-Naval officer were let off in a few hours,” Paswan said.The LJP leader also stood firm behind Ranaut, claiming she was targeted by the state government. Chirag said that he believes it was the “death of democracy” if people are gagged from asking questions.In a democracy, people have the right to ask questions and Ranaut was targeted for doing the same, maintained Paswan.While avoiding any political statement on Bihar polls and keeping the cards close to his chest, Paswan did mention pulling up Bihar government and Chief Minister on various issues.“I too ask questions from my state government and Bihar Chief Minister. Every aware citizen should ask and the government is bound to respond. Constitution gives us the right to live, earn livelihood anywhere in the country,” Paswan said.When asked whether Ranaut’s support and Rajput’s death case is raked up for political gains, he said, “Kangana kaun sa chunaav lad rahi hai, (which election is Kangana contesting). She has been targeted for fighting for truth. She is straight forward and blunt. This is a fight for a Bihari boy. Why is Maharashtra government afraid of questions?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asking-questions-from-govt-constitutional-right-chirag-paswan-demands-president-s-rule-in-maharashtra/story-H7h90jnoFo54HyY5Dp6U3K.html

12-09-2020||India||Judges are now soft targets with advent of social media: Justice Ramana||Judges have become soft targets with the advent of social media and have been subject to relentless criticism and juicy gossip, Supreme Court judge, Justice NV Ramana said on Saturday.Justice Ramana, who is the second senior-most judge at the Supreme Court after Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, said judges have to be very circumspect when it comes to their social life since they have no platform to respond to criticism and can speak only through their judgments/ judicial work.“Judges are restrained from speaking out in their own defence. Today, judges have become soft target of criticism and especially with social media’s advent, judges have become subject to juicy gossip. There seems to be a misunderstanding that judges lead a life of luxury in their ivory towers. That is not true. Judges have to balance their social lives in order to be independent,” he said in his speech at the launch of a book authored by recently retired Supreme Court judge, Justice R Banumathi.CJI Bobde concurred with Justice Ramana’s views saying “Freedom of speech of judges is curtailed by the same laws and machinery that uphold the freedom for others who use it to criticise the judiciary and judges.”Justice Banumathi’s book titled ‘Judiciary, Judges and the Administration of Justice’ was released by CJI Bobde who handed over the first copy to Justice Ramana.Justice Ramana will take over as CJI from Justice Bobde on April 24, 2021 and will serve at the helm for nearly 1.5 years before he retires in August 2022.Last week, another Supreme Court judge, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had said that courts today are increasingly being asked to decide on political matters which are brought before it under the guise of public interest litigation and they face a lot of criticism due to the handling of such cases.Courts, he maintained, have limitations and have not been been tasked with the responsibility of running the system and cannot perform the role of the government. He, therefore, called for a constructive approach while criticizing the court and its judgments.“I do believe that we have adopted a Constitution where we have an elected government in power. Segregation of powers requires the judiciary to perform its role and executive to perform its role. Courts cannot be unelected governments,” Justice Kaul had said at a webinar organized by non-governmental organization, CAN Foundation.CJI Bobde on Saturday also said that due to the Covid-19 and the accompanying restrictions which led to shutdown of courts across the country since March, there will be a surge in pendency of cases and suggested mediation as one possible way to tackle the arrears.“There will be huge pendency of cases due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I don’t think there is a way out of it but only a way through it. I think it can be resolved through mediation. I am not suggesting that we should go for mediation in every case but I don’t think we can go about it in the usual way. We will have to put our minds together (to find a solution),” he said.The CJI also highlighted the significance of mental health during Covid-19 times saying the Supreme Court has come up with an initiative to provide mental health support and the secretary general will be making an announcement in this regard soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judges-are-now-soft-targets-with-advent-of-social-media-justice-ramana/story-5RPYNrnrtViyjZJhNmjinM.html

It is going to be formally launched by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on September 17.“Depending on the GPS location of the user, the mobile app will tell her whether her present location is safe. The department has geo-tagged all scenes of crime in their database. This feature will alert women when they could be in danger,” Deputy Inspector General of Police (Technical) G Pala Raju said.Also read: BSF finds cache of arms near Indo-Pak border in Punjab’s Ferozepur districtAnother unique feature of the AP Police Seva mobile app is “house monitoring”, which enables the police to keep a watch on one’s house when one goes on a holiday along with family members for a few days. “The individual can place a request on the mobile app to monitor his/her house when it is locked for a certain period. The police department will install a motion sensor at the residence of the person placing the request. If any unknown person tries to enter the house without prior intimation, it automatically triggers an alarm, alerting not only the local police but also the owner of the house via an SMS,” the DIG said.There is also another option for citizens in the rural and remote areas where there is no possibility of installing sensors or CCTV cameras. The citizen placing the request for house monitoring will be allotted a constable on duty who will patrol the area regularly, click pictures of the house and send the same to the citizen.The mobile app is also programmed to alert individuals whenever they are approaching black spots and accident-prone areas without even having to open the app while travelling, using the location of the user.In a first, the police department has also provided a facility in the mobile app for a fact-check of fake news, he said.The app has many other features such as a request for a background check of a probable employee or a probable tenant, filing a complaint, downloading an FIR, checking the challan status, applying for passport verification, obtaining no-objection certificates, getting real-time updates on the status of complaints to identifying missing persons, et cetera.“All the services are free of charge and there is no need for paying a single rupee to the department.

The panel, which comprises people from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhilai, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and the National Informatics Centre, is gearing up to present a concept plan to the Commission to enable a two-way transfer of vote and ballot in the next two months. The panel was set up four months ago, professor Rajat Moona, director, IIT Bhilai, and former chief of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, told Hindustan Times. Also Read: Busting fake news is Mamata Banerjee’s key battle strategy for 2021 polls“The tech advisory group is exploring a spectrum of options, including blockchain technology to enable remote voting,” said Moona. They have been holding regular meetings to address the issue. “We are hoping to demonstrate a prototype in the next two months, then the Commission will take a call.” However, many concerns will have to be addressed before virtual casting of votes can be implemented for elections, said sources. “The remote voting exercise is not only for academic purposes,” the source said. “The machines will have to be flexible and ensure privacy and security of the vote.” The source added that the group is advising the ECI’s IT division on various aspects such as electoral rolls and storing, as the elections’ dependence on technology increases. “The idea is that going forward, everything should have the backing of experts.” Also Read: Ahead of Bihar polls, EC declares timeline for advertising criminal recordsThe ECI has already conducted two webinars on the issue and is looking to conduct a third one on network and security later this month. There are a sizeable number of voters, such as migrant labourers and students, who will benefit from the move. “The question of remote voting came up when we talked about whether postal ballots can have a two-way transfer system,” said Moona. At present, postal ballots, meant for service voters such as army personnel who cannot travel for the elections, are sent electronically, but the reply is received via post. “There will be logistical challenges, but we are working on it,” Moona added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-s-tech-advisory-panel-to-assess-options-for-remote-voting/story-DmIfzwM1QTCHyM7lu8vf3J.html

The actor was provided with Y plus security as she reached Mumbai on September 9, after she complained of receiving threats from Shiv Sena following her comment comparing Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The actor’s mother, Asha Ranaut, thanked Union home minister Amit Shah for providing Kangana security, despite knowing that the family has Congress links. This triggered several speculations over Kangana joining politics.Union minister Ramdas Athawale has recently met the actor at her Mumbai residence and said BJP or his party RPI will welcome Kangana if she wants to join. But the actor harbours no political ambition, Atawale confirmed.Talking about politics, Kangana on Friday said Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray has been one of her “most favourite icons”. She also took a swipe at the Congress and party president Sonia Gandhi for Congress’s silence during the entire episode.Both Kangana and her sister Rangoli Chandel are vocal supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the actor had no plans to join politics, as she had tweeted in August, this year. From Congress, fortunately after Manikarnika even BJP offered me a ticket, I am obsessed with my work as an artist and never thought about politics so all the trolling that I get for supporting who I want to support as independent thinker need to stop 🙂🙏“This is to set the records straight for everyone who thinks I support Modi ji because I want to join politics, my grandfather has been congress MLA for consecutive 15 years,my family is so popular in politics back home that after Gangster almost every year I got offers from Congress,” she tweeted on August 15.“From Congress, fortunately after Manikarnika even BJP offered me a ticket, I am obsessed with my work as an artist and never thought about politics so all the trolling that I get for supporting who I want to support as independent thinker need to stop,” she wrote.In 2018, however, the actor was not averse to join politics. “Whenever I decide to take up the path, I will do so with utmost sophistication, dignity and full focus. If I have to be a national servant, I can’t have a family or kids, or an alternate career. A politician should be nothing more than a government servant,” she had said in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-kangana-ranaut-has-said-so-far-on-joining-politics/story-bKKazOdjybxlmXbLDglzlN.html

Union sports minister and BJP MP from Arunachal West Kiren Rijiju tweeted: “ All the 5 Indian youths from Arunachal Pradesh who were received at Kibithu by our Army from PLA are fit and fine. However, they will be quarantined for a specified period.” According to the army, this was the third such instance of youths from Arunachal Pradesh living near the Indo-China border straying inadvertently to the other side of line of actual control (LAC) during “adventurous forays”. “Indian Army has always been proactive in tracing the lost locals and helping them return home. Three such incidents took place in the current year in Upper Subansiri and West Siang district including the latest one,” the release said. “All such individuals were brought back home safely after consistent efforts and coordination by Indian Army in the past,” it added. The 5 youths from Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for Indian Army, had gone missing on September 2 reportedly from Sera-7 in Upper Subansiri district on the Indian side of the McMohan line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet autonomous region (TAR) of China.

Petrol rates have been cut by 22 paise a litre that brought down its retail price to Rs 81.86 in Delhi on Saturday.The difference in quantum of decline in pump prices of petrol and diesel is mainly because their rates are aligned with respective international benchmarks that often do not move synchronously, two executives working for different state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) said, requesting anonymity.Also Read: Oil climbs as US stock market strengthens, but heads for weekly lossState-run fuel retailers revise pump prices of auto fuels daily based on fluctuations in their international benchmark rates. India’s fuel retail market is dominated by three state-run OMCs – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL). They have almost 90% market share.Benchmark Brent crude fell $39.83 a barrel on Friday because of weak demand. It slipped below $40 a barrel for the first time since June 15. Reuters reported on Saturday that the US stock markets ended lower for a second week following several economic indicators that suggest a long and difficult recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.One of the executives cited above said the falling international oil prices also helped state-run OMCs in reducing retail prices of subsidised kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS).The retail selling price of PDS kerosene was reduced by Rs 0.69 per litre in Kolkata. There was a corresponding reduction in prices in other cities effectively from September 1, the executive said.Also Read: Oil prices edge up off three-month lows, but demand concerns persist“This decrease is due to a drop in product prices in the international market and the strengthening of the rupee-dollar exchange rate,” he said. With this revision, the retail price of PDS kerosene was reduced from Rs 28.66 per litre in August to Rs 27.97 in September in Kolkata, he added.Public sector oil companies revise kerosene rates every month.The rupee-dollar exchange rate has a significant bearing on domestic fuel rates as India imports more than 80% of crude oil it processes and pays in dollars. Every dollar per barrel drop in crude prices reduces India’s import bill by Rs 10,700 crore on an annual basis.According to the oil ministry’s data keeper, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, the exchange rate fell to Rs 73.35 a dollar on September 11 compared to Rs 74.77 on August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-cheaper-by-63-paise-as-global-oil-prices-fall/story-PUczZE1cOz5m6NSYvmYQlJ.html

The suspension would stay in place till the airline completes taking action against those violating these norms.“In case of any violation of Rule 13 of Aircraft Rules 1937 on any passenger aircraft, the schedule of flight for that particular route shall be suspended for two weeks from the next day,” the DGCA statement read. The rule cited by DGCA, deals with conditions of photography and videography on board commercial passenger flights.The aviation regulator added that despite these regulations, airlines have often failed to follow rules primarily due to lack of diligence on their part. “Needless to say that such deviations result in compromise in maintaining the highest standard of safety and therefore is not to be allowed,” the statement said.ALSO READ | DGCA seeks report from IndiGo for violating social distancing norms on a flight with Kangana Ranaut aboardThe new guideline comes soon after an incident on board an Indigo flight recently involving actor Kangana Ranaut who was travelling from Chandigarh to Mumbai on Wednesday.The DGCA has asked IndiGo to take “appropriate action” after the regulator found alleged violation of safety and social distancing protocols by the media on the airline’s Chandigarh-Mumbai flight that included Ranaut as a passenger.“We have seen some videos wherein mediapersons are standing too close to each other on board the 6E264 flight on Wednesday.

The Hyderabad-based firm said the data from the study on primates substantiate the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate.“Bharat Biotech proudly announces the animal study results of COVAXIN - These results demonstrate the protective efficacy in a live viral challenge model,” Bharat Biotech tweeted on Friday.Bharat Biotech has said in a release that it developed and assessed the protective efficacy and immunogenicity of an inactivated Sar-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) or Covaxin in rhesus macaques. Twenty macaques were divided into four groups of five animals each, it said.Also read | Want to enrol in a vaccine trial? Know your eligibility“One group was administered a placebo while three groups were immunised with three different vaccine candidates at 0 and 14 days. All the macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 14 days after the second dose. The protective response was observed with increasing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralising antibody titres from third week post-immunisation,” the drug company said.ALSO WATCH | Parliament during Covid-19: 50 officials test positive It added that viral clearance was observed from “bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal swab, throat swab, and lung tissues at 7 days post-infection in the vaccinated groups.”“No evidence of pneumonia was observed by histopathological examination in vaccinated groups, unlike the placebo group which showed features of interstitial pneumonia and localisation of viral antigen in the alveolar epithelium and macrophages by immunohistochemistry,” it added.“To summarize, the vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” it added.Bharat Biotech had received approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to conduct the Phase-II trials earlier this month. It had announced in June that it successfully developed Covaxin in collaboration with ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).The SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated in NIV, Pune and transferred to Bharat Biotech. The indigenous, inactivated vaccine candidate has been developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s high containment facility located in Genome Valley, Hyderabad.Covaxin is one of the frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. It is an “inactivated” vaccine — it works by injecting doses of the virus that have been killed aiming to prompt the body to build antibodies against it without the virus posing a threat.Each stage of a vaccine’s clinical trial tests its safety and ability to develop an effective immune response. Phase 1 focuses on determining safety and dosage in a small group of healthy participants, while Phase 2 looks at the vaccine’s effectiveness. Phase 3 looks into these aspects in a much larger population that would represent a wider demographic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/animal-trials-proved-efficacy-of-covaxin-india-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-says-bharat-biotech/story-72QgevKAshBqKZis6X45XN.html

Under the first option, states will not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation issues, but they will have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfall due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-fresh-opinion-on-the-gst-compensation-issue/story-X09yBdOHkfQZ0jIJcGwAYO.html

He is happy since he had never imagined that it would be possible to get his job back within five months of losing it during the Covid-19 lockdown.He is not only getting his job back but also has a red carpet welcome laid out by his employer, who has sent his representative to Rajput’s village with a van to bring him back to Gujarat with other workers who had returned to the village after the factory closed down during the nationwide lockdown announced by the central government on March 24 to fight the Covid 19 pandemic.“I worked in a rubber slipper factory located near Ahmedabad. After the factory closed down, the owner expressed inability to pay wages. With shattered dreams and meager savings, I travelled hundreds of kilometers along with other workers to reach home in mid-April. I feared I would never be able to earn decent money and improve the living standard of my family and provide quality education to my children,” said Rajput.Rajput and his friends from the factory got registered as MNREGA labourers back in the village. It helped them earn Rs 200 per day and the district administration used to supply rice, yet it was barely enough for the survival of the eight members in Rajput’s family.“I was earning Rs 1,200 per day in Ahmedabad as a skilled labourer; digging a pond or a canal drain hurt our dignity but for survival we continued with the menial job,” Rajput said.In the first week of September, I got a call from the factory owner and he told me that he was restarting manufacturing and we must return immediately. He also assured us to provide free housing facilities and food.Within a week, the representative of the factory arrived in the village with a taxi to take us back, he said.In Gorakhpur, the story of Motilal, a resident of Ahirauli village, is no different.He worked in a furniture manufacturing unit in Delhi.After the closure of the factory in March, he returned with the family to his native village.“Skilled in making household furniture, I worked in Delhi for the past eight years. The lockdown turned me jobless, and along with other workers from the Gorakhpur region, I returned to my village. With little savings, I was somehow managing the family. The supervisor of the factory arrived on Monday and assured us that the factory will not shut down and our wages will also be hiked. The trains are running full so he has booked flight tickets for us to Delhi,” Motilal said.Vikram Rajput and Motilal are not alone who are getting their work back.Also Read: Indian Railways to start 80 new special trains from today: Here’s the full listBundelkhand and Gorakhpur regions, known as land of migrants, are witnessing a similar story with the migrant workers being wooed back to their workplaces in cities. Interestingly, the factory owners, real estate businessmen, construction agencies are sending their representatives to convince the workers and arrange their return by road, rail and air.“The push and pull factors are driving the migrant workers again from the villages to the cities. The deprivation and fear of Covid pandemic had forced the workers to return to their villages.

In an order, a copy of which has been accessed by PTI, DCGI Dr V G Somani on Friday also directed Serum Institute of India (SII) to increase the safety monitoring of the subjects already vaccinated as part of the trial, and submit the plan and report. Somani also asked the firm to submit clearance from Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in the UK as well as in India to obtain clearance from his office (DCGI) prior to resumption of future recruitment in the trial.  The central drug regulator DCGI had issued a show-cause notice to SII on September 9 for not informing it about AstraZeneca pausing clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in other countries and also for not submitting casualty analysis of the “reported serious adverse events”. Following which the Pune-based firm, which has partnered with the British-Swedish biopharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford vaccine candidate, on Thursday said it is pausing the clinical trials in India. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said it had paused the trials because of ‘an unexplained illness’ in a participant in the study.  “We are reviewing the situation and pausing India trials till AstraZeneca restarts the trials,” SII said in a statement on Thursday.   According to the DCGI’s order issued on Friday, the SII in its reply stated that DSMB has noted no safety concerns from the Indian study (part 1-phase-2 study) with the first dose and seven days post vaccination safety data.  In its reply, SII also stated that DSMB further recommended “to pause further enrolment into the study until ongoing investigations of SAE reported in the UK study is completed and the sponsor and the UK DSMB are satisfied that it doesn’t pose any safety concerns”. “In the view of the above, I Dr V G Somani, Drugs Controller General of India, Central Licensing Authority, after careful examination of your reply and the recommendations of the DSMB in India, in exercise of the powers vested under Rule 30 of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, direct to you suspend any new recruitment in the phase 2 and 3 clinical trial till further orders,” the order read. “Increase the safety monitoring of the subjects already vaccinated with the vaccine under trial and submit the plan and report,” the order further stated. On August 2, the DCGI had granted permission to the Pune-based SII to conduct Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine candidate. AstraZeneca, the biopharmaceutical giant in a tie-up with the Oxford University to produce the vaccine, described the pause of trials as a “routine” one following what was “an unexplained illness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-ordered-to-suspend-recruitment-for-covid-19-vaccine-trials-report/story-xjhStVjriFkM1lCgGQ2W6O.html

The FIR, lodged on September 7, said around 1.30am on August 24, Salmani was near the Kishanpur area of Panipat, searching for water. When he knocked at a house, four people allegedly attacked him with sticks and bricks, dragged him to a nearby saw machine and chopped his right arm off with a chainsaw. They later dumped him near the railway track, the FIR added. However, a second FIR filed on September 7 alleged that Akhlaq sodomised a young boy on August 23 and his hand was cut off when he fell on nearby railway tracks while fleeing from the spot. Both the FIRs were filed on September 7 after he recorded his statement from a hospital bed at PGIMS, Rohtak, where police admitted him after spotting him on railway tracks on August 24.“An SIT under Panipat DSP Satish Vats has been formed to investigate both the cases and the police will soon contact Akhlaq to join the investigation,” said Chaudhary. When Salmani reached his home in Nanauta town of Saharanpur district on September 8, his family alleged he was attacked because of his religion. This sparked a political row with Saharanpur MP and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Fajlur Rehman, Samajwadi Party district president Rudrasen and Bhim Army district president Raj Gautam visiting Salmani’s home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-s-arm-hacked-in-haryana-sit-formed/story-zeGQIm5yLE6MO0pBimm81K.html
12-09-2020||India||Factory output contracts for fifth consecutive month||India’s factory output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) contracted by 10.4% on an annual basis in July, according to data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation. This is the fifth consecutive month of contraction in IIP. While the contraction is in keeping with a Reuters forecast, it is better than the projected figure (11.5%).On the brighter side, the data does show a sequential recovery in industrial activity over the previous months. Experts believe a sequential recovery will continue in the months of August and September, but that the lack of fiscal stimulus and dissipation of pent-up demand could generate headwinds to this process.Also read: Moody’s projects Indian economy to contract 11.5% this fiscalIndustrial activity in the month of July this year was lower than its last year levels in all categories. IIP is classified into two kinds of categories. Economic activity-based categories include mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and electricity. Usage-based categories include primary goods, intermediate goods, capital goods, infrastructure goods and consumer goods. The last category has a sub-classification of consumer durables and non-durables. A look at the usage-based categories suggests that both consumption and investment, the two crucial drivers of growth, continue to present a grim picture. While all sub-sectors continue to show a sequential improvement—this month’s numbers are better than previous months—the contraction in capital goods and consumer durables is still more than 20% on an annual basis.India’s industrial output suffered a contraction of 38% on an annual basis in the first quarter (April-June) of the current fiscal year. The overall GDP contracted by 23.9%.The government has said that the first quarter’s performance was because of the exogenous shock of the lockdown and the economy is in the process of staging a V-shaped recovery. A V-shape implies that economic activity will quickly come back to its normal levels after suffering a sharp fall.Also read: Govt considering series of measures to boost economyHigh frequency indicators which are available for the post-July period, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for August and Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) until last week, do support claims of a continuing sequential recovery. PMI manufacturing breached the threshold of 50 —a PMI value greater than 50 signifies expansion in economic activity—in August for the first time since April. NIBRI climbed to 77.4 in the week ending September 6, the highest since the lockdown was imposed on March 25. But other indicators such as consumption of petroleum products paint a different picture. According to data released by the petroleum ministry, consumption of petroleum products in the month of August was the lowest since April. The fall was driven by diesel consumption, suggesting a fall in goods transport.The July IIP numbers suggest that the ongoing sequential recovery might be losing momentum as the curve is straying from a V-shaped pattern.Experts attribute this to continuing local lockdowns. “The data also shows that the sharp recovery witnessed in the month of May and June is now becoming somewhat flattish. Part of the reason is local/partial/ weekend lockdown imposed in many parts of the country, often without much advance intimation”, said a note by Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India ratings and research. The recovery could be further jeopardised as number of cases continue to rise. A research note by Nomura warned that the pick-up in resumption of economic activity was being driven by a “lockdown fatigue”.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings, expects the to improve further in August and come close to zero in the month of September. “The critical sectors to be tracked would be auto in particular in the coming months which have shown some signs of a turnaround—based on pent up demand to an extent”, he added. Passenger vehicle sales improved by 14.1% on an annual basis in August, according to the Society for Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/factory-output-contracts-for-fifth-consecutive-month/story-t3ypNWEEwzc52FFsiWABVJ.html
12-09-2020||India||An agenda for India’s New Deal to fix the Covid-infected economy | Opinion||India’s battle with coronavirus is on, with daily spikes in infections threatening to cross the one lakh mark. With easing of lockdown restrictions, things have improved slightly on the economic front but we have a long way to go to even catch up with the February 2020 level that itself was well below par. The adverse impact of the virus on the Indian economy is writ large everywhere with the first quarter of current year GDP indicating the economy contracted by 23.9%. There is hardly any section of the population that has not faced severe contraction of income in their occupation. The spectre of millions of migrant workers, walking on foot with all their belongings, across the length and breadth of our country is still fresh in every Indian’s mind. The march of these millions and millions of uneducated, unskilled and poor migrant labourers to their homes brought out the true picture of poverty and misery prevalent in our country for decades.The question is what were we doing all these years in the name of governing the country and states. Why did we fail to educate and skill these millions all these years? Why did we fail to provide a decent and affordable health care system to all our people? Why does every citizen have to still run from pillar to post to get justice and has to constantly struggle to save his dignity? Why have we failed to provide to millions even a decent dwelling with basic civic amenities? Where are the jobs for crores of our people who want to work and earn their livelihood.The time has come to rectify the mistakes of the past and build a strong and prosperous India. The pandemic has given us an opportunity to think afresh and take some major steps to turn the tide. Massive public spending programme will have to be undertaken urgently to not only create employment opportunities for our working population but also create demand across all major industrial sectors like steel , cement, machinery, equipment, manufacturing, building construction etc. Managing resources for the increased public expenditure is not difficult, there are many ways to manage the issue. It all has to begin with reforming the education and health system first. It is not rocket science that one needs bulky reports by subject matter experts to start any action. At present we have thousands of types of schools churning out thousand types of citizens across our nation. To revamp the existing education system with extremely poor infrastructure, the central government should announce a “National Programme for Rebuilding the School Education” and take up the responsibility to establish nearly 70,000 well equipped Class 1 to 12 schools across the nation that will truly be world class, equipped with all modern facilities to use IT-enabled education to provide the top quality of education to each and every student of our country. These schools will need to be fully equipped for providing vocational education to millions of students simultaneously. This will cost the nation nearly Rs 5 lakh crores over a three-year period. We already have more than adequate teaching posts sanctioned to man these schools so there shall not be any additional burden on account of salaries. These schools, spread across the country, each catering to nearly six to seven villages, will provide equality of opportunity in education to all our population and enable them to fully skill themselves to become economically productive.Similarly, through a “National Health Rejuvenation Programme”, well-equipped super-specialty hospitals should be established in every district to provide the level of healthcare that our constitution makers had envisioned. This will cost the central government barely Rs3 lakh crore over three years. This will also require complete change in the way the medical education system is being run today so that we not only start producing enough doctors for our requirement but for other countries across the world also.Our country is known for its pathetic infrastructure facility across all sectors. It is unfortunate that the highways which should not cost more than Rs 15 crore for a kilometre of a six-lane road are being built at the rate of Rs 60 to Rs 70 crore per kilometre. Through a “National Infrastructure Development Programme”, 20 thousand kilometre super highways will have to be built in three years time costing no more than Rs 3 lakh crore. Similarly, all the airports, ports, electricity distribution networks, and other infrastructure facilities can be made world class with an additional expenditure of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore in next four years.These four initiatives, to begin with, costing nearly Rs 15 lakh crores over four years, should become the “New Deal” of the central government, to not only transform India but will also kickstart the economy with jet speed and bring back mass employment, help pick up demand of all goods and services and bring the country back on the high growth path.In 1933, US President Franklin D Roosevelt came up with the nation-building programme called the “New Deal” to pull America out of “great depression”. It is an example for the present government to follow.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

12-09-2020||India||Charting India’s pathway to the big leagues||Even before the coronavirus pandemic swept through the country, India was at a crossroads. Its sustained economic expansion, accelerated by pathbreaking reforms in 1991, slowed significantly. Convulsions around religion and citizenship roiled domestic politics under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Meanwhile, the aspirations of international leadership that India has harboured since independence remain unrealised.For all its recent shortcomings, however, India should not be counted out. At a time when China’s myriad pathologies have left many countries thirsting for an alternative exemplar, India could again become the world’s fastest-growing free market democracy. But it will need a new approach to revive its hopes of joining the league of great powers.Can India grow fast enough?India’s economic growth has contracted since 2018, alongside a larger global slowdown driven by falling commodity prices, declining international trade, intensifying U.S.-China tariff wars, and decreasing manufacturing output across the developed world. If these cyclical factors alone accounted for India’s weakening performance, New Delhi could get by on provisional remedies while waiting for global conditions to improve.The unpalatable reality, however, is that the Indian economy’s structural weaknesses intensified these cyclical headwinds. Investments slowed because heavily indebted Indian companies left India’s major public sector banks saddled with huge non-performing loans and other Indian financial intermediaries fell victim to bad investments, thus bringing credit expansion to a halt.The resulting contraction compressed consumer spending at a time when the global slowdown was also pushing down exports. Additional government spending could not compensate because falling revenues and the costs of debt restructuring had aggravated the government’s fiscal burden. The coronavirus pandemic only intensified this problem, forcing the Indian government to expend resources to save lives and livelihoods at immediate risk.While all these challenges contributed to India’s recent drop-off in growth, they do not sufficiently account for it. The deepest underlying cause — one only now receiving a serious response by the government — is India’s failure to complete the programme of reforms begun in 1991, which liberalised commodity prices, removed production constraints, and reopened India to international trade.Those measures did not do enough to subject land, labour, capital, and enterprise to the rigors of a genuinely free market. The necessary follow-on reforms on this count were put off — largely out of fear that voters would penalise political leaders for the difficult decisions involved, after having come to view high growth rates produced by the initial reforms as a new birthright.The consequences have been onerous. Acquiring land in India today, for example, remains an arduous and distasteful enterprise that deters all but the most intrepid or the most corrupt. Labour in the organised sector can be hired but not fired, because current law is indifferent to market conditions and firm needs. Labour productivity growth in the informal sector— where most Indians are employed — is abysmal. India’s public sector banks dominate the nation’s financial capital, directing it toward the wealthy and the powerful often at the government’s behest with limited regard for viability. And red tape, corruption, arbitrary taxation, and unpredictable policies continue to sap both foreign investment and domestic entrepreneurship.Even as India struggles to reform these conditions, it has focused more resolutely on expanded distribution rather than growth. To attack inequality, the Indian state has tried to provide the disadvantaged segments of its population with subsidised food, medical services, electricity, and cooking fuel. These are commendable initiatives, but they ultimately must be paid for through accelerated economic growth. Yet this is precisely where India has faltered: without the structural changes that deepen markets, improve regulatory capacity, and expand human and physical capital through targeted investments, India will struggle to regain growth rates of 7 per cent and above — the minimum level necessary to sustain its development and its great power ambitions.Modi’s government has initiated important reforms under the pressure of the coronavirus crisis. Modi has encouraged states ruled by his party to institute land and labour reforms, even as the central government has begun to transform policies for agriculture and other industries to attract investments leaving China.Whether these efforts will produce lasting success, only time will tell. But India historically has only pushed forward with reforms when its back is to the wall — and, today, it is. Between the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened security threats from China, India needs to revive its economic growth in a hurry. The current crises may tip the balance in favour of the decisions necessary to free up the country’s substantial untapped capacity and master its myriad challenges.Can India play a meaningful global role? India’s economic performance remains its best instrument to shape the international system. But its role in international trade, its defence investments, and its conception of the global order also affect its rise to power.The coronavirus pandemic has unfortunately added momentum to the backlash against international trade, but jumping on the protectionist bandwagon in pursuit of self-sufficiency would provide India only illusory benefits. There is no way that India can reach its ambitious growth goals without expanded exports, which have recently been the fastest-growing slice of its economy. Those exports often depend on foreign inputs and cannot be sustained if India suppresses imports through higher tariffs, localisation requirements, and other trade barriers. Rooting for trade expansion — at least among friends, if not beyond — offers the greatest opportunities for Indian leadership and revived growth. But New Delhi’s inability to conclude even a modest trade truce with the United States, let alone integrate itself into the wider Asian economic system, is not reassuring.Defence investment presents parallel challenges. India’s slowing economy has constrained its defence spending —especially planned expenditures on modernisation — at a time when frontier security remains a major preoccupation. Any state seeking to become a great power, however, must influence outcomes beyond its immediate borders. Yet the economic downturn has left India without the necessary resources to expand its reach. Now that Chinese military assertiveness along India’s borders promises to bring new troubles, the financial constraints on India’s defence modernisation could prove especially costly.The persistent obsession with indigenising defence production will not help matters either. The belief that a country of India’s size should not import advanced weapons extensively is driven by sentiment at the expense of rational calculations about domestic capacity and economies of scale. Instead, India should import as needed to equip its military with the best operational capabilities while nurturing the development of critical components, subsystems, and technologies that can be integrated into global defence supply chains. This strategy offers better prospects than self-reliance for both securing cutting-edge technologies and stimulating domestic manufacturing.In recent years, India’s deepened strategic engagement with partners such as Australia, France, Israel, Japan, Singapore, and the United States has given it more room to play on the global geopolitical stage. Through better access to more advanced technology, increased exercises with highly proficient foreign militaries, and greater diplomatic coordination with other regional partners, India’s influence continues to enlarge, making it a stronger counterweight to troublesome challengers such as China. Ironically, India’s economic weakness has diminished its capacity to control its own neighbourhood even as it has fortified other global ties. And New Delhi’s policies on global issues such as data management, international trade, and sometimes even religious freedoms put it at odds with its Western partners, reminding the world more of India’s extant infirmities than of its growing strengths.India’s own conception of global order —centered on preserving a diverse, non-violent, non-discriminatory, polycentric state system — is not inherently incompatible with liberal internationalism. Consequently, there is no reason why India should not defend the liberal order more vigorously, both at home and abroad, despite its colonial history and its occasional disagreements with the West on norms such as the “responsibility to protect”. Can India remain a liberal democracy? Unlike China, India has seen its rise widely welcomed: it proved that rapid growth could occur even in a liberal democratic society marked by sharp demographic heterogeneities and severe developmental challenges. In fact, the United States and many other Western powers jumped at the prospect of aiding India’s ascent, presuming that it would not misuse its power against its own citizens or its neighbours. Yet a recent wave of policies widely perceived to be illiberal has eroded this confidence. Critics within and outside India point to many developments such as the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s autonomy, the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and the possibility of implementing a National Register of Citizens as evidence of a weakening commitment to liberalism. The government’s defences of these moves have not satisfied India’s minority groups or others concerned about India’s direction. But more than government policy is at issue here: key Indian institutions are weakening dangerously, and important segments of the population appear disenchanted with their country’s liberal inheritance.The community of liberal democracies internationally stands to lose if domestic unrest fuelled by confrontational politics stymies India’s growth or if India enlarges its material capabilities only by sacrificing its liberal character. Either outcome would dilute the West’s eagerness to partner with India.To be sure, India’s relevance in the Indo-Pacific will survive, thanks to the exigencies of balancing China. This ensures continued engagement by the United States and other powers, but a constrained acquiescence to partnership is a poor substitute for the enthusiastic boosting of India that would otherwise occur if its liberal credentials were not contested. For all its difficulties, India is by no means out of the great power game. It possesses vast and still largely untapped potential. But realising that potential will require New Delhi to deepen its economic reforms in order to expand its national power, use that power to strengthen the liberal international order in partnership with its fellow democracies, and remain a credible example of how liberal politics can advance development in large, diverse countries outside of the West. On each count, India will have to meaningfully correct course if it is to achieve these ambitious aims.(Ashley J.

12-09-2020||India||Only one man holds key to China’s moves||When Chinese foreign minister Huang Hua met Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 29, 1981, the two agreed that unless the boundary question was settled, it would be difficult to maintain friendship and goodwill between the two neighbours.More than 39 years later, the People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese foreign ministry appear to be on different pages on this tenet. The PLA is hard at work in its single-minded effort to reach to the Green Line defined by a 1959 map drafted by then Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai while the foreign ministry is talking about building bilateral economic ties, which over the years, favoured Beijing.Much as State Councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi tried to gloss over a near war-like situation in Ladakh during his two-hour-long meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the fact is that the 1981 parallel track policy of working to build on harmonious ties even as the two countries sorted out the boundary issue has not paid any dividends to India.Instead, India has lost territory since then, letting 65 patrolling points defined by the China Study Group in 1976 turn into the de facto Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The patrolling points are well within the Indian perception of the LAC but the movement of the Indian forces to these points has been curtailed by the presence of Chinese troops, face-offs with PLA patrolling parties and on occasion, harsh weather and mountainous terrain.As Wang and Jaishankar arrived at a five-point consensus in Moscow to first disengage, and then de-escalate in Ladakh, the Communist Party of China mouthpiece Global Times continued to play up its war-mongering editorial line .“If India wants peace, China and India should uphold the LAC of November 7, 1959. If India wants war, China will oblige,” the tabloid, considered an extended arm of the Chinese government, said. It claimed that India does not want to implement the 1959 LAC as it is still nursing a grudge for its failure in 1962 war. It is this 1962 mindset that pervades the regime of Xi Jinping. President Xi, who evidently sees himself as a true successor to Mao Zedong, who decided to target India in 1962 by creating an impression that India was out to occupy Tibet.The aggressive line projected by the party’s mouthpiece is totally at odds with State Councillor Wang Yi’s stand at his meeting with Jaishankar where the Chinese side did not appear to acknowledge the role of the PLA in spiking tensions. Given China’s expansionist plans to make unilateral cartographic changes in Ladakh, the disengagement process will not be easy. The PLA wants to reach the 1959 Green Line and push Indian Army troops beyond the self-designated line. This is completely in violation of the 1993 Peace and Tranquillity Accord, which talks about mutual and equal security on the border for both sides.Under the circumstances, India will have to wait for PLA Commander-in-Chief and President Xi Jinping to give instructions to his western theatre command troops to return to their barracks if Beijing is seriously interested in rolling back the aggression. While the Chinese political mindset has not changed since 1962, the Indian mindset has. Beijing must take this into account before making the next move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-one-man-holds-key-to-china-s-moves/story-Lkna8WacA8V5bEl1bMC1hK.html
12-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I have a data wish list. It changes, like all good wish lists must. The current wish list is heavy on data related to rapid antigen tests.I have been writing for months about the context in which it makes sense for these tests to be used – and the context in which it doesn’t. I have also suggested a hack (two rapid antigen tests administered in parallel) if these tests need to be administered even in the context where it doesn’t make sense to. There is a reason for this. Many rapid antigen tests are inaccurate when it comes to so-called false negatives. In plain English, this means they show infected individuals as uninfected – potentially disastrous in the case of Covid-19 because it means infected individuals will be at large, infecting others, including those from the most vulnerable population segments.Also read: 6.4 million Covid-19 cases were estimated in India by early May, says first national serosurvey reportBut back to the wish list.I’d like all states to separately mention the number of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (or RT-PCR) tests – a mouthful, but these molecular tests are very accurate – and the number of rapid antigen tests they conduct every day, not just provide a consolidated number. I’d also like them to mention how many RT-PCR tests resulted in a positive identification, and how many antigen tests did. This might require some changes in how they report data – there isn’t a direct correspondence between the daily test and new case numbers (the latter correspond to the previous day’s numbers where RT-PCR tests are concerned, sometimes to tests done two, even three days previously), although everyone assumes there is one. But it can be done.This information is important because antigen tests may push positivity rates down.This is how the math works. According to the Harvard Medical School, for instance, the reported rate of false negatives in antigen tests could be as high as 50%. Consider a population where the prevalence of the coronavirus disease is 20% — a proportion that is lower than what sero surveys (antibody tests) have come up with in some parts of the country. This means that in a population of 100 people, 20 are infected. Let us assume this population is tested – half using RT-PCR tests and the rest using antigen tests – and that the number of infected is providentially shared equally between these two groups. Of the 50 who undergo RT-PCR tests, 10 are identified as positive (to be sure, there are times when these tests are also wrong, but such instances are rare). Of the 50 who undergo antigen tests, assuming a false negative of 50%, only five are identified as positive. The overall positivity rate works out to 15%, when it should actually be 20%. As the proportion of antigen tests in overall tests rises, it is clear that the positivity rate will fall.Also read: Covid-19 respite for Mumbai unlikely till New Year says BMC, it has a logicThis is what states using a disproportionate number of antigen tests have to guard against. At one level, the inaccuracy of the test means a significant number of infected people are still at large (instead of being quarantined). At another, it means that the actual positivity rate in the state is higher than the reported number. Because many of the infections are mild or asymptomatic, the infected people are unlikely to require hospitalisation – although there is always the chance that they will infect someone from a vulnerable segment.Over the past three days (September 8-10), between 85% and 87% of all tests conducted in Bihar (the state conducted over 100,000 tests on each of the days) were rapid antigen tests. Bihar’s average positivity rate over these three days was 1.2%.In the same period, between 62% and 67% of all tests conducted in Uttar Pradesh (the state conducted at least 140,000 tests on each of the three days) were rapid antigen tests. Uttar Pradesh’s average positivity rate over these three days was 4.6%.And, in Delhi, between 78% and 84% of all tests conducted over the past three days (the Capital conducted at least 45,000 tests on each of the days) were rapid antigen tests. Delhi’s average positivity rate over these three days was 7.6%.Of the three, Delhi is the only state to have seen the trajectory that positivity rates follow in regions testing adequately (a rise to a peak and then a fall; Delhi’s peak positivity rate was 36.9% on June 13).I have picked these three but there are other states, too, that use a significant number of antigen tests. There is a context in which antigen tests can and should be used, but their indiscriminate use may well present an inaccurate picture.The good news: accurate antigen tests have been developed (a previous instalment of this column wrote about one) and may soon be available in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-LAhwgCTRJOPBbOGfLW0z4J.html

12-09-2020||India||NDMC’s 40-member team to keep Parliament deep-clean||The New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) has devised an elaborate plan involving a special 40-member team to sanitise Parliament before and during the monsoon session, which begins next week in the backdrop of a recent spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the Capital, officials said on Friday.Deep cleaning of Parliament whenever there is an adjournment, and regular sanitisation of the entire complex, are two highlights of the plan, according to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They pointed out that the first phase of the sanitisation drive has already begun in and around the complex and that it will be completed in the next two days. Officials also said NDMC, along with the Union health ministry and the New Delhi district administration, is conducting Covid-19 tests on parliamentary staff at 10 centres in the complex.The monsoon session will convene on September 14 and continue till October 1.According to a senior NDMC official, the special team will carry out sanitisation drives three times on a typical work day while the House is in session — before the sitting every morning, during breaks, and when the session is adjourned for the day.“We will also ensure deep sanitisation every time the session is adjourned on any issue. Sanitiser dispensing machines have been installed on the premises. We don’t want to take any chances as the session is being conducted amid the pandemic,” the official said.He said extra staff will be on standby to ensure there is no laxity in sanitisation, testing and cleanliness.This official added that the team — it will be deployed in addition to the staff deployed for usual cleanliness work in the complex — has been divided into two groups of 20 workers. “One group will ensure deep cleaning and sanitisation inside Parliament House, while the other will take care of the areas outside such as corridors, offices of ministers and staff rooms, among other places,” the official said.In normal circumstances, the civic body carries out cleaning exercises and drives against mosquitoes in the complex before any session, another NDMC official said. But this year, there are additional responsibilities of testing and thorough daily sanitisation in the wake of the pandemic, he added.“We are dedicated to ensuring a safe session of Parliament. Thorough sanitisation exercises will be conducted. However, we will be doing it for the first time on such a large scale. At this point, we will not be able to tell the exact time needed to conduct the daily exercises,” the second official said.A third official, who is from NDMC’s public health department, said the civic agency has been conducting Covid-19 testing for Parliament officials and staff since September 5.“Our testing process is underway at 10 testing centres set up in the Parliament complex at different locations...With the House commencing on Monday, the number of testing centres will be increased. Covid-19 testing counters will be opened at all entry gates of parliament building premises,” the official said.PK Sharma, former head of NDMC’s public health department, said: “It is good that thorough sanitisation exercises and testing will be done, as nearly 1,000 people are expected to be on the premises...Along with precautionary measures by concerned agencies, public cooperation and strict enforcement of guidelines are key to controlling the spread of the virus.”The additional safety steps come at a time when Parliament is preparing to hold the session under the shadow of the coronavirus. Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha authorities are focusing on every detail to ensure the safety of lawmakers and workers during the 18-day session.Doorstep Covid-19 tests for MPs, the freedom to deliver a speech in the House while seated, options to undergo real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at their constituency before heading to Delhi, and one-way movement in the Central Hall and key corridors are some of the new measures the House will adopt.Visitors and media persons will not be allowed access to areas, including the Central Hall, during the upcoming session. Media, however, will be allowed to cover the session from press gallery. There will be no question hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndmc-s-40-member-team-to-keep-parliament-deep-clean/story-zsBAPOuzuGApINKZjwPK4L.html
12-09-2020||India||CBI asks for govt nod to prosecute ex-CAG Sharma||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought sanction from the Union government to prosecute former defence secretary and Comptroller and Auditor General of India Shashi Kant Sharma, former Air-Vice Marshal Jasbir Singh Panesar, and three other Indian Air Force (IAF) officers in connection with irregularities in the ₹3,727-crore AgustaWestland chopper deal, people familiar with the development said. Sharma was joint secretary (air) in the ministry of defence when the contract for supplying 12 VVIP helicopters was under consideration, and when operational requirements (OR) for the deal were being finalised. The contract – alleged violations and kickbacks in the deal became one of the biggest controversies during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime — was given to Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland in February 2010. The deal was eventually scrapped in 2014Sharma was later India’s defence secretary, between July 2011 and May 2013, and then CAG till 2017. This is the first time his name has come up in connection with the case.The words “JS Air” – an apparent reference to the designation joint secretary (air) — appeared repeatedly in Italian court judgments in the matter, as part of a note written by British middleman Christian Michel, who allegedly arranged kickbacks to politicians and officials in India. Exact details of Sharma’s role, however, were not known.“As JS (Air), Sharma was part of key meetings in the defence ministry,” said a CBI official when asked about the prosecution sanction. He declined to give any other details, while confirming the request was made in writing to the defence ministry. HT has seen the document making the request. The details of the alleged role played by Sharma in the case are not clear at this time.Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act makes it mandatory for CBI to seek a prosecution sanction from the concerned department before filing a charge sheet against a government official.Sharma denied the charges. “I had a long unblemished service record of over 40 years and nobody can blame me for any malafide action or decision. I strongly and firmly deny any such frivolous allegation,” he told HT. A second CBI officer, who asked not to be named, contended that Panesar and the three IAF officers played important and questionable roles in the purchase and testing of the AW-101 helicopters. More details of Panesar’s alleged role are not known at this time.The three officers against whom sanctions have been sought from the defence ministry are deputy chief test pilot SA Kunte, Wing Commander Thomas Mathew, and Group Captain N Santosh. The three officers have retired.Panesar and the three officers could not be reached. The Directorate of Veteran’s office did not share their contact details.The second CBI officer added that a supplementary charge sheet, detailing the alleged roles played by Sharma, Panesar, Kunte, Mathew and Santosh, is ready and will be filed as soon as the government accords sanction. The charge sheet will also detail the role of about a dozen other officials and individuals that amount to conspiracy and violation under the prevention of corruption act, he added. On Michel, the CBI supplementary charge sheet will explain how he paid bribes to Indian officials to influence the decision in the favour of AgustaWestland, and later destroyed the trail, said the second officer.Michel was extradited to India in December 2018 and is currently lodged in Tihar jail. CBI filed its first charge sheet in the case in September 2017, naming former IAF chief SP Tyagi; former Air-Vice Marshal JS Gujral; former AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini; former Finmeccanica chairman Giuseppe Orsi; Michel and his two associates, Guido Ralph Haschke and Carlo Gerosa; SP Tyagi’s cousin Sanjeev Tyagi; and Delhi-based lawyer-middleman Gautam Khaitan. They have all denied any wrongdoing.According to a note, allegedly written by Michel sometime in 2008 at his London office, 30 million euros were to be distributed among Indian bureaucrats, politicians, and air force officers. The note used abbreviations of designations under the heads “AF” (which, investigators allege, meant air force), “BUR” (bureaucrats, according to sleuths), “POL” (politicians) and “Fam” (believed to be SP Tyagi’s family). The note mentioned that 6 million euros were for “AF”, 8.4 million euros for “BUR”, 3 million euros for “Pol” and 15-16 million euros for “Fam”. Several of the abbreviations under the header were revealed by Guido Haschke to Italian investigators, according to court documents. The Italian court’s 2016 judgment in the case – it sentenced Orsi and Spagnolini – said that Haschke admitted to these expenses incurred by Michel on the Indian military, bureaucracy, and politicians. Spagnolini and Orsi were acquitted later by an appeals court in Milan in September 2018.CBI claimed in its first charge sheet (HT has seen a copy) that, in 2004, officials at Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Special Protection Group (SPG) and air force and ministry of defence officials, agreed to change the mandatory service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 meters to 4,500. This, it alleged, ultimately benefitted Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland. CBI also says it has established a “money trail” of 62 million euros (around ₹415 crore) out of suspected 67 million euros (₹452 crore) in bribes allegedly paid to Indian officials through middlemen. The irregularities in the award of contract to AgustaWestland led to estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (around ₹2,666 crore) to the Indian government in the 556.262 million euros (₹3,726.9 crore) contract, according to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-asks-for-govt-nod-to-prosecute-ex-cag-sharma/story-zOCGwD8AwkPkH3cUegjQdK.html
12-09-2020||India||Key changes, boost to Team Rahul as Congress rejigs panels||The Congress announced a major organisational reshuffle on Friday, an exercise that a section in the party hoped will put a lid on a growing buzz over differences between its younger leaders and the old guard, even as fresh discontent appeared to be brewing over the move.Congress president Sonia Gandhi formed a five-member special team that will help her in day-to-day matters; reconstituted the party’s Central Election Authority (CEA), which will conduct the organisational polls to elect a new party president; revamped its highest decision-making body, the Central Working Committee (CWC); and removed some key faces, including senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge, as general secretaries. However, both of them were retained in CWC.The reshuffle comes against the backdrop of 23 Congress leaders, including four CWC members (Azad, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada), writing a letter to Sonia Gandhi on August 7, and calling for full-time leadership and an introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old organisation while outlining 11-point action plan.The letter-writers, who triggered a flutter and drew flak from the party, had demanded the election of CWC members, and not nomination as announced on Friday. Some of them did not appear to be satisfied with the changes, and the manner in which they were carried out. “The wisdom of great minds has prevailed. Nomination seems to be the rule and election is not even an exception,” senior leader Kapil Sibal, one of the 23 signatories of the controversial letter, said on Friday.Manish Tewari, also a letter-writer, cryptically said: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. I persevere in the hope that we shall do our duty to protect the idea of India that Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar gave their lives for.”While the four letter-writers, who were part of the CWC, retained their place in the highest decision-making body — an indication, according to some functionaries, that the party leadership was trying to strike a conciliatory note — there appeared to be an infusion of leaders close to Rahul Gandhi in other senior organisational roles across states.In an August 24 CWC meeting, Sonia Gandhi had asked for a committee to help her in organisational and operational affairs till the next session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) to be held within six months. The panel that will assist her comprised AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala, the party’s chief spokesperson. Wasnik was one of signatories of the letter.The five-member CEA will be headed by Madhusudan Mistry and the members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely, another of the letter-writers. The newly inducted general secretaries included Surjewala (Karnataka), Jitendra Singh (Assam) and Tariq Anwar (Kerala and Lakshadweep). The newly appointed in-charges were Dinesh Gundu Rao (Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa), Manickam Tagore (Telangana), Vivek Bansal (Haryana), Pawan Kumar Bansal (administration), Rajeev Shukla (Himachal Pradesh), HK Patil (Maharashtra), Devendra Yadav (Uttarakhand), Manish Chatrath (Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya), Bhakta Charan Das (Mizoram and Manipur), and Kuljit Singh Nagra (Sikkim, Nagaland and Tripura). Digvijaya Singh, Salman Khurshid, Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari and Chinta Mohan will attend CWC meetings; the body will have 22 members, 26 permanent invitees, and nine special invitees. Former finance minister P Chidambaram was elevated from a permanent invitee to full-time member of the CWC. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, AK Antony, Ahmed Patel and Ambika Soni, among others, were retained as CWC members.The restructuring also saw the exit of eight existing CWC members – Motilal Vora, Luizinho Falerio, Tamradhwaj Sahu, Asha Kumari, Gaurav Gogoi, Anugrah Narayan Singh, Ram Chandra Khuntia and Arun Yadav. Gogoi, who was also dropped as the general secretary incharge of West Bengal, said the decisions were part of a larger change. “This is a massive exercise and I welcome these changes. This announcement will put a lid on all rumours about camps and young versus senior,” he said.Prasada, a CWC member and one of the letter-writers, will now look after the party affairs in West Bengal, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Those who were retained as general secretaries were Harish Rawat (Punjab), Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (Uttar Pradesh), Oommen Chandy (Andhra Pradesh), Ajay Maken (Rajasthan), KC Venugopal (organisation). Among the in-charges retained were RPN Singh (Jharkhand), Rajani Patil (Jammu and Kashmir), PL Punia (Chhattisgarh), Shaktisinh Gohil (Bihar and Delhi), A Chellakumar (Odisha), and Rajeev Satav (Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu). “It’s a new team with both experience and youth. I want to thank Soniaji and Rahulji. In these vicious times, where lies and hate are consuming this country, it’s time for the Congress to rise to the occasion. I’m sure this new team will rise to the occasion,” said Dinesh Gundu Rao. Manickam Tagore said:“It is going to be a huge challenge. And the leadership has kept the younger team in the battlefield. The policy making body of the CWC has all the senior party leaders for larger issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-changes-boost-to-team-rahul-as-congress-rejigs-panels/story-LMBpOUO7zlNrjs88vVig9L.html

12-09-2020||India||Fresh five-point plan to douse flare-up at border||India and China have finalised a five-point road map to address the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including disengagement of troops and easing of tensions, even as New Delhi conveyed its strong concern at the massing of Chinese troops without any credible reason and will now wait to see if Beijing translates its words into action. The consensus on the five points was reached during talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow on Thursday evening. The talks lasted two-and-half hours. A joint statement issued early on Friday morning said that the ministers agreed both sides should be guided by the consensus of the top leadership on developing India-China relations, “including not allowing differences to become disputes”. They agreed the situation on the LAC is not in the interest of either country, and “therefore...the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”. They further agreed that both sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”. The two sides will continue communicating through the Special Representatives mechanism, and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The ministers also agreed that “as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work to conclude new confidence-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquillity”. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side highlighted its strong concern at the massing of Chinese troops and equipment along the LAC without any credible explanation. “The presence of such large concentration of troops was not in accordance with the 1993 and 1996 agreements and created flashpoints along the LAC. The provocative behaviour of Chinese frontline troops at numerous incidents of friction along the LAC showed disregard for bilateral agreements and protocols,” said one of the people cited above. “The immediate task is to ensure a comprehensive disengagement of troops in all friction areas. That is necessary to prevent any untoward incident in the future. The final disposition of troop deployment to their permanent posts and the phasing of the process are to be worked out by military commanders,” the person added. The people said the five-point roadmap is a broad template for disengagement, though differences remain on crucial issues such as how far the troops should be pulled back from the LAC. The Indian side made it clear the ultimate goal should be to move forces back to their permanent posts, at least 20 km or more from the LAC, so that the high levels of tension dissipate, the people added. The Indian side said it expected full adherence to agreements on the management of border areas and that it “would not countenance any attempt to change the status quo unilaterally”, the people said. It also pointed out that Indian troops had scrupulously followed agreements and protocols on the border areas. Jaishankar, who has served as India’s envoy to Beijing and knows Wang well, made it clear India recognises that a solution to the boundary question requires time and effort, but it was equally clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquillity on the border areas is essential for developing the overall ties, the people said. Recent incidents in eastern Ladakh had “inevitably impacted the development of the bilateral relationship”, and an “urgent resolution of the current situation was in the interest of both nations”, the external affairs minister was quoted as saying by the people. Jaishankar also noted that since the resumption of ambassadorial-level relations in 1976 and holding of boundary talks since 1981, bilateral ties have developed on a “largely positive trajectory”. While there have been incidents from time to time, peace and tranquillity has largely prevailed on the border, and bilateral cooperation developed in a broad range of domains to give the relationship a more substantive character, he noted, according to the people. Jaishankar and Wang met for the crucial talks in Moscow against the backdrop of a spike in tensions on the LAC after both countries amassed more troops in the Ladakh sector. The two leaders were in the same room twice earlier in the day – first for a meeting of foreign ministers of the SCO and then for a luncheon meeting of the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping – before holding their bilateral talks a little after 8 pm Indian time on Thursday. A Chinese foreign ministry statement cited Wang as saying that “it is normal for China and India to have differences as two neighbouring major countries”, but it is important to “put these differences in a proper context vis-a-vis bilateral relations”. The statement further said the Chinese side is willing to “support enhanced dialogue between the frontier troops on both sides to resolve specific issues”, and it will stay in touch through diplomatic and military channels to restore peace and tranquillity. The Chinese statement quoted Wang as outlining China’s “stern position” on the border situation and “emphasising that the imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions”. He also said the “frontier troops must quickly disengage so that the situation may de-escalate”. However, New Delhi has rejected all assertions by Beijing that Indian troops had crossed the LAC and blamed the latest face-offs during August 29-30 and on September 7 on provocative military actions by Chinese forces.There have been face-offs on the south bank of Pangong Lake after provocative Chinese movements to change the status quo during August 29-30. India said during the latest face-off on September 7, Chinese soldiers fired in the air after being prevented from closing in on an Indian forward position – the first time guns were used on the LAC since 1975. Since then, both sides have further strengthened their military presence by moving in additional troops, tanks and other weaponry. The Chinese side, however, has been rattled by India’s proactive move of positioning its troops on several strategic heights to prevent further land grabs on the south bank of Pangong Lake. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said that despite the view taken by some sceptics, the meeting had produced a reasonable outcome. “The result is better than the external affairs minister coming back empty handed. In that scenario, things would have looked truly grim. It is also significant that the two sides agreed that the continuation of the current situation is not in their interests. India always believed in this obvious realty and now China is also subscribing to it,” he said. “An agreement is worth the paper it is written on provided it is implemented. While there are obvious difficulties in implementing it, it is in the interest of both countries to implement it scrupulously,” Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-five-point-plan-to-douse-flare-up-at-border/story-1KxNp4kw9riuj2aaMte93K.html

12-09-2020||India||PM Modi backs mother tongue but says NEP puts no bar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of students studying in mother tongue or local language at least till Class 5 even as he pointed out that the National Education Policy (NEP) placed no bar on learning any language. He also said students should be stepping towards a new future with a new curriculum designed under NEP when India completes 75 years of Independence in 2022. This curriculum will be forward-looking, future ready and scientific, he added, addressing a conclave on “School Education in 21st Century” under NEP 2020. “After the NEP came, there has been much discussion on what will be the language of instruction... language is the medium of education, not entire education itself. People caught in too much of bookish knowledge often fail to grasp this distinction. Whatever language the child can learn easily should be the medium of instruction,” Modi said. Some states, ruled by political rivals of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have criticised NEP-2020. Detractors have accused the BJP of working to promote Hindi, a charge it has vehemently rejected. “I see many people are under the wrong impression on this count. There is no bar on teaching-learning any language, be it English or any global language that helps at the world stage,” Modi added. Modi also said NEP will give a new direction to the country in the 21st century, sowing the seeds for a new era. “The job is not finished yet. It (NEP) has to be implemented in an equally effective manner, and we have to do it together,” he said, noting that a nationwide consultation process is going on over the policy. In July, the Union Cabinet passed India’s first NEP in at least 28 years, recommending primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities, creating a single higher-education regulator and easier board exams, among several other steps aimed at ushering in sweeping reforms. Since then, over 1.5 million suggestions have been received on the MyGov portal, Modi said in his speech. The Prime Minister said the world changed in the last three decades but India’s education policy remained the same. In the current system, marksheet has become “pressure sheet” for students and “prestige sheet” for families, Modi said, adding that the new policy aims to remove this pressure. “When the country marks its 75th years of Independence, every student should be studying under guidelines formulated by NEP. This is our collective responsibility,” he said, addressing teachers, parents, states and NGOs. NEP places a lot of thrust on children’s education, Modi said, adding that the young generation is vital to the nation’s development. NEP has been prepared in a way that the syllabus can be reduced and focus should be shifted to fundamentals, Modi added. He said one of the major reasons behind the drop-out ratio is that students do not have the freedom of choosing their own subjects, but NEP will give them the choice. Now, students will not have to be limited to the watertight boundaries of commerce, science and humanities, and will choose any subject they want to, he said. “The playful education of pre-schools till now was restricted to urban centres alone. It will now reach the poor as well as the rural areas,” Modi said. “It is recognised world over thar early childhood, up to the age of 10, is the fastest learning period. Also the cognitive and analytical powers of a child are activated to the maximum if the medium of instruction is the mother tongue, or the dominant languages of the area... The emphasis of NEP on multi-disciplinarian [teaching] is excellent. The emphasis of the policy is to make youth future ready to meet the ever-changing contours of future exigencies,” said Inder Mohan Kapahy, former member of the University Grants Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-backs-mother-tongue-but-says-nep-puts-no-bar/story-DMeWvFYZx8psgsk0FZWGWK.html
12-09-2020||India||Nirav won’t get a fair trial in India, says SC ex-judge||London: Diamantaire Nirav Modi will not get a fair trial in India if extradited to face charges of major financial offences, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju insisted while deposing as a defence witness in the Westminster Magistrates Court on Friday.Appearing via videolink from New Delhi, Katju alleged in his 130-minute deposition that the judicial system in India has collapsed, claiming that investigative agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate were acting at the behest of political masters. The prosecution, in turn, suggested that Katju was using he case to boost his own public profile. The five-day hearing is part of Modi’s extradition trial in which the judge needs to decide whether there is a prima facie case against him in India on the basis of evidence submitted by the government of India. Katju expounded on several cases and issues to substantiate his allegations, including the 2019 Ayodhya judgement by a SC bench headed by former chief justice Ranjan Gogoi, the latter’s subsequent nomination as a Rajya Sabha MP, post-retirement appointment of judges, media trials and alleged corruption in the judiciary.Questioning law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s claim in a press conference in May that Modi was a “criminal”, Katju said: “The government of India has made up its mind that Nirav Modi is a criminal. Is Prasad the judge? What kind of law minister is he? How can we expect a fair trial?”“All ministers have pronounced him (Modi) guilty and the courts will do what they say…The present government needs a scapegoat to divert attention from other issues. Nirav Modi is the scapegoat, blamed for all ills”.He added: “They have already pronounced him a criminal. I am definite that he will not get a fair trial in India. No lawyer will pick up his case. The justice system has collapsed; it is beyond redemption; it has bowed before political masters.”Katju clarified that he cannot say anything about the charges of financial offences brought against Modi by CBI and ED, since he is not aware of the details, but repeated several times that he will not get a fair trial under the present circumstances.Recalling the SC’s 2013 description of CBI as a “caged parrot”, Katju alleged that things had worsened, claiming that CBI and ED were not politically neutral, with the Central Vigilance Commission “doing nothing”. According to him, such agencies had become “tools of political masters”.Helen Malcolm, appearing on India’s behalf, questioned him about speaking to the news media in India on Thursday about his court appearance, and wondered if it was anything to do with his being a “self-publicist” keen to exploit the high-profile case.Malcolm read out Katju’s remarks published in the past on same sex relationships, about single women allegedly being prone to psychological problems, that “90% Indians are fools”, provoking agitated responses from Katju. At one point, he said: “I know more English literature than you”.Malcolm said: “I don’t want to be discourteous but is it possible that you are a self-publicist who will make any outrageous comment to reach the press in this high-profile case. It is up to others to make a judgement about the use of your evidence”.Katju insisted that Malcolm’s accusation that he is motivated by personal vanity is not a fair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-won-t-get-a-fair-trial-in-india-says-sc-ex-judge/story-3cvrA5BqNrHtkmT6W4Q82N.html
12-09-2020||India||DGCA to check if Covid guidelines violated on Kangana’s flight||India’s aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has sought a report from IndiGo on alleged violation of safety and social distancing norms necessitated by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic on board a Chandigarh-Mumbai flight, where actor Kangana Ranaut was one of the passengers, on September 9. The IndiGo flight, 6E 264, which took off from Chandigarh at its scheduled time at around 12 noon, landed in Mumbai at around 2.15 pm on September 9. The flight had Ranaut on board, along with her sister, Rangoli. A few media persons were on the same flight to cover Ranaut’s movement. Ranaut has been critical of the Mumbai police’s investigation of the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, and an escalating war of words with members of the Shiv Sena, part of the state’s Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, saw her compare the state to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. Ranaut, was subsequently provided Y+ security by the Union Ministry for Home Affairs (MHA) and she did not interact with the media during the flight. However, mediapersons allegedly violated social distancing norms as they kept on leaving their seats during the flight . An airline official said, “The cabin crew kept on requesting the media persons on board the flight to remain seated. The pilot also asked them not to use their camera phones or shoot on board. However, they refused to obey.” Arun Kumar, director-general, DGCA, said, “We have asked the airline to submit the report about the situation during the flight and the safety and social distancing norms violated by a few passengers. The report is expected soon.” Commenting on the incident, IndiGo said, “We have given our statement to DGCA regarding the matter pertaining to flight 6E 264 from Chandigarh to Mumbai, on September 9, 2020. We would like to reiterate that our cabin crew, as well as the captain, followed all the requisite protocols, including announcements to restrict photography, follow social distancing and maintain overall safety. IndiGo also followed the requisite protocol of documenting this matter in its post-flight report. We are committed to providing a safe, hassle-free experience to our passengers.”“Multiple issues have been witnessed, the prominent ones include photography on board in violation of Aircraft rules 13, violation of Covid protocols and certain actions falling within the purview of unruly behaviour on board. We have asked the airline to take appropriate action against those responsible,” said Arun Kumar, DG, DGCA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-to-check-if-covid-guidelines-violated-on-kangana-s-flight/story-Du7iWL4rRe1V4Wde6NsrQN.html

He said the permission to register an FIR and conduct further investigation was pending with the state government due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  He said the FIR was lodged after the state government gave the go-head in the case a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-11-crore-embezzlement-at-two-mathura-temples-sit-files-fir-against-12/story-VXVvooKs9I4hECLML4xXrN.html
12-09-2020||India||ED questions Kerala education minister in gold smuggling case||Thiruvananthapuram:The Enforcement Directorate on Friday questioned Kerala higher education minister KT Jaleel in the gold smuggling case.Jaleel’s alleged involvement in the case had come to light when his phone number figured in the call records of the main accused, Swapna Suresh. Following this, the minister had told mediapersons that the calls were made regarding a consignment of Holy Quran from UAE, which customs officials had referred to as “prima facie violation of FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act)”. The customs department found that a consignment, weighing 4,000 kg, had arrived in the state on March 4. “Out of 31 packets that came only one packet was opened. Rest are lying in two religious institutions in my constituency. Let any agency probe, my hands are clean,” the minister had said. The minister’s questioning led to further controversy in the state, with the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party hitting out at the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan-led government. “It is a shame for the state. It seems the CM is waiting for his arrest. This is the first time such an incident is taking place,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, demanding Jaleel’s resignation. Meanwhile, a senior official privy to the case said that the minister will likely be summoned again. The case pertains to the seizure of a 30-kg gold consignment, that arrived in Thiruvananthapuram for an official of the UAE consulate on July 5.The case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now.The NIA has arrested 30 persons in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-kerala-eduction-minister-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-9P1o9yEBnqFimxpzTwHnLL.html
12-09-2020||India||India, US ask Pakistan to act on terror||New Delhi/Beijing: India and the US have called on Pakistan to take “immediate, sustained and irreversible action” to ensure that Pakistani territory isn’t used for terror attacks and to speedily bring to justice the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot attacks. The two countries also underscored the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including al-Qaida, Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), and Hizbul Mujahideen. These issues figured in the 17th meeting of the US-India joint working group on counterterrorism and the third session of the designations dialogue held virtually during September 9-10, according a joint statement. Both sides denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms. They also exchanged views on threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities, the statement said. “The two sides underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot,” the statement said. The 2008 Mumbai attacks, which were carried out by a 10-member team of the LeT from Pakistan, left 166 people dead, including six US nationals. Pakistani security agencies arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, for allegedly planning, financing and supporting the attacks but there has been little progress in their trial in a counterterrorism court. The 2016 Pathankot attack, blamed on JeM, targeted an Indian Air Force base and resulted in the death of seven Indian troops. During the dialogue, India and the US also shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions and designations against terror groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India, the statement said. There was a joint commitment to strengthen cooperation on information-sharing and other steps to disrupt the ability of international terrorists to travel, in line with the provisions and obligations outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2396. Officials of the two sides highlighted their efforts to address some of the world’s most pressing counterterrorism challenges, including countering the financing and operations of terrorist organisations, countering radicalisation and terrorist use of the internet, cross-border movement of terrorists, and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning terrorist fighters and family members. The two sides also discussed mutual legal and extradition assistance, and bilateral law enforcement training and cooperation. The US reiterated its support for the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism. Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary for counterterrorism in the external affairs ministry, and Nathan A Sales, the US state department coordinator for counterterrorism, led the two delegations in what the statements described as a “far-reaching conversation on counterterrorism cooperation”. The two sides also resolved to continue close coordination on “this important element of the comprehensive global strategic partnership” between India and the US. China, however, responded to the joint statement by defending Pakistan’s counterterrorism record. It said Pakistan has made “tremendous efforts” in fighting the menace and shouldn’t be singled out as a country linked to terrorism. Asked to comment on the joint statement, the Chinese foreign ministry noted that Friday is the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York.“All countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard the world’s peace and stability. So, on this very special day, I would like to say that we hope the US won’t forget terrorism and Covid-19 are common enemies to all mankind. And China and Pakistan are not the enemies of the US,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing.“Terrorism is a common challenge faced by all countries. And Pakistan has made tremendous efforts and sacrificed in fighting terrorism. The international community should fully recognise and respect that,” he added. “China opposes all kinds of terrorism and we believe that the UN should play a leading role and we oppose double standards on counterterrorism. And we oppose the attempt to link terrorism to any specific country,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-ask-pak-to-act-on-terror/story-zARN4mlCkeOKzNvM5eVZxK.html
12-09-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi, CDS Rawat attend House defence panel meet||New Delhi: The parliamentary standing committee on defence, which met on Friday with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in attendance for the first time, discussed issues such as better food, clothing and other facilities for soldiers, especially those deployed on the borders, according to people aware of the matter.The meeting -- in which Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat was present -- centered around the topic on the agenda, “provision and monitoring of the quality of ration and livery items to the defence forces”. The committee is headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Jual Oram.The border standoff between India and China was not discussed, though Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former defence minister Sharad Pawar did seek a discussion on matter, the people cited above said.When Pawar asked for a briefing on the latest situation in India-China border conflict, General Rawat said his comments have been noted, and indicated that the armed forces will send a written reply to the panel later -- a usual practise in parliament that allows deponents to give a detailed reply to questions which they think should be handled more carefully. Last month, appearing before another parliament committee, Rawat had said that de-escalation in Ladakh may be a “long-drawn process” but that the Indian armed forces is prepared for it and has made all arrangements for troop deployment in the harsh winter. The top general and three-star Generals had also emphasised that the Indian armed forces are prepared to face any contingency.Rahul Gandhi on Friday expressed concern over the food items being provided to soldiers as compared to officers, saying rank should not considered for providing the “type of food or nutrition” in the defence forces, they added.Gandhi had skipped the earlier meetings of the panel, apparently as a mark of protest against the inclusion of BJP’s Lok Sabha member from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur, in the 31-member committee. The BJP later removed her from the panel following her praise of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse, whom she called a “desh bhakt (patriot)” during a discussion on the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha in the Winter Session last year. According to a functionary present in the meeting, when Gandhi wanted to know about the difference between the ration for jawans and the officers, General Rawat emphasised there is no qualitative difference in food but since jawans mostly come from rural India, they prefer certain kind of food items such as chapati over rice. He added that there is no complaint about the quality of food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-cds-rawat-attend-house-defence-panel-meet/story-rgW8qKt9B0Cw92Twi9e9AM.html
12-09-2020||India||China may hand over 5 missing arunachal men on Saturday, says Rijiju||GUWAHATI: The five young men from Arunachal Pradesh who strayed across the border to the Chinese side earlier this month will be handed over to Indian authorities on Saturday, according to union sports minister Kiren Rijiju. The Chinese PLA has confirmed to the Indian Army that it will hand over the young men, likely anytime tomorrow, Rijiju, who represent BJP from Arunachal West seat, said in a Tweet on Friday evening. The five men from the Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for Indian Army, went missing on September 2 reportedly from Sera-7 on the Indian side of the McMahon line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and the Tibet autonomous region (TAR) of China. Following their disappearance, the brother of one of them posted on social media that they had been abducted by PLA. The same accusation was made by Tapir Gao, BJP MP from Arunachal East and Congress MLA from Pasighat, Ninong Ering in their tweets. Responding to a hotline message sent by the Indian Army, the People’s Liberation Army said on Tuesday that the men had been found on the Chinese side and that they were fine. “The young men, who were hunting in the area, inadvertently crossed over to the other side. The PLA informed us that they all are okay. Formalities for their early transfer are being coordinated with the Chinese side,” Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, PRO (Defence), Tezpur, Assam, said on Tuesday The disappearance and the allegation that they were abducted came against the backdrop of heightened tensions between both countries. On Monday, China’s state affiliated Global Times tweeted quoting Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian: “China has never recognized so called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’, which is China’s south Tibet region, and we have no details to release yet about question on Indian Army sending message to PLA about five missing Indians in the region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-may-hand-over-5-missing-arunachal-men-on-saturday-says-rijiju/story-JZPkha64EU1bgXdcCXn6zJ.html
12-09-2020||India||India, China statements show divergence remains||Divergences remain between India and China on the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even after they framed a five-point road map for easing tensions on the disputed border and speeding up the disengagement of troops. The two sides reached an agreement on the five points during talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on Thursday night. The points include dialogue aimed at quick disengagement, maintaining proper distance between troops of the two sides and easing tensions, abiding by all agreements and protocols on border management, and working on new confidence-building measures once the situation eases. Wang was quoted by a Chinese foreign ministry statement as acknowledging that it is normal for two major neighbours such as India and China to have differences and that bilateral ties have come “to a crossroads”, though there is no challenge that can’t be overcome if both sides keep moving in the right direction. These remarks marked a slight shift from China’s stance in recent weeks, including during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe on September 4, of holding the Indian side entirely responsible for the standoff. In other areas, however, sharp differences persisted between the two sides, and experts noted that both countries hadn’t made any mention of the restoration of the status quo on the LAC as it existed in April or set any time frame for completing the disengagement and de-escalation. The Chinese foreign ministry’s statement also said that the Indian side “does not consider the development of India-China relations to be dependent on the settlement of the boundary question”, but this was dismissed by people familiar with developments. The people, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that Jaishankar emphasised even before the meeting that “the state of the border cannot be de-linked from the state of the relationship”, and that he had repeated this at the talks with Wang. During the meeting, Jaishankar made it clear that recent incidents in eastern Ladakh had “inevitably impacted the development of the bilateral relationship”, said one of the people cited above. “While the Indian side recognised that a solution to the boundary question required time and effort, it was clear the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is essential to the forward development of ties,” the person added. The people also challenged the Chinese statement’s assertion that the “Indian side believes that China’s policy toward India has not changed”, saying the Chinese side is yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for the massing of troops and equipment in violation of all existing border agreements, which has created new flashpoints along the LAC. The Chinese statement cited Wang as outlining China’s “stern position” on the situation and emphasising the need to “immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions” and to “move back all personnel and equipment that have trespassed”. The people cited above reiterated that Indian troops hadn’t crossed the LAC and it was the Chinese troops that had fired in the air during the latest face-off on September 7 on the south bank of Pangong Lake. “We are committed to a resolution though peaceful dialogue but it is the Chinese side that has repeatedly resorted to aggressive military actions and posturing,” a second person said. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash is among those who remain sceptical about the Chinese side’s intentions and willingness to deliver on the commitments made during Thursday’s meeting. “The India-China joint statement on border disengagement somehow doesn’t inspire. The Chinese don’t seem to have agreed to restore status quo ante. There are no timelines,” he said. “The understanding on quick disengagement is vague at best. It will be a miracle if these commitments are honoured,” Prakash added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-statements-show-divergence-remains/story-9HkETQqK811BmEwYSZaF5L.html
12-09-2020||India||India’s first toy-making hub pins hopes on ‘vocal for local’||Greater Noida: A few hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s latest Mann Ki Baat radio address, in which he urged entrepreneurs to “team up for toys” to make India a toy-manufacturing powerhouse, Naresh Kumar Gautam, vice president of Toy Association of India, started getting phone calls from people seeking tips on how to get into the toy business. “A lot of them currently see a great opportunity in it. The PM’s emphasis on local manufacturing of toys was yet another morale booster for us after the government increased the import duty on toys earlier this year. If the government had the right policies and shown such enthusiasm 20 years back, this place by now would have become one of the world’s biggest toy manufacturing hubs,” says Gautam. Also read: ‘Mindset for free India should be vocal for local’: PM Modi pushes for self-reliance in Independence Day speechThe place that Gautam, founder of Little Genius Toys, one of India’s biggest wooden toy companies, is referring to is the Toy City in Greater Noida, where he has a manufacturing unit. In the past couple of months, with the government pushing the Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiative, several toy manufacturing hubs have been announced in different parts of the country, including one along the Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Buddha Nagar. Very few people know that Toy City in Greater Noida — 30 km from Connaught Place — was India’s first toy hub. Planned in the late 1990s, the Toy City, where plots were allotted to over 100 toy makers, has wide, well- laid out, tree-lined roads and signage. Years later, in 2002, the ministry of micro, small & medium enterprises launched a national programme for the development of the toy Industry. As part of the programme, land for a Toy Design & Development Institute (TDDI) was also allotted in Toy City. Ironically, today, Toy City has only 10 toy manufacturing units producing a range of tin toys, soft toys, board games and puzzles, among others. The rest are engineering, furniture, auto parts, packaging material and home appliances units--- all, incongruously, with a Toy City address. Also read: ‘It’s a great service to the nation’: PM Modi urges people to go vocal about localMost of those allotted plots either surrendered their land to the Greater Noida Authority or sold them. Toy manufacturers here say there are several reasons why India’s first toy city failed to become a manufacturing hub. “Even as the Toy City was set up, at the time liberalisation had picked up pace and the government drastically reduced tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports of many items, including toys. So, many of the toy manufacturers had second thoughts about setting up a factory here,” says Gautam.Labour-intensiveGautam’s tryst with Toy City has been fortuitous. Starting in a small room in Kalkaji in South Delhi with an investment of Rs 1,500, he came to Toy City in 2006. Today, he is one of India’s biggest wooden toy manufacturers, employing over 300 people in his Toy City factory spread across three floors, boasting a range of laser machines, computer-controlled milling machines and freight saw machines, among others.“ We are able to compete with China as we are into labour-intensive manufacturing. China cannot beat us in any labour-intensive industry, ” says Gautam. Tarun Chetwani, director of Natkhat Toys, a soft toy maker, says Toy City had teething troubles. “When we started construction of our factory in 2002, many villagers from Habibpur, the village whose land was acquired for the development of the Toy City, came and forced to stop the construction, saying they had not received the promised compensation. The construction was held up for two weeks,” say Chetwani. That was not the end of the troubles. In 2003 May, when he finally started production, he realised the electricity was a major problem, with his captive generator running for hours every day. “ We never faced this problem in Delhi, and began to wonder whether we made the right decision by shifting our factory here, but decided to stay on, and have no regrets today, ” says Chetwani, who had a small manufacturing unit in Chilla village in Delhi, before he shifted to Toy City. “We were manufacturing about 600 toys a day before we came here, and 6,000 soft toys a day until the coronavirus lockdown. While we depend on China for fabric, we have been able to match them in quality and cost, ” says Chetwani, who supplies toys to some of India’s biggest consumer retail chains. Many plastic toy manufacturers, Chetwani says, did not move to Toy City, and some even left because of the electricity problem. “Their machines took time to heat up and frequent power outage was a problem. But I think those who had been allotted plots should have shown more ‘fighting spirit’ and set up factories instead of surrendering and selling their plots,” adds Chetwani. He says the Indian toy industry needs to match China in terms of the economics of scale “The problem is many international chains we supply to sign buyer-seller agreement only for a year. Unless there is a long-term agreement with our buyers, we cannot afford to invest in enhancing capacity beyond a point. Manufacturing, after all, is governed by market forces,” says Chetwani. “ Indian wholesale traders are also part of the problem; they go to China where they are willing to pay a huge advance and place bulk orders , but they always hold up our payment and never place large orders with us. ”Ease of doing business Most of the manufacturers in Toy City say they flourished despite competition from China because their toys cannot be mass-produced on automatic machines. Paresh Chawla , director of Tin Treasurers, perhaps India’s biggest tin toy manufacturers, set up a unit in Toy City in 2003 at a time when most tin toy factories were shutting down. The company, he says, exports 95% of its toys to countries such as Germany, Spain, the US and Australia. “ We are competing with some of the biggest and best companies in Europe and China,” says Chawla, sitting in the spartan office of his 24,000 square factory spread across three floors. The factory is equipped with a range of hand- press machines, CNC (computer numerical control) wire cut machines for , automatic hydraulic machines, shearing machine and a tool room, among others. He says the government needs to improve ease of doing business if the country is to meaningfully increase its share of the global toy industry, which is worth an estimated Rs. 7 lakh crores. The global market research firm, IMARC estimates India’s toy market to be worth around Rs.10,000 crore. “What toy manufacturers needs is a design centre, a further easing of the import of machines, tools, dyes under the existing export promotion schemes,” Chawla says. “ Besides, the existing policies and schemes should be implemented properly so that manufactures can easily avail of them,” adds Chawla, whose office also serves as the office of Toy City Development Society, an association of toy manufacturers in the Toy City . “We meet once every month to discuss the issues and problems relating to Toy city and find a solution. We also organise training and awareness programmes for employees.”His business has been growing 10% a year, and like most other manufacturers in Toy City, he has booked a plot in the new Toy Park along the Yamuna Expressway. “ The idea is to set up laser-cut machines and scale up our capacity there,” he says. Raj Kumar, 80, founder, Creatives Educational Aids, a company that makes educational toys, and the first person to shift to the Toy City in 2001 , says the government should focus on building the Toy Design & Development Institute (TDDI) in Toy City. “The 5- acre plot earmarked for it is still lying vacant. The toy industry desperately needs a state-of-the-art design centre and it will be fitting if it comes up in the original Toy City, ” he says. Satish Sundra , who runs Ram Chander & Sons , perhaps the country’s oldest toy shop in Connaught Place, agrees, “India needs to invest in research and development facilities to match the quality and variety of Chinese toys.” Meanwhile, 92 applications have been received from domestic toy manufacturers for the upcoming Toy Park along the Yamuna Expressway and many hope it does not eventually meet the same fate as the Toy City. “Allottees will not be able to sell the plots before 10 years and not without setting up and running a toy factory on it for at least five years,” says Arunveer Singh, CEO, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-first-toy-making-hub-pins-hopes-on-vocal-for-local/story-zZqiCfY3GXBPPBCi3cHkHM.html
12-09-2020||India||‘Pranayam, regular exercise’: Goa CM Pramod Sawant on his Covid ‘recovery’||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant recommends pranayam, a healthy diet and regular exercise, saying it helped him recover from coronavirus.Addressing a press conference via video for the first time since he tested positive, Sawant said that he will continue to remain in isolation for at least another seven days after which he expects to resume his regular duties.“I felt mild symptoms on September 1 on account of which I took a test and was found positive. But other than fever and body ache for a day, I had no other symptoms and have recovered,” Sawant told media persons.“From my own experience I can say a healthy diet, regular exercise and pranayam has helped me recover from the disease. Many have experienced the need for post-Covid care and I would recommend the regular pranayam, drinking ample liquids and a good diet,” Sawant, who himself is an ayurvedic practitioner, said.Pranayam is a breathing technique that has health benefits.The CM went on to say that the state government would now be setting up centres for post-Covid care since many patients continued to experience symptoms even after they have recovered. They complain of fibrosis in the lungs or muscle pain or a persistent cough and other symptoms that require rehabilitation, he said. After testing positive on September 2, the CM isolated himself at home and said that he increased his exercise time and followed it religiously over the past 10 days.Cases in Goa are at nearly 25,000 while deaths have reached 276 with six to ten deaths being recorded daily. Critical care beds are in short supply in the state which has led to patients being accommodated on the floor of the state’s premier Goa Medical College and Hospital.The state has four dedicated Covid-19 hospitals with the fourth hospital having only just been commissioned.While Goa has among the highest per capita testing rates, cases are also among the highest in the country and positivity rate remains high at nearly 30% far higher than the national average and much higher than the recommended 10% or below.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranayam-regular-exercise-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-on-his-covid-recovery/story-zQAc371wFVXRJFePHjhVLN.html
12-09-2020||India||6.4mn may have had Covid-19 by May||An estimated 6.4 million people were infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid -19) in India by early May, show the findings of the first national serosurvey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research. “Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent... Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388… adult infections were estimated in India by the early May,” said the findings published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR).However, till May-end the country’s official caseload was about 200,000, which is roughly 3% of the estimated cases found in the survey. The country’s current case load is close to 4.6 million, hinting at inadequate testing for the disease, experts said. “That has always been the concern that testing was not adequate as India was largely testing symptomatic cases and asymptomatic positives is a huge number that may have been missed. It was important to cast the net wide, more so for asymptomatic people. It only boils down to the fact that we need to increase our testing,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR. As part of the community-based survey, which was held from May 11 to June 20, a total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled for the study across 21 states. According to the survey, those between the age group of 18-45 years were the worst-affected with 43.3% of them having developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Those with a past infection between 46 and 60 years of age comprised 39.5% of the sampled individuals. “The results, however, appear to be more correct to the ground reality at that point in time, and it is a huge number” said Dr Kant. The published literature indicates that the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection start appearing by the end of the first week after symptom onset and most cases are IgG positive by the end of second week, according to the researchers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-4mn-may-have-had-covid-by-may/story-3APyMrxeFKsqx7Uca7b6uK.html
12-09-2020||India||Centre tells states not to restrict oxygen supplies||The Union health ministry on Friday asked states not to place restrictions on transport or supplies of medical oxygen after the Madhya Pradesh government claimed Maharashtra was doing this and at least three other states -- Punjab, Karnataka and Telangana -- reported problems in getting regular supplies. On Friday, less than 3.7% of 943,480 active cases in India were on oxygen support, the ministry said, adding that for moderate and severe cases, adequate oxygen support, appropriate and timely administration of anti-coagulants and widely available and inexpensive corticosteroids, were the mainstay of Covid-19 therapy. Several states have seen up to five-fold increase in demand with Covid cases in the country rising to over four million.“It has come to the knowledge of the Union health ministry that few states are trying to curb the free inter-state movement of oxygen supplies by exercising provisions under various Acts and also mandating the manufacturers/suppliers located in the State to restrict their oxygen supplies to only the hospitals of the State,” the health ministry said in a statement issued on Friday.According to senior officials in the health ministry, the letter was sent in response to a Maharashtra government order under the disaster management Act, that sought to prohibit movement of oxygen from outside the state. “This may have built into a chain reaction with other states following suit. As of now there is no shortage but since major oxygen manufactures in the country are not equitably distributed, this could have led to a problem later on as states such as Delhi don’t have a manufacturer and gets its supply from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand,” this person said, asking not to be named. “India’s actual oxygen consumption is about 2000 metric tonnes per day, and the production capacity per day is about 6,400 metric tonnes that is also used by the industry. As the number of cases is rising and experience of treating doctors tells us that oxygen therapy saves lives, the consumption of oxygen is also going up and needs to be addressed,” the health ministry official added.The Madhya Pradesh government reported shortage of oxygen after Maharashtra stopped supplies on September 7, reserving 80% of production in the state for Covid hospitals in the state. “Since chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had a talk with his Maharashtra counterpart yesterday, a positive outcome is expected soon,” said an MP health department official, asking not to be named. The official shortage of oxygen was reported mainly from Jabalpur, Damoh, Chhindwara . Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has increased quota of oxygen supply from manufacturers within the state to hospitals in the state from the earlier 50% to 80% under Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. he added that this is to meet the increase in demand because of rising Covid cases. The rest of the oxygen can be provided for industrial purpose or to other states, he explained. Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country, becoming the only state to cross the million-infections marks on Friday.State chief secretary Sanjay Kumar confirmed that district administrations had stopped oxygen supply to neighbouring states. “I have had calls from Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka for oxygen. We are trying to sort it out. Some districts thought that there was not enough oxygen for patients there and hence the local administration had stopped supply to other states,” the official said. Like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka health department officials also reported shortage of supply and said the state government via a circular dated August 26 directed the manufacturers ‘to augment production and supply of liquid oxygen to meet demand’. A health department official, on condition of anonymity, said all assistant drug controllers across the state have been adequately empowered to ensure that oxygen demand is addressed.Punjab also reported shortages. Principal secretary (industries and commerce) Alok Shekhar wrote to his counterparts in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand to direct manufacturing plants in their area to increase supply of liquid oxygen to hospitals as well as manufacturers and refilling units in Punjab so as to reduce the shortage of oxygen in hospitals of the state.Officials in most states, however, said there was no need to panic as the situation was being brought under control. “We have already instructed district health officials to procure dura oxygen cylinders on priority and has received the demands from 16 districts,” Dr Archana Patil, director of health, Maharashtra.S Dhanraju, the nodal officer for oxygen supply to the health facilities in Madhya Pradesh, said, “We have 120 to 130 metric tonnes of oxygen every day in the state and we have sufficient stock for the Covid patients in the state.” The state plans to increase the oxygen supply per day to 150 tonnes by September 30. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said while the daily requirement by both Covid and non-Covid patients was 25 metric tonne per day, the state produces 37.86 metric tonne of oxygen per day. “We have drawn up a plan to become fully self-sufficient in oxygen very soon. In the meantime, we are trying to cope with the demand by getting oxygen from the neighbouring states,” Samir Kumar Sinha, principal secretary (health) said on Friday. NS Nigam, West Bengal health secretary, said the state has worked on the plan to meet the increase in demand even though there was no shortage. Officials in health departments of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttarakhand too said there was no shortage of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-states-not-to-restrict-oxygen-supplies/story-7yCE7zAV0QTVawLhZ6EktN.html
12-09-2020||India||House panel backs e-courts||Virtual courts and hearings through video conference should continue even during non-pandemic times with the consent of parties in certain categories of cases such as appeals and final hearings where physical presence of parties or their counsel is not required, a parliamentary panel suggested, saying this will pave way for cheaper and faster means of delivery of justice.The panel observed that such hearings have gained immense ground during the Covid-19 pandemic and will remain the new reality. It suggested that these be extended permanently for appellate tribunals such as the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal, Intellectual Property Appellate Tribunal, and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. “This will cut down the cost and increase efficiency in disposal of the cases without unnecessarily being adjourned. Virtual courts can deliver faster results with fewer resources. They can also reduce commute time to courts and waiting time,” the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice said in an interim report submitted to Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday.The report on “Functioning of virtual courts/ court proceedings through video conferencing” underlined that digital justice is cheaper and faster. The panel added it addresses locational and economic handicaps, ensures the safety of vulnerable witnesses providing testimony besides expediting processes and procedures.Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Bhupender Yadav-led panel said virtual courts are an improvement over traditional ones “as they are most affordable, citizen-friendly and offer greater access to justice”.Court proceedings have been held digitally for over five months to adhere to social distancing norms as part of the measures to check the spread of the pandemic. Physical hearings of cases in the Supreme Court were suspended on March 23. The apex court has been hearing cases via video conferencing since then. The Supreme Court late last month notified standard operating procedure (SOP) to govern physical court hearings which were expected to commence soon but that has not happened yet.The panel’s recommendations come even as the Bar Council of India and various bar associations have questioned the efficacy of the digital proceedings and pointed to limitations in the infrastructure required for them. They have said digital proceedings favour tech-savvy advocates besides depriving opportunities to many lawyers to change the course of arguments based on the changing dynamics of a case during hearings.In their submissions to the panel, a representative of the Bar said that at least 50% of advocates, mostly at the district and lower levels, do not own laptops or computers and lack the skills required for virtual proceedings.The panel’s report said that virtual courts will promote access to justice since litigants in remote areas will be able to access the Supreme Court without spending money on travel to Delhi. The panel also suggested necessary amendments to the law to give legal validity to virtual courts and their proceedings so that they are not questioned before courts.As many as 13 out of the 25 high courts in the country have introduced and enabled electronic filing of cases. But district and subordinate courts at many places have been lagging behind due to lack of infrastructure and experience in handling and transitioning to virtual hearings.The committee, in its report, acknowledged these difficulties and said massive investments would be required to put in place the infrastructure necessary to support digitised hearings. It has suggested the feasibility of new financing approaches like the public-private partnership model for the purpose.The panel also pointed out that there is no mechanism currently to segregate simple cases from complex ones involving cumbersome procedures and multiple witnesses.“The principle of Proportionate Justice requires that the expense, speed, complexity, and the extent of combativeness of any case should be proportionate to the substance and scale of that case. Petty cases should be dealt with swiftly in a reasonable timeframe. Such cases should not require cumbersome procedures.”Virtual courts, the report said, can address this issue.The committee concluded that physical courts alone will not be sufficient. It added virtual courts will have to be integrated into the country’s legal ecosystem. As a first step towards this, the judiciary should identify cases that can be heard by virtual courts, it suggested.It also recommended extending virtual courts to cover arbitration hearings. Other recommendations include setting up of E-Sewa Kendras at all court complexes, speedy execution of National Broadband Mission, the introduction of computer courses for law students, and developing an indigenous software platform to ensure data privacy and safety.Yadav said: “We have effectively used virtual courts during the lockdown period wherein more than 1.8 million cases were registered across the country, of which nearly 800,000 have been disposed of.”Congress MP and member of panel Vivek Tankha said: “Virtual Courts through VC will be an integral part of court hearing in times ahead. It will change meaning of the word court - it will reflect a system of seeking justice than just a place of legal work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-backs-e-courts/story-F5GNGVNcYT3dTHHdx4uMHJ.html
12-09-2020||India||SC seeks Centre’s reply on death row convict’s mercy plea pending for 8 years||The Supreme Court on Friday sought Centre’s response on a death row convict’s plea seeking commutation of sentence to life imprisonment for the failure on part of the Central government to decide on his mercy petition filed eight years ago.The convict, Balwant Singh Rajoana, was sentenced to death for the murder of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh who died in a bomb explosion in Chandigarh on August 31, 1995. The petitioner has been in custody for nearly 25 years.Rajoana filed a mercy petition before the President on March 25, 2012 but has heard nothing on it till date. Several attempts to seek progress on his mercy petition under the Right to Information (RTI) Act did not succeed.Last year, on September 27, the Centre decided to commute the death penalty of Rajoana to life sentence on the special occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Almost a year has passed but the decision is yet to be implemented.Citing these reasons, Rajoana decided to approach the apex court and seek benefit of a 2014 decision passed in Shatrughan Chauhan v Union of India where undue, inordinate delay in deciding mercy petitions was held to be a ground to commute punishment of death row convicts. The judgment declared that prolonged delay in execution of the death sentence has a “dehumanizing effect” on the death row convict.Rajoana’s lawyer Rupesh Kumar said, “From July 31, 2007 the petitioner is on death row. He is suffering from clinical depression and anxiety disorder along with various other ailments. After moving the mercy petition, he and his family moved four RTI petitions between 2016 and 2018. On every occasion, the Centre responded by saying the matter is under consideration. No reason for delay was cited and so we decided to approach the top court.”A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice to the Centre on Rajoana’s petition and posted the matter after four weeks. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Rajoana, argued that all that the convict was seeking was life sentence and not a pardon.The bench asked Rohatgi, “You have been convicted for killing the chief minister of a state. Has there been a precedent in the past where the President of India has pardoned anybody who is convicted of killing a chief minister.”Rohatgi said that in 2014 soon after the apex court laid down the law that inordinate delay in deciding mercy petitions will lead to automatic commutation, persons who were convicted of assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi got benefited under the rule. He cited the case of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar who too got the benefit of this decision as the Centre failed to act on his mercy petition for eight years.“There is clear violation of his fundamental rights ensuing from inordinate delay caused at the hands of the executive in deciding the said mercy petition,” Rohatgi said. With the Centre now issuing directions for commutation of Rajoana, Rohatgi asked the Court to direct the Centre to clarify its stand.The incident involving Rajoana involved a bomb explosion in the porch of the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat, Chandigarh, which led to the death of the then Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh along with 16 others.Rajoana was named in the FIR along with 15 others and taken into custody on January 14, 1996. On July 27, 2007, a Chandigarh court awarded the death sentence to Rajoana which was confirmed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on October 12, 2010.Rajoana did not prefer an appeal against this decision and instead filed a mercy petition before the President under Article 72 of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-on-death-row-convict-s-mercy-plea-pending-for-8-years/story-FvZpS1krlaN3IQuQrDmwQN.html

A police team reached the spot and recovered the body, the IG said, adding that a case has been registered in this regard and a search operation has been launched for the ultras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-ranger-hacked-to-death-by-maoists-in-chhattisgarh-s-bijapur-district/story-5R3aumudj1tea3dIUABTFM.html
12-09-2020||India||Visions for the future: The post-pandemic home||In July, the Indian Railways announced that it was working on a prototype coach with foot-operated soap dispensers, fixtures with anti-microbial titanium dioxide coating and air purification equipment in air conditioner ducts that would sterilise the interiors using ionised air — all to safeguard mass transit in a post pandemic future. Sachin Goyal, 35, read the news and rejoiced for a different reason. His family, comprising wife Ekta (35), daughter Divisha (4) and two sexagenarian parents had moved out of a bungalow in New Delhi’s Anand Vihar and into a rental apartment in Gurugram, a month before the national lockdown was announced on March 24 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, he was on the look out for the right kind of air conditioning system (ACs), since air circulation was a crucial factor in the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Goyal searched online for the equipment that the national carrier planned to use, and found a company, Plasma Air, that sold it in India. He then made a call to his AC service provider to procure eight pieces of the ionised air purifier.But that’s not the only thing that Goyal did to prepare for a post-Covid reality. The chartered accountant with his own logistics firm asked Dinesh Panwar — an architect-designer who drew up the plans for the Goyals’ newly bought apartment in Gurugram and into which they plan to shift in a few months — to make some significant design modifications.Panwar, who runs Delhi-based architecture and design firm Urbanscape, said that Goyal swapped the designs for a 250 sq ft area with the adjacent 450 sq ft area. Earlier, the smaller area was meant to be a living room, with a small dining area, the television and recliner seats — essentially, the family lounge room. The larger area was to be a drawing room with two seating areas to entertain a large number of guests. Now, the larger area will now house the family lounge; a wall has even been designated for a projector that will be connected to the computer so that four-year-old Divisha won’t need to stare at the laptop screen during online school and activity sessions.“I wanted a big, alishaan drawing room where we could entertain many guests. But now, we don’t know what the future will bring. In case of another pandemic or a lockdown, the area that we use daily should be more luxurious and comfortable. The drawing room for guests should also be separate from the rest of the house,” Goyal said. WATCH: What the independent villa could look like As the Sars-CoV-2 virus continues to ravage India — the country now has the second-worst outbreak of the disease in the world, behind only the United States — many begun to turn their homes into multi-functional spaces. The house, which has now turned into a school, playground and workspace, must cater to a variety of demands. What’s more, furniture makers have come out with a range of work tables with adjustable heights and ergonomic chairs to cater to what they forsee will be growing market, as tech giants such as Infosys and Wipro, Dell and Google, among others, ask their employees to work from home for the foreseeable future.“Work from home furniture which comprised about 3% of company’s sales has increased to 15 %. Overall, June, July and August achieved 60%, 70 % and 85 % of the normal demand with improvement seen month after month. We believe we will achieve normalcy from forthcoming festival season, which will also be supported by marriage season,” said Subodh Mehta, senior vice president (B2C) Godrej Interio, the furniture making arm of Godrej.Two products that have done well since they were launched during lockdown are a work desk with a separate hutch and a swivel arm that can allow more than one user to use the desk at the same time, and a chaise that allows a user to stretch out while working on laptops/tablets and thus create a comfortable working corner, Mehta said.WATCH: What an 1,800 sq ft apartment could look likePanasonic has come out a desk and 4-ft high partition which can be assembled at home to create a work cubicle at home.

READ: Post-Covid design: Envisioning the home in the new normal“Now that we are spending more time at home and having to share that limited area with our cohabitants, we need to work on optimising the available space. Partitioning off or zoning our interior between various activities and people, or during different times of the day, presents an easy option. The so-called broken plan — with screens, curtains and plants in the absence of walls — creates digital detox zones while other members of the household carry on with their work. The home might even adopt some well known typologies from open space offices, such as soundproof phone booths or objects with higher walls,” the document stated.“It’s not just about designing a two BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) or a three BHK anymore; it’s about designing a multifunctional space, since spaces inside a home can’t any longer have a singular purpose. So, customers are asking us to create collapsible partitions. They are experimenting with the idea of sound-proofing through acoustic panels and false ceilings. Customers are saying, ‘give me open spaces (like skylights or balconies) for the future’,” said Neelima Ronanki, vice president of design for HouseJoy, a company that provides a suite of services from appliance repair to interior design, construction and even home salon services.In Bengaluru, a client recently requested a design that would give her and her husband much-needed silence during work hours, and their two children private space after school. Ronanki’s team came up with an elegant solution: a mezzanine floor, between the ground floor and the first, “like a sort of box in an in-between space” where “the children can play video games or chat with friends without disturbing parents,” Ronanki pointed out.This focus on the interior is here to stay, said Amar Tendulkar, chief of design at Mahindra Lifespace Developers Limited. Tendulkar’s team conducted a survey among a small sample size of 125 families in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (across middle, and upper middle class, he said) over the past three months to gauge how their needs from their home and community has evolved over the course of the pandemic. Some of the themes that emerged included the need to re-evaluate the spatial configuration of interiors, flexibility being key; a need for sanitisation spaces in the lobbies and entrance areas of apartments; a shift from indoor, air-conditioned community spaces to outdoor ones (like gymnasiums); and, the need for balconies.“Balconies and decks have re-emerged in the Covid era as more families realise their importance. Balconies are like your own private outdoor space,” Tendulkar said, adding, “We are looking at doing this in some of our upcoming housing projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.”WATCH: What an 800 sq ft flat could look like  His own big take away from the lockdown, he said, was the re-emergence of the kitchen as an important space within the home. High-end appliances and a screen in the kitchen — something that current designs don’t usually take into account — are gaining importance and modern-day kitchens must account for this.“I used to love cooking, but I wouldn’t get much time to cook earlier. Now, having spent time in kitchen [during the lockdown], I realise the importance of smart appliances. Other male friends of mine are also realising this — a screen in the kitchen, for example, which can play recipes on YouTube,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visions-for-the-future-the-post-pandemic-home/story-XLWAaBc8vPfwAdl9ZSUx1H.html

HT reached out to three architects to share their visions of what a post-pandemic home could look like. Take a look at what they came up with. 800 SQ FT — ‘THE HOME IS PART OF THE COMMUNITY’ By Akshat BhattThese past few months, as we’ve been forced to stay indoors under lockdown, our homes have re-emerged as sanctuaries –– places of safe and socially-distanced work, leisure, and engagement –– and our verandahs, balconies, and terraces are thresholds from which we’ve stayed connected with the outside. The fundamental way we live, how we interact with our families or move within our homes hasn’t changed much (apart from repurposing rooms for quarantine or creating a dedicated quiet zone for work) and I don’t believe it will. I hope, however, that this pandemic acts as the catalyst of change towards more minimal, sustainable living. Our value systems need an urgent rethink. And this must start with an evaluation of what is essential for sustenance and how our homes connect to the outside world for delivery of these products or public services. What if our homes could be off the grid?   For the Covid-19 age, I envision low-rise residential developments, three to four storeys tall and navigable by foot. When compared to high-rise apartment buildings with high densities and large numbers of elevator banks and common spaces, this scheme would allow for easier and more efficient isolation and hence, curb the spread of the contagion. Each dwelling unit — around 800 sq ft —or a sector with three to four dwelling units, would have independent administrative control and access points serviced by small, autonomous public travel capsules, which would ply frequently with flexible routes right to the traveller’s destination, limiting physical interaction with others.  The architecture of the units would be based on modularity and create open-ended frameworks for flexible dwelling systems; open plan studio apartments with collapsible partition walls and roofs and flexible storage systems will allow residents to reconfigure their homes, enclosing and combining spaces or lending them to the greens, as needed. Within the unit, distinct zones would be created based on degree of sterility , from community spaces such as arrival courtyards, foyers, and formal living rooms to host guests, to spaces for the family to engage, to private rooms for individual inhabitants, which could be easily sealed off with movable partitions when needed. Isolation wards could be housed in the basement with direct access to the outdoors via sunken green courtyards for fresh air and light.Most importantly, these homes would be entirely self-sufficient. They will rely on ground water to meet their potable water needs and generate their own power with solar panels or photovoltaic arrays. Thermal massing will reduce heat gain and light wells will double as wind tunnels and enhance passive cooling; the reduced mechanical cooling requirements could be met with geothermal energy through earth air tunnels and displacement ventilation (conditioned air supply with diffusers near the floor and exhaust from ceiling height level to reduce mixing as opposed to conventional air conditioners that supply air from the side). Individual pockets of greens and open spaces on multiple levels will not just aid ingress of natural light and fresh air but also house grow-rooms for farming food through techniques such as hydroponics and aeroponics. All dry and wet waste generated will be treated on site with the compost being utilised as feed for farming, while all outgoing waste to the grid will be taxed to incentivise responsible resource consumption.We can no longer afford to think of homes in isolation, but as part of neighbourhoods and communities that promote safe and healthy living.

Until early 2020, one visualised schooling, working, exercising, eating and entertaining as outdoor tasks; the home was perceived as a retreat to disconnect oneself from the flurry of activities of the outside world. Today, however, the home must perform a multitude of these very functions, indoors. The pandemic certainly marks a shift in our psychology and behaviour, and it would be interesting to see how society changes as a result of it. One of the paradigm shifts that we may see altering is our architectural consciousness. As our relationships with our homes change, there will be a greater need to demarcate spaces in terms of functionality and usage. As the home becomes a space for both work and schooling, it will be necessary to create a balance between privacy and company. One can expect common areas to be connected in order to accentuate the feeling of togetherness. At the same time, privacy may need to be emphasized either through physical demarcations such as dancing doors, accordion doors, or bookshelves with planters, acoustic insulation to permit focus-driven activities, and creating activity-specific zones for different individuals (with staggered timings) within a shared space.  In a 1500 sq ft apartment house, with three bedrooms to accommodate an inter-generational family of four adults and two children, certain features like a large drawing room (to entertain guests), a closed kitchen (to provide privacy and keep the sounds out of the entertainment unit) are common. However, in a post-Covid home, large gatherings are not expected. So the space of the drawing and dining room can be reconfigured to create a tech-enabled home office, with video conferencing and screen projection facilities, as well as the space to accommodate a visitor. The master bedroom can also be reconfigured to create another home office, which is sound-proofed, well-lit, and well ventilated.  For the children, either of these spaces can double as a learning space during school hours; the adults could use the space afterwards in a staggered time approach. An open kitchen can turn into a meeting point for family members, even as the store or utility room at the entrance of the house can be turned into a dedicated zone to allow multiple sanitation functions: cleaning vegetables, sanitising deliveries, cleaning up after returning from the outside. A clear path should be demarcated for the elderly to walk unimpeded in the house.A similar emphasis will need to be paid to indoor air quality. Natural ventilation and sunlight are keys to a healthy indoor space. A happy space is one that takes into account the physical, emotional and mental well-being of its inhabitant. This period, thus, certainly calls for us to take a serious relook and redesign the physical spaces that we live in.

Consumed by the fear of contaminating your home, your safe place, you hesitate. You now find yourself in need of a ‘buffer zone’ — a place where you can leave groceries, online deliveries, and sanitise yourself before entering the house. You need enclosures for activities and for that, historical architecture has a solution: the foyer, the hallway or the verandah. Integrating a wet area for cleaning up (powder toilet) and a dry one (with spacious storage for cleaning/ sanitising material; shoes), gives us Zone 1. Similarly, domestic help and staff have an independent room even if they visit daily. This gives them privacy and a space to wash up, change and enter the home just as anyone entering the house and interacting with other inbound members, is expected to do.Social stability and work necessitated that we lived in fluid, multi-generational homes. In a post-Covid world however, this prevents effectively isolating the young and the elderly. However, this can be managed by staggering the time that three generations carry out different types of activities, across the morning and evening; in other words, multiple uses of distinct spaces.A garden is attached to the kitchen. You rely on homegrown produce for salads, vegetables and even the occasional fruit. Since everyone in the family cooks these days, the kitchen is open and is spectacularly clean. Every surface is anti-microbial and can be wiped down. The kitchen flows into a dining room and a living room. The open spaces provide much needed human interaction for the family — leisure for grandparents, a playroom for the children and the dining table can be converted into a work zone for everyone. All bedrooms have attached bathrooms, including the guest — this allows any one room to be a possible isolation area. This is Zone 2. Now we enter the zone of the “call”. Someone in the house is always on a call and it’s often video. You need a productive environment, a quiet space. Unaccommodating of the mid-day naps and the running children or those sunning themselves on the balcony, the call must be taken. Here we find that WiFi has rightly earned its place at the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy. The call requires the strongest WiFi available, and the bandwidth is being split amongst the kids taking online classes and several instances of Prime, Netflix and Youtube.For those of us lucky enough to have not seen the inside of a hospital this year, this is the most enduring image of the pandemic: Grown adults running out of, or into rooms, desperate for the minimal background noise necessary to have a conversation on the phone. Your post pandemic home will be designed around the need for robust Wi-Fi. The open plan, a legacy of modern 20th century design, will be replaced by more enclosed spaces with more focus on spaces designed around specific activities.Your post pandemic home will be radically different. For the foreseeable future, it has to double up as the office, the school, the mall, the gym and the park.
