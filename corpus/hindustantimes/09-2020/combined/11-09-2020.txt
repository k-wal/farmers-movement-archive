11-09-2020||News||Oil: The interplay of pricing, supply, demand||The technical committee of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)+ cartel met last month to reaffirm the whopping crude oil supply cuts in the global pipelines to rebalance oil markets in view of the huge demand destruction unleashed by Covid-19. However, it is not enough to just “manipulate” supply. Global oil demand has to be nudged up if oil producers are to retain their respective market share in the face of altered realities. For a start, West Asian producers will have to do away with discriminatory pricing regimes that adversely affect major global consuming centres in Asia. Although Saudi Aramco, one of the biggest players in the market, has slashed its official selling price (OSP) for its October-bound crude exports to Asia, this has to become an institutionalised practice given tightened refinery margins in recent times. This has led to refiners scrambling to replace some barrels with cheaper oil from the West, and also procure from the heavily-discounted spot market. Historically, major West Asian producers, such as Saudi Aramco and the Iraqi State Organisation for Marketing of Oil (SOMO), have been providing hefty discounts to the United States (US) and Europe to gain market share with a differential pricing system by pricing the same grade of crude oil higher for Asian markets. Asian refiners have been protesting for decades, calling it the “Asian premium”. Kuwait, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates typically follow Riyadh’s monthly pricing. This is declared around the fifth of every month, affecting about 12 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude bound for Asian markets. According to Indian oil records, the Asian premium against the prices for US ports, for instance, in December 2019, and January, February and March 2020 was $5.1, $6.29 , $3.71 and $7.3 respectively per barrel. The Asian premium for Arab medium crude in September is $0.19 for the US and $2.79 per barrel for Europe. This eats into the gross refinery margins of Asian oil companies and makes them scout for cheaper alternatives. The premiums fell sharply during April to July this year when global demand for oil had sunk by about 14 mb/d and Russia and Saudi Arabia had unleashed a price war. Meanwhile, even with producing cheaper crude, companies such as Saudi Aramco are losing their market share to unlikely competitors, for instance, Russia. Ironically, US shipments from Saudi Arabia to American ports slumped from 371,000 barrels a day (b/d) in June to 271,000 b/d in July — their lowest since 1986. August was even lower at 102,000 b/d.With the shale boom, the US has become the largest crude oil producer, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia. Crude from the US region has started flooding the Asian markets. For instance, the bilateral hydrocarbon trade between India and the US has touched $9.2 billion during 2019-20, marking a 93% increase compared to 2017-18 figures. India is now the fourth-largest export destination for US crude. China’s crude import from the US surged 492.25% between June and July while it slumped a record 27.9% in July from Saudi Arabia — pushing Riyadh behind Russia and Iraq as China’s third-largest crude supplier. August saw about 21 million barrels of crude coming into China from US oil fields — the largest volume for a month — and, reportedly, a total of 80 million barrels over July through December to comply with the Phase-1 Beijing-Washington trade deal signed in January. Although, shale production in the US that reached a high of 13 mb/d in February, this year may have left its best production days behind, $35 per barrel is enough for many of the drilled-but-uncompleted wells, or DUCs, to kickstart into action. Another price rally facilitated by Opec+ will fortify competitors in the American Gulf coast region as well as Canada, Argentina and China which are expanding their own shale gambit. This does not sit well for the petro-states, many of whose budgets are solely dependent on oil exports. Last month, Aramco said that its second-quarter profits plunged a massive 73% due to “strong headwinds from reduced demand and lower oil prices”.Opec, in its latest monthly report, states that world oil demand will fall by 9.06 mb/d this year instead of a 8.95 mb/d decline predicted a month ago. While peak demand is a highly-contested subject, the emergent story is that renewables are finding capital much easier than fossil fuels, making them increasingly competitive. With near-saturation of demand in the US and Europe, West Asian producers should focus on natural markets in Asia. Though the West Asian region may remain the central bank regulating crude currency, simply providing a floor to crude prices may turn out to be a short-sighted move to retain its grip on the oil geographies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/oil-the-interplay-of-pricing-supply-demand/story-h3hBKmj9J1SenHkEKky4FM.html
11-09-2020||News||The ordinance raj of the Bharatiya Janata Party||An ordinance is a temporary law made by the President of India (on the advice of the central government) when Parliament is not in session. An ordinance becomes a permanent Act (the law of the land) on being approved by Parliament within six weeks of reassembly.As Parliament convenes amid the Covid-19 pandemic from Monday, it will need to consider and approve ordinances promulgated over the past six months. Since March 24, when the lockdown was imposed, 11 ordinances have been signed by the President. With every session, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is brazenly rewriting the rules of Parliament. Cancel Question Hour, so the Opposition isn’t given a chance to hold the government accountable. Slash Zero Hour time by half, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, to deprive the Opposition of raising issues of importance. Misuse a constitutional tool such as an ordinance to mock Parliament, in a way it hasn’t been done in 70 years.Five of the 11 ordinances are broadly related to the outcome of Covid-19, coupled with two in the health sector. All the other ordinances are unrelated to the pandemic, including the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, and the three ordinances related to agriculture.These are the 11 ordinances that Parliament will be required to approve in the coming fortnight.Many previous Presidents have raised questions about individual ordinances. The current President, in his wisdom, prefers to go ahead without asking questions. Unchecked, the BJP government has embraced an unfortunate culture of ordinances. Some statistics are revealing. In the first 30 years of our parliamentary democracy, there was one ordinance promulgated for every 10 Bills introduced in Parliament. In the following 30 years, the ratio was two ordinances for every 10 Bills. In the 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19), the number jumped to 3.5 ordinances for every 10 Bills. In the current Lok Sabha it is, so far, 3.3 ordinances to every 10 Bills.Look at it another way. Between 1998 and 2004, when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in office, the government promulgated 9.6 ordinances a year. Between 2004-09 (United Progressive Alliance-I), 7.2 ordinances were issued a year and for UPA-II, it was down to five a year. Between 2014 and 2019, in the first term of the Narendra Modi government, the number shot up to 10 ordinances a year. About 10 ordinances were issued on the eve of the 2019 general election. Clearly, the BJP has a preference for short-circuiting democracy.Ordinances have to be approved by Parliament within six weeks of reassembly. So, is there really a problem, or are we in the Opposition only being sticklers? No, there is a problem. In fact, two problems. One, the BJP government thinks nothing of re-promulgating ordinances that have lapsed. This is a breach of convention and extremely undemocratic. But the Modi government has done it more than once. Two, a bill that seeks post-facto approval for an ordinance is often rushed through the House. The deliberation and fine-tuning, the pre-legislative stakeholder consultations and the committee scrutiny, are important stages in the passage of a law. Ordinances that hurriedly become Bills and then Acts bypass this process.Is the BJP government guilty of pushing laws that it wants in place without adequate parliamentary discussion or scrutiny by Parliament committees? Or while the country is distracted by a pandemic? Consider a few of the recent ordinances. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance is a response to the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scandal. There have been two parliamentary sessions since the scandal became public knowledge, and no draft bill was introduced. Similarly, permitting corporate farming, and liberalising agricultural trade regimes as well as produce movement to benefit big retailers, should have been preceded by adequate parliamentary debate. These are significant and controversial decisions. Has care been taken to address the information asymmetry between farmers who sell and big traders and corporations that buy? This could have been scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. The ordinance glosses over it — passing itself off as either pandemic relief to farmers or an economic reform. It is neither. The timing of such ordinances is very odd and no coronavirus-related gap is being filled.This problematic ordinance culture has extended to BJP-run states as well. During the lockdown, BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat issued ordinances diluting labour laws, without consulting worker unions and civil rights groups. Even the International Labour Organisation advised caution. On March 15, just before the lockdown, the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Ordinance was promulgated. It sought to impose punitive fines on those who damaged public and private properties during protests. This is a law reminiscent of the colonial era. To support and enable the implementation of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the central government is pushing states to amend their Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Acts. This will minimise the role of state market committees and risk creating agricultural cartels of big food businesses and retailers. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka have acted as per command and promptly promulgated ordinances. Where will this stop?Post Script: There are only three parliamentary democracies in the world that permit the ordinance route — India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The practice in India was adopted from the Government of India Act, 1935, where the viceroy could do as he pleased. In every other country, Parliament has to be convened in order to get a law passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-ordinance-raj-of-the-bharatiya-janata-party/story-NlVvn0pm6updxwYlj0gSvJ.html
11-09-2020||News||India will have to make hard choices||A recent policy brief issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace asserted that even in a pandemic world, India’s influence would enable it to become a strong counterweight to China. A cursory search of recent newspapers, policy statements, and even academic journals reveals this widespread belief.One may be forgiven for thinking that this idea dates to contemporary watershed moments of military or economic strength —such as India’s economic reforms of the early 1990s or the nuclear tests of 1998 — but this would be wrong. Shortly after India turned independent in 1947, and the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, The New York Times declared that independent India would become “a great counterweight to China”. Given that in the eyes of the world, India has apparently been in the process of becoming a counterweight to China for 70 years, it’s important to examine what this means. In other words, if India were a counterweight to China, what would that entail? And whom would it benefit?The concept of one country being a counterweight to another, or “counterbalancing” as it is sometimes known, comes from realist and neo-realist theories in international relations. If there is one dominant power either in the world-at-large or within a region, the best chance of reducing the likelihood of war is for one country (or a group of countries) to counter it by acting as a balance. A counterbalancing country would take deliberate and assertive steps to match the dominant power in not simply size and population but in military spending and prowess, economic power, global influence, participation in international institutions, the strength of its alliances, and its reputation. This would make it risky for the dominant power to go to outright war with the counter-balancer. The father of neo-realism, Kenneth Waltz, famously declared that the most stable world was one that was bipolar, much like the Cold War world with the United States (US) and the Soviet Union counterbalancing each other.Which brings us to the current post-Cold War world where the rise of China is a source of huge worry for the dominant power, the US. While the US’ capabilities and influence still outstrip China’s — simply put, it is a superpower and China is not (yet) — it is important for it to find allies with a common cause to counter China’s rise. Thus, when it comes to counterbalancing, particularly in Asia, the US thinks of India. This is partly because China and India are heavyweights in the region. It is also because India is a democracy, and the US, therefore, sees India as a country akin to it.What it expects is for India to undertake a number of significant actions that will cement its role as a counterbalancer. Expanding the Indo-US defence partnership is, of course, one — the US has, for example, agreed to transfer sensitive military technology to India, engage in industry collaboration including 5G networks, and hold high-level defence talks, and joint exercises. But it expects not simply a strategic partnership but one that is implicitly and, perhaps even explicitly, anti-China. The US thus wants India to undertake an expanded role in the Indo-Pacific as a member of the Quad (along with Japan and Australia). It would like India to strengthen its economic and naval profile in Southeast Asia; strengthen its relationship with Japan; develop its own security and economic capabilities and commit to regional partners; and counter China’s naval expansion in the Indo-Pacific, including by lending its voice to the negotiating of a code of conduct for China in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.All of this then begs the question of whether India wants to act as a counterweight to China. Here, the evidence gets murky. There is a reason that the idea of India becoming a counterweight to China has been floating around for 70 years with little end in sight —while the word “non-alignment” has essentially faded from the Indian government’s vocabulary, the word “alliance” has not replaced it. A counter-balancer needs formal alliances, not simply partnerships — since, by its very definition, counter-balancing involves both serious assertiveness in foreign policy, and, therefore, strong support from a coterie of other countries.But as external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, pointed out just a few days ago, at a forum with US Vice President Mike Pence, China and India as rising powers needed to reach some kind of “understanding or equilibrium.” His statement hints at the reluctance that has always existed in the Indian government to become the US’ geopolitical tool.So if not explicit counterbalancing, what then? What are India’s possible options in the geopolitical triangle? India could continue to develop its partnership with the US, and hope that a commitment to any alliances or assurances of explicit security cooperation would not be needed. It could move under a US security umbrella à la Japan and South Korea. It could move away from the US, and commit to non-alignment between any future American and Chinese poles. Or it could, in the least plausible scenario given the current climate, decide to take concrete steps that would lead to long-term rapprochement with China. All of these actions come with costs and benefits. But, all else being equal, at some point India will have to make a difficult choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-will-have-to-make-hard-choices/story-VbdCuhHG20N3W0wns8dHOM.html

11-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Shopkeepers found serving food to people drinking in the open to be booked||The police arrested 64 people from different residential areas of the city for drinking in their parked cars on Wednesday and Thursday. The police said strict directions have been issued to all shopkeepers, cart owners and restaurant owners in markets of residential areas, asking them not to serve food to people in cars to prevent them from drinking in the open. The police said action will be taken against shopkeepers if they do not follow the orders. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that only takeaway services will be allowed from food joints that do not have a dine-in facility. “We have received over 200 complaints from different residential areas of open drinking following which teams were formed on Tuesday. The teams have been directed to take action against those shopkeepers who are found serving food to people drinking in the open or in their cars. They will be booked under the Excise Act,” he said. The police said those drinking in the open were mainly arrested from Sector 56, 17/18 dividing road, Sohna Road, Sector 71, Sector 14, Palm Vihar, Sector 22, 23, and Golf Course Extension Road. The police said the people who were arrested were found drinking inside their cars and had even set up a bar on their car bonnet. In some of the cars, people had set up bars in their car boot space. Rao said the drinking in the open has increased after the lifting of the lockdown and opening of the liquor shops on May 6. People who find restaurants expensive prefer drinking in the open or in their cars,” said Rao. The police said it is important to curb drinking in the open to prevent drink driving. Recently, six accidents were reported where the suspects who rammed into cars were under the influence of alcohol. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that if in any case the offender is found creating nuisance under influence of alcohol, the person will be booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and can even land up in jail. “We conduct raids between 9pm and 2am in the market areas based on complaints. After two days of night patrolling, the number of parked cars in these markets have come down,” he said. Haryana excise and taxation department in February 2017 had notified that no person shall consume liquor at a place that has not been licenced or authorised under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, except one that is a dwelling house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-shopkeepers-found-serving-food-to-people-drinking-in-the-open-to-be-booked/story-JhtbG0LWKKkNQG8g4eFhVK.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Public window closure forces Chandigarh Police to shift complaint system online||The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the Chandigarh Police to opt for online complaint system following the closure of public window at the police headquarters, a move that caught many residents unawares. People have been turning up daily at the police headquarters to lodge complaints, only to find about the transition to the online complaint system. However, the website needs to be streamlined as the copies of most FIRs are yet to be uploaded on regular basis. Residents are finding it hard to file complaints through the online channel. Public window to open after employees’ recoveryWith four out of five police personnel posted at the public window testing positive for Covid-19 and one employee with high fever proceeding on leave, the Chandigarh Police department had on September 1 closed the facility. “The SSP public window on the ground floor at the police headquarters in Sector 9 was closed after four of the five cops deployed there tested positive for Covid-19 . The area was sanitised and will reopen only after the employees recover,” said Dilbagh Singh, in-charge of the public window. “We have pasted email addresses to which people can send their complaints. Many have started filing online complaints and the same are being forwarded to the officials concerned, but still people are turning up and we have to guide them to file online,” he added. “Residents can also approach us on Twitter. We will soon review how we can make the process more citizen-friendly,” said Vineet Kumar, Chandigarh senior superintendent of police. People can also send their complaints on dgpchd@nic.in; pssut-chd@nic.in and police-chd@nic.in till the public window reopens. “I had lost money to a developer, so had come to lodge a complaint here. But now I have learnt that the complaint is to be filed through email. They should have informed people about the closure of the public window,” said a resident of Sector 39, who didn’t wish to be named. Dip in complaintsThe public window closure has led to a drop in complaints received by the police, who said only about 10% complaints have been filed online. “Earlier, on an average, about 50 complaints were filed daily at the public window that were marked to different officers and police stations depending on their nature. But now, there is a dip, maybe because of lack of awareness or trust that online complaints would be looked into,” said a senior police official. The police department on its website had already shared email addresses of its officials, but residents used to visit the public window regarding their issues ranging from cyber or financial frauds to pending complaints or complaints against policemen. 44 cops infected so far At least 44 Chandigarh cops have tested positive for Covid so far, including one DSP (who has recovered), an inspector, three sub-inspectors, five ASIs, seven head constables and 27 constables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/public-window-closure-forces-chandigarh-police-to-shift-complaint-system-online/story-z8xOY8ildyPz5baEEEAXKL.html
11-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Man booked for raping woman, her minor daughter after sedating them||Gurugram: A man was booked for allegedly raping a 31-year-old woman and her 14-year-old daughter at gun point, on separate instances, after giving them some substance laced with a sedative, said police on Friday. The police said the suspect had recorded a video of the first incident and blackmailed the woman to molest her several times. He had allegedly threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they told anyone of the assault. According to the police, the two incidents took place in March and August this year, but the woman or her daughter did not approach the police earlier out of fear. The woman, a homemaker, lodged a police complaint at Sector 10 police station on Thursday, following which an FIR was registered. The police said the suspect was arrested by a team of crime branch earlier this week in another case related to the possession of an illegal weapon and booked under Arms Act at City police station. In the complaint, the woman said that the man posed as a friend of her husband and started visiting their house on the pretext of checking upon her husband, who was bed-ridden then and later died in June. In March, the woman’s husband had gone out of town to stay with his brother after suffering a heart attack. She said that on March 19, the suspect came to her house on the pretext of giving her a medicine. “I was lying down as my blood pressure was low. He gave me a medicine and said that my husband had sent it. It was probably laced with a sedative. After consuming it, I fell unconscious. He raped me and also recorded a video of the incident. When I confronted him, he pulled out a gun and threatened to kill my family. I did not share my ordeal with anyone as I was scared,” she said in the FIR. The police said after the incident in March, the suspect molested the woman several times but she kept to herself. A few weeks later, she accompanied her husband to Rohtak as he had suffered another heart attack and was admitted to a hospital there. The woman said that during her stay in Rohtak, her daughter had been staying at her mother’s place in Gurugram. “The suspect went to my mother’s house to pick up my daughter and made up a lie that he had come to take her to Rohtak to meet me. Instead, he took her to his friend’s house where he gave her a sedative, and sexually assaulted her. He threatened her too with a gun and told her that he would kill us all if she told anyone,” she told the police. The police said the woman returned to her house in Gurugram recently. The landlord told her that all her belongings were taken away by the suspect, who told him that he was their relative. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The incident was reported to the police on Thursday after the woman’s daughter shared her ordeal with her mother. Her mother, till then, was unaware that the accused man had sexually assaulted her daughter too. An FIR was registered immediately, and the woman and her minor daughter were provided counselling.” Sanjay Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 10 A police station, said, “The accused was arrested two days ago for a case of Arms Act and was sent to judicial custody. The victims said that they did not report the incident earlier due to fear. We will take the accused under production remand for this case.” A case was registered against the suspect under sections 376 (rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc with intent to commit and offence), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code, section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Sector 10 police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-man-booked-for-raping-woman-her-minor-daughter-after-sedating-them/story-lT7j5vH7lrzZu13qQ3ollJ.html

11-09-2020||Gurugram||Five large illegal structures demolished in Alipur near Sohna||Five large buildings that had come up without any permission in Alipur village in Sohna were demolished on Friday. Of the five, four had come up in a 10 acre colony being illegally carved out in Alipur village.  “The developer of the colony had no permission to sell, purchase or develop the land. The buildings were also illegal. The department had issued notices and carried out demolitions in this area earlier also but despite warnings, the land owners did not desist from selling plots and constructing illegal structures, which were demolished,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram who also has the charge of enforcement wing that spearheaded Friday’s demolitions. A large team of DTCP officials supported by Gurugram police reached the spot around 11am. Officials said no one came forward to oppose the demolition of the four buildings.The enforcement team also demolished another large illegal structure close to the Gurugram-Sohna road. “The owner of this building approached us and sought time but we did not give it as the building had no valid permission. We will keep demolishing the illegal constructions in the illegal colonies to send a message to dealers and owners that demolition will take place irrespective of the fact whether it is a boundary wall or an entire building,” said Bhath.As per an estimate by the department, around 100 illegal colonies have come up in the district due to unauthorised colonization and action had been taken against these. However, a systemic response to prevent these colonies from mushrooming the department has initiated a process for online issue of NOC and also starting mapping unauthorised colonies on urban map of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-large-illegal-structures-demolished-in-alipur-near-sohna/story-HIlRMMfB7RDsY7H0uzw7uO.html
11-09-2020||Gurugram||Illegal call centre busted in Gurugram; 4 held||The police busted an illegal call centre, operating from the basement of a guest house in Sushant Lok-1, that was allegedly duping people, especially those in English-speaking countries, under the garb of providing them with technical support. A raid lasting for several hours was conducted on early Friday morning and four people, including the owner, were arrested, said the police. At least 20 employees were let off after questioning. According to the police, the intelligence unit had received a tip-off that an illegal call centre was operating from the premises behind Galleria Market. A patrolling party of policemen took a round of the area and raided the premises around 1.30am. The police said, in the basement, 23 men and five women were found making calls, in a western accent, to potential customers abroad and offering them technical support services. During questioning, the employees allegedly said that they had been working on the directions of four individuals, identified as Manu Singh Tanwar, Arun Singh, Pushpendra Singh and Pankaj Yadav. Manu Singh, who earlier had a liquor business in Bhiwani, was the owner, and along with the other three aides, he started the operations. The police said Manu paid ₹15,000 per month to his aides, along with some incentives. The police said the accused persons were unable to furnish the documents required for running a call centre such as a licence from department of telecommunications, company registration, source of customers, and mode of payment. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The probe has found that the accused targeted people mainly in the US. They used voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) calls to dupe people into paying for technical support services. One computer, which had all the data, has been seized and a probe has been initiated.” Explaining the modus operandi, the police said the accused used to send an email to potential victims with fake pop-up error messages stating that a malware had infected their computer systems and if not rectified immediately, their personal and financial data would be compromised. “The pop-up messages would lock the user’s browser and repeated warnings such as “malicious malware detected” and “personal information is not safe” would flash on the user’s screen. In panic, the users would contact the helpline number mentioned on the screen. The calls were answered by call centre agents, who use fake aliases, and claimed to be from ‘Best Buy’ chain of stores. The user was asked to install a bogus paid application for a fee ranging between $100 and $3,000. The fee was taken in the form of gift cards from iTunes or Amazon,” said a police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity. A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66 D and 75 of the Information Technology(IT) Act at Sector 29 police station on Friday, said the police.

11-09-2020||City||Gurugram: High court allows HSVP to auction residential plots after gap of two years||Gurugram: The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) will be able to hold auctions of residential plots in the city after a gap of almost two years, as the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had put a hold on such auctions, has now removed these limitations. According to the authorities, the stay order, granted due to objections raised by oustees whose land had been acquired by the authority, has now been vacated by the high court.Officials said that as claims of the oustees are being processed by HSVP on priority, the high court has given a nod to the sale of the residential plots.As per HSVP rules, only those land owners, also called oustees, whose over 75% land has been acquired for development of residential sectors, are entitled to get a plot from the authority at concessional rates.The online auction will be held on September 29, and plots in sectors 5, 9, 9A, 19, 28, 31, 32A, 38 and 39 will be auctioned at a reserved price.Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, Gurugram said that they have prepared a list of residential plots and submitted it to the headquarters. “We have worked towards hearing the claims of the oustees whose land has been acquired and their claims for plots, under the oustees quota, are being processed on priority. The matter has been brought into the notice of the high court and we have received permission to conduct the auction for residential plots,” said Yadav. Apart from plots in estate one and two in Gurugram, HSVP will also auction residential plots in the estates of Daruhera and Narnaul on September 29. Officials said that a resident of Sector 4 had obtained the stay order from the high court on the submission that HSVP had allegedly not allotted plots to oustees, whose land had been acquired by the authority for various residential and infrastructure projects. The oustees had submitted in the court that till oustees are given plots, the authority should be stopped from selling residential plots, after which the high court had granted stay on the sale of residential plots.Last week, HSVP administrator had started processing the claims of around 300 oustees and during the hearing, held that several oustees were ineligible for getting a plot. The same was conveyed to the court after which permission was granted for auction of residential plots. Last month, the authority had sold commercial plots to the tune of Rs 65 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-high-court-allows-hsvp-to-auction-residential-plots-after-gap-of-two-years/story-jE0NE05qAkvEW6Rbdvy0vL.html

11-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police deploy 974 cops to curb snatching cases||The police have deployed 974 cops across the city from 43 police stations and crime investigation agency (CIA) to detect snatching cases. These personnel will regularly monitor the snatching-prone areas of the city and analyse CCTV footage, said the police. The police said the personnel have been instructed to reach the crime spot within 10 minutes of an incident being reported so that they can help the victim to lodge the case, record their statements, and monitor the spot. They have been provided with the latest GPS-enabled, wireless communication system, which is connected to 147 spots, 79 police control room vans, and 123 patrol bikes. They will also track the suspected stretches which can be used by criminals, said the police. According to the police, till August 31, at least 126 snatchings have been reported in the city this year as compared to 308 in the previous year. This period includes the 68 days of the lockdown, when only three cases were reported. Over one-fourth have been reported from the east (from places such as DLF phases 1, 2, Sector 29, Sushant Lok and Sohna Road) followed by the south (Sector 65, Sohna and Bhondsi), the west (Sector 5 and Palam Vihar) and Manesar. According to the police, the snatchers usually target victims near market areas and hospitals. Unsuspecting morning and evening walkers, majorly women, are their prime target. While 88 incidents were caught on CCTV cameras, the police are yet to identify suspects in 38 cases. A total of 46 snatching incidents have been reported from July 1 till August 31, including 17, which were reported in August itself. Besides, six incidents were reported in September. During the 68-day national lockdown, only three snatching cases were reported, said the police, adding that there was a spurt in snatching cases as soon as the lockdown was lifted. Thanks to the lockdown, the total number of cases till August this year are fewer when compared to the same period last year, said the police.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that from January to March, 71 cases were reported from all zones as compared to 104 the previous year. “Since the beginning of the year, there has been a dip in the snatching cases. Last year from January 1 to August 31, 308 cases were reported and this year, 126 snatchings were reported. In 2019, 28 cases were reported in August as compared to 17 of this year,” he said. Sangwan said they had conducted a crime mapping of the city, that has helped them in arresting 28 suspects involved in snatching. The police have solved 88 cases so far. The police said with the increase in the movement of people, the snatchers have also got active. “However, we have set up barricades across the city at 147 points to check street crimes, including snatching. We are hoping to witness a dip in snatching cases this year as compared to the last three years,” said Sangwan. In July, the police had identified 147 spots across the city that reported most of the crimes, including snatching.According to the data analysed for mapping crime, incidents of snatching were regularly reported from Old-Delhi Gurugram Road, Railway Road, Civil Lines, MG Road, Golf Course Road, Sector 23, Palam Vihar, sector 56, 57, 65 and Sohna Road. Police commissioner K K Rao said that the recent crime prevention programme will help in checking snatching cases. “We have chalked out a plan to control such cases and the crime teams have already been deployed in plain clothes with the new action plan. We are also analysing the CCTV footage to identify the suspects and the motorbikes used in the crime,” he said. The police said they have changed the positioning of checkpoints on the basis of the crime pattern that has emerged through mapping over the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-deploy-974-cops-to-curb-snatching-cases/story-zEWmDmlpNtldLqvFYzQQTP.html
11-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Victims of snatching to get psychological counselling||The Gurugram Police will conduct counselling sessions for victims of snatching after several women, who were injured while resisting snatchers, had to undergo counselling sessions for trauma from private hospitals, said officials on Friday. The sessions would start from Saturday. According to the police, three counselling sessions will be provided to each victim free of cost and a regular weekly update on each case will be taken.The psychologists working with the police will conduct the sessions on the second floor of the commissioner’s office near Rajiv Chowk. Further, in case of an emergency, they will also visit the victim’s house to provide counselling. The police said that the decision was taken after reports emerged that a few of the injured victims in the past few months were allegedly under tremendous mental distress. In some cases, the police had conducted private counselling sessions to help these women overcome their fear of being attacked by snatchers. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the cases of chain snatching and vehicle theft are a major concern for the police. Since January this year, a total of 126 cases have been registered under Section 379A (snatching ) and 379 B of Indian Penal Code(IPC) across different police stations in Gurugram. “Out of 126 victims, 86 were women who lost their mobile phones and gold chains. They were dragged for a considerable distance before the suspects fled from the spot on their two-wheelers. These counselling sessions will be held for the victims and if needed for their family members as well,” he said. The police said, in many cases, the women had reported that the ornament that was snatched was a gift from their in-laws. As such, they were reluctant to reveal the incident to their in-laws as that would have led to harassment or a rift in the relationship. Apart from trauma, this is another cause mental distress, said the police. Alpana Sharma (45), a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, who was visiting her sister-in-law in Gurugram’s Sector 5, became a victim of snatching on June 26. She said she had to attend counselling sessions because of the trauma but her condition is yet to improve.Sharma said, on June 26, she had reached Gurugram with her family to meet her ailing mother-in-law and had parked car near a sweets shop on the main road near the Sector 5 market. She was walking towards the shop when two boys wearing helmets came from behind and tried to snatch her gold chain, which was gifted to her by her in-laws. In the ensuing commotion, she fell down. “They dragged me for about 50 metres. When I felt that I could not hold on to my chain, I had to surrender. They fled the spot.I was bleeding and in terrible pain. My husband informed our relatives and took me to the hospital for first aid. I was discharged from the hospital on the same day but the incident still haunts me. I took a few counselling sessions but nothing much has changed,” said Sharma. In another incident, a 28-year-old housewife, a resident of Sector 23, was returning home on a two-wheeler from the hospital where her husband was undergoing treatment for kidney stones. It was around 7.30 pm, when two bike-borne men snatched her gold chain and sped away, leaving her injured. She suffered a fracture on her right arm and injuries on her head and face. “I could not tell anyone in my family. I took help of my friend to lodge a complaint and had to lie to my husband. The suspects grabbed me and pulled my chain. The impact was so hard that I lost control and fell down,” said victim on the condition of anonymity as her family is unaware of the case registered. The police said apart from the counselling session, they were also starting a preventive action programme for which the modus operandi of snatchers would be studied and crime teams and the staff of the police station concerned would discuss all the cases one by one. “The teams will study the timings of the incident, the spot from where it was reported and the modus operandi based on which a prevention plan will be made, so that it will be easier for crime teams to arrest them,” said Rao. All the police stations will share the details of the victims with the counsellors and a call will be made from the commissioner’s office to book appointment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-victims-of-snatching-to-get-psychological-counselling/story-DOJPZds9WoGwfDR9OFA4bO.html

But today, it took me one hour to deposit the bill at the counter. The authorities must increase the number of counters and deploy more staff so that long queues can be avoided.”‘Don’t know how to pay online’Another resident, Alok Khanna, said, “I prefer depositing the bill at the cash counter as I don’t know how to pay it online. The last date is September 20, I thought it is better to do it today. But after reaching the PSPCL office, I waited for 45 minutes and had to stand in a long queue.”Ramesh Kaushal, executive engineer (XEN, distribution), said, “We have limited space in the office at Fountain Chowk and a single employee is deployed.

Some of the owners removed on their own, but most of them didn’t comply with the orders. In the past two days, around 30 hoardings have been taken down. Ajit Singh, president, Shivalik Welfare Society, Kharar, said, “We welcome the move of the administration to remove hoardings from the NH-21 as per the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, but at the same time, the enforcement team in its two-day drive left few hoardings on the highway intentionally.”Former general secretary of Confederation of Residents’ Welfare Association, Zirakpur North, Manoj Sharma, said, “Our area is full of illegal hoardings, but the authorities concerned are not taking any action and simply following pick and choose policy to appease a few people.”The Punjab and Haryana high court had in 1995 issued directions to all deputy commissioners to remove hoardings on national as well as state highways as “these were not just eyesores but a traffic hazard which could divert motorists’ attention”. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We will not spare anybody who has installed hoardings in violation of the high court orders in the district .We would soon be holding drives in other subdivisions of Mohali. In case any person has any grievance for a hoarding on NH-21, he/she should lodge a complaint with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hoardings-on-nh-21-residents-accuse-mohali-administration-of-pick-and-choose/story-XuPblpTtVIlDOsWWKeMpqJ.html

According to market committee officials, prices are likely to stay on the higher side for the next couple of weeks.Onions, which were being sold for ₹30 per kg last week, are now being sold at ₹40 per kg. “As farmers in Punjab have not planted a lot of vegetables this season, we have to depend on Himachal Pradesh, which is why prices fluctuate,” said Rashwinder Singh who works as an auction recorder for Chandigarh Market Committee. He added that onion prices had gone up in Maharashtra with Nasik onions coming in the city at the wholesale price of ₹28 per kg from ₹17-18 per kg in the last week. The supply chain of vegetables coming from Himachal Pradesh has also been affected. The price of peas reduced to ₹10 and then went up by ₹40 in a span of two weeks. Officials said that prices of green chilies, tomatoes and potatoes may increase in the coming weeks as they are mostly coming from the hill state.Meanwhile, residents complain vendors are charging higher rates than those fixed by the market committee. “Every day, we receive complaints from various RWAs of overcharging. Most vendors were marking up prices by at least ₹10,” said Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation chairman Hitesh Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/supply-crunch-pushes-veggie-prices-up-again-in-chandigarh/story-bfKXadEh2B3DvzQdwBZwUM.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn notifies up to 200% hike in water tariff||Chandigarh residents will have to shell out up to three times for water with the administration on Friday notifying the revised tariff.The hike is between 50% and 200% depending upon the category of user and consumption level (see box). In addition to the tariff, water cess of ₹20 per month per connection is charged for maintenance of parks and green belts.The rates were last revised in 2011. The proposal for further hike was first mooted in 2014. Another attempt was made in 2018, but the municipal corporation House rejected it while seeking additional water supply for the city first.With Chandigarh, last year, receiving an additional 29 MGD (million gallons per day) water from Phases 5 and 6 of the Kajauli waterworks, the House approved 200-300% hike in June 2019. In face of opposition, the hike was slashed. Now, finally the administration has notified the revised tariff.While the House had recommended 10% increase in tariff every three years, the administration has kept it at 3% annually.‘Will also discourage wasteful use’Justifying the increase in rates, MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “The hike was very much needed, as for nearly a decade there was no revision. The city has one of the lowest water tariffs.”An audit department report had also asked the MC to revise the rates, since its annual losses from water supply had crossed ₹135 crore per annum from ₹41 crore in 2011. The report also observed: “As the annual recurring expenses are increasing by 10% to 15% every year, losses will further increase in the future, putting huge pressure on the MC’s coffers.”“The MC collects ₹90 crore per annum as water charges, but expenditure incurred to maintain the supply to its 1.8 lakh consumers is ₹225 crore,” said Yadav. Struggling to even pay salaries to its employees because of a severe financial crunch, the civic body expects to earn an additional ₹60 crore from the hike.The tariff increase will also discourage wasteful use of water. “The MC is not putting any additional burden on residents, particularly if there is no misuse. In the first two slabs, the increase is by ₹1 and ₹2 per kilolitre. Consumption of most of the households in the city is within these two slabs,” said Yadav.Sample this: A family of five persons, consuming around 21kl water per month (at 135 litres per person per day) is paying ₹54 right now. After the hike, it will be shelling out ₹81.Residents, Oppn decry moveStating that the hike would further burden residents who are already reeling under Covid-19 pandemic, Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said: “Why is there so much urgency in revising the tariff. They could have done it next year. They have also not improved or introduced 24x 7 water supply in the city.”Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition, said: “What else has the BJP government done except burdening people with taxes? They could have at least left water alone. We strongly oppose this move. The MC under the current mayor is rudderless and creating only problems for residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-notifies-up-to-200-hike-in-water-tariff/story-zycOE025IYA75OS5cWFybL.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC Bar poll committee refuses to hold elections||The election committee of Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association (PHHCBA) has refused to conduct elections for the high court Bar association. It was on Thursday that the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH), a statutory body, had asked district Bars in both the states and Chandigarh; and high court Bar association to hold elections for the executive committee on September 30 and October 1. The high court has nearly 4,000 registered voters. As of BCPH, it has over 1 lakh advocates as members in two states and Chandigarh and oversees the functioning of Bar associations. Chairman election committee, senior advocate, KS Sidhu in a letter to BCPH has said that the election committee met on Friday and unanimously decided not to participate in the elections. Thirteen out of 16 members had participated in the online meeting. On the one hand, Bar Council is making an endeavour to have the physical hearing of the cases expressing problems of online hearing but on the other hand, taking a contradictory stand to hold online elections without any serious necessity, the letter stated that many advocates have gone back to their native places with no online infrastructure to participate in voting. “The elected members of the committee stated that neither are any provisions in the Advocates Act or the rules which authorised Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana to suo motu conduct the elections of any Bar associations without the request of the concerned Bar nor there is any emergency of holding the elections,” the letter reads. It also says that two of the judges refused to be associated with the BCPH move because of a lack of transparency and secrecy of votes in the online mode, which is of paramount importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-bar-poll-committee-refuses-to-hold-elections/story-lhgOtoWMiXAkauqWYYQPeI.html
11-09-2020||City||Civil society groups urge SC to reconsider its slum eviction order||New DelhiMany members of the civil society, NGOs, and organisations working for the welfare of the poor and their land rights have urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its recent order to evict residents of 48,000 slum settlements on railway land within three months. In a statement issued on Friday by over 65 organisations, movements and associations of residents of affected slums, the civil society members pointed out that the SC order did not take into account the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) policy on relief and rehabilitation of slums, which was notified in 2015. They said the apex court also didn’t consider the Delhi high court’s 2019 order in the Ajay Maken vs Union of India case, where it said DUSIB’s policy applied on railway land too. According to the DUSIB policy, slum residents who have valid documents to prove that they have been living in that place since January 1, 2015, would have to be rehabilitated, even if the settlement is on government land. In the statement, the organisations raised the following demands:The SC should review its order; the Delhi government should accept and assert its responsibility to apply DUSIB policy on railway land; no demolition during the coronavirus pandemic; railways should work with communities to move these people to safe areas without forced eviction among others. The statement said the order would have “devastating consequences” for nearly 50,000 households, or over 2.5 lakh people”, during the pandemic. Some organisations that have come out in support and signed the statement are: Housing and Land Rights Network, Centre for Advocacy and Research, Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform, Delhi Rozi Roti Abhiyan, Railway Basti Jan Sangharsh Morcha, Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action among others. Gautam Bhan, urban researcher part of the team that drafted the statement, said the apex court had not taken some factors into consideration. “There is a history of legal right to resettlement and protection against forced eviction. The city has a policy for rehabilitation of slum residents and it is applicable on those living on railway land. This fact, we think, was not placed before the court partly because those affected by the order were not part of the case,” Bhan said. Bhan said displacing more than 250,000 lakh slum dwellers during a pandemic will only make matters worse for them. “They are already suffering because of the impact of the pandemic on their livelihoods. This forced eviction will condemn a generation to destitution”. Various organisations working for the welfare of urban poor and their rights are planning protests and events in the days to come to demand a review of the order. Shakeel Ahmed, convenor of Basti Suraksha Manch, said, “We want their voice to be heard. The order pertains to an old case and the affected parties didn’t even know about it. There is a need to rehabilitate these people. We are against forced eviction. We are planning to protest against it.” Indu Prakash, facilitator, CityMakers Mission International and member of the SC-appointed committee on monitoring of homeless shelters in Delhi, said, “….It is supreme injustice done to these people, especially at a time when the country is fighting a pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-society-groups-urge-sc-to-reconsider-its-slum-eviction-order/story-HiQY6LyE9bPqzsgcgL9OXI.html

The case, registered by the NIA on December 9, 2015 under relevant sections of the IPC and the UA(P) Act, pertains to the larger criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths for the proscribed terror group through different social media platforms, the NIA said.The accused had formed Junood-ul-Khilafa-Fil-Hind organisation, seeking to establish a caliphate in India and pledging allegiance to ISIS, to recruit Muslim youths to work for the ISIS and commit acts of terrorism in India at the behest of Syria-based Yusuf-Al-Hindi who is purportedly the media chief of ISIS, the NIA said.The NIA filed chargesheets against the accused persons in 2016-2017.This case was first of its kind in which terrorist conspiracy of this magnitude involving online radicalisation was effected on cyber space in the aftermath of declaration of Islamic Caliphate by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, the NIA had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-court-convicts-9-isis-operatives-for-conspiring-to-launch-terror-attacks-in-india/story-3sd0pqMl3HZb9dXrA2T1wM.html
11-09-2020||City||AS Covid cases spike, Ghaziabad moves to secure containment zones||With the total Covid-19 cases in the district crossing 10,000 and rising, the Ghaziabad district administration has turned to ensure compliance of all containment zone protocols. As on September 10, the district has 321 containment zones that are supposed to remain closed to all activities and movement of people except for essential services. That, however, has not been the case on the ground. On September 4, HT had highlighted that the surveillance and barricading measures to check these restrictions were lax in several containment zones. “We reviewed the situation and asked the secretary of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) to take help of municipal commissioner and respective incident commanders (in-charges of the containment zones) to ensure that all protocols, including sealing, are followed” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. According to official records, there is a major surge in number of Covid-19 cases in prime localities of Ghaziabad. The highest affected localities are under Kavi Nagar police station area that had 293 fresh cases from September 1 to 10. The other police station areas are Indirapuram with 278 fresh cases, Sihani Gate 201, Sahibabad 195, Kaushambi 71 and Vijay Nagar with 123 cases, among others. “We suspect that most fresh cases are coming in from existing containment zones. These zones must be secured in order to contain the spread of infection,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. Dr. V B Jindal, president of the Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association, agreed. “It would also be handy if all residents of these containment zones are tested,” he said. The district magistrate said that the secretary of the Ghaziabad development authority has been given additional responsibility to supervise the containment zone activity after the previous officer, an additional district magistrate, had turned positive for Covid-19. The Ghaziabad district, according to state control room records of September 11, has tally of 10219 Covid-19 cases which includes 1642 active cases which is the highest single day figure since March. MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner, said that the corporation will be most willing to help out the district officials. “On our part, we have got prepared rolls of tapes like the ones which are used to secure scene of crime, which we have provided to all police posts to mark and secure the zones. If the administration requires wooden poles instead, our quick response teams will make them available,” he added. According to the July 24 order of the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary, the area of category-1 zones, having one positive cases, is defined in a radius of 100 metres or an entire Mohalla, whichever is less, while the category-2 zones are created in a radius of 200 metres along with a buffer zone on outer periphery whose area is to be assessed on the basis of local conditions. In the recent unlock 4 directions issued by UP chief secretary, RK Tiwari, had said that the lockdown in containment zone will continue till September 30 and the containment zones are to be defined on the basis of July 24 directions besides only essential services will be allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-cases-spike-ghaziabad-moves-to-secure-containment-zones/story-r1rkE4HIgYaY0vJPenLa8K.html
11-09-2020||City||UP allows on-demand Covid testing for certain categories of people||The Uttar Pradesh government has allowed on-demand testing for certain category of persons who can now get themselves tested without having to produce any medical prescription. It also puts the onus on laboratories to ensure details of those tested are accurate.The categories of patients cleared for on-demand testing include those who wish to travel to any such place where authorities require a “Covid negative” report; those who came in contact with a Covid-19 patient; those who have symptoms like cough, fever or breathlessness, among others linked to influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness, and those who need to be admitted to a hospital or require surgery. The state order issued by UP additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad does not expand the testing fully considering the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR’s) new guidelines issued earlier this week allowed for testing of all, without categories, on demand. The ICMR, however, is an advisory body and state health authorities are allowed to prepare their own testing rules.The state now requires laboratories to keep copies of the testing subject’s particulars.“At times, people provide incorrect phone numbers. The government order mentions that it will now be the responsibility of the laboratories to verify the phone numbers. They should keep a photocopy of the identification (Aadhar, voter id etc) from the person getting tested. Further, those who are getting tested will also have to act responsibly else they may face action. If a person is getting himself/herself tested at one or more laboratory, they will have to produce the same mobile number and same identification document at all locations. This will help authorities in identifying contacts,” he said. The order also specified the modalities for people who need to be tested as part of routine surveillance in containment and non-containment zones besides those in hospital settings, as per the new ICMR guidelines. Ghaziabad health department said it will soon implement the directions. “We have about 20 government testing locations. There have been instances where people provided wrong addresses and mobile numbers. In such cases, we provided details to police to trace them. Our staff at the testing centres are also verifying the mobile numbers (by calling the given number) on the spot,” said Dr. NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad. Health minister’s visitOn Friday, UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh visited Gautam Budh Nagar and reviewed the situation in the district and Ghaziabad, and stressed on contact tracing.“I’ve asked the health officials of GB Nagar district, to increase the testing and contact tracing to the maximum limit. They have also been asked to keep a constant watch on spread of the virus and make the containment zones accordingly,” he said. Gautam Budh Nagar CMO Dr. Deepak Ohri, who was also present in the meeting, said that the minister analysed daily sampling data. “He also took the details of patients presently admitted in different Covid-dedicated hospitals. He also asked for the details of patients under home quarantine,” he said. “The minister stressed on contact tracing in order to control spread of infection and also asked officials to keep in check the fresh rise in number of Covid cases,” Dr Gupta said.Officials added that about 90% of testing in Ghaziabad is done at government facilities while the rest at private laboratories. Till September 10, the district completed 231192 samples of which test reports of 228232 were received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-allows-on-demand-covid-testing-for-certain-categories-of-people/story-bHSHhdH5EeAWS3qrenyFKO.html

While around 250 acres of land has been identified in Sector 28 close to Yamuna Expressway for this, the Kalam Institute of Health Technology (KIHT), Visakhapatnam, has been assigned to make the detailed project report (DPR) for this park.Arun Veer Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Yeida, said that as per the requisition of the Central government, the authority has sent its application to the state government. “The state will send this application to the Centre before September 27. The Centre, in consent with the Niti Aayog and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), will check its feasibility, after which the in-principle approval may be given to us,” he said. He further said that after getting in-principle go ahead from the Centre, Yeida will submit its DPR, which is being made by the scientists at KIHT. “If the Centre approves our proposal, it will give ₹25 crore or 70% of the project cost of setting up of the medical device park, whichever is less. The park will provide necessary infrastructure where companies can easily plug and play. The main reason behind setting up the medical device park is to support the Make in India initiative and provide world-class products at an affordable price for treatment,” he said. Singh, who is also the CEO of Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the nodal agency for the international airport scheduled to come in Jewar, said that if everything goes hassle free, the project will take shape within six months. “What gives us an upper hand is that the proposed site is near to the upcoming airport at Jewar.

11-09-2020||City||Woman held for planning, executing murder of younger brother over a personal grudge||The Ghaziabad police Friday arrested a 45-year-old woman for allegedly planning and killing her 35-year-old brother who, six years ago, had allegedly shot at her son in Loni. The police said that the man was gunned down Thursday night, allegedly by the woman Warisha, her family members and accomplices. All except Warisha and one of her sons Golu are on the run, police said. According to eyewitnesses, Asif Malik was waiting for a construction contractor in Prem Nagar locality of Loni, along with his brother Nafees Malik and sister Shirin Malik, when a group of their relatives arrived there around 8.30pm Thursday and opened indiscriminate fire on Asif, killing him on the spot. “The victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to a hospital in Delhi where he succumbed to injuries. Shirin identified one of the assailants as her older sister Warisha and gave a police complaint against her and named five others as well. We registered an FIR against the seven suspects and arrested Warisha for the conspiracy and murder of her brother,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). Asif, police said, owned a fleet of cycle-rickshaws and autos which he used to rent out on a daily basis. According to police, Asif and his nephew Golu (Warisha’s son), aged 25 years, had some previous enmity. Police said Asif had allegedly shot at Golu, and also stabbed him, about six years ago over some dispute. Asif had an attempt to murder case against him in that incident, which was being heard by a Ghaziabad court. Shirin said in her police complaint, “Golu nursed a grudge against Asif after that. On Thursday night, Warisha had come along with her husband, her other son and a few men to the spot where we were waiting. Warisha then asked the men to open fire at our brother. They fired multiple shots and fled the spot. I took my brother to a hospital in Delhi but he could not be saved. I identified all the assailants and gave a police complaint.” The FIR names Warisha, her husband Wahabuddin, her sons Sajid and Golu (only for conspiracy as he is currently in jail in connection with another murder). The FIR also names two others who were part of the group, according to Shirin. “During the investigation, it came to light that Warisha was in constant touch with Golu, who is currently lodged in Delhi’s Mandoli jail, over phone. Since phone calls to family is allowed, he and his mother planned Asif’s murder. We have arrested Warisha while the others are on the run. They will soon be arrested,” Jadaun said. Warisha has been booked under the IPC sections 302 (murder), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) at the Loni police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-held-for-planning-executing-murder-of-younger-brother-over-a-personal-grudge/story-VgiG68pKV7V6jb8JfX4ZOI.html

The trauma centre will cater to farmers and accident victims who need immediate medical aide,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), Yeida .Yeida has allotted the land free of any cost.As per the estimate of Yeida officials that manages the Yamuna expressway, two to three accidents take place daily on it. The expressway has witnessed over 750 deaths since it opened in August 2012. Accidents on the Noida-Greater Noida and the Yamuna expressways are often severe leaving victims in need of immediate treatment than can be available in the vicinity. In accident cases, the first hour – referred to as the golden hour – is crucial as prompt medical treatment during that time can prevent many deaths, said officials. “The facility, once operational, will prove to be beneficial because the accident victims will be able to get medical help without any loss of time,” CEO Singh said.The district administration said that official formalities to get the work on the facility started are ongoing.“As of now, a deadline as to when the work will start on the ground has not been set. But, the project has been sanctioned and formalities such as preparing a tender and a budget are under process. The Yeida has allotted the land for free for this project,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh said that on August 24, he had met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and health minister Jai Pratap Singh and raised the demand for setting up a multi-speciality hospitality in the area.“After we met the UP CM and the health minister, the state government has approved a 200-bed multi-speciality hospital along with a trauma centre. In the absence of a hospital, the farmers and accident victims would depend on Delhi hospitals for emergency cases.

11-09-2020||Election:||‘Big blow’: Ahead of Bihar polls, two Congress MLAs and RJD senior join JD(U)||In a blow to the Congress party ahead of Bihar assembly polls, two of its sitting MLAs - Purnima Yadav and Sudarshan Kumar - quit the party to join the Janata Dal (United) on Friday.Former minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Udai Narain Rai alias Bhola Rai, who represented Rabhopur assembly constituency of Vaishali district, also accepted the JD(U)’s membership at a function held at the party office in presence of Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh.Purnima Yadav, who is the wife of JD(U) legislator from Nawada Kaushal Yadav, was fielded on the Congress’s ticket from Govindpur constituency of the same district in 2015 under an adjustment and won the seat. Her husband had previously declared that she would be joining her original party (JD-U) ahead of the assembly elections and contest from the same seat.Barbigha MLA Sudarshan Kumar, grandson of former Congress stalwart Rajo Singh, finally joined the JD(U) on the insistence of minister Ashok Choudhary. Sudharshan was among the legislators who had planned to leave the Congress after Choudhary was removed as the state chief in September 2017.Also read: ‘BJP won’t rest till Sushant Singh Rajput gets justice’ - FadnavisCongress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, however, said that the party was aware of the desertions well in advance and never sought to keep them in its fold after they kept them disassociated from the party’s functions.“Their departure would not affect the health of the organisation anyway,” said Mishra.The JD(U) eyes a major gain in Bhola Rai’s desertion to the RJD as he had allegedly left his Raghopur constituency for election of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family members, including opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Currently, Tejashwi Yadav is an MLA from the same constituency.RJD chief spokesman Bhai Birendra said that Bhola Rai was made MLC and a minister by the party chief for his gesture. “No other party would give him the honour and respect which he received by the RJD. However, he had left the party long ago and his joining to the JD(U) would not affect the RJD’s prospects anyway,” said Birendra.Last month, three RJD MLAs - Chandrika Rai (Parsa Assembly constituency), who is also the father-in-law of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav; Jaivardhan Yadav alias Baccha Yadav (Paliganj) and Faraz Fatmi (Keoti) - had joined the JD(U). Fatmi was expelled from the party on the charges of indulging in anti-party activities.Spokesman of Upendra Kushwala-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), which is the constituent of Grand Alliance, Abhishek Jha also bade adieu and joined the JD(U). Building construction minister Ashok Chaudhary was also present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/big-blow-ahead-of-bihar-polls-two-congress-mlas-and-rjd-senior-join-jd-u/story-dP9U32TyiZSrRvt4WHLOIO.html
11-09-2020||City||Gautam Budh Nagar gets permanent Lok Adalat to hear public utility related grievances||The Gautam Budh Nagar district has got permanent Lok Adalat (PLA) which will redress grievances of the people regarding public utility services.The Uttar Pradesh State Legal Services Authority (SLSA) recently announced to constitute permanent Lok Adalats in 24 districts of the state. Complaints against educational institutions, hospitals, nursing homes, housing societies and developers, among others, can be filed at the permanent Lok Adalat (PLA). In GB Nagar, PLA will function from Alternate Disputes Redressal Centre building at district courts complex in Surajpur, its newly appointed chairman Allah Rakha Khan, a retired district judge, said on Thursday.“I have joined, along with two members. Other staff members are being appointed. We have started registering complaints,” said Khan.“Public utility services complaints can be filed at the permanent Lok Adalat, which include complaints against educational institutions, hospitals and housing societies which have been added to public utility services,” said Khan, adding that some other services whose complaints can be filed at PLA include transport , telephone, insurance, and municipal services.Cases having value up to Rs 1 crore can be filed at the PLA. The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) secretary Sushil Kumar said, “PLA will function from Alternate Disputes Redressal (ADR) centre. It has two floors and presently DLSA offices are located at the ADR centre. Now, the ground floor will be used for PLA, while DLSA offices will be shifted to the first floor. Till staff for PLA are appointed, DLSA staff will work for the adalat.A permanent Lok Adalat is a special tribunal which is not a court and its decision is not subjected to successive appeals. National Lok Adalat and other Lok Adalats being held from time to time in the district will function as usual at the scheduled period, DLSA officials said.Sanjeev Verma, president, District Courts Bar Association, said, “Permanent Lok Adalat will be very beneficial for resolution of complaints related to public utility services. Students and housing society residents can utilize this platform for early resolution of their issues.” Sardar Singh Bansal, an advocate, said, “I have started motivating clients to file cases at PLA as it is a way to get speedy redressal.”Residents have welcomed the SLSA’s move. Pawan Mangal, a resident of SDS NRI Residency, said, “Permanent Lok Adalat will be a good platform for us to get our issues resolved. UP-Rera is interested in possession or refund cases, and consumer courts take years to decide a matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gautam-budh-nagar-gets-permanent-lok-adalat-to-hear-public-utility-related-grievances/story-9ljcBXAKDma682hDF5GCeN.html
11-09-2020||City||10-year-old rivalry behind property dealers’ murders; two suspects held||The Greater Noida police on Friday arrested two suspects for allegedly killing two property dealers in the parking lot of a high-rise in Greater Noida west on Monday night.The police said the arrested suspects Mohit Vats, 28, and his uncle Suresh Sharma, 51, hired two sharpshooters – Tek Chand and Daya Chand – and one Omveer, to murder the property dealers to seek revenge from them. The two suspects were arrested from the Galaxy Roundabout in Greater Noida West. The police have launched a search to arrest the two sharpshooters and their Omveer.The police said the victims, Dal Chand Sharma, 32, who is from Faridabad in Haryana, and his friend Arun Tyagi, 22, and the arrested suspects shared an enmity that goes back to more than nine years, and five persons have been killed in the aftermath of the feud so far. Both the group members are residents of Faridabad in Haryana.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida central, said the property dealers Dal Chand Sharma and Arun Tyagi, were inside Dal Chand’s Tata Harrier SUV in the parking lot of Ajnara Le Garden, a Greater Noida west residential society, on Monday night when they were killed. “Two sharpshooters - Tek Chand and Daya Chand – entered the society after conducting a recce. They approached the victims, knocked on the car’s windows, and sprayed bullets from both the front windows. Sharma received seven bullets and died on the spot, while Tyagi received three bullets and was wheeled to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead,” DCP Chander said.The double murder had sent shock waves in the society and Bisrakh police had registered a case of murder against unknown persons and launched an investigation. The victim’s family told the police, they said, that they had an enmity with Mohit Vats’ family. The police also said nine years ago, Dal Chand’s father was chosen as the head of his village and a rivalry ensued with the suspects due to the election.“Police investigation further revealed that in the past, victim Dal Chand’s elder brother Rajendra Sharma and Vats’ elder brother Krishna used to work in partnership. However, their relationship turned sour and they parted ways later. In 2011, Krishna allegedly killed Rajendra and his friend, one Kapil, in Haryana,” Chander said.The police said that in 2017, Dal Chand had allegedly killed Krishna in Mathura to avenge his brother’s death. He had served six months in jail after in connection with the murder.Chander said that when Dal Chand was released on bail four years ago, he shifted his base to Panchsheel Greens Society in Greater Noida West. “He opened a property dealership office in Ajnara Le Garden in Greater Noida West, where the murder took place,” he said.Meanwhile, six persons— including Mohit, Suresh, Omveer, and others—were in jail for six months in connection with Rajinder’s murder.Chander said Vats, Suresh roped in Omveer, Tek Chand and Daya Chand to murder Dal Chand. “Omveer had conducted a recce and informed the two sharpshooters about the latter’s whereabouts. The two shooters had reached the society’s back door, but the security guards refused them entry since they were not residents of the society. The two gunmen then came to the front gate and had an easy entry into the society somehow. The criminals sprayed the bullets at the two victims and fled the spot in a car parked outside,” Chander said.Mool Chand Sharma, Dal Chand’s brother, admitted that the two groups had a personal rivalry for some ten years. “The two persons arrested on Friday are the masterminds behind the murders. We hope the police arrest the sharpshooters who are on the run currently,” he said.The police have also served a notice to the maintenance department of Ajnara Le Garden society for alleged security lapses. R P Singh Pawar, owner of Evergreen Securities Private Limited—who is responsible for the society’s security— said that the suspects had entered through a smaller gate which was unmanned. “There was a security guard at the parking area, and this gate was unmanned at that time of the incident. We have closed this gate now,” Pawar said.Greater Noida police said they will also soon ask all the high-rises in Greater Noida and Greater Noida west to conduct a security audit of their premises and sensitise the security personnel not to allow entry of any outsider without proper checking and verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-year-old-rivalry-behind-property-dealers-murders-two-suspects-held/story-pFFMDsbmVO1ZhENbvN0OGK.html

We then informed the police and a team from Rabupura police station reached the spot,” he said.Sanjay Sharma said his family had named the suspects in some cases of petty crimes (causing hurt etc) and were being pressurised to reach a compromise. “We feel that the four suspects have attacked my cousin over the same issue,” he said.Vineet Kumar, station house officer, Rabupura police station, said that the victim’s family and the suspects live in the same neighbourhood and share a personal enmity. “Based on a complaint given by the family, we have registered a case against four persons under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 324 (causing hurt with deadly weapon), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. “We have registered a case against the four persons and launched a search to arrest them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-man-assaulted-by-four-persons-in-greater-noida-over-personal-enmity/story-5kvgolUY8AfIWofvsJMt9K.html
11-09-2020||Noida||Respite from heat likely in two days||There may be some respite from the soaring mercury over the weekend, the weather department has said. With no rain, dry weather conditions dominate most of north-west India, including western Uttar Pradesh. According to the weather analyst, the region may start receiving easterly winds from Saturday night to Sunday onwards which will bring the mercury down marginally. However, the mercury may drop by three to four degrees only after September 15 with high some chance of rains. “The region is receiving hot and dry weatherly winds and the rainfall activities have also stopped. It is not just in the national capital region but the rest of north-west India as well. With clear skies, the temperatures have soared too. We can expect light rains only after September 15. The easterly winds will reach the region in next two days, which will bring moisture and start showing their effect, however, the temperatures will fall by three to four degrees a day after by September 14,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The Friday’s maximum temperature was recorded at 37.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees above the season’s average, against 36.4 degrees a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 26 degrees Celsius, against 25 degrees a day earlier. The humidity oscillated between 77 to 47 percent, with day getting drier towards the afternoon. “The temperatures may marginally drop by next 24 to 48 hours due to the moist and comparatively cold easterly winds due to a low pressure area being built over the Bay of Bengal. Though the temperatures will begin to fall but so will the humidity rise. There are high chances of rains after September 15, with a maximum probability between September 17 to 18,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/respite-from-heat-likely-in-two-days/story-R8vrD7fAo8yqD141N5H68H.html

11-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGI researchers find more manifestations of a rare genetic disorder||A pioneering research carried by the rheumatologists at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, in the field of systemic vasculitis has shown that a disease called DADA2 which was previously known to occur predominantly in children, also occurs in adults.DADA2 is a rare genetic disorder that involves inflammation of the body’s tissues, especially the tissues that make body vessels.This disease was recognised very recently in 2014 and is caused by a defect in the ADA2 gene which results in a deficiency of the ADA2 enzyme.“What was known till now was that this disease manifests in the form of vasculitis, immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure. The median age of involvement of all the 210 cases known till now was 4 years, whereas the present study has had a median age of 15 years with patients presenting even as late as in the fourth decade of life. This disease was known to present with brain strokes, bad extensive skin rashes, limb gangrene and also other internal organ involvement,” the researchers noted.The researchers led by Professor Aman Sharma, rheumatology services, department of internal medicine, have reported manifestations not known to be associated with this disease till now like hemorrhage in the lungs, infarction of the pancreas, and heart involvement.The research findings have been published online in ‘Arthritis and Rheumatology’ an official journal of the American College of Rheumatology.Prof Aman Sharma said that it is important to recognise this entity since strokes do not recur if the treatment is started. Researchers called for spreading the awareness about a disease that can have various devastating manifestations including stroke in young and other significant major organ involvement, the recurrence of which can be prevented by prompt diagnosis and early appropriate therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgi-researchers-find-more-manifestations-of-a-rare-genetic-disorder/story-JjQUewslhxFi7mNvKIZSBI.html

In this interview, he says farmers need to be involved in policy making. What went wrong at the protest rally?We had informed the district administration that the rally will be peaceful and were on our way to the venue. Police imposed restrictions and did not allow farmers to reach Pipli grain market. Even elderly farmers were beaten up, forcing us to block the national highway 44. Due to covid-19, norms on protests and rallies are in force. The government has adopted double standards. Ruling party leaders have been holding rallies, with even deputy chief minister Dushayant Chautala himself addressing a rally in Shahabad just recently. Are these guidelines only for farmers? The government wanted to suppress farmers’ voice and brought in these ordinances during the lockdown, instead of discussing these bills in Parliament.You had unsuccessfully contested assembly polls on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket. Are you using this protest for politics? Everybody has a right to join politics. I am not using this platform for political ambition. Farmers should be involved in policy making. If farmers had representation in Parliament, nobody would have dared to pass such anti-farmer laws.Political parties are now supporting farmers. Your take?I don’t know why parties are coming forward now, but what did they for farmers, when in power is my question to them. They must also explain what will they do, if they return to power. Farmers should not be used for political advantage. What next for farmers?The government must withdraw the ordinances by September 14. Otherwise, protests will be held in all district headquarters on September 15. After four days, on September 20, all roads in the state will be blocked for three hours.A farmer, who got injured, was a Cong worker and accompanied party leader Randeep Surjewala to a press conference.Some farmers might have political connections, but there were also farmers who were supporters of other leaders, like Dushyant Chautala at the protest. They had gathered to protest as a farmer. They were beaten up for being a farmer.You have been booked for attempt to murder, among others.These are pressure tactics. Farmers remained peaceful. The government can suppress farmers, but we are not worried about such FIRs. The agitation will continue, till we force the Centre to withdraw these black laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agitation-to-continue-farmers-need-say-in-policy-making-haryana-bharatiya-kisan-union-chief/story-xYfK87OHb8tD0Ejbab43XK.html

11-09-2020||Delhi||20,000 tickets issued on Delhi buses in trial run of e-ticketing system||Around 20,000 tickets have been issued to passengers on Delhi buses on select routes, as part of the ongoing trial run of the new contactless ticketing system, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said Friday. The minister reviewed the trial run of the new system Friday by hopping on to a cluster (orange) bus and purchasing a ticket through the phone application ‘Chartr’. This is the second phase of trials being undertaken by the state transport department to introduce contactless ticketing on each of its over 6,600 buses. “Now that we’ve increased Covid-19 testing and are witnessing another spike in cases, an app-based contactless ticketing is crucial in minimising person-to-person and surface contact. The second phase trial of the e-ticketing app was started on 332 cluster buses on 14 routes earlier this week. The trial will also be extended to 29 DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses on Route Number 534. So far, around 20,000 tickets have been issued through the app, of which more than 75% are pink tickets for female passengers,” Gahlot said. He added that passengers can now buy up to three tickets for a journey. Female passengers can now book a single ticket for their entire journey. Women are allowed free rides on Delhi buses. Gahlot along with the officials from the transport department conducted a real-time inspection of the app on a cluster bus on Route Number 429, and used the app to purchase the ticket.“I’m extremely happy to note that, within five days of starting the trial, 6% of the total ticketing on the selected routes are being done through the app now. It is particularly encouraging to see the response from female passengers, who account for more than 75% of the total tickets issued through this app,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/20-000-tickets-issued-on-delhi-buses-in-trial-run-of-e-ticketing-system/story-5RvmmyGOO4GSlYYi06eJ9M.html

11-09-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Equip police with high-tech gear, give them better pay, training||Better training, payThe goals of the commission should be to improve police infrastructure, upgrade the functioning of the police force, including investigation, prosecution, forensic investigation, training and intelligence in Chandigarh. Training and skill enhancement techniques should be developed. The functioning of lower level personnel can be improved by better training, pay and allowances and by creating a system that rewards initiative and positive action. Ishita NaraBuild trust between public, policeEquip the force with the latest technology to lessen the workload of personnel and to curb crimes. Long duty hours need to be shortened to allow people to be well rested to tackle their duties diligently. Awards should be given to those carrying out duties with utmost professionalism. No political interference should be brooked. Trust should be built between the common man and the police to enable the former to approach the latter without fear.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliKeep ‘controversial’ officials awayA one-man commission often proves successful as the person can work unhindered and keep a strict eye on implementation of changes suggested. However, it should be ensured that controversial officials are not in charge of law and order and allowed to behave like dictators who think they have the right to take the law unto their hands. Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalMore surveillance of ‘sensitive’ areasAnyone planning to overhaul the policing system should recommend dividing the city into sensitive points and zones and deploying extra force to cope with problem areas. Health is crucial so police personnel should be made physically fit by exercising daily and take care of those bulging bellies. Counselling and training programmes should be conducted from time to time to cope with mental health issues. Personnel also need to be friendly so that the public can approach them without hesitation in case of need. Staying active and alert is mandatory to tackle the surge in crime rates in the tricity. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliSeek help from intellectualsThe police reforms commission is not likely to improve the functioning of the force until intellectuals from the civil society are invited to share their suggestions. A team comprising local advocates, retired police officers, journalists and social activists should be part of the body. Their recommendations should have legal status to help in implementation of all changes. Only then can the reforms be effective.Sukhpal SinghPunish the corrupt, step up surveillanceReforms are not likely to work and to set up a panel for the same is a waste of time. Installing more CCTV cameras will help curb crimes in the city, especially in remote areas. For improved policing people should be able to send in their complaints through WhatsApp. Exemplary punishment should be given to personnel who are caught favouring people and taking bribes.Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Latest crime-fighting technology neededThe police need to have the latest crime-fighting technology, CCTV cameras at vantage points, seal the porous borders, streamlined coordination among all the police stations and security guards at public places. Personnel should be given the latest cameras and equipment to fight crime. Their service conditions too need a rethink. They should be given at least one day off during the week, be posted near their home towns and be given extra compensation/financial support in case of injury/death on duty. Civil society should be sensitive to their challenges and stress. Both the sides should live in harmony. Usha Verma, ChandigarhBritish-era mindset has to change A serious effort should be made to ensure that the report of the commission does not meet the fate of previous reports on police reforms that are gathering dust. Ways and means should be looked into to free the police force from British-era mindset, where ruling politicians and top bureaucracy consider the police force as their personal army.Overworked personnel should be given relief both in terms of duty hours, salaries and working conditions.AK Sharma, ChandigarhNo political pressuresThe only wish of the citizens of the city is that they remain safe and secure where rule of law prevails sans police acting as a law unto itself. The commission should ensure that fear of law is instilled among criminals who get away by ‘managing’ the police. Delayed action by the men in khaki in any case adds salt to injury. The bane of our electoral democracy is that politicians of all hues wield power, even to meet their partisan ends and they misuse the force, twisting facts at times.There is no dearth of talent and professionalism but these get eclipsed because of the pressures policemen face from the powers that be.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaSensitive handling of seniors requiredInternal matters and power allocation in a new police set-up does not bother the common man, who is more concerned about better policing, more so in times of coronavirus. Many police personnel have put in an exemplary performance as Corona Warriors and have been honoured by various resident welfare associations. They need to be firm in their dealings with people flouting Covid safety norms, but apart from taking on criminals, they have to be sensitive enough to reach out to lonely and infirm senior citizens and take care of their needs. Let us hope the overhauling in UT police is result orientedSC Luthra, Chandigarh No threat of danda pleasePolice personnel should be given behavioural training to deal with the urban educated population in UT and understand that the threat of the ‘danda’ (stick) can only distance them from the common manCol TBS Bedi (retd)Advice of local police crucialLocal police personnel are required to have complete knowledge of the region they operate in, especially spots with frequent criminal activities and nature of operations required to tackle antisocial elements. The commission must factor in advice from local police as well as market and resident welfare associations to draw out plans to tackle crime. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhTransparency is keyPolice personnel need to deal sensitively with the public, hear their grievances patiently and attempt to solve matters quickly. There should be transparency in the working of the police.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Public should understand challenges faced by policeThe public-police relationship needs to improve, with the former made aware of the challenges men in khaki face. The latter need to understand what expectations people have of them. Apart from the physical and standard training imparted to the police, lower ranks need to learn how to interact with the general public. Besides training, the force should get the latest equipment, including belts loaded with pistol, taser weapon, baton and handcuffs. A metallic badge issued to personnel should have details of their respective departments and personnel number for quick identification, which should be worn prominently. Also, community policing should improve as it’s not as effective as it should be in the city. As military service is mandatory in some countries, community policing should also be widely open to all people, though on voluntary basis, to enable the public to work with police personnel and experience the challenges they face. Beat police officers to be provided with bicycles to keep fit and simultaneously carry out their duties of patrolling as obesity has been a serious problem in the police department. Suggestion boxes should be installed in police lines and stations for the public to share ideas on streamlining the force. Naveen Sharma, ZirakpurBetter pay, training are mustsPolicemen need to be given professional training and skill sets to handle law and order efficiently and better pay packages. They also need to be equipped with modern and user-friendly equipment, especially bulletproof vests. Attacks on police personnel should be dealt with strictly, with maximum punishment for undermining the legitimate authority of the state. An image makeover is urgently required in the force to create a fear psychosis among criminals. Exemplary behaviour should also be exhibited by personnel at all times, so that the taint of corruption is removed with censures and suspensions from service as per CrPC and IPC. Physical fitness of cops is a major area of concern. Yoga, meditation and other exercise camps should be organised regularly. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurCitizens should check police functioningPolice should be first made accountable for their conduct, ie cases of corruption against personnel should be dealt with strictly. Second, this biased attitude: Challaning cars without pollution certificates and not buses and trucks, should change. The commission must suggest setting up of a citizen’s councils to check the functioning of police. Also filing of FIRs must be a smooth process. Police should stand for P: Polite, O: On Alert. L: Live wire, I: Intelligent, C: Courteous and E: Ever readyCapt Amar Jeet Kumar (retd), Mohali. The commission has to evolve strategies to counter strong political, bureaucratic and other pressures on police personnel that stop them from doing their duty. To understand more about the problems of the common man and win over their confidence, the commission may liaise with the residents welfare associations . Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhUpgrade recruitment processFirst, the recruitment process needs an upgrade. Both mental and physical standards for screening need to be a level higher (for every candidate, irrespective of whether they have a reservation or not), which should be revised and upgraded time to time. This will ensure quality personnel in the force. Also, police stations and officials should get the latest equipment training to upskill and upgrade. Some changes in infrastructure of police stations is also required.

11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Parents’ consent a must for children attending school from Sept 21||The UT education department has asked schools to upload Google forms on their websites with consent from parents allowing their children to attend classes 9 and above from September 21.Latest Union home ministry guidelines permit states and UTs to call 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff for online teaching, tele-counselling and related work from September 21. Students of classes 9 to 12 can go to school voluntarily for guidance from their teachers, subject to the written consent of their parents/guardians. Commenting on the matter, UT director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, “All the schools of Chandigarh have prepared their individual Google forms for consent to be given by parents to allow their wards to visit school from 21st September onwards. The Google form of the particular school will be uploaded on the respective website of the school also.”Students who are unable to respond through the Google forms will have the option to use WhatsApp or text messages so that the final list of students going to school can be compiled and arrangements made accordingly, Brar added.However, with the surge in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh most parents are still reluctant to send their children. A large number of parents are not likely to give permissions to their wards, said the Chandigarh Parents’ Association.Compartment exams for Class 11 on the cardsBrar also pointed to the possibility of compartment exams being held soon after schools reopened from September 21. “We will get permission from parents before a date is finalised. After feedback from Class 11 we will conduct the same for class 9,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-consent-a-must-for-children-attending-school-from-sept-21/story-VVwDvY3Y9rfs4aXzxVArYJ.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Truck driver thrashed over petty issue||A truck driver was thrashed by a group of men near Ram Darbar on Friday. The victim, identified as Harender Pal, is working as a driver with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at the city-based laboratory Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIHAR) near 3BRD Air force Station, Chandigarh. In his complaint to the police, Harender said that he was going to drop labourers and when he reached near Ram Darbar, he found two men standing in the middle of the road.

From the existing 250 to the proposed 1,500 offices, this is the widest possible coverage that has been conceived and enabled in online management of public grievances in J&K.Officials claimed that this makes it the first online grievance management system in country which is linked to the central government (on the top level) and districts, tehsils and blocks (at the bottom level).The administrative secretaries of different departments are also linked to the mechanism.In addition to this, the new system will be available 24x7 with applicant OTP authentication, acknowledgement to applicant at each stage, feedback by complainant, and grievance submission through call centre via phone call between 9.30 AM -5.30 PM on all days except Sundays.The L-G said that government is committed towards undertake all radical reforms to put in place a people-centric good-governance structure which will have an institutionalised grievance redressal mechanism.He added that it is the most important component of a well governed responsive administration and an indicator of efficiency and effectiveness of all administrative processes.Terming it a step towards gaining peoples’ trust, the L-G said that an effective grievance redressal mechanism is the lifeblood of any good governance system and is the top priority for the J&K administration. “The new system is initially being launched on a pilot basis for three districts of Jammu, Srinagar, and Reasi. It will gradually be rolled out in the remaining districts by or before October2. It will replace the current portal which was launched back in 2018,” an official spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/effective-grievance-redressal-is-crucial-to-good-governance-l-g/story-RN8B7QZ4iWCDeYWZ0UcZ1M.html

I hope Haryana chief minister and home minister will solve this issue.”BJP’s Hisar MP Brijendra Singh said farmers have the right to raise their own issues and that he was ‘disappointed with the Kurukshetra episode’. “ I condemn the attack on farmers by police, who resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob in wake of Covid-19. I hope a thorough probe will be done and the government will resolve the issue after talking to farmers,” he said.Haryana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Om Prakash Dhankar described the police action as uncalled for. “The police and the administration should have exercised restraint,” he said. Dhankar also chastised the farmers, saying they should have given preference to dialogue instead of confrontation to resolve the matter. He said the rumours about the government stopping MSP and closing grain markets were baseless and that the state will procure every grain. He has also constituted a three-member committee comprising Bhiwani MP Dharambir, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Saini, and Hisar MP Brijender Singh to hold talks with the farmers.The Jannayak Janata party’s Badhra MLA Naina Chautala, her son Digvijay Singh Chautala and Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag also condemned the attack on farmers and demanded a probe into the incident.Wrestler Bajrang Punia and boxer Vijender Singh also extended their support to the farmers and slammed the BJP-JJP government for ‘curbing the voice’ of farmers. The farmers were protesting against three ordinances promulgated by the central government. These bills include: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance; and the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-stir-bjp-jjp-leaders-demand-a-fair-probe-into-lathicharge-on-protesters-in-kurukshetra/story-hhq5xS3TQW1oLKmmkOpEZO.html

He said the police action against farmers reminded him of the Kandela episode. “The BJP-JJP will have to face severe consequences for using force on farmers,” he added. The former CM said the Congress will also hold a state-level rally in support of farmers at Pipli in the near future. Kumari Selja, who was the first to reach Kurukshetra along with an injured farmer, said this incident has exposed the anti-farmer policies of the BJP-JJP government. She said the ordinances were framed to benefit the corporate houses by forcing farmers to sell their produce according to prices set by them. Selja also alleged that the government’s ordinances will promote contract farming. She has demanded that the government should withdraw the FIRs registered against the protesters.Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the farmers will never forget the brutal action on them and the BJP-JJP will have to pay for it in the future. He also demanded an investigation into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-leaders-make-beeline-for-kurukshetra-extend-support-to-protesting-farmers/story-9dZBP2jXiLeHtblhUtp9FO.html

The farmers are protesting against three ordinances promulgated by the Centre. Instead of raising their issues, he is sitting in the BJP’s lap. His brother Digvijay Chautala is making a fool of the farmers by demanding a probe into the matter. The Jannayak Janata Party has failed to raise our issues before its ally (the BJP),” he added.Pachar said the agrarian community wants either Dushyant to pull back his support to the BJP or clear his stand over the issue. “It is shameful that the BJP ministers are lodging FIRs against the protesters and calling them Congress workers. On the other hand, Dushyant Chautala is mum on this issue. People have voted for him to raising their grievances and not to enjoy power,” he said.A standoff between the police and protesters continued for an hour outside Chautala’s house. Later, the protesters were sent back by the police and administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-sacked-ptis-gherao-haryana-deputy-cm-s-house-in-sirsa/story-HqrCGVmmroR561A6cPfufO.html

Teltumbde, who is lodged in Mumbai’s Taloja jail along with other accused in the case, added the special court should be ordered to grant him bail. The plea is expected to be heard next week as justice Revati Mohite Dere on Friday recused from hearing it after it came up before a bench she headed.The plea said Teltumbde on July 12 completed 90 days in custody. But as the investigation had not been completed in the case, the extension of his custody was sought along with that of his co-accused, Gautam Navlakha. Teltumbde surrendered to the NIA on April 14 as per a Supreme Court direction.NIA cited the Covid19 pandemic and voluminous draft of the charge sheet and said that is why it has been unable to file it. It added that interrogation of witnesses and perusal of forensic evidence was also pending due to the pandemic while seeking the extension of Teltumbde and Navlakha’s custody as per the Section 43 (D) of the UAPA. The section says the extension for 90 days can be sought citing if there are compelling reasons for it.Teltumbde’s plea said the special court did not heed the information provided in NIA’s application for the extension to his custody. It added the application said “sufficient evidence has been being collected” and added the special court did not abide by a Supreme Court order which states that a person cannot be detained beyond 90 days if investigators are unable to complete the investigation and file a charge sheet within that period.Teltumbde said his custody would not contribute towards the recording of statements of witnesses or receiving forensic reports. Hence, the special court should not have granted the 90-day extension.The violence in Bhima Koregaon was triggered a day after an event called Elgar Parishad was held in Pune on December 31, 2017. Hundreds of activists attended the event. Investigators say that speeches made at the event, which Maoists allegedly funded, aggravated caste clashes that broke out in Bhima Koregaon during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war Dalits commemorate. One person died in the clashes that also sparked widespread protests by Dalit groups that shut down Maharashtra later that month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-anand-teltumbde-moves-court-against-nia-s-extension-of-his-custody/story-fLB484tfmJOoWRHGpJv5eO.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Investigate suicide cases on priority: Himachal DGP amid increase in cases during Covid lockdown||With the number of suicides doubling in Himachal Pradesh during the Covid-19 lockdown and the exact cause not known in most cases, the state director general of police, Sanjay Kundu, has directed all 12 district police chiefs to ensure that such cases are investigated on priority. “I have given directions to fast track investigation into suicide cases,” Kundu said, expressing concern over the spike in the number of suicides in the state during the lockdown. 481 COMMITTED SUICIDE TILL JULY 31 The number of suicides in Himachal Pradesh in the first three months of the lockdown, imposed on March 24, was twice those recorded in the previous three months. According to police data, 40 suicides were reported in January, 45 in February and 32 in March. In April, 47 people committed suicide, 89 in May, 112 in June and 101 in July. So, a total of 117 suicides were recorded from January to March and 248 from April to June. A total of 481 people committed suicide till July 31 this year. Of them, only 55 cases were that of abetment to suicide. In the rest, domestic quarrels, chronic illness, mental illness, financial crisis and drug abuse were reasons behind victims taking the extreme step. According to a reply filed by the home department in the ongoing monsoon session of the assembly, more than 600 people commit suicide in Himachal Pradesh every year, while about 1.3 lakh people end their lives every year in the country. A total of 1,946 people have committed suicide in the past two-and-a-half years. Among the victims, 1,197 were male and 749 female. STRESS ON SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION The state police have renewed guidelines for investigating suicides. It is now mandatory that in cases where the suicide victim is a female, the investigation will be conducted by a woman officer. Station house officers have been asked to ensure that responsible officers supervise suicide cases and visit the crime scene to make sure it is properly photographed, videographed and the sketch is prepared for record keeping. The victim’s post-mortem examination should be conducted preferably in a medical college to get the best forensic expert opinion on the cause of death. The new orders say that the investigation officer should unearth full reason(s) for the death that is if there is any crime or conspiracy or if there’s any money, sexual, drug or network angle involved. The officers will gather documentary, technical, expert, forensic, digital and other evidences to strengthen the case. The interview of all relevant witnesses and evidence will be conducted with stress on scientific investigation. The DGP said that the police must also ensure the timely arrest of the accused, make recoveries of the seizures, conclude investigation and prepare a final report expeditiously. He asked police personnel to look into suicide cases closely and not treat them as routine. LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUTH Suicide is a leading cause of death in the 15-29 years age group. “Early recognition of depression and suicidal behaviour is important to prevent suicide,” says Dr Dinesh Sharma, an associate professor in the psychiatry department of Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla. Speaking at a webinar organised at IGMC on ‘Working together to prevent suicide’ on World Suicide Prevention Day, September 10, Dr Sharma said, “The global health crisis due to Covid-19 has increased mental health issues. It is important to be sensitive towards the mental health of everyone, including ourselves.” “We should be aware of warning signs such as social isolation, talking about suicide, saying goodbye to friends and family, giving away a valued possession or writing a will,” he said. He said all suicidal threats should be taken seriously and help should be sought at 104, the medical helpline of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/investigate-suicide-cases-on-priority-himachal-dgp-amid-increase-in-cases-during-covid-lockdown/story-drOOkmBOMcz4ji320D9llI.html

11-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Nepal man arrested for defrauding Army personnel of Rs 69,000||A Nepalese national (25), who had worked as a contractual agent with two banks, would secretly install a remote access application (app) in mobile phones of his customers he had helped obtain credit cards and would later use the app to withdraw money from their accounts, the Delhi Police said. The police have arrested the suspect following a six-month hunt. The suspect’s modus operandi was uncovered after he had gained illegal access to the mobile phone of an Indian Army personnel in the national capital and withdrew Rs 69,334 from the latter’s credit card account, said Devender Arya, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (south-west), Delhi Police. The arrested accused has been identified as Mukesh Okheda, a native of Nepal, who had moved to Delhi from Bengaluru late last year in search of a job. Okheda allegedly started committing these frauds from February after he was employed as an agent by credit card departments of two banks. “His job was to look for customers, who wanted new credit cards. Initially, he would convince his customers to take new credit cards and later facilitate the process of obtaining the cards for them,” said a Delhi Police investigator, who didn’t wish to be identified. Okheda allegedly took advantage of the card issuance process.“He would get hold of a customer’s mobile phone during the card issuance process on some pretext. Then, he would secretly install a remote access app in the customer’s mobile phone and return the device to him (the customer),” said the investigator. All that Okheda needed to carry out a fraudulent transaction was a one-time password (OTP) since he had the other credit card details of his victim. The rule stipulates that an OTP must be sent to a customer’s mobile phone number to validate a transaction.Okheda would use that app on his own mobile phone to gain remote access to the victim’s mobile device and then steal the OTP.Okheda would delete the OTP from the victim’s mobile phone after making a bogus transaction, the investigator said. Okheda would never leave behind any trail of evidence about his crime and the victim would be unaware that his mobile phone and privacy was breached to defraud him, he added. Okheda got busted after the Indian Army personnel approached the Delhi Cantonment police station authorities on March 9 after he had lost Rs 69,334 through a fraudulent transaction.“The Indian Army personnel found out that Rs 69,334 was withdrawn from his credit card even though he didn’t share the card and OTP details with anyone,” said DCP Arya. Delhi Police’s cyber cell in the south-west district was assigned the case and they approached the bank that had issued the credit card to the victim. “The bank authorities informed us that the money was transferred to two online payment apps and from there to a bank account registered in the name of Okheda. Some mobile phones registered in Okheda’s name were also recharged using the duped money,” said the DCP. Okheda had allegedly been changing his address repeatedly to evade arrest, the police said. Finally, acting on a tip-off, the police nabbed him from Baprola village in Dwarka on Wednesday. A probe is in progress to ascertain how many other credit card holders were allegedly cheated by Okheda, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fraudster/story-fNqShP2pEApzb2VA9UEppJ.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Senior leaders demand action against Himachal Congress vice-president for remark against Anand Sharma||Taking issue with Himachal Congress Committee vice-president’s statement against Congress’ deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma and other 23 leaders who had expressed concern over the party’s state in a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi, senior members of the District Congress Committee (DCC) demanded that disciplinary action be initiated against Kehar Singh Khachi. The joint statement was issued by state Congress Committee member Arun Sharma, former DCC president (Shimla, Urban) Pradeep Singh Bhujja, PCC delegates Pradeep Verma and Harendra Singh Rawat, former Rohru block Congress president Ishwar Das Chawaru, former Jubbal-Kotkhai block Congress president Laiq Ram Oujta, former Shimla rural district Congress vice-president Lok Pal Chhajta, former Rampur block Congress president Satish Verma, former Theog block Congress president Brahma Nand Sharma, former Kasumpti block Congress president Bhupinder Singh Kanwar, and former Rajiv Gandhi Panchayati Raj Organization general secretary Om Prakash Verma. The leaders said, “It was not Khachi’s place to question the loyalty of leaders who have been pillars of the Congress party for so long. The senior leaders have always been loyal to the Nehru-Gandhi family and casting aspersions on them is unbecoming and ridiculous.”They said Sharma was both politically but emotionally connected to the Gandhi family and had never courted any controversy and as such his loyalty to the party was unquestionable. At a time when the party must unite, it is disheartening to see a party member make such disparaging remarks against senior leaders. Khachi’s statement will only bring instability to the party and is a cheap publicity gimmick, the leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dcc-leaders-demand-disciplinary-action-against-himachal-congress-committee-vice-president-khachi/story-LEBFRpZyNeenk4beLecLZO.html

Also read: Security forces nab 5 ULFA bomb experts in Assam, bust recruitment driveThe charge sheet, under various sections of Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Explosives Substances Act and Arms Act, was filed on Thursday in the court of a special NIA judge in Guwahati. The seven ULFA-I cadres names as accused are Bijit Gogoi alias Arunodoi Dahotia, Kanto Bora alias Rupom Asom, Santosh Gogoi, Jushinta Moran alias Yankho Asom, Bubul Moran alias Tiger Asom, Dipankar Borah alias Ghutuk and Mamun Dihingia. As per the charge sheet, on May 4, 2018, the officer-in-charge of Bordumsa police station in Tinsukia district, Bhaskar Kalita, received specific input regarding presence of ULFA-I cadre inside a house in Kujupathar village. Following this, a joint operation was launched by police and paramilitary forces to nab the cadres. “During the process of cordoning of the suspect premises, ULFA-I militants hiding inside a locked house started firing indiscriminately at the police, which resulted in the death of OC Bordumsa Sub-Inspector Bhaskar Kalita,” an NIA release issued on Friday stated. “Taking advantage of poor light conditions, ULFA-I militants managed to escape into the nearby jungle. While escaping, they snatched away the AK-47 from the deceased police officer,” it added. The case was handled by Assam Police till June 2019 after which NIA stepped in and started their investigations. It was revealed during investigation that the killing of the police officer was the result of a conspiracy hatched by the accused on instructions of Arunodoi Dahotia. Subsequently, four of the seven accused and another ULFA-I cadre (who has died since) came from their Myanmar camps to Tinsukia district, armed with assault weapons, IEDs and explosive powder etc. with the aim of raising funds for the banned outfit and committing terrorist acts across Assam. “On receipt of the said information, the same was sought to be thwarted by OC Bordumsa Sub-Inspector Bhaskar Kalita and his team. During the process of laying the cordon, the ULFA-I cadres fired indiscriminately on OC Bordumsa, who was leading from the front, thus killing him,” the release stated. While three of the accused named in the charge sheet, Bubul Moran, Dipankar Borah and Mamun Dihingia have been arrested, the other four are still absconding. Further investigations into the case are still on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-7-ulfa-i-cadres-for-killing-of-assam-police-officer/story-1O1ICMxzUW1LLxkKUwvqoN.html
11-09-2020||Pune||Hoteliers in Pune claim ₹10 crore in dues pending for city’s use of hotels as quarantine facilities||Hoteliers in Pune have sought the state government’s intervention in the release of payment for hotels which were “forcibly requisitioned” by the district administration, under the Disaster Management Act, to quarantine Covid-19 medical staff, as well as patients, at the initial outbreak of the pandemic in April. The total amount due, according to the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India and the Pune Hoteliers association (PHA), is approximately ₹10 crore for 24 hotels used. The rates decided by the administration were ₹2,000 for a five-star hotel room, and ₹500 for a non-star hotel room, per day. The rooms were requisitioned from April onwards when the lockdown was enforced in Pune. The association has registered its grievance with district collector Rajesh Deshmukh seeking release of the compensation. “The hoteliers have approached the administration and I am looking into their complaints,” said Deshmukh. “I have sought all the details on requisition and bills from the concerned department and based on the details, further action will be taken,” Deshmukh added.“It is reported by members that although their hotels have been requisitioned and taken over, no payment of compensation has been made so far in any of the cases. This has led to further losses and our members are unable to meet even the daily expenses during these times. Hence, it may not be bearable to sustain the further burden of forced operations due to the requisitioned housing of guests,” stated a letter written by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India to the district collector and chief minister of Maharashtra on September 8. “We did what the government asked us to do. Hotels were requisitioned for the purposes of accommodating health workers and doctors, and were promised compensation against the services provided, but we are still waiting for it. Hotel staff risked their lives to serve those who were quarantined in their hotels during the lockdown,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, of the association. “We are hurt at the ‘use it and throw’ policy of the government. It is the ultimately the government which is bringing down this sector through its step-motherly treatment of the hotel industry. They are treating us like doormats. The industry is dying thanks to the state government as we are shut since five months. We stood by the government and it has failed us . They promised us compensation, but nothing has happened and we are sitting like beggars for their alms. Forty percent of the industry will shut down due to the indifferent attitude of the government,” Kohli said. Sharan Shetty, president, Pune hoteliers association, said it is unfortunate that the hotels have to bear the brunt of a decision made in good faith. “Hotels were made to open and carry out operations by the state when they actually were closed. They have incurred expenses which they wouldn’t have if they were to remain shut. Now hotels are receiving electricity bills with penalties for not paying on time,” said Shetty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/hoteliers-in-pune-claim-10-crore-in-dues-pending-for-city-s-use-of-hotels-as-quarantine-facilities/story-hvAGH077HsxDWedidxQkFI.html

11-09-2020||Pune||Lost jobs, but not their spirit; these individuals in Pune know how to shine, even during a pandemic||The pandemic has been tough on the economy and on businesses. Many people lost their livelihoods, but Covid-19 has not been able to crush the spirit of the people. From finally pursuing life-long dreams to changing professions for the better, some city residents have transformed their lives despite facing adversities.“I had been working as a bank manager at one of the cooperative banks in Kalewadi over the past 10 years, which was shut down due to the pandemic, so I started my own business of selling sanitary napkins,” said 48-year-old Prashant Gaikwad. Working to empower women had been Gaikwad’s dream and starting this business, helped his ideas grow. “I started my new business at Akurdi on August 15. I have always observed that women ignore menstrual hygiene especially in slums and even those who belong to middle-class families and use cloth instead of sanitary napkins. My aim is to change the habit of these women in order to improve their overall hygiene,” added Gaikwad who is also approaching non-government organisations and social organisations to promote menstrual hygiene.Along with Prashant, his wife and daughter are now also spreading awareness regarding menstrual hygiene in Pimple Gurav.Like Gaikwad, Vivek Temkar, who was unsure about his future due to the lockdown-induced unemployment, decided to start a chicken and mutton shop at Manchar, Ausari Khurd, Ambegaon taluka.“I decided to start my own business instead of depending only on my regular job for a living,” said Temkar, who started the quality chicken shop in June. Suddenly, the days have become longer for Temkar as he starts his day at 6am and ends at 11pm. In the morning he completes his office duty as an engineer and from 3pm onwards, he attends to his shop.“In our area many people had complained that chicken and mutton centres do not maintain cleanliness. So cleanliness is our top priority here and people have encouraged my business venture. I have been able to earn good profit over the last three months,” Temkar who works at Varroc Engineering Limited, Chakan.His family had first objected to his idea, however, now all are onboard. “Business is business and if you give quality products, then people will keep coming to your shop without any hesitation. I will keep growing my business,” added Temkar.Gaikwad and Temkar were guided by Abhay Bhor, president, Forum of Small Scale Industries Association.“Bhor has always been there for guidance and he has helped many people start their own business during these hard times,” added Temkar.For Vaibhav Hinge, the decision of leaving his profession turned out to be for the better, as his Matoshree plant and fruit nursery on a two-acre land – is now earning him profit.“Due to cost cutting, my company terminated the contract on April 30. I had been reading that organic plants and fruits have a lot of demand in the city so I decided to set up a nursery and it is attracting many people,” said Hinge who started his Nursery on June 5.People who love flowers have started making queues at the nursery.“First I was thinking of starting a hotel but in our taluka, we don’t have such a nursery and since we have farms at our home, I took to the idea of maintaining a nursery,” added Hinge who worked as the project head at a cable line at one of the private firms in Chakan.Earlier, Hinge had to work in various shifts at his company, but now he doesn’t have to travel every day to earn money.Abhay Bhor, president, Forum of Small Scale Industries Association, who has provided many such people guidance, adds, “To overcome the current situation of unemployment, our firm is always pushing new ideas and innovation for the people and we are also creating opportunities for them.”Bhor runs different forums to give consultation to unemployed people, women self-help groups and youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lost-jobs-but-not-their-spirit-these-individuals-in-pune-know-how-to-shine-even-during-a-pandemic/story-BYtvmBtqvaWljXNEzFPN8I.html

The firm made a final bid of Rs 164.6 crore to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited, PSPCL director, finance, Jatinder Goyal said on Friday. “The official order will be released within two weeks to the successful bidder to start dismantling the defunct plant. Details of the top bidder in the e-auction held on Wednesday will be made public after completion of the official procedure of work allotment,” Goyal said. “The PSPCL had fixed a reserve price of Rs 132 crore but we got Rs 32 crore above it. The e-bidding got an encouraging response,” he said. The state cabinet has decided to develop a mega industrial park on 1,350 acres over which the plant is built. “The land will soon be handed over to Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) on a 80::20 revenue sharing scheme, as decided by the cabinet. Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) recently offered to install a solar power plant at the GNDTP site but that is not under consideration. The PSPCL may consider a renewable energy project at another site,” said Goyal, who also holds the charge of director, generation. TOWERS TO STAND TALL The four mega cooling towers of the power facility, that are often confused with smoke-emitting chimneys, are deemed to be monuments and will not be brought down. Only civil structures, including chimneys and machinery used in power generation besides cables and pipes, will be disposed of. The GNDTP plant was shut in 2018 as per the modalities worked out by a Punjab government’s sub-committee set up on August 24, 2017, for the closure of the state-owned thermal plants in view of the Central Electricity Agency (CEA) guidelines to retire non-viable thermal power plants that have exceeded 25 years’ life span. SYMBOL OF MALWA’S PROGRESSThe foundation stone of the thermal plant, credited with playing a significant role in the development of the semi-arid Malwa belt of Punjab, was laid in November 1969 by then chief minister Gurnam Singh. He was the first Akali chief minister. The power facility was dedicated to the first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev to mark his 500th birth anniversary. Construction started in 1970 and the plant was completed in 1982. It had four thermal units, each having a generation capacity of 110MW. The first unit started generating electricity in 1974. Opposition parties such as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) besides employees of the state power department and farmer unions have been protesting against the decision to wind up the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-firm-to-dismantle-thermal-plant-at-bathinda-but-iconic-towers-will-stay/story-vOruwqKchaNFjGdqhLpQDP.html

She is not a political leader. You don’t go to demolish Dawood’s home but you demolished her place,” the former Maharashtra chief minister said.Watch l ‘You don’t demolish Dawood’s house’: Fadnavis slams Sena over Kangana case The action by the Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) came in the backdrop of the party’s recent war of words with the actor over her comments comparing Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It has led to allegations that the demolition by the civic body was an act of ‘witch-hunt.’Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, one of the key figures in the said faceoff, on Thursday dismissed these allegations, saying that the Maharashtra government has no connection with the action taken by BMC.

The development came as part of a plan to oppose the three new agricultural ordinances that the Centre has passed. Other farmer outfits, mostly seen as armies of old men, are also working to ‘recruit’ youth and women into their fold. BKU leaders claim that the ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the government will affect the lives of women and the young. “In 2018, we decided to focus on increasing the participation of women and youth in unions. Now, we need to organise our youth and women. This is the need of the hour, as we combat these ordinances,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, state general secretary of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan).Kokri Kalan added that the anti-farmer policies of successive governments had meant that youth and women were already against the government. It was up to the farmer leadership to channelise this energy, he claimed. “These ordinances will damage the farm economy and women have to suffer more. We are getting a huge response and women are joining the battle against anti-farmer policies,” he added.Harinder Bindu, 42, state leader of women’s wing of BKU Ugharan, said they already had a women’s wing in Sangrur, Bathinda, Mansa and Barnala districts. “The Modi government passed three ordinances under the shadow of covid-19. Women protested from August 25-29. Our women activists also protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the NRC (National Register of Citizens) and the National Population Register (NPR) in Malerkotla,” she added. “Women are the most oppressed section, and farm debt and patriarchy impact them the most. We are getting organised in Malwa,” she added.Kirti Kissan Union, another farmer outfit, recently formed youth wings in Sangrur, Moga, Ludhiana and Muktsar districts. Union activists are holding meetings with youth for the Barnala rally scheduled on September 14, the first day of the new Parliament session, to oppose the agri-ordinances“We have formed five units of youth in Sangrur district. They wanted freedom, when elders were leading the movement. We will form units in other districts by September 28,”said Bhupinder Longowal, 35, state leader, Kirti Kissan Union.“Youth must not waste time and energy in gathering votes for political parties. Agriculture is our profession and we will not allow the government to snatch it from us,” added Longowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-unions-scale-up-efforts-to-get-youth-women-into-their-fold/story-hwviQp9UluNxzgo29GyOuJ.html

While some say they now prefer to go to select cafes, others are only opting for a drive with friends. Drive-through funDU student Vanshika Rana, who prefers fun drives with friends, says, “In Covid times, my hang-out spot is either my house or my friend’s car. I usually chill at home with buddies at a game of UNO or monopoly, and we order out pizza or momos. But it’s more fun is to be in a car, listening to hip songs, and relish this food while on a drive to nowhere! Or may be a drive through movie...” Outdoor joints, a hit Mihika Gulati, a Delhi-based student, says, “I went nowhere for a very long time. Then, my friends and I met at each other’s houses. But now, I’ve returned to my fave joints that are sanitised well. And the best part is they have outdoor seating, which allows us to laze there for hours together... I really miss club hopping on special occasions, but no one knows what the future holds and when will we be able get back to that. Until then, here’s where all the fun lies!” Miles to Go... Partying A Hindu College graduate Ankrish Khanna, says, “My core friend group used to meet only at one of our houses until recently we started going out for walks. Now we order food wherever we are and have an old school picnic in the greens. Abhi ke liye toh this is the only scene where there’s music and drinks. At least it’s some change from being at home.” Jacqueline Joseph, a Jesus and Mary College graduate, seconds the thought adding, “Since we have gone in unlock mode, I have started visiting malls.

Painted in bright colours and very retro styles are murals of old Hindi films and the stars that inhabit the cineverse. From the sleepy lanes of Chapel Road and Waroda Road to the more popular Bandstand and Sea Link, the murals have left an indelible mark on the cityscape. So who is the artist creating these time capsules? Meet Ranjit Dahiya, a self-confessed film buff who moved to Mumbai in 2009 for work. He paints these murals under his art collective, Bollywood Art Project. His latest offering is a mural of late actor Rishi Kapoor, which took him six days to complete. He unveiled it on his social media on September 4, the actor’s birthday. “It was my tribute to him and I wanted to celebrate it in my own style,” says the NID, Ahmedabad graduate.

The organisation — Ranjit Nagara — began the restoration work in August this year. The Pakistan government reopened the abandoned gurdwara and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) had unveiled a plan to reopen the gurdwara after restoration. Satpreet Singh, director of Ranjit Nagara, said they wrote to the ETPB in December 2019, seeking permission to carry forward the restoration work at the gurdwara and the approval was given in August this year. “We have hired experts, including Amrik Pahala who worked in UAE and had restored more than 40 sites. He has a team of 70 engineers and they are voluntarily supporting us. Another Architect Rubab Farha Chisti and her team are also on the preservation job,” said Satpreet Singh, who is a businessman in California. He said they expect the restoration work to be complete by August next year. Was closed since the Partition Built in 1834 under the command of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Gurdwara Choa Sahib was lying closed since the Partition. Located on the northern edge of Rohtas Fort — a UNESCO world heritage site — near Jhelum, it fell prey to neglect. The gurdwara commemorates the site where Guru Nanak is believed to have created a water spring during one of his (udasi) journeys. A water spring is called “choa” and the place was named Choa Sahib. Even today, residents of the Rohtas Fort use the water of the same spring. In 2019, 500-year-old Babe-de-Ber gurdwara in Sialkot in Pakistan’s Punjab province also opened its doors for pilgrims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/us-based-sikh-body-starts-restoration-of-gurdwara-choa-sahib-in-pakistan/story-PQbhxlrSIqcumm0kNqzqkI.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Metro 2A, 7 trial runs to start from January 14||Trial runs for two Metro lines – Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro 7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East) – will commence from January 14, 2021, said commissioner of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) RA Rajeev on Thursday. Commercial operations for the two lines are expected to start from May 2021. “We will receive the first set of trains in December 2020. Post which, system integration will take about five months. We can assure citizens that the operations will start from May 2021,” Rajeev said at a press conference on Thursday. MMRDA will commence operations with 10 train sets, with a headway of 20-25 minutes between trains initially. The Metro was expected to be operational by December this year, but the Covid-19 lockdown resulted in delays. Rajeev said MMRDA was making up for lost time by readying teams for each site and “maximising” labour force for Metro 2A and Metro 7. According to MMRDA, 7,109 labourers were working at the Metro sites on March 16, before the lockdown was announced. Now, 6,332 labourers are at the Metro sites. “We have almost reached the pre-lockdown count. We are also arranging special trains for labourers to reach Mumbai,” Rajeev said. While the authority was looking to employ locals at its sites, only 150-200 labourers at the two Metro sites are from Maharashtra. Officials said labourers from Maharashtra are trained for industrial jobs and not for working at construction sites. No depot for Metro 6 yet A right-to-information (RTI) query dated September 8 by environment activist Zoru Bhathena revealed that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which is executing Metro 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) on behalf of MMRDA, has not been allotted land for the Metro 6 depot yet. “Exact location of depot is not yet finalised. The plan shall be prepared only after finalization of the land,” the reply stated. Officials from MMRDA said there are two land parcels under consideration. “Whichever is allotted by the state government, we will start work,” the official said. Direct connectivity for Metro 7 stationsMMRDA has approved two proposals for direct connectivity with Metro 7 stations. Sonia Sethi, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said two foot overbridges – one from Aarey station to Oberoi Realty; and another from Poisar station to Shapoorji Pallonji – have been approved. “We are looking at other proposals too. The cost of construction will be undertaken by the developers,” Sethi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-metro-2a-7-trial-runs-to-start-from-january-14/story-z4Z389gTYhMHrvOCeNA7yI.html

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Biryani king of Mumbai Jaffer Bhai Mansuri passes away||Jaffer Bhai Mansuri (83), fondly known as the Biryani King of Mumbai passed away at Breach Candy Hospital on Thursday. He was being treated for Covid-19. “He was taken to Breach Candy last week. But his oxygen saturation decreased and he was shifted to a ventilator on Sept 2. He died yesterday due to a heart attack,” confirmed a source from Breach Candy hospital. Mansuri had not been feeling well for the past month, according to his family members and was put on a ventilator last week. The founder of Delhi Darbar and Jaffer Bhai’s Delhi Darbar chain, Mansoori’s death is being mourned by the hotel industry at large. Mansuri founded the Delhi Darbar restaurant in 1973 in Grant Road, Mumbai. In 2006, he set up a chain of restaurants called ‘Jaffer Bhai’s Delhi Darbar’ after branching out from the family business. Known for its tasty kebabs and mouth watering biryani, the Delhi Darbar chain owns several restaurants in the city from Grant Road to Jogeshwari. The chain also has several restaurants in the UAE. Also Read: Covid-19 respite for Mumbai unlikely till New Year says BMC, it has a logicShivanand Shetty, president of the Association of Hotel & Restaurant (AHAR) said that Jaffer Bhai was a pioneer in the hotel industry who had many firsts to his name. “Delhi Darbar was one of the earliest attempts of brand building in the city. At the time, even when people owned multiple eateries, they did not have the same name. Jaffer Bhai built Delhi Darbar into a big, credible brand. His kebabs and biryani are known across the globe. He also introduced the idea of a central kitchen, wherein the main ingredients are sent from a single place to ensure the same taste across multiple branches,” he added. Jaffer Bhai was one of the founder-members of AHAR when the association was formed in 1979. “From a single restaurant in Grant Road, Jaffer Bhai managed to build an empire of restaurants and food delivery joints across the city all the way to Navi Mumbai,” said culinary anthropologist and food historian Kurush Dalal. Known for being ahead of his times, what with starting paperless food orders in his restaurants and introducing the Afghani biryani to those who preferred their biryani less spicy, he was the man at the forefront of all new ideas.“He loved cooking and up until very recently, he would be fiddling in the kitchen and making magic happen. I wish the family all the luck in taking his legacy to greater heights,” added Dalal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biryani-king-of-mumbai-jaffer-bhai-mansuri-passes-away/story-lmHlCZl6zOOWm9UrU4dzSP.html

She said her husband died due to reaction after consuming those medicines.Patil was also booked under section 33 of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961, after it was found that contrary to his claim of having finished medical studies prior to 1976, his certificate of registration didn’t mention the year in which it was issued.Also Read: Ensure enough beds, doctors available for Covid-19 patients: Bombay HCPatil had moved the HC seeking quashing of the FIR, primarily relying on the June 2014 amendment to the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961.

No decision has been taken on any further lockdown as of now. The lockdown scheduled on September 12 has been cancelled,” said a senior official of the state government. The union government, in its Unlock 4 guidelines, had directed the state not to impose lockdown restrictions at the local level without consulting the centre.The Mamata Banerjee administration, which had declared three complete state-wide lockdowns on September 7, 11 and 12, cancelled the September 12 lockdown due to the national entrance cum eligibility test (NEET) scheduled to take place a day later on September 13.

People were being sent back home or were being arrested if they failed to provide valid reasons for violating the lockdown. Earlier in August, the state government had enforced a state-wide lockdown on six different days, in an attempt to break the chain of Covid-19 infections. Around 5,000 people were arrested for violating lockdown orders and around 2,500 people were booked for not wearing a mask on lockdown days. “Situation is gradually improving even though there is no room for complacency. Even though the daily numbers of new cases have shot up, the positivity rate has dropped and the discharge rate has improved,” said a senior health official.

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 respite for Mumbai unlikely till New Year says BMC, it has a logic||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) does not see much improvement happening in Mumbai’s Covid-19 situation until the New Year due to fears that the upcoming festival season-- comprising at least one big festival including Diwali, Navaratri, Christmas and New Year falling every month-- will lend itself to regular spike in infections, before a possible significant decline is noticed.Mumbai had witnessed a plateauing of cases in August, however, Ganesh festival, relaxations in Mission Begin Again and increased testing, are widely believed to be behind the resurgence of cases in the city. The civic body is expecting Covid-19 cases to further go up by the end of this year.All ward officials have been put on alert and told to strengthen contact tracing of the infected in slums and in residential buildings. Nearly 80 percent of Covid cases in the city are being reported from high rises and housing societies, contrary to the spike earlier seen in slums.As per expectations, average daily Covid cases shot up after Ganesh Chaturthi from nearly a 1000 cases in August to 1,800 + cases in the first week of September. The city reported record-breaking single-day spikes on the last two consecutive days with 2,227 and 2, 371 cases reported on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.Also Read: Covid-19 winners gain in public share saleSuresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “Next two to three months will be crucial because there are major festivals lined up when people are likely to come in contact while greeting each other.”Also Read: Positivity rate dips in Mumbai even as Covid-19 cases surgeAmid the recent spike in infections, the BMC has also increased Covid testing in the city. On Wednesday, it conducted a record 15, 701 tests. More than 60 % of total tests are conducted using rapid antigen kits, which deliver results within 15-20 minutes but are less accurate compared to the RT-PCR tests.

11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Wait for high-end cycles to get longer amid surge in global demand||If you are a recently converted fitness enthusiast and have discovered that a high-end bicycle is your preferred route to health, you need to develop muscle for patience. The wait for premium cycles is expected to get longer after October, when existing supplies (gear components) used in high-end bicycles are likely to be exhausted with the makers. The reason: Bicycle manufacturers in Ludhiana will not be able to order select gear parts used in high-end cycles as Japanese companies that manufacture these are not taking new orders for the next six months till February 2021. The huge global demand for these has led to the situation. Leading brands like Hero and Avon in Ludhiana are facing shortage of such components, leading to huge waiting time with dealers. Japanese firm Shimano, a major supplier, is shifting its unit from China to Singapore, adding to the delay. Some firms make these parts in India, but these are not good quality, rue manufacturers. The prices of these high-end cycles are likely to jack up, with fear of black marketing. Ludhiana, which accounts for nearly 90% production of cycles in the country, has witnessed 100% growth in figures post-easing of lockdown. Brands are delivering with 10-15 day waiting, due to huge orders. Manufacturers said there was a global shortage of multi-speed gear components (front and rear derailleur and shifters). “Shimano had its first factory in Japan years ago, but shut it down as labour costs are prohibitive. They have automatic plants in China, Malaysia and Singapore. The company is not taking orders, as it is clearing a huge backlog. The order we placed three months ago, will reach us in some time, but will not be enough,” said Omkar Singh Pahwa, chairman and managing director (CMD) of Avon Cycles. Pahwa added the parts were key components. “This forms the basic transmission system of these bikes. Other parts are manufactured indigenously, but we have always been importing these three components, as clients demand it,” he added. Hero Cycles CMD Pankaj Munjal told HT that the demand for cycles has gone up, hence shortages have doubled. “Shimano and other companies of that league have always worked with a six-month demand forecast. Some Japanese companies are planning to move out of China, hence the disruption. It is this huge shift towards outdoor fitness that is changing the world’s landscape,” said Munjal. He added India was among the lowest in the world for fitness penetration ratios until covid and the ratio was shooting up. “With smart cities and cycling tracks coming up, demand surge will continue,” added Munjal. Neelam Cycles Ludhiana chairman KK Seth said scarcity of raw material for high-end cycles was a grave concern. “We receive calls from dealers for high-end cycles. When we say it is not available, they settle for traditional bikes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wait-for-high-end-cycles-to-get-longer-amid-surge-in-global-demand/story-rSC4eDxhjwWDKLqGCO5UAL.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Former Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini moves SC after high court dismisses bail petition||Former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini has moved the Supreme Court, seeking anticipatory bail in a case related to the alleged abduction and disappearance of a junior engineer, Balwant Singh Multani, in 1991.Saini, who is likely to be represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, moved the apex court on Thursday evening after the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday dismissed his bail plea. Punjab Police too filed a caveat requesting the Supreme Court to hear it before any order is passed in the case. The matter is likely to come up for hearing next week, lawyers from both sides said. Saini, a 1982-batch Indian Police Service officer, who was the youngest DGP in the country, was booked along with six others on May 6 at Mataur police station in Mohali for the alleged kidnapping of Multani in 1991. Murder charge was invoked in August after two of the accused policemen turned approvers.Multani worked with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) and was picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, who was then Chandigarh senior superintendent of police. Saini was injured in the attack and three policemen were killed. Saini retired in 2018 after 36 years of service.‘POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CONSPIRACY’Saini claims that the case against him is an example of “politically motivated conspiracy” by the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab. He says he was granted bail by the trial court after the registration of the FIR, hence, it should continue. In 2008, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also registered a case against him that was later quashed by the Supreme Court. This is another argument put forward by Saini who added that when Covid-19 was at a peak, under “a politically motivated conspiracy, an FIR was registered against him on the same facts by the state machinery. Saini was part of the then director general of police KPS Gill’s team that helped eliminate terrorism in the state. His bail petition mentions his outstanding service record.“When the state of Punjab was going through a difficult period, he took active part in counter terrorism and anti-insurgency operations. The applicant is a decorated officer and was awarded the President’s Police Medal for gallantry and The Wound Medal (now referred to as Parakram medal). He has been a target of anti-national and terrorist elements,” the petition said. The petition also said that after abatement of terrorism in Punjab, the applicant has been involved in unearthing scams and scandals. He served as head of the state Vigilance Bureau from 2007 to 2012 and during his tenure “a number of criminal cases were registered against members of the political party, which is now in power in the state of Punjab”, the main reason Saini mentions in his plea on the registration of the FIR. On September 8, the high court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea, observing that the same cannot be allowed as there is every likelihood of Saini stifling fair investigation and trial. “The investigating agency has woken up and gathered courage to investigate its own officer and therefore, the vital pieces of evidence which would come handy in leading to various leads would inch towards unravelling this puzzle, which too has baffled the citizenry who are looking upon the justice system as a last resort to get justice,” the high court bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh observed on why Saini’s custodial interrogation is warranted. According to Punjab Police, Saini has ‘Z’ category security cover but his whereabouts are not known for nearly a week now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-punjab-police-chief-sumedh-singh-saini-moves-sc-after-high-court-dismisses-bail-petition/story-17oo3Eh8KQ0BRJEV40Lu0K.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||High-speed Mumbai-Nagpur train corridor can slash travel time by 50%||The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) plans to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the construction of a high speed 753 km railway corridor that is expected to cut the travel time between Mumbai and Nagpur by half from over 11 hours currently to just six, officials aware of the matter said.The fastest Duronto Express between the two cities departs from Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus at 8.15 pm and reaches Nagpur the next day at 7.30 am.“The speed of [bullet] trains between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will be 320 km per hour [along an under-construction high-speed corridor]. ...the exact speed and time [trains will take along the Mumbai-Nagpur corridor] will be determined after the DPR is prepared but we expect to reduce the travel time by up to 50%.” said an NHSRCL official.NHSRCL on Tuesday floated a tender for a survey to identify overhead, overground and underground utilities that will be required for the proposed corridor.The survey will also include identification of power sourcing options for substations along the Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur high-speed railway corridor.“DPR will be prepared on the basis of the details we get from the survey. It will be crucial as it will determine the area required, the pathway of the railway corridor, and other technicalities. Once data is received, we will begin preparing the DPR,” said another NHSRCL official.Passenger associations have welcomed the move and said the proposed high-speed railway corridor will help Maharashtra’s economy. “The capital of Maharashtra is Mumbai but Nagpur is a very important city. The reduction in travel time will not just help passengers but will also businesses,” said Subash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/high-speed-mumbai-nagpur-train-corridor-can-slash-travel-time-by-50/story-ndavh7fCeIq5tSM3Sr9ibN.html

The search had started after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had asked the authorities to employ “sons of the soil” for the construction work for the ongoing Metro Rail projects and not depend on migrant workers.There was an exodus of migrant workers from Mumbai following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and its resultant lockdown restrictions for over two months.Also Read: Maharashtra has come a long way in fight against Covid, says CM Uddhav ThackerayAt present, around 200 people from Maharashtra are employed at the Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro 7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East) sites. Altogether, 6,332 workers are engaged at various Metro Rail construction sites in Mumbai. In June, the MMRDA had released a requirement for 16,000 construction workers at its sites following the CM’s instructions. “Labourers from Maharashtra are more equipped for industrial or factory works,” said RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, at a press conference on Thursday. He said the authorities would make arrangements to ferry construction labourers from other states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Around 60% of migrant labourers had left Mumbai after nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak. The lockdown has also led to delays in the Metro Rail construction work. The two Metro Rail lines --- 2A and 7 ---- that were to be operational by December are likely to become functional by May next year.Rajeev said Maharashtra chief secretary had also written to the Railway Board recently to arrange for special trains to ferry migrant construction workers to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-many-in-maharashtra-adept-at-construction-work-authorities-find/story-NsQ7tL02BLUY5izM8EcnKM.html

The Jharkhand HC had on August 28 deferred the case to Friday as the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) counsel, assistant solicitor general Rajiv Sinha, had fallen ill.The fodder scam case concerns fraudulent withdrawals amounting to Rs 33.67 crore from the Chaibasa treasury when Lalu Prasad was the chief minister of Bihar.Devarshi Mandal, the former chief minister’s lawyer, had earlier said that Lalu Prasad’s chances of securing bail are high as the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader has served half of his jail term and that his health is deteriorating.The RJD chief has been convicted in three-fodder scam cases so far. A trial court in Ranchi had held him guilty in the first of the six cases registered against him in September 2013 sentencing him to five years in prison. He was also banned from contesting polls and disqualified from Parliament.He was again convicted in December 2017 in three other fodder scam cases. He was shifted from Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Jail in March 2018 to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences due to his health conditions and is currently being treated there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-hc-to-hear-lalu-prasad-s-bail-plea-in-fodder-scam-case/story-hzeCySHoQWZDodGW7QwxvK.html
11-09-2020||Election:||The importance of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh||Dr. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh (74), or Raghuvansh babu for those who have a ready connect with him, is a prized upper caste asset of a party that survives on backward caste politics, a loyal lieutenant of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad since the late 1980s, the party’s intellectual powerhouse and a doctorate in mathematics. He is also the unsung architect of India’s biggest welfare programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) of 2005. Singh, a man of unquestionable integrity, was the Union rural development minister during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA-1) government (2004- 09) when his political boss Prasad was the minister for railways. An MP from Bihar’s Vaishali constituency, Singh was entrusted with the key social sector ministry amid a flurry of welfare activities that would soon transform welfare models for poor Indians. To be sure, MGNREGA faced its usual delay as at least three Congress heavyweights were not fully convinced of its utility and saw the programme as a leaky cauldron of public funds. One afternoon, as UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi was passing through the Central Hall in Parliament, Singh walked up to her and briefed her about the inordinate delay in framing the scheme. Within a few minutes, Gandhi summoned the then defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who headed the Group of Ministers (GoM) on MGNREGA, and told him to expedite the project. Soon, MGNREGA was rolled out in 200 districts in the country in 2006. Singh was also instrumental in launching the disabled, widows and old age pension schemes. And it was during his tenure that the government started the process of amending the land acquisition law, which took final shape during UPA’s second tenure. Singh’s association with Prasad goes back over three decades. And, he is also perhaps the only leader who could openly criticise Prasad and get away unscathed. Once he was asked in an interview how he would rate Prasad’s achievements. Singh replied that in political management, his boss would score a perfect 10 on 10 but as an administrator, he deserved nothing more than a zero. Singh’s baiters within the RJD pounced on the opportunity to paint him in poor light before Prasad. They quickly brought the paper clippings to the RJD boss, demanding action against the former mathematics professor. The RJD chief, however, disappointed them: “Yes, he should not have said such a thing publicly, but whatever he has said is also not incorrect.” It’s the Prasad bond that kept Singh alive in the RJD. He didn’t leave Prasad even though the Congress and other parties were always willing to accept him. In 2009, the Congress had again offered him the rural development ministry, even though the RJD had ceased to be an UPA ally. But Prasad didn’t agree. Weeks before the upcoming Bihar elections – slated to be held on schedule in October and November, despite the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak – Singh on Thursday, submitted a hand-written resignation letter to Prasad. It said: “After (former Bihar chief minister) Karpuri Thakur’s death, I stood by you for 32 years, but no more.” Party insiders said his equation with the new generation of RJD leaders has been under strain for a while now. At present, Singh is admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi and is recovering from Covid-19-related complications. Prasad responded to Singh’s letter and urged him not to join another party. “A letter written by you is circulating in the media. I cannot believe it. Me, my family and the RJD family want to see you recover soon. We will talk after you recover. You are not going anywhere. Just mind it,” the RJD chief said. There have been swirling rumours that Singh could be headed towards Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), ahead of the assembly polls. The entry in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) camp may also help him regain his Vaishali seat, which he has not won since 2009. It could be a win-win situation for both CM Kumar and Singh. CM Kumar, who once got five pieces of advice on how to run the Bihar government from Singh written in a paper napkin on a flight, will get a trusted voice to represent the party in Delhi or even in the Modi cabinet. Singh, a low-key politician known for his grassroots brand of politics, has been an unflinching champion of the poor. Once he had written a letter to the then PM Manmohan Singh accusing a top-ranking minister of being anti-poor, or gharib-virodhi. The then Planning Commission chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had tried to mediate and told Singh that the senior minister was pained about his letter and he would want to accompany him to some of the villages to see how rural programmes were in progress. “No”, Singh had replied, “he should come with me in the peak of summer in north Bihar and stay in an unelectrified village for at least three nights. Only then he would understand what it means to live in an Indian village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/the-importance-of-raghuvansh-prasad-singh/story-RFdbUdSRVUFthdcJF0LRdK.html

The team found that there was availability of 400 oxygen cylinders in the hospital and there was enough oxygen for 156 patients admitted,” said an official press release from the CMHO office on Thursday. The release further stated that the four deaths at the hospital were not related to coronavirus.“There were deaths of four patients in the hospital on September 8- Shantabai, 65, Ashok Nanuram Kumawat, 42, Jubobai, 74, and Anandrao, 52. They died due to different diseases and all these four patients had tested negative for coronavirus,” it said. Also Read: MP CM Chouhan asks Uddhav Thackeray to resume oxygen supply to his stateA district administration official said, “No one came forward to lodge any complaint regarding any death caused due to want of oxygen but the inquiry was instituted in view of the social media post.” Earlier, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said he had a talk with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday and urged him to resume supply of oxygen to Madhya Pradesh for Covid patients.Also Read: Maharashtra has come a long way in fight against Covid, says CM Uddhav Thackeray Talking to journalists, Chouhan said the state government was also working on short-term and long-term plans to increase production of medical oxygen in the state itself. Notably, Maharashtra government, on September7, ordered that 80% of oxygen produced in units in the state will be used only for medical treatment in the state and the remaining 20% can be used for industrial purposes in Maharashtra itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/viral-post-claims-3-mp-covid-deaths-due-to-lack-of-oxygen-probe-reveals-truth/story-ZLCNOSqCsGRwJO0xapyaeK.html

11-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s Magenta, Grey lines resume services today after gap of 173 days||Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line and Grey Line resumed operations on Friday after being closed for 173 days due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, officials said.Services started at 7am as part of the second stage of the graded reopening of Delhi Metro, which was closed on March 22 to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.“With the people of Delhi-NCR efficiently following our safety guidelines, we have successfully begun operations on the magenta and grey lines today,” the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said, according to news agency ANI. This is the second stage of the graded manner in which Delhi Metro services are being brought back to operation after being closed for over five months.In this stage, trains will operate in batches of six-hour each from 7 am to 1 pm and 4-10 pm. Services on other lines which had opened under stage one from Monday through Thursday would now also follow the stage two schedule. Prior to this, Yellow line and Rapid Metro were the first ones to be reopened on Monday, followed by Blue line and Pink line resuming services on Wednesday.Delhi Metro trains were back on track on September 7 after a gap of almost six months. In the fourth phase of unlocking, the ministry of home affairs allowed metro services to begin.On Thursday, three days after the DMRC resumed its services in a phase-wise manner, the total ridership of Delhi Metro was approximately 47,600 between 7 am to 11 am. Red line, Violet line and Green line were made operational yesterday. “After resuming services on most of its lines under stage-I of the graded resumption from September 7-10 where services being run for four hours each in the morning and evening, the Delhi Metro will now resume services on its last major corridor, Line-8 i.e, Magenta Line from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden (37.5 KM/25 stations) tomorrow, (with 26 trains)” the DMRC said in a statement. Also Line-9 or Grey line from Dwarka to Najafgarh (4.3 KM with three stations) will also be resuming services from Friday with two trains, it said. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had recently issued guidelines allowing the Delhi Metro to resume operations in a graded manner, following which the DMRC had said it would be done in three stages from September 7-12. The train services will follow broadly the same frequency which used to be before lockdown, it said. Normal timing of services throughout the day from 6 am to 11 pm will become applicable from September 12 onwards. All lines will have resumed services when Airport Express line from New Delhi to Dwarka Sec-21 (22.7 km with six stations) is made operational under stage-III, the last stage under graded resumption plan of metro services, the statement said. On Sundays (starting from September 20) the services will commence at 8 am from all such sections which had this practice in vogue before the lockdown also. However, on this Sunday-- September 13, the services on these lines will commence at 6 am as per the existing schedule, it added. Thus, all lines of the Delhi Metro network comprising 349 km and 253 metro stations will be fully operational once again from September 12. Owing to new norms of social distancing in place now which has significantly reduced the number of persons to be carried in a train, DMRC has also decided to run the peak hour frequency of trains from 8 am to 8 pm, doing away with the concept of off-peak hours from 11 am to 4 pm where services were available with less trains or trips earlier, the statement said. From start of services till 8 am, it will be available in the range of 3 minutes to 15 min as the trains are gradually inducted from depots to lines.  From 8 am to 8 pm, on all the main stretches of lines, frequency will be in the range of 2 minutes and 45 sec to 6 minutes, the DMRC said. From 8 pm to close of services, frequency will be in the range of 3 minutes to 15 min as the trains are gradually returning to depots, it said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-magenta-grey-lines-to-resume-services-after-gap-of-173-days/story-tNGVqdHYRf1sMibAfj9gOK.html

The SGPC has asked its all dharam parchar (religion propagation) committee staff to visit even private residences to record the number of Guru Granth Sahib and their place of printing. “The exercise will be undertaken to locate every saroop of Guru Granth Sahib. The motive is to find the missing saroops. Once we get some clue, then SGPC can link the chain to ascertain how the saroops were taken without record and how many such saroops are there,” said an SGPC official.Every saroop of Guru Granth Sahib printed from the SGPC carries a serial number, while private publishers also do the same. As per a letter issued by the dharam parchar committee, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal has ordered to get the serial number and other details of every saroop. Two pro forma were also supplied to officials wherein they will fill details of saroops in gurdwaras, in private residence, etc. The SGPC has asked its employees to complete the exercise in a week.The SGPC faced severe criticism as an inquiry committee formed by the Akal Takht indicted several of its officials, including top functionaries, for missing saroops from its publishing house where a fire broke out in 2016. Then the SGPC decided to lodge an FIR against the erring official, but later did a U-turn.Parnam Singh, SGPC employee and head granthi at Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, Patiala, briefed several teams which will start the process in eight SGPC segments of the district. Similar exercise has been initiated in other parts of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rattled-by-missing-saroops-sgpc-starts-door-to-door-counting-of-holy-book/story-RDwHxjuk75iLPp8y8dchII.html

Last week, the SIT probing the 2015 police firing incidents had approached the court with a petition seeking pardon for prime accused inspector Pardeep Singh, the then reader to former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma, as he wanted to turn an approver in the case. On Wednesday, the district and sessions judge Sumeet Malhotra directed SIT member inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh to appear in the court as his presence was required to a decision on the plea. The court adjourned the matter to September 15 for order. The court allowed the SIT’s plea seeking a copy of the statement recorded by inspector Pradeep to the court. The 18-page sealed statement of Pardeep was opened in the court and a copy was supplied to SIT.Resham Singh, one of the prime witnesses and brother of firing victim Krishan Bhagwan Singh, had approached the court claiming enough evidence on record that the application of Pardeep Singh and SIT should not be accepted.During the arguments, Resham’s counsel said Pardeep should not be pardoned as he is the prime accused in the case. When the court asked as who were the prime accused in the Behbal Kalan firing case, the IG said the then DGP Saini and now suspended IG Umaranangal (then Ludhiana police commissioner) were the main conspirators in the episode. Umaranangal was specially deputed in the district in the wake of the protests. He further said besides Pardeep’s statement, the investigation team has sufficient “independent evidence” against them to prove its claim. The SIT told the court that it will soon file a supplementary chargesheet in the case.Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village had died in the police firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. Besides, many were seriously injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/behbal-kalan-firing-ex-dgp-saini-suspended-ig-umaranangal-main-conspirators-in-episode-sit-to-court/story-VX9Rhtw8fXKy2VKOAcKaRN.html

11-09-2020||City||BJP-Shiv Sena fight gets fiercer over Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probe||The proxy war between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the Sushant Singh Rajput probe has widened the rift between the former allies-turned-foes, diminishing scope for reconciliation in Maharashtra in the future. The BJP’s shadow attack on Sena scion and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray in the case and now Centre’s backing of actor Kangana Ranaut has rankled and irked the Sena. A close political aide of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the CM and his wife Rashmi Thackeray were upset with the way Aaditya, who has been groomed and launched as the political heir of the Sena, got dragged into the controversy. “The CM has been hurt with the way the BJP twisted the entire SSR probe narrative to defame and malign his son, when he had absolutely nothing to do with the case. He even conveyed his displeasure through his aide and minister Anil Parab to the former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis around 10 days ago, asking the latter to back off from personal attacks,” said this aide of Thackeray. It is learnt that Thackeray conveyed that while he understood there would be political attacks like in the case of Palghar lynching of sadhus, he was dismayed with the way his son was attacked through trolls and BJP leaders. Parab’s missive, the aide added, had prompted Fadnavis to point out in public that the BJP had never directly named any Sena minister in connection to Rajput’s death. And, there had been a toning down of the attack from BJP after this. When asked, Fadnavis did not comment on this missive to HT; Sena also did not officially confirm this. However, soon after this missive from Sena, Ranaut versus Sena verbal tussle cascaded, leading to the demolition of the actor’s office on Wednesday. The beginning of Ranaut’s verbal spat with Sena MP Sanjay Raut is also linked to the BJP. She said she was scared of Mumbai Police in response to a tweet from BJP leader Ram Kadam, who questioned why the Maharashtra government had not offered protection to the actor, who had said she could expose Bollywood and drug mafia.The ongoing clash with actor Ranaut has further hardened party lines. “By providing security to Ranaut, the Centre has in a way unleashed this actor on our leadership. The way she has spoken about Thackeray will not be taken lightly by us,” added this leader. He added there was no question of a future reconciliation with the BJP given that the latter was openly attacking Thackeray’s leadership. A senior state BJP leader also said that the way SSR probe narrative had been played out dealt a death knell on any future alliance with the Sena. “This is a point of no return. It stems from this government’s lack of political acumen and arrogance because they failed to get even an FIR filed in nearly three months in the case. Our party decisions are made in Delhi and not here. It is clear that for now focus is on Bihar polls,” he said. The leader added, “For now, there are no plans for Maharashtra. But we don’t see a future alliance with the Sena or NCP possible now. An alliance with disenchanted Ajit Pawar, if he breaks out ahead of elections, can be imagined, but our party seniors are in no rush at the moment.” Political analyst Hemant Desai also opined that post SSR probe, the Sena had now closed all doors on BJP and the party would sharpen its attack on the Opposition and vice versa. “The way Aaditya was targeted and the way Ranaut has taken on Thackeray with a clear backing of the BJP-led Centre, one can say reconciliation is not possible now. The Sena and NCP alliance will get cemented, although Ajit Pawar’s role remains shaky. And, BJP will keep that door open,” said Desai. BJP state spokesperson Keshav Upadhyaya said the party was only focussing on taking up people’s issues and playing the role of a strong Opposition. “We are not thinking about future relations, reconciliations etc. Our job is to be a responsible opposition and we are expressing people’s sentiments and anger over SSR probe, that’s all.” Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the issue of Ranaut was over for the party. “This issue is over for us. Our alliance is doing fine as is our government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-shiv-sena-fight-gets-fiercer-over-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-probe/story-lePvi6K4Pm36OppDpomPfI.html

Their bodies were then dumped in cardboard cartons after being wrapped in plastic sheets. The next day, a garbage collector discovered the bodies, following which the police filed a first information report and began probe into the case. Upadhyay was arrested on December 22, 2015 for the murders. While Rajbhar continues to be absconding, the other accused in the case – Shiv Kumar Rajbhar, Pradip Kumar Rajbhar, Vijay Kumar Rajbhar and Azad Rajbhar were arrested during the probe. Upadhyay’s plea for interim bail reached the sessions court last month and was scheduled for hearing on Thursday. However, his lawyer Bharat Manghani made an application to withdraw the plea. “Chintan’s regular bail application is pending in the (Bombay) high court. This application was preferred through jail on April 2, soon after the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19. However, it was sent to the court quite late. Now, as the matter is pending before Bombay high court, we decided to withdraw the plea for interim bail and pursue his regular bail plea,” said Manghani. The court also rejected the bail plea of Vijay Rajbhar. The special court also asked the prosecution to bring witnesses before the bench to resume the trial in the murder case and to “take necessary positive steps to secure the presence of its witnesses and for production of accused person during the trial either physically or through video-conferencing.” “We are ready to resume the trial. If the witnesses are available, we would make an attempt to examine him (Upadhyay) on the next date on Monday,” said special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade. The prosecution has so far examined 10 witnesses. However, the evidence of one of the witnesses was partly recorded as he was not available on some occasions. The prosecution on Thursday informed the court that they would try to complete the evidence of the pending witness and with that resume the trial. The court asked the prosecution to make the necessary arrangements for the trial through video-conferencing by using many of the available apps, if the witnesses cannot remain present (in court) due to the Covid-19 situation. The court also asked the prosecution to take the necessary steps pertaining to the absconding accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/artist-chintan-upadhyay-withdraws-interim-bail-plea-in-murder-case-of-wife-her-lawyer-sessions-court-in-mumbai-asks-prosecution-to-take-steps-to-begin-trial/story-jTwYlO7ZTJZ9jWatPyNBzO.html

The fake circular, which was shared on social media platforms, stated that beneficiaries of houses under SRA could sell or transfer his house in five years instead of the 10-year lock-in period.Lokhande said, “My office staff told me about the circular making rounds on social media. The accused even forged my signature. The circular claimed that the beneficiary of SRA house may now sell or transfer his house in five years instead of 10 years of lock-in period. Under SRA scheme, slum-dwellers get houses free of cost and they can’t sell or rent them out for 10 years.”Last week, Lokhande wrote an application to Mumbai Police requesting legal action against the person behind such act.Shashikant Bhandare, senior inspector from Nirmal Nagar police station, said, “We have registered a case against an unknown person and are looking for him. The said circular was circulated through WhatsApp.” The FIR has been registered under sections 193 (false evidence), 465 (forgery), and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/case-registered-against-fake-sra-circular-circulation-in-mumbai/story-7H6Zgq9V0QfsPxhUW3ZLDM.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||‘Vikel Te Pikel’ initiative: Maharashtra government to connect farmers with 1,370 market-based value chains||The Maharashtra government has launched a new initiative ‘Vikel Te Pikel’ (sow that sells) to connect farmers with over 1,370 value chains, which will be developed across the state. The system will enable the farmers to grow crops based on the demand of end consumers, and established supply chains will guarantee the sale of their produce at competitive rates. State officials said that this will also help farmers to minimise the post-harvest loss of crops as produce can be stored properly and sold without delay.The initiative was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday.“Farmers are worried about minimum support price but we want them to move from guarantee price to good price against their produce. We have thus come up with this initiative through which demand-based farming will be promoted,” said Thackeray, while addressing a group of farmers, virtually.Eknath Dawale, secretary, state agriculture department said that the government is planning to develop 1,370 value chains that will be linked to the agricultural markets. “They will be developed with the help of farmer-producer groups and self-help groups that are into the business. Our approach is market linkage of the crops, and market access to the farmers by connecting them with these value chains. The farmers will take up crops based on the demand from the value chains, and thus won’t have to face hardships in selling the produce,” said Dawale.“Besides, farmers will be able to get proper remuneration against the yield, as against the present situation. They can also minimise post-harvest losses, which come to around 30% of their total produce, as their produce will be bought without delay. This means farmers can earn more and also avoid losses,” he added.The state agriculture department has called for applications on its portal — www.smart-mh.org — from farmers groups, self-help groups and others that are in the business.“The farmers are working blindly as they are unaware of the demand at both the fronts — quality and quantity. They need to work like a business that does research before starting. What’s the point if, after so much hard work, the agrarian community doesn’t get proper remuneration and cannot take care of their families,” Thackeray added.Dawale also said that till date, the approach of the agriculture department was to increase yield but now it has been changed to realisation of the produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-connect-farmers-with-1-370-market-based-value-chains/story-xqMYcW3q5l2QhPiTVQSyZO.html
11-09-2020||City||Kangana Ranaut’s neighbour designer Manish Malhotra gets Mumbai civic body notice over ‘illegal construction’, given 7 days to reply||Along with actor Kangana Ranaut, her neighbour and fashion designer Manish Malhotra was also issued a show-cause notice on Monday over alleged illegal construction in his Pali Hill bungalow. He was given seven days to reply. Ranaut had to respond to the show-cause notice in a day. At the time of going to press, Malhotra had not responded to HT’s messages, and his spokesperson too had no comments. Malhotra was issued the notice (a copy is with HT) under section 351 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC), Act alleging illegal erection/commencement of work. The notice mentions four violations – contrary to the section 342 and 346 of the MMC Act. It mentioned there is unauthorised change of user from residential to commercial office and addition and alteration by way of erecting partitions/cabins on the first floor; unauthorised construction of structure with brick wall and shed with sheet roof on the second floor terrace. The notice asked Malhotra to show evidence for the construction and alterations. The notice also added if Malhotra failed to show sufficient cause to BMC’s satisfaction, the said work will be pulled down and BMC can also take action under section 475A of the MMC Act, which includes imprisonment and fine.Ranaut was issued notice under section 354 (A) of the MMC Act giving her 24 hours to explain the alleged illegal construction or face action. BMC officials claimed work was going on at Ranaut’s bungalow and therefore as per procedure she was given notice under relevant sections, seeking her reply in 24 hours. “We have informed the Bombay high court our basis for issuing notice under section 354A of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and further giving her 24 hours, as per the provision. In case of Malhotra, we found alterations, but no work was ongoing at the time of inspection,” said a BMC official. The affidavit filed by the BMC in HC in Kangana’s case read: “At the time of inspection, workmen, materials and tolls were also found present and work was found to be going on in the property. Photographs pf the unlawful work carried out were also taken.” Ranaut in one of her tweets has also mentioned that there was some leakage related work ongoing at her house during BMC’s visit for inspection. In series of tweets she said, “Because of the criticism that BMC received from my friends on social media, they didn’t come with a bulldozer today, instead stuck a notice to stop leakage work that is going on in the office...”Advocate and BJP leader Vivekanand Gupta said, “Ranaut was deliberately issued notice under 354(A) to harrass her by asking for a reply to notice in 24 hours whereas alleged illegal construction notice to her neighbouring bungalow was given seven days to respond. I don’t see any urgency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kangana-ranaut-s-neighbour-designer-manish-malhotra-gets-mumbai-civic-body-notice-over-illegal-construction-given-7-days-to-reply/story-xAzg5mxLU3fpzlziZiYVzO.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Delay in FYJC admission due to stay on Maratha reservation worries Maharashtra colleges over completion of syllabus||With the state government’s decision to stay admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC), in line with the Supreme Court’s (SC) interim stay on Maratha reservation in jobs and education, colleges said they are worried about how these students will cope with the academic year. The general admission rounds to FYJC usually conclude by August, after which colleges begin. This year, however, due to late declaration of the Class 10 results, with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, the process began in August and only one admission round has concluded so far. With the stay on the admission process, colleges are now worried about completing the syllabus and conducting exams for Class 11. “Usually, colleges begin by August, and we conduct the first unit test by September. Then the first terminal exam is usually conducted before the Diwali break. This year the entire schedule has gone haywire, and we don’t know if there will be enough time to teach everything, even with the reduced syllabus,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal, Chandibai Himathmal Mansukhani (CHM) College, Ulhasnagar. Verhani said that the education department can consider pushing the academic year for these students up to June instead of April. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal at VG Vaze College, Mulund said that since Class 11 students are not known to the teachers, it might be a challenge to understand their learning needs in an online-only mode. “Getting used to the students is difficult because teachers have not seen them in the past. This is going to be a challenge for both, the teachers and students,” he added. On Tuesday, the education department released an official statement announcing a postponement of the second merit list which was supposed to be declared that day, after the SC stayed the Maratha quota in jobs and education. “The list is postponed, and admissions are stayed until further notice. Revised timetable for FYJC admissions will be released later after getting instructions from the state government,” stated the official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delay-in-fyjc-admission-due-to-stay-on-maratha-reservation-worries-maharashtra-colleges-over-completion-of-syllabus/story-l8gEgQW8OgHK2JKhFCkR4H.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Interim stay on Maratha reservation: Maharashtra government to move CJI; CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks opinion on course of action||In the wake of the major setback the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government received after the Supreme Court (SC) stayed the Maratha quota in jobs and education on Wednesday, chief minister (CM) Thackeray held a high-level meeting with his cabinet colleagues to address the matter. He will hold a second round with experts and senior counsels to decide the next step in the case. The government is expected to approach the Chief Justice of India with a request for revocation of the stay.Thackeray chaired a meeting which was attended by deputy CM Ajit Pawar, public works department minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on the reservation, four other ministers and senior officials from the government. In the meeting held at the CM’s official residence Varsha on Thursday evening, the ministers were briefed about the orders and ways for the state government to request the court to vacate the stay.According to the members of the cabinet sub-committee, the court order has contradictions and lacks merit. “There was no reason to initiate an interim stay on the quota while transferring the case to the larger bench. In none of the previous reservation cases that were transferred to the larger bench, the quota was stayed. The three-judge bench has observed that the reservation given to Marathas was not in an ‘exceptional and extraordinary’ situation. The report by the Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission had proved the backwardness of the community with the help of extensive data it collected,” said a minister, requesting anonymity.All these factors will be brought to the notice of the SC, the minister said. He added that the court will also be apprised about the chaos-like situation regarding college admissions, owing to the order.The group of ministers will hold a video conference with senior counsels to the government and experts on Friday afternoon.Meanwhile, alleging that some elements are trying to instigate the community in the wake of the stay order, the government has appealed to the Maratha community to maintain calm. “A few anti-social elements are active in instigating the community by posting misguiding matter on social media. They are aiming to provoke the community to resort to violence, and in turn, defame it. It is time to understand the conspiracy and maintain peace,” said Chavan.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded concessions to the Maratha community in education and jobs until the stay was vacated. “In the wake of the delay in enacting the law for the reservation, our [BJP] government had given the concessions to the community. Similar concessions are required to be given until the stay is vacated,” said BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/interim-stay-on-maratha-reservation-maharashtra-government-to-move-cji-cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-opinion-on-course-of-action/story-5Juus3AtQjP0XowEW6yHNK.html
11-09-2020||City||Kangana Ranaut episode is a closed chapter, no role in Mumbai civic corporation’s action, says Shiv Sena on demolition of part of actor’s office||Distancing itself from the ongoing spat with actor Kangana Ranaut, which led to demolition of alleged structural violations in her Pali Hill office on Wednesday, the Shiv Sena on Thursday said the “episode is a closed chapter”. Sena leader and party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut met party chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. However, Raut denied that the meeting was about the controversy. The Shiv Sena leadership, according to party insiders, has directed its leaders and spokesperson to not engage in any verbal spat on the actor’s statements. “I had met him in connection to an event. We have stopped discussion on that topic. What is left to discuss? The [Ranaut] episode is over and we have forgotten about it already. We are back to our daily political, social and administrative work,” Raut told reporters after meeting Thackeray. “The action at Ranaut’s office was carried out by BMC. It has no connection with the Shiv Sena. BMC has their legal department. You can talk to the mayor or BMC commissioner about it,” he said. However, Sena mouthpiece Saamana, which is edited by Raut, carried a page one story with headline “ukhaad lia” (demolished it) in reference to one of Ranaut’s’ dares to Sena to “do whatever they can”. The Sena leader also dismissed news that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had called Thackeray over the issue. “Do not spread such rumours. No such thing happened,” he said. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party was left red-faced by chief of ally Nationalist Congress Party Sharad Pawar on Wednesday when he publicly questioned the timing of the action taken by BMC and said the actor’s statements should not be given much importance. Raut, however, downplayed Pawar’s statements and said, “Whether it is Pawar saheb or Sonia ji, nobody has made any statement expressing disappointment [over the issue].” Meanwhile, Ranaut continued her attack on the Sena, accusing it of diluting its ideology to be in power and even called it “Sonia Sena”. In an indirect reference to Sena chief, the actor called him an “example of a dynast”. “Because of these petty crimes that they do @Dev_Fadnavis ji must have suggested that BJP does [no] alliance with them, one must never succumb to bullies, after losing elections ShivSena shamelessly made milavat sarkar and turned in to Sonia Sena. (sic),” she tweeted. Raut chose not to respond to it but said, “I don’t know what she tweets. I have not seen them. We do not read them, we only read Saamana.” In a veiled jibe at Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who summoned CM’s advisor Ajoy Mehta on the Ranaut issue, Raut said, “The governor’s job is to take stock of the happenings in the state. He must have thought that this is an important development.” Ahead of Raut’s visit to New Delhi on Friday, the security outside his residence in the capital has been beefed up following protests by members of the Karni Sena. “I do not have any idea about it. I will have to see; I am going to Delhi tomorrow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kangana-ranaut-episode-is-a-closed-chapter-no-role-in-mumbai-civic-corporation-s-action-says-shiv-sena-after-part-of-actor-s-office-is-demolished/story-J0fkbrZC8b2m5pDu0bs4bN.html

The matter has now been resolved as the shopkeepers have agreed to get the road repaired after establishing the wells. One of the shopkeepers, requesting anonymity, said that there are around 90 shops in the market, which falls under the jurisdiction of the zila parishad, and not a single penny had been spent for its maintenance. Accumulated rain water enters the shops due to which the shopkeepers have decided to establish five rainwater harvesting wells in the market at the cost of Rs 5 lakh, he added.“The MC had stopped us from taking up the project on Sunday after which we approached the mayor and apprised him of the issue.The mayor has given his approval to complete the work,” said the shopkeeper. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The shopkeepers have assured that they will he the road repaired after establishment of the rainwater harvesting wells. The MC officials have been told to grant the permission to take up the work as it is for the welfare of shopkeepers at large and no financial burden is being put on the MC.” Councillor Rakesh Prashar said that they are also working on a project to install a storm water sewer near the clock tower area to avoid water accumulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-shopkeepers-get-approval-to-install-rain-water-harvesting-wells/story-dpSuk1KnCjOHY7oOlaCNAK.html
11-09-2020||City||30% of Covid-19 cases in Amritsar reported since September 1||More than one-fourth (30%) of the total Covid-19 cases in Amritsar district were recorded since September 1 as 1,756 people were tested positive for the virus while 70 died in just 10 days. The district, which is among the worst-hit in Punjab, has reported a total of 5,798 coronavirus cases and 235 deaths. As many as 4,225 patients have recovered. The health officials attributed the spike in cases to the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions enforced to contain the spread of the contagion. Also, there has been a rise in intra- and inter-state travel, reopening of offices and restaurants, besides public gatherings, leading to a surge in the cases, the officials said. The district had only one Covid case in March, 89 cases in April, 302 in May, 565 in June and 902 cases in July. In August alone, the district recorded 2,139 cases of infection, nearly 38% of the total tally, and 85 deaths. “In the biggest single-day spike till date, the district reported 347 fresh cases on Wednesday and 225 cases on Thursday. Till August, an average 70-80 case were being reported daily but now we are recording over 150-180 cases a day. Besides, the positivity rate also increased in September as of the 17,045 samples tested so far, 1,756 were tested positive. The positivity rate is 10.3%”, said Amritsar’s assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh. “People are still not serious about the situation as they are not following social-distancing norms. The district is testing over 2,200 people daily. Our main focus is to detect infection at early stage so that we can control the fatality rate here,” he added. 50% PATIENTS IN HOME ISOLATIONAt present, about 50% of the district’s Covid-19 patients (active cases) are in home isolation with the number doubling from the last month. In August, nearly 25% people were isolated in home rather than institutional centres. “On Wednesday, of 1,280 active patients in the district, 641 were in home isolation. As people are now aware of the home isolation option, more are coming forward for testing, which is a positive sign,” Dr Amarjit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/30-of-covid-19-cases-in-amritsar-reported-since-sept-1/story-NHJ8I2NLxyjtQxjSAiKUuM.html

The members have requested the higher authorities including director public instructions and education secretary to rethink their decision and regularise the services of all teachers. They stated that the higher authorities have extended the probation period of the district president Didar Singh for another six months and as per rules, the authorities must regularise his services from April 1 and provide salary according to regular pay scale. Democratic Teachers’ Front president Hardev Singh Mullanpur, said, “For the last 11 years, Didar has been teaching in government schools and producing 100% results. He was also appreciated by the secretary, education for commendable performance.

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Positivity rate dips in Mumbai even as Covid-19 cases surge||There has been a drop of four percentage points in positivity rate in Mumbai even as the number of Covid-19 cases have witnessed a surge over the past few weeks. Positivity rate reflects the proportion of people who test positive among those who are tested. It is a good indicator to assess the prevalence of the novel coronavirus infection in the community.An analysis of data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Covid-19 dashboard reveals that between August 10 and August 24, 77,667 tests were conducted in the city and 14,529 people were diagnosed with Covid-19, which translates into a positivity rate of 18.70%. However, in the following two weeks, between August 25 and September 8, 20,580 Covid-19 cases were reported as 140,911 tests were conducted – a positivity rate of 14.60%. “Till August 24, we were running daily average tests of around 5,500 in the city. But now, we have increased it by almost 50%. It has gone up to almost 9,500. On September 8, we tested around 13,000 people, which is a record,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, adding that if the number of infected people had increased, the positivity rate, too, should have risen. “But it has declined and that proves Mumbai’s Covid-19 case graph hasn’t shot up.” The city’s overall positivity rate stands at 18.76% as on Wednesday, with 160,744 people having tested positive for Covid-19 from the 856,454 who were tested. Health experts said despite increasing daily testing, Mumbai is far behind Bengaluru and Delhi in total number of tests. Bengaluru has tested around 1.1 million people, while in Delhi close to 2 million people have been tested. “The number of tests is equally proportionate to the number of positive cases. So, the more we test, the more cases will come out. This might create panic among people, but it will help to break the chain of infection. In fact, the civic body should have increased their testing much earlier, considering Mumbai is the most populated city,” said Anant Bhan, a public health expert. Rapid antigen testing (RAT) has helped increase testing in Mumbai, as around 25% of the total tests conducted in the city are using RAT, which gives results in 30 minutes. For instance, on September 8, when 12,763 people were tested in Mumbai, 4,200 tests were conducted through RAT. “We are conducting close to 800 tests every day, that’s why we have the highest growth rate (1.61%). But we aren’t testing senior citizens above 50 years with RAT to rule out any chance of false negative reports,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer in R-Central (Borivli), which has recorded the third-highest number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/positivity-rate-dips-in-mumbai-even-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-lRuNbSYRvzQFShE1TJ0O6J.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab grapples with oxygen shortage, sends SOS to Haryana, Uttarakhand||With the coronavirus cases witnessing a sharp spike in Punjab in the recent weeks, the health department is grappling with shortage in supply of medical oxygen for patients in hospitals in several districts of the state. The 16 oxygen manufacturers and suppliers, mostly small, in Punjab are struggling to meet the increased demand from government and private hospitals. The medical-grade oxygen demand, which varied from 15 to 20 metric tonnes (MTs) a day on an average before the pandemic outbreak, has now shot up five-fold to around 100 MTs daily as per industry sources. The future demand for oxygen is likely to increase further in the event of the pandemic situation aggravating in the coming days. As per the state health department, the projected requirement of oxygen for both government and private hospitals in the state will be around 165 MTs daily by September 30. RS Sachdeva, managing director of Hitech Industries, the largest supplier in the state with its manufacturing plant and refilling unit in Mohali, said the supply of liquid oxygen was really tight. “The major oxygen generation plants in neighbouring states have a huge demand from other northern states. Therefore, hospitals, particularly small hospitals are facing a huge problem. We have placed orders for a new manufacturing plant in Amritsar and expand the capacity in Mohali, but it will take time,” he said. The state’s Covid-19 case count of 37,824 on August 21 has now raced well past the 70,000-mark, going up by 91% in the past three weeks. The number of active cases stood at 18,088 on Thursday. Oxygen is critical for patients of Covid-19, a respiratory disease that reaches the respiratory tract, mainly the lungs, leading to breathing problems, from mild to critical, as well as reducing oxygen in blood to dangerously low levels. Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC) managing director Tanu Kashyap said the availability of medical oxygen was a bit of a challenge. “Due to an increase in oxygen demand from all the states in the wake of coronavirus cases, there is an issue with regular supply. We are reviewing the oxygen availability on priority on a daily basis and have been managing things so far,” she said. The situation has set alarm bells ringing for the state government as Covid-19 cases are projected to race past the 1 lakh mark in the next few days. Director (industries) Sibin C said the oxygen manufacturers and suppliers in the state had limited capacity and were sourcing liquid oxygen from three major oxygen manufacturing plants, one each in Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. “They are facing shortage in supply of liquid oxygen from these units. The scarcity is likely to increase in the coming days. We have taken up the issue with the governments of the three states,” he said. Principal secretary (industries and commerce) Alok Shekhar has written to his counterparts in the three states requesting them to direct the manufacturing plants in their area to increase the supply of liquid oxygen to the hospitals as well as manufacturers and re-filling units in Punjab so as to reduce the shortage of oxygen in hospitals of the state. Also, the department has asked the oxygen makers and suppliers, who were supplying 20% of their oxygen for medical use and the rest to the industry (steel units) earlier, to give priority to hospitals. The industries director has written to the deputy commissioners of Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Bathinda, Amritsar and Jalandhar, asking them to call a meeting of oxygen manufacturers and refilling units in their areas to monitor their production. They should be asked to utilise the production capacity mainly for medical-grade oxygen, he wrote on September 3 after the health department flagged the issue. The power department has also been told to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to these units which complained of frequent power cuts leading to interruption in production and supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-grapples-with-oxygen-shortage-sends-sos-to-haryana-uttarakhand/story-DW3uEi9HAO04bg7fUwJN6M.html
11-09-2020||City||Mumbai civic body defends its demolition of alterations in actor Kangana Ranaut’s office||A day after the high-voltage drama over demolition of alleged structural violations in Kangana Ranaut’s office in Pali Hill in Bandra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday, in its affidavit filed before the Bombay high court (HC), said the actor’s allegations of harassment and mala fide action were false and unwarranted. The affidavit, file in response to the actor’s petition, justified the demolition on the grounds that 14 alterations and additions on the premises were not as per the sanctioned building plan. The official concerned acted as per a 2012 policy circular, which states “such construction should be removed forthwith on expiry of notice period of 24 hours”. “In light of these submissions and the fact that the actor has not claimed the demolished portions were legal, action of demolition as per section 35 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act was justified,” BMC’s affidavit stated, seeking dismissal of the petition. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy and Anil Sakhare appearing for BMC informed a division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla that Bhagyawant Late, designated officer, H-West ward, had filed the affidavit, acting on HC’s orders on Wednesday. The affidavit stated BMC officials had followed proper procedure of inspecting the site with proper permission from the person responsible in the property. The affidavit stated that during the inspection on Monday, it was found that on the ground floor, a toilet was converted into office cabin, unauthorised kitchen was constructed in store room, new toilets were constructed beside staircase inside storeroom and in parking area, and unauthorised pantry was built. It further stated that on the first floor, unauthorised room/cabin with wooden partition was made in the living room, unauthorised meeting room/cabin with wooden partition was made in the pooja room, toilets were built in open chowk area with brick masonry walls and slab at the front was extended horizontally by 2’6”. The violations on the second floor were staircase orientation change, balcony enclosed in habitable area by removing partition walls and an unauthorised horizontal extension of slab at the front admeasuring 3’, it said.The affidavit also stated that on observing the alterations and additions, the official served a notice to Ranaut on the same day. Thereafter, a stop-work notice was posted on the gate on September 8. However, as the notice was not heeded and unauthorised construction continued, as per the March 2012 BMC policy circular, demolition was carried out. As the court pointed out that the petition was filed in haste, Ranaut’s advocate Rizwan Siddiqui sought permission to amend it. Siddiqui submitted that he also wanted to put on record various facts and communications which his client had undertaken with the BMC ward office concerned over two years .

11-09-2020||City||World Suicide Prevention Day: Economic distress, erratic lifestyle pushing people on edge: Experts||On World Suicide Prevention Day (WSPD), mental health experts talk about the alarming rise in cases of suicide across the city amid the pandemic. According to the experts, uncertainty about the future, erratic lifestyle increased consumption of alcohol, and financial crisis amid the pandemic are certain factors that are triggering suicidal tendencies among people.Dr Ranjive Mahajan, professor and head of psychiatry, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H), says, “The pandemic has turned our lives upside down. There are three major factors people are currently battling with: Uncertainty about the future, financial distress, and Covid’s impact on our lifestyle.”“All this has contributed to increased consumption of alcohol and even drug abuse among few and driven many into depression which further triggers suicidal tendencies,” observed Dr Ranjive. Dr Mamta Singla, professor and head of the psychiatry department, Christian Medical College and Hospital, observed that people are getting frustrated over pandemic-related issues such as social distancing, isolation, financial crisis, as well as its undesirable consequences. “Most of the patients are facing a financial crisis and are talking about death or suicide, hopelessness and disturbed sleep patterns. Many patients have increased their consumption of the substance,” observed Dr Mittal.Study on the impact of Covid-19 Dr Mitthat Miglani, assistant professor, psychiatry, and Palak Upadhyay, assistant professor, clinical psychology, of DMC&H are conducting a study on the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of patients. “Many patients have been expressing concern for their families’ well-being, many are anxious about their physical condition and worried about when they would be sent home. Some are feeling guilty abouthaving spread it to their parents or children; some had trouble sleeping in a new place,” they said.“We realised that most of their fears and worries were rational and justified; normal response to a stressful situation,” they added. “What we found to be most interesting was the majority did not express feelings of loneliness or hopelessness. Their phones have become their saviors; friends and family video call them and play games with them online. We realised that our society’s strong family system is helping them maintain their sanity and face the crisis,” observed both the doctors.SYMPTOMSDr Tarlochan Singh, PhD, clinical psychology, said suicidal symptoms include talking about death or suicide, hopelessness, considering one’s self a burden, withdrawing completely from friends and family, losing interest in all kinds of activities, and extreme mood swings. WAYS TO BEAT COVID BLUES Dr Ranjiv and Dr Mittal suggested, “We have to bounce back to our previous routines. Early to bed and early to rise, exercise, meditation, yoga, healthy eating habits, and spending time with family and socialisation through the digital medium are some of the best ways to beat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/world-suicide-prevention-day-economic-distress-erratic-lifestyle-pushing-people-on-edge-experts/story-z46j1FLvxwJ0G8cDJ0lIHP.html

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks state to consider granting emergency parole to prisoners from other states||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Tuesday directed Maharashtra government to consider extending the benefit of emergency parole to prisoners from other states in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar directed the government to take a decision in this regard in 15 days.The directive came as a number of prisoners from outside Maharashtra who are lodged in state prisons challenged their exclusion from the benefit of emergency parole.Their lawyers said the high-power committee (HPC), appointed by the state government after the March 2020 Supreme Court order to decongest prisons to prevent spread of Covid-19 in jails, extended the benefit of emergency parole to certain categories of prisoners. They further said that prisoners whose residences are outside Maharashtra were not included primarily in view of the fact that due to travel restrictions prevailing at that time, they could not have reached their hometowns even if released on emergency parole.They added that since the Union ministry of home affairs has on August 22 written to chief secretaries of all states saying there are no restrictions on inter-state or intra-state movement of people or goods, the state government need to reconsider the HPC decision with regards to granting emergency parole to prisoners from other states.The HC said that in the changed circumstances, it was desirable that state government consider the same, and directed it to take a decision in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-state-to-consider-granting-emergency-parole-to-prisoners-from-other-states/story-1AWgyVoX4eHrdmAoxyd7lK.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Report on education facilities for specially-abled in rural areas: Bombay HC to Maharashtra government||While pulling up the state government for not taking sufficient measures to address the issue of education for differently-abled students during the unlock phases, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed district social welfare officers to visit and inspect learning centres and ensure that such students have access to online education. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the NGO Anaprem, was informed by advocate Uday Warunjikar that though the government had facilitated education for normal students during the various unlock phases, education of the differently-abled had been neglected. As a result, he submitted, more than 1 lakh differently-abled students in the state had been denied their right to education.Explaining the situation, Warunjikar said that while the state had made arrangements for online classes for normal students, the same could not be applied for hearing- and speech-impaired students as they needed specialised teaching aids. These, he said, were not provided by the government. Hence, he asked that directions be issued to the state to formulate a policy for such students and ensure that they get their right to education fulfilled.Warunjikar further submitted that circulars concerning education of the specially-abled were issued in May by the state, and agencies had been appointed in June to implement the circulars. However, after that, there was no progress. He also countered the state’s contention made by advocate Reena Salunkhe, that online classes had been arranged for specially-abled students, but that in most places in rural areas where centres of learning for the specially-abled were present, there was no internet connection. Hence, said Salunkhe, any initiative by the state was futile. On its part, the Central government informed the bench that the process was on to make digital platforms friendly to specially-abled students and impleadment of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was necessary to answer any other queries of the court in that regard, which the court allowed. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked Warunjikar about his expectations from the state and said that he should also give suggestions to resolve the issue of education for specially-abled students.“Having regard to the seriousness of the concerns raised by the petitioner, we direct all district social welfare officers to pay surprise visits to all learning centres in the course of the next 10 days, to ascertain the nature of services being rendered by such centres to challenged students. If any deficiency is noticed, the officer shall suitably advise the learning centre on how to [resolve] the same,” observed the bench. The bench further said that if a decision at the learning centre not possible, the district social welfare officer shall submit a status report before the joint secretary, social justice and special assistance department, who shall, in turn, file an affidavit before the HC. The bench then posted the petition for hearing after three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/report-on-education-facilities-for-specially-abled-in-rural-areas-bombay-hc-to-state/story-VqTUcZoeYcRnaYaC5JraBI.html

Following this, protests were staged by the Republican Party of India- Athawale (RPI-A) along with the deputy mayor from the same party and several others.PCMC deputy mayor Jagdish Gaikwad carried out protests with 150-200 RPI-A party workers against CIDCO. The site was purportedly a site of 2,500-year-old Buddhist rock-cut caves that were converted into a temple of local deity by villagers of Waghavli Wada, Panvel.On Monday, CIDCO officials, along with contractors for the construction of the airport, demolished the cave site. The demolition was carried out by a controlled blast.Meanwhile, the RPI-A leaders, learning of the demolition, were enraged as there were continuous talks with the CIDCO officials to protect the caves against demolition.Mahesh Khare, state secretary, RPI-A said, “We even requested them to move the site of the temple to respect the villagers’ sentiments. However, they sneakily demolished the site at night and stole temple artefacts.”CIDCO officials rubbished claims that the demolition was carried out in an irregular manner. “The demolition was carried out as per rules and regulations, and with the confirmation of local villagers. The villagers shifted the idols of the deity with permission from the authorities,” said Priya Ratambe, public relations officer at CIDCO.Gaikwad and Khare, with other RPI-A leaders and workers, protested in Panvel against CIDCO officials on Wednesday and demanded a case be registered against them for demolishing the caves.“We have proof from the archaeology department that these structures were caves built 2,500 years ago similar to the rock-cut Buddhist caves in Aurangabad. CIDCO officials and the contractors carried out demolition during night time during the lockdown. We have demanded that a case be registered against them,” said Gaikwad.In the 2013 order by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Maharashtra, the authorities noted the hillocks were levelled for the airport construction around the caves site. They also instructed that the caves are historical and should be protected from any damage.Following the protests, the Panvel police booked Gaikwad, Khare and four others for violating lockdown orders||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panvel-civic-body-deputy-mayor-protests-against-demolition-of-historical-caves-booked/story-FVrtpjC2F8Mauc47yCjqIK.html

The police tried to locate him at his friends’ place. However, when he was not found anywhere, the police formed teams to find the man.A police official requesting anonymity said, “We got information that Daki would visit Pankhanda village on Ghodbunder Road with his friend Tarude. We tried to reach out to Tarude. However, his phone went unanswered. So, we went to Pankhanda village. We found Daki’s bike parked in this village and suspected the involvement of Tarude in Daki gone missing.“During investigation, we got information of an auto-rickshaw driver whom Tarude had called on September 4 and asked to pick him up the following morning.”Tarude met the auto driver around 5 am on September 5 with two huge empty drums and asked him to take him to Vasai Creek side. He allegedly stopped near some bushes near Pankhanda and brought a heavy gunny bag and put it inside the drum.Police officials said, “He stopped the rickshaw on Ahmedabad highway and threw the gunny bag in the creek. Later, he asked the auto driver to drop him home.”Senior police inspector Kishor Khairnar said, “Our team was sure that something was wrong with Tarude’s activities. We started looking for him and on September 7, arrested him from his house. During interrogation, he confessed to the crime. He allegedly murdered Daki for his 400 gram gold chain. He planned this murder well in advance with his brother Ghodke and friend Paswan.“Accordingly, he called Daki near Pankhanda for a party. They strangulated him and later in the morning, Tarude threw his body in the creek. All the accused work as daily wage labourers and were struggling to find work for the last few days.”The three were arrested for murder and remanded to police custody till September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-held-for-killing-20-yr-old-for-gold-chain-dumping-body-in-vasai-creek/story-XCDchoJmCN0J1XmgwMa54O.html

11-09-2020||Mumbai||Issue e-passes to lawyers to travel on local trains on experimental basis: Bombay HC to Maharashtra government||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday suggested issuing e-passes to lawyers on an experimental basis to allow them to travel by local trains to attend physical hearings of cases. The HC made the suggestion after it was informed that many lawyers were unable to reach the HC for physical hearings as they did not have any other modes of transportation to reach the court except for local trains. According to government order, only personnel employed in the state government, municipal corporation, health and essential services can travel via local trains. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by advocates, was informed by advocate Shyam Dewani that since lockdown was implemented to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection, many lawyers practicing in the HC and other trial courts in the city had been unable to reach the court as local train services had been suspended. Dewani further submitted that even after a limited number of local train services were resumed in the unlock phases, lawyers were not permitted to commute on trains. As a result of this, many lawyers were unable to attend court even after physical hearing in HC commenced recently. In light of these submissions, the petitioner urged the court to direct the state to permit lawyers to use local train services to reach both the HC and lower courts. However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni opposed the plea and stated that as there was a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, permitting lawyers to travel by local trains would only add to the rising number of cases. Kumbhakoni said that while the state was amiable to resume normal services, it could not allow train travel till the Covid situation did not improve as social distancing norms were not being followed even in the limited train services being run currently. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “For how long will you allow the situation to continue? We have to live with coronavirus.” The chief justice further said that though HC had started physical hearings, the inability of lawyers to reach the court premises was negating the purpose of the initiative. He then suggested that issuing of e-passes could be started for advocates having to appear before the HC bench on an experimental basis. “We can direct the HC registry to issue the e-passes or the state can issue them. We would like the AG to come up with a plan and mode of implementing the experimental initiative by Tuesday, September 15. Issuing e-passes to lawyers to attend lower courts can be considered after seeing the outcome of the experiment,” the bench said.The petitions will be heard on September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/issue-e-passes-to-lawyers-to-travel-on-local-trains-on-experimental-basis-bombay-hc-to-state/story-tSNqEpGntJG1SY9YhsXssL.html

11-09-2020||Mumbai||IMD predicts monsoon revival, issues heavy rain alert for Friday and Saturday in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar||The weather bureau has issued yellow alert for Friday and Saturday predicting the possibility of thundershowers and heavy rain across isolated areas.After minimal rain activity over the first 10 days in September, monsoon revival is expected from Saturday onwards, said independent meteorologists.According to rainfall forecast for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar, cloudy conditions with the possibility of moderate rain or thundershowers can be expected in the city and suburbs on Friday, and heavy rain across isolated areas on Saturday.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), an off-shore trough at the mean sea level runs from Maharashtra coast to Kerala coast. “Combined with this, an east-west shear zone over peninsular India and land heating leading to tall cloud formation will account for increase in moisture, lower level westerly winds and increase in rain intensity for the west coast and north Konkan including Mumbai in the coming days,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Over the past 24 hours, only light showers were recorded in the city. Between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday, the suburbs recorded 5.6mm rain while south Mumbai recorded 4mm rain.During the first 10 days of September, Mumbai witnessed only 5.5% of the rainfall recorded during the corresponding period last year. The suburbs recorded 43.3mm rain while south Mumbai witnessed 56.4mm rain this month so far. Last year, the suburbs had recorded 801.4mm rain and south Mumbai 464.6mm over the same period. During the corresponding period in 2018, only 33.6mm and 12.4mm rain was recorded in the suburbs and south Mumbai, respectively. “Intra-seasonal variability is there, but a specific trend from year-on-year rain for a specific period cannot be established as every monsoon is different. No rain bearing weather systems had formed over Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea through the first 10 days of this month,” said Mohapatra.Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said that under the influence of a few monsoon low-pressure systems, the offshore trough will strengthen, thereby leading to moisture incursion in coming days. “Most of this activity will be of light to moderate intensity (especially during this weekend), so there is no severe weather threat involved. The monsoon is expected to remain active in the region over the next 10 days,” he said.The city can expect overcast skies again from Saturday with the possibility of heavy rain for Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Pune and ghat areas between Sunday and Tuesday, said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. “Rainfall is expected to be between moderate to heavy at around 70-80mm over 24 hours during this period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/imd-predicts-monsoon-revival-issues-heavy-rain-alert-for-friday-and-saturday-in-mumbai-thane-palghar/story-HtWNTc4aUlqVMag9ocnJ2I.html
11-09-2020||City||Navi Mumbai fake loan case: Four more file complaints against trio||Days after three men were arrested for duping Navi Mumbai residents under the pretext of offering loans, four more persons have stepped forward with their complaint against the trio. Two of the accused were working in a non-banking financial institution and had duped scores of people using fake names using their knowledge of the loan process. They had committed a similar fraud in Thane in June.The Sanpada police, on Wednesday, took custody of the trio – Omkar Mhatre, 35, Rohit Nagwekar, 30, and Bhalchandra Palav, 27 from the APMC police station, where they were arrested on September 2.As Mhatre and Nagwekar were well versed with the documentation of the loans, they allegedly hatched the plan to dupe people under the pretext of loans.“Previously, Nagwekar and Mhatre had duped people in a similar con in Naupada, Thane. The Naupada police had arrested them in June after which their accounts were frozen. We are collecting their financial records for the money trail,” said Keshav Dinde, assistant inspector at Sanpada police station.As per their modus operandi, the accused would first print out documents to resemble a cooperative bank. These documents would look like printed loan applications with a randomised registration number to assuage any suspicions. So far, police have found that the men duped Navi Mumbai residents under the guise of two fake cooperative banks – one in Vasai and another in Dahanu.Sanpada resident Savita Sakpal, 42, was trying for a loan last year to help her children’s new business but was not able to procure financial assistance. In December 2019, she came across a pamphlet in a regional newspaper promising quick and easy loans. The accused would print hundreds of pamphlets and then distribute it among newspaper vendors to be sent across.Palav and Mhatre met Sakpal and introduced themselves to be working at the Vasai bank. Two of Sakpal’s friends, Sheetal Jedhe and Shobha Ghodke, also needed loans. Under the pretext of collecting processing fee, insurance fee and other documentation process for the loan approval, the accused had made the complainant women pay a total Rs 5.34 lakh between December 2019 and April 2020.Police said they have also learnt of a new complaint against them in Nerul, where a few more persons were duped of a few lakh of rupees. Officials said they were in the process of registering the case and after the Sanpada police finished their investigation, the accused would be handed over to Nerul police for further interrogation.At least two police stations in Thane district have inquired with the Navi Mumbai police about the accused after it was discovered that the men duped residents in their jurisdiction as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-fake-loan-case-four-more-file-complaints-against-trio/story-F99Wq1U8iKFzhxVKKmLzmM.html
11-09-2020||City||Ludhiana fatality rate is almost double of Punjab’s||While Punjab’s Covid death rate is the highest in the country at 2.95%, Ludhiana’s tale is even more sordid with its case fatality rate (proportion of people who die among all individuals who have been diagnosed) touching 4.25%, which is almost double the state’s figure.What’s more, the state has seen a five-fold increase in the deaths in just five weeks, with the toll going from 103 on August 2 to over 500 in the first week of September. On August 1, Ludhiana’s case fatality rate was 2.82% against the state’s 2.39% and has risen steadily over the subsequent 40 days. On August 25, Ludhiana’s CFR was 3.6% against the state’s 2.5%. With 546 residents succumbing to the virus till September 10, Ludhiana has the highest number of deaths in the state. Officials attribute this same to a high number of patients with co-morbidities and also to excessive testing. From 1,158 samples on August 1, the district went on to collect 4, 711 samples on September 9. So far, a total of 1.79 lakh samples have been tested in Ludhiana. On September 5, Ludhiana was among the two Punjab districts in the list of 15 districts in the country with high Covid caseload and fatality over the past month. Civil surgeons of Ludhiana and Patiala at the videoconference with the Union health secretary had then swung into action to take stock of the situation by increasing sampling and also deciding to organise medical camps all over the district over the next three weeks.The silver lining for Ludhiana is that its recovery rate is the highest in the state at 81.88% with 10,443 persons recovering so far. Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “People with co-morbid conditions are more in Ludhiana. The case fatality rate is peaking but the number of recoveries is also high. We are hopeful of bringing the fatalities down. It is my sincere appeal to people to get themselves tested at the slightest of symptoms and to not to fall prey to rumours.”Ludhiana’s per day toll is at par with that of the neighbouring state of Haryana, which has been recording about 25 deaths a day over the past few weeks. The industrial city and financial capital of Punjab thus has almost the same number of deaths as Haryana, which is a full-fledged state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-fatality-rate-is-almost-double-of-punjab-s/story-BimDFaF5NfujU0lqFf24NN.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||BJP seeks emergency meeting to move no-confidence motion against Mumbai mayor||In the wake of allegations against mayor Kishori Pednekar of misusing her position to award contracts to her son’s firm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BP) appealed for an urgent general body meeting of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday to move a no-confidence motion against her.Pednekar had earlier rubbished the allegations.BJP’s move comes even as Pednekar tested positive for Covid-19 and was advised to be in home quarantine. Vinod Mishra, BJP leader in BMC, said, “We have requested for an emergency meeting under section 36 (H) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, to move no-confidence motion against mayor.” It remains to be seen whether the Shiv Sena can gain support from disgruntled councillors of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as cracks appear among the three ruling parties in the state.To get the no-confidence motion passed, BJP will have to achieve a simple majority among the councillors present during the voting. Currently, Sena has a strength of 97 councillors, BJP has 83, Congress has 29, NCP has eight, Samajwadi Party has six, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen has two and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has one corporator in BMC.Pednekar, who underwent rapid antigen testing on Thursday, is asymptomatic. She tweeted, “I am isolating myself at home as advised by doctors. My family members have been tested for Covid-19. With your best wishes, I will soon resume work to serve Mumbaikars.” She also appealed to people, who have come in contact with her, to get tested for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-seeks-emergency-meeting-to-move-no-confidence-motion-against-mumbai-mayor/story-ft8n5u8gCNBWvmczCeFHvN.html

The committee approved free final rites for those who die of Covid.Patil said, “PCMC will, henceforth, bear the cost of the final rites of those who die of Covid-19. At present, residents have to pay Rs 2,500 for gas crematorium and Rs 5,000 for using wooden logs. This cost will, henceforth, be borne by the PCMC.”The committee also approved more than Rs 4 lakh for the purchase of triple layer masks for various hospitals, urban health posts, teachers deployed for survey work, etc. Fifty thousand masks will be purchased at a cost of Rs 4.20 lakh. New civic building The committee has also approved the long-awaited proposal for the construction of a new civic building. The architect and consultant for the project have also been appointed.The standing committee has approved the plans for the new building at a cost of Rs 3.47cr.The new PCMC headquarters, named Swaraj, has been planned at plot No. 4 in Sector 16 of New Panvel. The plot was earlier acquired from CIDCO at a cost of Rs 28cr, which the civic body has paid.PCMC presently operates from the old building where the municipal council functioned from and another building next to it. It is located next to Dewale pond.Patil added, “With the appointment of the architect and consultant for the headquarters project, the path has been cleared for serious work to begin on the building. The standing committee also approved Rs 4.51cr for the preparation of city development plan (CDP) by CRISIL that will ensure the all-round development of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/last-rites-for-covid-19-victims-for-free-panvel-civic-body-passes-proposal/story-xzjDRMasKy7x9gGW5MXaNO.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to make citizens aware about disasters through free seminars||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to organise seminars and workshops for citizens in areas that are prone to disasters such as building collapses and flooding to raise awareness about how to identify disasters and ways to survive them. As part of its outreach programme to bridge the gap between BMC and citizens, these seminars will be free of cost.Senior civic officials said that community leaders and elected representatives will be roped in to get more people to sign up for this programme in order to increase the turnout. Pamphlets and booklets related to the seminars will be distributed among citizens to further extend the reach of the awareness programme.Mumbai has nearly 20,000 dilapidated buildings, a majority of which is located in south Mumbai. BMC has also identified around 273 flood-prone spots in the city which include Hindmata, Gandhi Market, Pydhonie and settlements around Mithi river. In addition, similar workshops and seminars on fire related disasters will be conducted on ward level. The programme is being brainstormed and an outline will be prepared following discussions with various departments, civic officials said.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “In situations involving natural disasters or fire, the time taken by agencies to reach the spot is crucial. Alertness of people trapped in such cases could save a lot of mishaps. For instance, crawling under a smoke-logged room during a fire towards the exit avoids feeling suffocated.”With this initiative, the civic body aims to connect ward machineries with citizens. Ward officials will give inputs on areas that will be selected for these workshops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-make-citizens-aware-about-disasters-through-free-seminars/story-t4wGo4hNVtlOvA9YnW0JlN.html
11-09-2020||City||At least 40 migrants test positive in Thane daily||More than 40 migrants visiting the city through long-distance trains test positive for Covid-19 daily, according to the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) records.The corporation has started conducting Rapid Antigen Tests for these migrants at the Thane railway station. More than 800 migrants are being tested daily since last week. Out of these, six to seven per cent migrants test positive and are immediately quarantined at the TMC centres. A long queue of outstation commuters is being witnessed at the Thane station for testing at any given time. The testing at the railway station has been set up to ensure that the migrants entering the city from other states do not spread the virus in Thane. The corporation claims that increased testing is the only solution to control the mortality and decrease the daily cases.Civic commissioner Dr. Vipin Sharma said: “Among those tested at railway stations, on an average around 40 to 50 people test positive on a daily basis. Most of them are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. These are immigrant labourers working as construction workers or in industries and factories. Since almost a week, we have begun regular testing at Thane railway station. We have set up four counters for antigen testing. Details of all these migrants have been taken down. Even if asymptomatic, we isolate them and monitor their health for a week or two before letting them go.”He added: “It is difficult to keep a tab on each and every one visiting the city as there is a large number of migrant population who travel by road into the city. However, there are various state checkpoints as well where people are screened for symptoms. Our focus is to be able to control the spread of the virus. Through regular screening and testing, we are casting a safety net for residents of Thane. We will not stop soon. These initiatives will continue.”At the Thane railway station, each person takes around four minutes to take swab samples, hence there are long queues near the testing counters as soon as a train arrives.“With so many people waiting at any given point, we have to ensure that the names and swab samples on the vials are properly noted. Moreover, we have to take down details of the individual and based on the result, provide them with proper guidelines. Some get impatient with the long queue and make attempts to jump the queue. In such instances, we have to ensure that social distancing is maintained and crowd is managed properly as well,” said a technician working at the railway station. As most immigrants returning to the cities are in desperate need of an income, there could be instances of people flouting quarantine. Hence, the Thane civic body prefers to isolate most of those who have travelled from other states into the city.“If you compare with the number of people who had migrated back to the villages during the lockdown; hardly 30% have returned to Thane city. This is a very small number and most of the rest will return after the Navratri festival. That would be the period when the city needs to be cautious as there will be a major influx of migrant labourers,” said Dhananjay Singh, Founder, Rudra Pratishthan, an organization that works for the welfare of the north Indian community in Thane.“Many factories and construction sites are offering facilities for isolation, stay and food; everyone needs labourers to get back to business. There is dearth of manpower at present in the city. So many are going out of the way to make the labourers feel comfortable,” added Singh.Those who are returning currently are those who are in a very bad state financially. “We have faced issues wherein labourers are unable to share their address details as they have returned to the city without a job in hand. This is the reason we prefer to isolate them even if asymptomatic, so that their health can be monitored,” said Ashok Burpulle, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.“Setting up testing counters in containment zones, malls and railway station is a way for us to reach out to the people. Not everyone finds it convenient or a necessity to visit a testing centre and get themselves tested. Hence, we are taking the testing kits through the medium of these special counters to the people,” added Burpulle. Activists demand more counters for testing City-based activists claimed that the counters were insufficient to accommodate all the passengers coming from outstation trains. “Every outstation train will have a minimum of 800 passengers, even after maintaining all social distancing norms. Having only four counters for testing so many passengers is not feasible. The travellers wait for two to three hours after such a long travel to get tested. They should set up a minimum of eight counters for ease in checking and for the convenience of travellers as well,” said Shashikumar Nair, chairman of Yatra Samiti, Thane.Another activist, Sanjeev Dutta, claimed that testing should be done at the point of origin. Dutta said: “Before allowing people into Thane city, a medical check-up or a test report from their place of origin should be asked for. It does not make sense to travel such a distance if one is Covid positive and spread it to other travellers and the residents while visiting a different city. This will help the civic body to increase testing within Thane city.”Migrants SpeakSriram Kumar, 33, resident of Jharkhand worked with a construction company in Thane until the lockdown. He returned to the city on Monday with the hope that he would get a job in the city. he said: “Isolating is not feasible for me. Due to the lockdown, I had a huge debt, hence had to leave the city and go to my hometown. But repeated efforts to earn a living did not bear fruits as much as it would in cities. That is the reason I returned but the quarantine period will leave my family hungry. The construction company where I worked initially is also not keen to take me as of now. Any means of livelihood and survival seems difficult at present.”Another migrant, Ranjan Prasad, 45, resident of Bihar used to work as a mason in a construction site on Ghodbunder Road and is now ready to take up any job. “All that we had earned and saved all these years had to be spent for daily meals over the last few months. With nothing else in hand, we have to go to the city. Everyone in my village in Bihar kept saying that there was no work around. We are hopeful that we shall find something here that will help us earn a few pennies for our family back home.”In Numbers Total number of positive cases: 29,265 Active cases: 2,729Deaths: 999 Daily number of positive cases: September 9: 495September 8: 281 September 7: 306September 6: 420 September 5: 335 September 4: 294 September 3: 348 September 2: 301 September 1: 242||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-least-40-migrants-test-positive-in-thane-daily/story-qlRSabLDdSsesOVJucgwOJ.html

11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Plans afoot to revamp Chandigarh’s over 5-decade-old sewerage system||Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is all set to upgrade and replace the city’s more than 50-year-old sewerage system. As a first step, the civic body will be appointing a consultant to analyse the existing structure and suggest options to improve it.Frequent breakdowns of the sewer lines are often reported across the city as it struggles to handle flows much higher than its design capacity. Similarly, the old stormwater drainage system gets flooded every monsoon because of its low capacity.Confirming the development, municipal commissioner KK Yadav, said, “City’s sewerage system is quite old and requires a major overhaul. At several places, relaying of new sewers is very much needed.” “We are planning to engage a consultant who will examine the requirements for replacements and upgrades. After taking into costing issues under consideration, different options for improving city’s sewerage system will be reviewed,” he added.The consultancy work will be given to either a government agency or a private firm. With a government agency such as Punjab Engineering College (PEC) or National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR), MC will sign a memorandum of understanding, and if it is a private firm tenders will be floated for invitation. To choose between the two options, an agenda will be submitted before the MC general house for its approval.“There are certain parameters against which the consultant will measure the efficiency of the sewerage system. On the basis of this analysis, they will prepare a detailed project report and submit it to us with their recommendations. On the basis of this report, the costing will be finalised and final project plans will be prepared,” Yadav said.AT THE END OF LIFE CYCLEChandigarh has both brick and pipe sewers laid in four phases as city expanded. One of the particular concerns is the brick and mortar sewer which became operational shortly after the foundation of the city. “As per our study, there are several places where these have majorly thinned out due to continuous erosion. Chemical reactions because of toxic gases in the sewers have led to the damage. There are fears that these might even collapse,” said an MC official who didn’t want to be named.Even the carrying capacity of the sewers is low as the population increases in the city.“The existing stormwater drainage system is inadequate to manage the discharge during heavy rainfall. The system was designed in phases, for 15mm rainfall per hour in phase 1 (northern sectors), 20mm in phase 2 (central sectors), and 25mm in phase 3 (southern sectors),” said another MC official.Significantly, the civic body has already initiated the process to upgrade the five sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the city. However, low and poor capacity of the main trunk sewers will handicap any improvement in the STP.“The options to improve the system will either require total replacement of the sewers or modifications. Technologies are now available that can improve the existing old sewer channels. The consultant’s report will indicate what options can be employed at which places in the city,” said Shailender Singh, MC’s chief engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plans-afoot-to-revamp-city-s-over-5-decade-old-sewerage-system/story-fIannhAlRyHlaEgZNawQdI.html

He said plasma donation commenced on August 20 when PCS officer Jagdeep Sehgal posted as Mohali SDM volunteered to donate plasma to save the life of a fellow police officer. Since then people are slowly and steadily showing interest in plasma donation, he added. The DC said that in over two weeks, as many as 80 people have volunteered for plasma donation and of them, 10 donations have already been made. Efforts are afoot to motivate eligible Covid-19 survivors to come up for the same.Sharing further details on the plasma donation scenario in the district, the first donor of the district and now chief motivator Jagdeep Sehgal said, “All who have recovered from Covid-19 can help in saving precious lives by donating plasma. Plasma donation is a safe and simple procedure. I have experienced the trauma of the infection and the bliss of the donation. So, I have taken it upon myself the mission of motivating others to come forward for plasma donation. With the support of my staff, I have been able to identify 500 eligible donors.”“Renowned Punjabi singer, Kulwinder Billa is among others who have made plasma donation at my behest,” said Sehgal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plasma-donation-gaining-ground-in-mohali-district-says-dc-girish-dayalan/story-Bi67kcE74g9IP8qojgMwyK.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: NDPS court to decide on bail pleas of Rhea, Showik and others today||court to pass order on rhea bail plea todayManish K Pathak and Charul Shah manish.pathak@hindustantimes.com MumbaiA special court constituted under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act will pronounce its order on the bail plea filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, among others, on Friday. Rhea, Showik, actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, house help Dipesh Sawant, Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar, were arrested by NCB for their alleged involvement in a drugs case linked to Rajput’s death.On Thursday, Atul Sarpande, the special public prosecutor appearing for NCB, opposed the bail plea of all accused on the grounds that the probe was at a crucial stage and releasing the accused on bail may hamper the probe. “We have opposed bail pleas because in this case the quantity of the drug is not important, instead, the gravity of the offence is more important. All the accused are connected to each other, are involved in the conspiracy, and cannot be separated from the case,” said Sarpande.Rajendra Rathod, lawyer for Sawant, said, “We have argued for bail as the sections are bailable, and on the same sections Kaizan Ebrahim [another accused] was given bail. But NCB opposed the bail, saying that investigations are at a premature stage and evidence can be hampered.”Meanwhile, Miranda, in his bail plea filed through advocate Subodh Desai, claimed that NCB in its search had recovered nothing incriminating from him, and argued that the case is based on the statement of the co-accused and the prosecution has nothing to corroborate the statement.Rhea, in her plea, had stated that she was innocent and falsely implicated. Rhea and her brother Showik have been booked under section 27A of the NDPS Act, which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders.The defence raised issue of applicability of charges of section 27A of the NDPS Act against the two. In Rhea’s plea, the defence stated, “The allegations against the present accused would at the most make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug, which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender and hence the ingredients of section 27A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances.”Further, the defence had also alleged that even though the role attributed to Rhea and her brother Showik is identical to that of another accused, Kaizan Ebrahim, NCB selectively invoked charges of Section 27A only against Rhea and Showik. Ebrahim was released on provisional cash bail on the very first day of his remand by the magistrate court, the defence had pointed out.The pleas were opposed by the prosecution, claiming all accused are connected and case of each accused cannot be looked in isolation. Sarpande, however, countered the argument and said that the agency will move court to cancel Ebrahim’s bail on Friday. Sarpande added that the agency had recovered 0.5 grams of hashish from him.Objecting the allegation that the charges of section 27A of NDPS is not applicable, Sarpande contended, “As far as Rhea and Showik are concerned, they financed and arranged drugs. That is why they have been made accused in the case. This is a non-bailable offence, hence they should not be granted bail.”On the allegation that no woman officer was present during Rhea’s interrogation, Sarpande said, “One woman officer of the NCB and one from Mumbai Police were present on the request of Rhea for protection. Rhea’s statement was recorded in front of them and they are witnesses in the statement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-ndps-court-to-decide-on-bail-pleas-of-rhea-showik-and-others-today/story-vSN6emK3FsMPYbTY4GzOgM.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||PU online exam: Roll numbers to be issued without ‘no dues certificate’||The final-semester students enrolled in the undergraduate and postgraduate courses of Panjab University will be exempted from furnishing ‘no dues certificates’ to get their roll numbers this time before taking the online exams. The varsity on Thursday requested its departments and regional centres to issue roll numbers without ‘no dues certificates’ after students raised concerns over obtaining the NOC from departments amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Online examinations for the final-semester students are scheduled to start from September 17. Earlier, as per the date sheets released by PU, the students were asked to get NOCs from their respective departments before downloading admit cards from the website.“The detail instruction for the candidate will be printed on admit/roll number card which can be downloaded from the University website after getting NOC from head of Institutions in case of regular students, private candidates can download from Panjab University Official Website,” the date sheets read. This time, students flagged their concerns over the demand of NOCs by the varsity for getting the admit cards, prompting PU’s office of Dean University Instruction (DUI) to issue an urgent circular to the heads of departments and regional centres on Thursday, requesting them to issue roll numbers without ‘no dues certificates’ to enable students to take the exams.However, the final result may be declared only after submission of NOCs and clearance of all dues.Pardeep Saharan, a student from Haryana who studies in the department of laws, said, “It is difficult to get an NOC at this time. In that case, many students would be needed to visit the university campus. The exams are already delayed and getting an NOC within a span of a few days is impossible.”Usually, students need to furnish the ‘no dues certificates’ as a proof that they do not have any outstanding bills, such as mess bills, canteen bills, library charges and others.“We had left the hostels in a hurry when the lockdown was imposed in March. If I have to get the NOC, then I would need to visit the campus,” said a UIET student, Bhawani Singh, who hails from Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-online-exam-roll-numbers-to-be-issued-without-no-dues-certificate/story-3qfUpiOgkCDU8giMUQFpfM.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid case tally inches towards 1 million, Mumbai sees sharpest rise||Maharashtra on Thursday inched towards one million Covid-19 cases with 23,446 new infections, including Mumbai’s sharpest single-day spike of 2,371, taking the tally to 9,90,795. The state on Thursday also reported its highest number of deaths in a day, 495, taking the toll to 28,282. The latest fatalities included 47 from reconciliation of older cases and another 133 were from over a week. Barring Sunday, the state has reported more than 20,000 cases daily over the past six days. In the first 10 days of September, the state has reported 198,254 cases — 20% of the total cases reported in six months of the virus outbreak. Mumbai reported its highest single-day jump in cases for a second consecutive day, which pushed its count to 1,63,115, while the toll crossed the 8,000 mark with 38 more deaths. There are 26,629 active cases in Mumbai, while the city’s fatality rate is 4.9%. One hot spot that has shown drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded 11 new cases on Thursday, bringing the area’s case count to 2,850, of which 2,478 have been discharged.Of the latest deaths, 72 were from Satara district, 50 each were reported from from Nagpur and Pune districts, 39 were from Kolhapuri. Pune district topped the list for daily caseload at 5,939 new cases, including 2,969 in Pune city,1,802 in its rural parts and 1,168 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Nagpur saw 1,726 new cases, while Satara, Sangli and Jalgon reported 1,017, 1,031 and 1,089 cases respectively. The state recovery rate has dropped, while the positivity rate has increased. The recovery rate dropped to 70.72%, which had crossed 72.32% on August 31. State’s case fatality rate (CFR), too, stood at 2.85%, against the national rate of 1.69%. A few districts such as Kolhapur, Sangli, Nagpur, Satara have been key contributors in the sudden spike in cases and they have seen a rise of more than 50% in the last two weeks, from August 26 to September 9. Sangli’s growth during this period was 107% (10,108 to 20,924), cases in Satara grew by 88% (from 10995 to 20657), Nagpur by 92% (22,378 to 42,974) and Kolhapur by 57.63% (19076 to 30069). State’s caseload rise in two weeks is 34.59% (from 7.19 lakh to 9.67 lakh). The state authorities are now concentrating on these districts. “Our directives to the district and civic administrations are to ramp up health facilities on one hand and to track-trace high-low risk contacts. This would help in containing the spread and later treat the patients identified. We expect our ‘chase-the-virus’ drive beginning from September 15 plays a major role in identifying more infections, which will help contain the rapid spread, especially witnessed in the rural parts of the state,” said an official from the health department. Dr Sanjay Salunkhe, civil surgeon of Sangli district, said that the unlocking over the past two weeks, movement of people from other districts or states and lack of awareness among people about social distancing has led to the rise in the cases. “We have been continuously ramping up our health infrastructure and had started laying oxygen pipelines for rural and sub-district hospitals too. Our oxygenated bed capacity has increased to more than 1,460 beds in the district and we have 201 ventilators. We trace around 12-15 high and low risk contact to contain the spread. We expect the rate of the new infections to reduce by the end of this month as the district is currently witnessing its peak of the infection,” he said. The doubling period in most of the districts has, however, improved and is more than 10 days, except Chandrapur, which has reported a doubling rate at 9.56 days. Nagpur and Nanded have reported the period at 15.1 and 18.11 days, while in urban parts of Sangli, it’s 17.43 days. In all nine municipal corporations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), it’s over 30 days. The growth or reproduction rate in cities and districts in the state ranges between 1.03(Bhiwandi-Nizampur) and 1.59% (Chandrapur), according to the daily report released by a group from Mumbai University, headed by economist Neeraj Hatekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-case-tally-inches-towards-1-million-mumbai-see-sharpest-rise/story-rmbVWKHBZ4dprrtPZ9YsPN.html
11-09-2020||Mumbai||Bhima-Koregaon violence: NCP chief Sharad Pawar pushes for SIT probe||Keen to form a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018, National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar called a meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. The meeting was attended by senior ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and officials from the home department. The meeting was held at YB Chavan Centre on Thursday. “Many ministers pushed for an SIT probe in the Bhima-Koregaon case. The NCP chief was also of the same view. He asked the officials their opinion on whether a SIT can be constituted,” said a senior minister, who was present at the meeting and requested anonymity. “We all were of the view that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Elgar Parishad and its activities whereas we want an investigation into the violence that happened at Bhima-Koregaon,” he said. After the meeting, Pawar spoke to reporters. “We reviewed the case today. Though NIA is investigating it, the state government too has some powers and we are taking view of experts for the same. We believe the NIA probe is not going in the right direction,” he said. A further extension for the two-member Bhima-Koregaon Commission was also discussed as the its term ended on April 7. A senior official from the home department said that since the Bhima-Koregaon case is sensitive and already being investigated by NIA, there are legal aspects to setting up a SIT that need to be considered. “We need to see how many FIRs were filed by the police in the case before it was handed over to the NIA; whether all the cases were covered by it or some are left. We will also have to study the legal aspects and powers of the state in probing a matter where a Central agency is already involved,” he said. In January, the MVA government had been planning to form an SIT when the Centre directed the NIA to take over the investigation into Elgar Parishad’s activities. Pawar has said that both the Centre’s decision to take over the case and the state government giving its approval for the same were inappropriate. The violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018 saw one death and many injured, including 30 policemen. Numerous activists and intellectuals have since been charged with inciting the violence. Among the arrested accused in the case are lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, poet Varavara Rao and academic Anand Teltumbde. In the past, Pawar has described the arrests of activists in the Bhima-Koregaon case an abuse of power by the state government in 2018, which was led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-violence-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-pushes-for-sit-probe/story-1PBvMZ2erlxt7RUhvYqb3M.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||AAP hits out at slums eviction notice as Kejriwal looks for options||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met officials to discuss the possible rehabilitation of slum-dwellers living along Delhi’s railway tracks, even as Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha dramatically tore eviction notices sent to them, and said no one will be displaced “till Kejriwal is alive”.The Supreme Court, on August 31, ordered the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings situated along Delhi’s railway tracks within three months. To ensure compliance of its order, the top court stopped any other court from passing a stay order on their removal. HT was the first to report this story on September 3.Kejriwal called a meeting on Thursday to discuss the court’s order and explore possible ways to rehabilitate the displaced people, a senior official in the chief minister’s office said. “He had a discussion with the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi urban shelter improvement board (DUSIB). While DUSIB suggested its vacant flats for economically weaker sections could be used, the PWD expressed concern over the scale of the potential project as it involves more than 48,000 families,” the official said. At the same time, the ruling AAP is also exploring legal options to stall the eviction of the slum-dwellers.Chadha, the party’s national spokesperson and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson, said the government was committed to protecting the people who live in these dwellings. “The chief minister is making a policy to ensure security to every slum dweller. I want to tell the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) that they should immediately stop such illegal acts,” he said, brandishing eviction notices sent to several people living in these houses by Indian Railways.The issue has turned into a political slugfest with AAP blaming the BJP-led Central government for serving eviction notices. “The BJP is issuing notices across the national Capital, threatening the slum dwellers that their houses will be demolished within this month. These notices are against the basic principles of the Constitution, which allows every citizen to have a life with dignity. I urge the BJP not to harass these slum dwellers,” he said. He tore a few of the notices and said that “no slum dweller in Delhi will be displaced, till Kejriwal is alive”. The BJP responded saying AAP should “cut the drama” and start allotting its vacant flats to these slum dwellers.Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, senior BJP member and leader of opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said the Kejriwal government failed to provide houses to any slum dweller despite being in power for six years and announcing the ‘Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana’ amid much fanfare.“Even after taking Rs 11.25 crore from the railways for rehabilitation of slums, the Delhi government did not work and now their ministers are doing drama of tearing notice and accusing the BJP. The people of Delhi know that the slum dwellers are being given houses under the Modi government’s ‘Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makan’ (in-situ rehabilitation) scheme. But the AAP government did not allow the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to be implemented in Delhi and instead announced the Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana on the same lines and cheated the slum dwellers,” Bidhuri said. Chadha said he would respond to the BJP’s allegations with proof on Friday in another press conference. The Supreme Court, which was hearing an application filed in the MC Mehta case relating to Delhi pollution matters, gave it verdict after the Indian Railways informed the court that despite a Special Task Force constituted to remove encroachments, political interference was coming in the way of getting the jhuggis removed. An order for removal of all encroachments passed by the NGT on October 1, 2018 had led to the formation of the task force.The top court’s extraordinary order was passed in exercise of its power under Article 142, which says, “the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.” There are no official estimate as to how many people live in such slums. NGOs say that the land owning agency, the Railways in this case, will have to do a survey to ascertain the number of dwellers.Officials from the Railways ministry and Northern Railways refused to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-hits-out-at-slums-eviction-notice-as-kejriwal-looks-for-options/story-N3nF1jzGZWRxupqHDuYXYK.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Four from Delhi cadre posted as motor licensing officers||In a first, the Delhi government has posted four officials of the Delhi Administration Subordinate Service cadre as motor licensing officers in its regional transport offices (RTOs).The move comes after chief secretary Vijay Dev on September 2 suspended three MLOs from the RTOs of Suraj Mal Vihar, New Delhi and Vasant Vihar, after raids conducted by the transport department found irregularities in issuance of driving licenses.“The four newly appointed MLOs earlier served as section officers of DASS cadre. This is the first time that the government has posted DASS cadre officers as MLOs, in a move to bring more transparency in public services. The four officers were transferred from different departments to the transport department by an order of the services department on September 7,” said a senior government officer .In the suspension case, apart from collusion with touts, it was found that over 1,000 DLs were issued from the three RTOs over the past two months without conducting the mandatory video recording of the driving test given by the motorists. These three RTO are among the five RTOs in Delhi which do not have an automated driving test track for testing motorists seeking a permanent DL. RTOs in Sarai Kale Khan, Burari, Mayur Vihar, Wazirpur and Vishwas Nagar have automated test tracks which make the entire process of issuing DLs more comprehensive and stringent as it reduces manual intervention. Dahiya said the remaining five RTOs will have automated test tracks by the end of this year and no manual driving tests shall be allowed thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-from-delhi-cadre-posted-as-motor-licensing-officers/story-pl3Fl73eoY94IIDt6MHAsM.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Clean, bright, sanitised... and eerily silent metro amid Covid-19||New Delhi: As the Delhi Metro reopened, more than five months after the coronavirus changed the world, its scenery is weirdly reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the classic Stanley Kubrick sci-fi film. Only a few people are milling about, in masks. Since this is Yellow Line’s Chawri Bazar underground Metro station, one of the deepest in the city, it has two sets of escalators burrowing down to the basement tracks.This is the third day of the limited reopening of the Metro services. A small queue has formed outside the station’s entrance, moments before it opens for its day’s second shift — at 4pm this Wednesday, five hours after its midday break. Those familiar memories of spitting, sneezing, coughing crowds swarming into the station seem as unreal as New Amar, the single-screen cinema that originally stood on the station’s site. The commuters are entering as reverently as one might enter an international airport — at one’s best behaviour, eager not to needle the security staff. A hushed atmosphere reigns inside. Around the security personnel, all sheathed in masks and face shields, the commuters are to follow a precise choreography. First, approach the sanitiser stand in the corner, and rub your hands under a sanitiser spray. Next, walk to the man checking the body temperature, before approaching the security gate, while keeping a safe distance from fellow humans. What happens next is surreal.As soon as they cross to the other side of the security, the commuters disappear straight into the station’s vacant hugeness. Nobody is to be seen inside except for sudden glimpses of Metro staff or a security guard popping up in some far corner.Finally, a masked commuter is fleetingly spotted, quietly going down the escalators. It’s a strange and unreal silence.The platform has perhaps less than a dozen people — though 27,000 people will be travelling on this line today. The train from Samaypur Badli to Huda City Center in Gurugram arrives. The announcer’s casual voice appears to be the only discernible leftover of the old normal.Each alternate seat inside the train is plastered with a physical distancing yellow poster warning “Do not sit here.” The ladies coach has only two women. The one next to it has six people, one of whom is clicking a selfie. Among them, plumber Babu Ram is going to Gurugram to collect payment from a building contractor. “Itna sannata hai (so hauntingly quiet here),” he remarks, before putting his finger on his mask, in the hush sign. Indeed, the new etiquette in the Metro doesn’t want you to talk, and risk spreading aerosol particles in the train. For that matter, every surface that can be touched — the handrail, the glass pane on the door — might seem, to an anxious eye, swarming with you-know-what. Though one does feel, at least if one has boarded the train at Chawri Bazar, that it is probably far safer inside the train than in the super-crowded market outside. The train arrives at New Delhi Railway Station. A man steps into the coach. A few minutes pass and the train halts at Rajiv Chowk Metro station. In the pre-corona era, the sprawling terminus would be pulsating with humanity, its air saturated with various harmless viruses. The staircase, which would be flooded by new waves of commuters with every fresh arrival of Metro trains from other connecting lines, is empty. Further ahead, a masked housekeeper mopping the vast walkway is looking like a tiny cog in the giant wheel.Now, a walk through a long empty passage, up the escalators, and outside into Connaught Place, and daylight. Palika Bazar is a few steps away. A poster on the glass doors to the market says: “Body temperature check is required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-metro-clean-bright-sanitised-and-eerily-silent/story-BnFtB5CxEd7TQRQmhhRJMM.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Just a quarter of the aspirants for second phase of DU’s open-book exam opt for offline mode||Of the 12,000 students, who have registered to appear in the second phase of Delhi University’s open-book exams (OBE), only 3,000 will take the exams physically, officials said.The exams are scheduled to begin from September 14According to the DU’s officiating dean (examination) DS Rawat, of around 12,000 registered students,10,000 are from the School of Open Learning (SoL) and around 2,000 are those enrolled in colleges and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). “Only around 3,000 of these students have opted for physical exams, the rest of them will write the exam online,” he said.DU will conduct the second phase of the open-book exams for those final year undergraduate and postgraduate students who could not appear in the first phase, which was held online between August 10 and 31. This time, the students have been given the option to either write the exam online or visit the university’s examination centres to take the tests.According to the University’s examination branch, as many as 2,53,677 final year undergraduate and postgraduate students were to appear in the OBE exams this year. Of them, around 2,12,256 had appeared in the first phase of OBE, as per the data submitted by the university in the Delhi High Court on August 26.DU dean of colleges and director of SoL Balaram Pani said that the majority of the students who did not apply for the second phase are from SoL. “It happens every year. Thousands of SoL students do not appear in exams. Majority of them are working. It’s just that it’s the first time that data is being analysed,” he said.While colleges and students cite the prevailing pandemic as the reason behind maximum students opting for the online mode, university officials say it’s because of the “success” of the first phase of online OBE”.In majority of DU colleges, only a handful of students have opted to appear physically. In Miranda House, only 16 students have applied for the second phase of OBE. “Only three out of them have decided to appear in exams physically. Even out of five visually impaired students we have, only two will appear in offline exams,” said college principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda.In Ramjas College, only three of the 34 students who have registered for the exams will appear physically. Similarly, in Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College (ARSD) college only eight students will appear physically.Among the colleges where no student has chosen the physical mode are Shri Ram College of Commerce (SCRCC) and Aryabhatta College. SRCC principal Simrit Kaur said only six students, including one postgraduate student, are appearing in the second phase and none of them has applied for offline mode. “All other students of our college had successfully appeared in the first phase of exams held online,” she said. Aryabhatta principal Manoj Sinha said, “Despite colleges being ready with all precautions, there is an overall atmosphere of fear due to the pandemic. The cases are rising in Delhi and other neighbouring states. Therefore, students are opting for the online mode in the second phase as well.”Deepak Gupta, a visually challenged final year MA (English) student, has travelled from Bihar’s Rohtas district to appear in exams. But he has still chosen the online mode. “It’s not that we like online mode for appearing in exams. We have opted for it because of the prevailing situation. I did not have scribes, proper internet facility and assistive devices in my village and that’s why I have travelled to Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/just-a-quarter-of-the-aspirants-for-second-phase-of-du-s-open-book-exam-opt-for-offline-mode/story-hdj8pDWCi4wNjtqTKHOSPN.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Record infection spike again as daily tests cross 58k mark in Delhi||The number of tests for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi touched another high, with 58,340 samples tested in 24 hours, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Thursday — 4,000 more than were conducted the day before. However, there was also a sharp dip in the number of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the most accurate diagnosis for the disease. Only 9,004 samples, or 15.4% of the total tests, were collected using the RT-PCR method on Thursday. This is less in both absolute and percentage-wise terms than on Wednesday. On that day, 11,101 RT-PCR tests were conducted, which worked out to 20.3% of the 54,517 samples collected.The rapid antigen test, although cheaper and quicker, is known to throw false negatives. As the number of cases and positivity rate — the fraction of people who test positive among those tested —started going up towards the end of August, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said testing would be scaled up to 40,000 tests a day. To facilitate this, the government has started outreach activities, setting up testing counters in public places like weekly markets, and began testing all those coming to Delhi government hospitals.

On Thursday, Delhi reported 4,308 new cases of Covid-19, the highest one-day spike so far in the city. During the initial surge, the most cases recorded in a single day was 3,947 on June 23. That number has been breached twice now, the first of which came on Wednesday when the city added more than 4,000 new cases for the first time. However, the positivity rate is much lower than it was during the late-June, early-July peak. On June 23, for instance, the test positivity rate was 23%.The number of hospitalisations and deaths, however, are fewer as compared to June. There were 5,775 patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals across the city, according to Thursday’s report. In contrast, 6,264 were hospitalised as on June 23, as per government data. The city reported 28 deaths due to the infection on Thursday, as compared to 68 reported on June 23.“The Delhi government is doing everything to ensure that people do not die of the infection. We have standardised treatment protocols across hospitals. Plasma therapy is also being given,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, adding that the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) study on plasma therapy says it does not have benefits in the late stages of the disease, when patients are on ventilators. “The ICMR study says that very serious patients do not benefit from plasma therapy, which is what doctors have said. People do benefit from the therapy in the initial stages. This is not a new therapy, and has been used for other diseases, and is now being used to treat Covid-19 in the absence of a definitive treatment,” Jain said during a media interaction on Thursday. He said that during a review meeting on Wednesday, chief minister Kejriwal had directed the medical superintendents to increase the number of ICU beds in the city. “There are already enough beds in several Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Now, we have been asked to prepare to work at full capacity and utilise the existing infrastructure. This means, we need to maintain proper stocks of antiviral medicines, convalescent plasma, PPE kits, and also rope in more health care workers. We are already in the process of hiring some doctors,” one of the medical superintendents present in Wednesday’s meeting said. Another official not present in the review meeting by the CM held on Wednesday, said, “I do not know what was said in the meeting, but internally, there have been discussions about the ICUs now filling up and whether the normal ward beds could be converted to ICU beds. This would of course require not just ventilators — which there are enough of — but high-flow oxygen supply, monitors for the vitals, and nurses, doctors and technicians.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/record-infection-spike-again-as-daily-tests-cross-58k-mark-in-delhi/story-B5nROQ3U9F5x81x5PgJy6H.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Red, Green, Violet — Metro nears normal service with three more lines opened||Ridership in the Delhi Metro continued to rise on Thursday, after three more lines — Violet, Red and Green — were opened four days after the public transit system reopened its doors to passengers since being shut for over five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.On Thursday, the Metro saw 84,841 passengers use the service throughout its two shifts. Service continued in two shifts, in the morning from 7am to 11am and in the evening from 4pm to 8pm. Passenger traffic on the service has seen a steady rise, as more corridors have reopened over the past few days. The Red, Green and Violet lines saw thin but steady attendance on Thursday. Ridership data released by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) shows that the Red Line received 8,037 passengers, the Green Line received 3,564 passengers and the Violet Line saw a ridership of 6,373 passengers. The three corridors that had been opened over the past three days — Yellow, Blue and Pink — also saw a gradual improvement in ridership on Thursday. The Yellow Line (Huda City Centre-Samaypur Badli), the first corridor to be opened, saw 29,656 passengers. In contrast, only the line saw a ridership of around 15,500 when it was opened on Monday.  Over 31,000 people used the Blue Line, which is the most popular corridor on the service. Thursday’s passenger traffic on the Blue Line was the highest across all lines since the service restarted. Meanwhile, 5,977 people used the Pink Line on Thursday. “Overall passenger boarding (total trips passengers made) on Wednesday’s operational lines was 103, 412,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Puneet Dhir Singh, who was travelling from Jhilmil to Kashmere Gate on the Red Line, said that before Covid-19 hit the national capital, the Kashmere Gate interchange station would be packed, with little space for passengers to even stand inside trains. “I was pleasantly surprised at the arrangements made at each level. Commuters were also very careful. A person had taken off his mask in the train to talk on the phone, but a fellow passenger promptly asked him to put it back on,” Singh said. On Friday, the Metro corporation will begin services on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden) and Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh). With this, all the major corridors of the Delhi Metro network will become serviceable. Operational hours will on Friday also be increased to 7am to 1pm in the morning and 4pm to 10pm in the evening. In the final leg, on Saturday, the Metro will go back to operating from 6am to 11pm, while also opening up the Airport Express Line (New Delhi-Dwarka Sector-21) for passengers. “Owing to the new norms of social distancing in place, which has significantly reduced the number of persons to be carried in a train, DMRC has decided to run the peak hour frequency of trains from 8am to 8pm, doing away with the concept of off-peak hours from 11am to 4pm, where services were available with less trains/trips earlier,” the DMRC said in a statement on Thursday. The Metro said, once normal service is resumed on Saturday, trains will be available every 3 to 15 minutes from 6am to 8am. From 8am to 8pm, on all main corridors, frequency will be in the range 2.45 minutes and 6 minutes, and after 8pm, train frequency will return to the 3-15 minute range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/red-green-violet-metro-nears-normal-service-with-three-more-lines-opened/story-78ifzAW98EXutunYdzpAnL.html
11-09-2020||Delhi||Pub owners pin their hopes on weekend for business to pick up||Hit by the lockdown and a fall in customer numbers on reopening, restaurants, bars and pubs in Delhi are pinning their hopes on the coming weekend -- the first weekend since they got the government nod to serve liquor from September 9 -- for business to pick up. Restaurateurs said business has been slow over the past two days, but they are expecting more patrons this weekend; the silver lining being that many regulars have already booked tables for Friday night. Several resto-bar owners said liquor is being served only at the tables at present and they hope to run at full capacity (only 50% of total capacity allowed under the unlock guidelines) over the weekend, which has not been the case so far. Restaurants and restro-bars have remained shut in Delhi since March when the lockdown was announced to control the spread of Covid-19. Although restaurants were allowed to open on July 29, serving liquor was not permitted in Delhi. On September 3, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) approved the sale of alcoholic beverages to dine-in customers from September 9. HT made a round of restaurants in Connaught Place on Thursday evening to assess the situation and found a few tables -- about seven to 10 -- occupied at most places. But most guests were seen following the Covid-19 protocols. Also read | Covid Metro: Clean, bright, sanitised... and eerily silentEntry was allowed only after thermal temperature scanning and all patrons wore masks; tables were sanitised before and after guests occupied them.The manager of one of the restro-bars, who didn’t wish to be named, said people came in early and left early these days. Vishal Sharma, a government hospital doctor, who had come with a party of four, said people must follow precautions, irrespective of where they went. “I have been going out for a while now and restauarants are following all norms, so I think it’s safe to go out once in a while. Even when we are at work, we are at risk,” Sharma said. Restaurateur Priyank Sukhija, who owns a host of outlets including Lord of the Drinks, Tamasha, Plum, Diablo, Warehouse Cafe and Open House Cafe, among others, said since September 9, business has risen to 20% from the earlier 5% to 10%. “We are expecting more business over the weekend. We are sanitising all outlets and preparing to cater to a full house (50% of total capacity). We hope to touch at least 50%-60% of pre-Covid sales during weekends; otherwise, we won’t be able to survive,” Sukhija said. The permission to serve alcohol has been given on a trial basis till September 30. Only four to persons are allowed at a table while live performances have been discontinued. Navneet Kalra, who owns Townhall, and Mr Choy in Khan Market, said he has already got bookings for the weekend. “People are coming out gradually -- everyone is tired of staying home. Many of the regular guests have made advance bookings,” Kalra said. Restaurateur Dinesh Arora, who owns the Unplugged Courtyard in Connaught Place, said he opened his outlet only this Wednesday and the response has been good so far. “Over the past two days, at least 13 tables were occupied, each by at least three to four people, which meant we got around 40-50 guests in total every evening. Over the weekend, I’m expecting 30% to 40% of the pre-Covid business to be back, as I have already got around 20 reservations,” he said. The excise department has deployed teams to ensure that government guidelines are being adhered to. “The compliance by hotels and restaurants so far is appreciable. Our drive will intensify in the coming weeks when more people will start dining out,” a senior excise official said.The department said strict action will be taken if any facility is found violating the rules laid down by the DDMA and the Union government. Action would include prosecution of owner/manager of errant establishment, sealing of the premises forthwith and cancellation of the excise licence.Sisodia meets RestaurateursDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Thursday met representatives of hotels and restaurants in Delhi to understand the problems being faced them.He suggested that the industry come up with innovative ideas to ensure safety of guests and staff and boost revenue.“With more people stepping out, it will not only bring energy back to their lives but also to the economy. Until now, people were afraid of stepping out and their fears need to be handled carefully. Staying at home is not the solution and we need to restart our normal life, but with precautions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pub-owners-pin-their-hopes-on-weekend-for-business-to-pick-up/story-n2Lb2JBouroZ8iarChAI3M.html

A case was registered at the sector 20 police station ion Tuesday in this regard and investigations taken up. The victim, Sanjay Kumar Jain, is a resident of Noida’s sector 31. According to him, the incident started earlier this month after he received a message from the customer care of a leading e-wallet company “I contacted the number provided in the message to open my e-wallet account, after which I was told that first I would need to give them access to my phone through a software access sharing app, take a photo of my debit card and do a transaction of Rs 5 for verification purposes,” said the victim in his police complaint. He said that he later received an OTP, which he shared with the suspects. “However, soon after I again received a second OTP, that I refused to share with them. The men, however, convinced me that 80% of the work had already been done, but the transaction was not going through. So, they suggested that I use a different ATM card, after which I received three separate OTPs, which i shared with them. Afterwards, I received multiple messages of money having been withdrawn from my account. Based on the advice of my family, I immediately blocked the cards,” said the complainant. He said that the next day also, the suspects contacted him and asked for the OTP, which Jain refused to share, after which they started abusing and threatening him. The victim later registered a complaint online and a case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act. “They have filed a complaint online. We will start working on the case as soon as it is assigned to us and will take necessary help from the cyber cell,” said RK Singh, station house officer, sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/septuagenarian-duped-of-nearly-1-lakh-on-the-pretext-of-e-wallet-registration/story-zWWsXrkZYXJ5FdzgXvIvBO.html
11-09-2020||Noida||Four from Nepal among 11 teenagers found working as labourers in Noida; rescued||At least 11 minors, between the ages of 15 and 17 years, were found working at various establishments in the automobile and hospitality industry in the city on Wednesday, officials said, following which their employers were issued show cause notices. In a joint effort of the Noida police department, the anti human trafficking unit, the labour department and the Childline India Foundation, raids were conducted at several establishments in the city area including sectors 5, 9, 31, 140, among others.On August 26, the state government had instructed all districts to conduct a ‘No child labour’ campaign in the month of September in which market areas, railway stations, bus stands, hotels as well as road side eateries and factories, among others, would need to be covered. The instructions also said to take action against offending employers under the Child Labour Act, relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Human Trafficking Prevention Act.“We already had received a tip about a restaurant. A total of 11 minors, aged 15, 16 and 17 years, were found working at separate establishments. Of these, four were from Nepal, one from Haryana and the rest were locals. Proper procedure needs to be followed after such raids. The minors have to be removed from the place of exploitation and sent to a place of safety. They also need to be presented in front of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in case of exploitation. These days it is also important to verify whether they were employed before the pandemic broke out or afterwards, and then they have to be handed over to their families,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB India Suraksha, an NGO that manages the Noida chapter of the Childline.He said cases of child labour are expected to rise as the unlock progresses, with many wanting to earn a quick buck and employers looking for cheap labour to save costs. The fact that some minors are from outside the district also suggests the presence of an agent of human trafficking which needs to be looked at, said Prakash. Police officers said that as the industries, where these minors were found working are non-hazardous, show cause notices have been sent to the employers according to procedure. “They will have about a week to reply and provide explanations. If they are found liable and negligent, court cases will be registered against them,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women and minors safety, who also heads the anti-trafficking unit of the district. She said they will continue with these raids. Officials also said that they will work on verifying how the minors from Nepal came to work here and necessary action will be taken. Shukla also said that due to the informal nature of the work, it will be difficult to ascertain whether the minors started working post unlock. The minors have been sent back to the care of their guardians, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-from-nepal-among-11-teenagers-found-working-as-labourers-in-noida-rescued/story-vAebWHXmjMYvNCGktoGDrI.html
11-09-2020||Chandigarh||Byelection in Haryana’s Baroda constituency likely in November||The Baroda assembly by election in Haryana are likely to be held along with the Bihar assembly elections in November. The assembly seat had fallen vacant due to the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda on April 12. As per the Representation of People Act, an assembly by election has to be conducted within a period of six months from the date of occurrence of vacancy. The due date for conducting Baroda by poll, thus, will be in October. However, Section 151-A of the Act provides that the Election Commission (EC) in consultation with the Centre can defer the bypoll if it is difficult to hold it within the said period. The EC, which last week held a meeting regarding holding of 65 by elections across the country, reviewed reports and inputs from chief secretaries and chief electoral officers seeking deferment of bypolls due to Covid-19 pandemic and heavy rains in some places. The commission, subsequently, decided that since general assembly elections in Bihar were also due and required to be completed before November 29, all the 65 bypolls across the states will be conducted around the same time, a statement by the EC said. A major factor in clubbing the polls together is the relative ease of movement of Central Armed Police Forces and related logistics, the EC said. “Announcement of schedule of Bihar assembly elections as well as these bypolls will be done by the commission at an appropriate time,’’ the EC said. ‘Baroda falls in Covid-19 hotspot’ Haryana’s chief electoral officer had sent a status report regarding the prevalence of coronavirus infection in Sonepat district to the commission. Baroda assembly seat falls in Sonepat, a district regarded as a hotspot in terms of Covid-19 cases. The district ranks at number three behind Faridabad and Gurugram in terms of total number of positive cases, which were 5,498 as on Thursday. The EC had also asked the chief electoral officer to assess the prevalent infrastructure facilities to ensure that number of polling stations can be increased amid the pandemic. As per the EC’s broad guidelines for conduct of general and by elections during Covid-19, there shall be a maximum of 1,000 electors instead of 1,500 in a polling station. The EC officials said as a precautionary measure on account of the pandemic, the limit of number of electors assigned to a polling station has been restricted to 1,000 in Bihar and constituencies of other states where by elections are due in near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/baroda-assembly-bypolls-likely-to-be-held-in-november/story-NlMGWB581JdYTPbJD717vM.html

11-09-2020||Delhi||Karol Bagh market traders want pedestrian-only plan deferred||Traders of central Delhi’s Karol Bagh market, which was pedestrianised last year, have asked the North Delhi Municipal Corporation not to reintroduce the scheme till March next year, saying extremely low footfall has affected business and so the authorities should allow vehicular movement on Ajmal Khan Road for six more months.Karol Bagh was the first shopping hub in Delhi to be pedestrianised, as part of which its main market road (Ajmal Khan Road) was restricted for vehicles in May last year. Additional arrangements were made to resolve the problem of haphazard parking in the area. But after the Covid-19 lockdown, the stretch was opened for vehicular movement from July 8 this year on traders’ demand. Parking on the stretch is still not allowed.Municipal officials had then said the arrangement was temporary and the pedestrianisation plan would be implemented again after the opening of public transport such as the Delhi Metro.Murli Mani, president of the Ajmal Khan Road Traders Association, said traders do not want the stretch to be pedestrianised for a few more months as there is low footfall and business has been adversely hit due to the coronavirus pandemic. A footfall of 7,000 to 10,000 people per day was reported at the market in normal times, which has now gone down by 90%, traders said.“People do not want to take public transport or walk and prefer private vehicles. Our business is down by over 70% due to Covid-19. We want vehicular movement on Ajmal Khan Road to be extended further. We have written to the mayor and the commissioner of the north corporation, seeking relaxations till March next year,” Mani said.Ajay Bajaj, advisor of the Karol Bagh Market Federation, said pedestrianisation at this juncture would further affect business in the market.“Whatever businesses is happening is because of those who come in private vehicles. Restricting vehicular movement again will only hamper our trade and deteriorate our financial condition,” Bajaj said. He said on-street parking on the stretch should not be allowed but at the same time, vehicular movement should not be restricted .The Karol Bagh market had emerged as a model for other areas as in May last year, the north corporation, along with the traffic police and the public works department (PWD), had restricted vehicular movement on Ajmal Khan Road and made it a completely walkable stretch. A special parking management area plan was made for the market to regularise haphazard parking in the area. On-street parking from Ajmal Khan Road, Padam Singh Marg and Tank Toad was removed. Benches, flower pots and decorative street lights were installed to beautify the market.A senior official of the north corporation said they were yet to get any latest communication from the traders’ body on the issue. “The pedestrianisation plan will be implemented agaun for sure but the date and timing are yet to be decided. It will be done in consultation with all stakeholders, including traders. Any decision regarding when to reintroduce the plan will be taken by higher authorities of the corporation,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/karol-bagh-market-traders-want-pedestrian-only-plan-deferred/story-vE7GKgwONE7AZIGZGCZ6XJ.html

Moreover, the railway station is well connected and approachable by road, we have prepared adequate stacking areas for consignments and space for parking trucks and tempos.There are labourers deployed for loading and unloading of goods, each parcel service car can provide employment to 150 people, which is also a boon for the locals.”The first parcel train with five parcel vans fully loaded with various commodities like refrigerators, furniture, medicines and cosmetic goods have been loaded from Bhiwandi Road Station, Maharashtra to be sent to Danapur in Bihar on Wednesday.As Bhiwandi Road Station falls in the north-south rail route and is also connected to JNPT, it has proximity to Mumbai and Thane cities. Hence, it is considered an apt location for goods and parcel traffic.“It was a request put forth by the people that we took forward and implemented. It is an accessible location and beneficial for many as well. In future, we are planning to develop a similar industrial corridor from Vasai to JNPT. We have also planned to improve the goods shed at Mulund and Kalamboli. Also a proposal to start a Ro-Ro service from Kalamboli towards Kerala has been put forth,” added Goel. The average loading per day of goods has increased from 1,028 in 2019 to 1,116 in 2020 in the month of September within Mumbai division.

11-09-2020||Pune||Baner Covid facility faces medical manpower shortage||Medical manpower shortage has become a pricking thorn in the running of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Covid care facilities across the city. The Baner Covid hospital inaugurated on August 28 has not been able to operate to its full capacity because of the lack of manpower,said Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol.The 314-bed capacity hospital, currently has only 55 patients undergoing treatment. The PMC has also stopped new admissions to the facility, till the medical manpower shortage has been fixed.Mohol said, “The hospital was inaugurated on August 28, but is currently running under capacity. Earlier, the agency which had been appointed to provide a medical team, submitted a letter expressing their inability to provide the manpower. Now, PMC has appointed a new agency which is running the jumbo hospital. The agency’s name is Dr Bhise, which has an earlier experience of being recruited at the COEP jumbo facility to manage an ICU unit. Their experience is good.”Mohol said, “We are trying to increase infrastructure required to handle the Covid-19 situation in the city. It is comparatively easy to increase infrastructure, but now we are facing medical and trained manpower shortage.” “After the jumbo hospital experience which was riddled with problems, PMC has decided to go slow and start hospital operations step by step even though it has a capacity of 314 beds,” added the mayor.Dr Ramesh Ranka, director of Ranka Hospital, said, “Due to the scale of the pandemic, there is a shortage of medical manpower. Many employees working in the health sector left their jobs due to fear of contracting the virus. Poaching is also going on at some places to attract medical staff.” Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “In the last six months, PMC medical staff has tried to control the pandemic.Now, the situation has worsened and the state government must provide additional manpower and if needed, seek help of the armed forces medical college which is in Pune. They even have a nursing college.”Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar said that the previous agency had expressed its unwillingness to run the hospital and a new agency was appointed. The Baner hospital had been inaugurated by deputy chief minister AJit Pawar and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. As both the leaders shared the dias together after the oath-taking ceremony, the inauguration created ripples in the political circles.“Bharatiya Janata Party is ruling in the Pune Municipal Corporation, hence, they invited Fadnavis and as a the district guardian minister is Ajit Pawar, he was also there for the inauguration,” added Mohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/baner-covid-facility-faces-medical-manpower-shortage/story-npuWdHsJZtv1xDjR2dvvkJ.html

Unverified, misleading, malicious information on social media will invite action under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. “Do not forward Covid related messages without verification . We are monitoring such posts on social media. Legal action will be taken against those who spread false news,” said Dayalan, .WhatsApp admins sharing unverified, misleading Covid-19 information were asked to be careful. “Rumours spread fast on social media, leading to unwanted panic among the people. So, our cyber cell sleuths are on guard. We have stepped up online surveillance to identify senders of such fake news, frivolous, unfounded Covid-19 related messages and other content,” Dayalan said. “Whereas the administration is making all out efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the district, certain antisocial elements are spreading all sorts of rumours on social media, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others. This does not just create panic, but also is extremely discouraging for the frontline corona warriors, he added.The entire government machinery was working round the clock and making all out efforts to keep people safe from the virus, “but a few bad elements are hampering the process by posting and sharing unfounded messages. No one would be allowed to sabotage our pandemic control efforts; we will take sternest action in the book against the miscreants,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fir-lodged-against-makers-of-audio-clip-on-mohali-civil-hospital-dayalan/story-HjjMieKC7Uy0sZ9ZCHpCHN.html
11-09-2020||World||Parking deck collapse in Atlanta leaves five workers injured||A parking deck under construction in Atlanta partially collapsed on Friday, officials said, injuring five workers.Video from news helicopters showed an injured worker lowered by crane from the collapsed section of the deck.Four construction workers were injured but managed to walk away from the collapse site. One was trapped with leg injuries, and had to be lowered to the ground by crane, Atlanta Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Glen Riley told reporters at the scene.Firefighters communicated with a crane operator using a construction worker’s radio to remove the worker who was trapped, Riley said.“That was an awesome job,” he said.A firefighter was also taken to a hospital with likely heat exhaustion, Riley said.The collapse involved a prefabricated parking deck under construction in Atlanta’s Midtown section, officials from Atlanta Fire Rescue said in a statement.There are concerns that more of the structure could collapse and fall onto the Downtown Connector, a busy thoroughfare through the heart of the city, Riley said. An on-ramp to that freeway was being closed as a precaution.“If the wall collapses, it may extend to the expressway,” he said.City inspectors planned to examine the structure in the next few hours, he said.The parking structure is near Emory University Hospital Midtown, in a commercial area just southeast of the Georgia Institute of Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parking-deck-collapse-in-atlanta-leaves-five-workers-injured/story-PR0gn5H7fri4WtMwq0cDfI.html
11-09-2020||World||No cameras allowed at Floyd criminal proceedings, for now||When four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death appeared for an omnibus hearing Friday, no cameras were allowed — just as at all other hearings so far in the case.In Minnesota, unlike many other states, cameras are not allowed before the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings unless both prosecution and defense agree. Attorneys for the officers have said they want cameras, but the prosecution team — led by state Attorney General Keith Ellison — has so far resisted. In a court filing, they have warned the cameras could change the way attorneys present evidence, force participants to endure even more media scrutiny and even intimidate witnesses.Prosecutors have said they might change their minds before the trial’s scheduled start in March. A coalition of media organizations, including The Associate Press, has requested access for cameras, arguing that they will increase transparency, especially with the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic may restrict access to court proceedings for the media and spectators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-cameras-allowed-at-floyd-criminal-proceedings-for-now/story-1K9z1G6bzW1WIJd4aQWeMI.html
11-09-2020||World||Donald Trump, First Lady mark 9/11 moment of silence on Air Force 1||US President Donald Trump on Friday led the nation in mourning victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack with a moment of silence along with First Lady Melania on Air Force One. He delivered remarks at the memorial site near Shanksville in Pennsylvania. Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden crossed paths at the 9/11 memorial site in New York, where on this day in 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people in the worst-ever terrorist attacks in the recent memories. At 8:46 AM local time, Trump and Melania participated in a moment of silence in a conference room cabin of the Air Force One to commemorate the moment the first plane hit the World Trade Center. “God bless America,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said when the moment of silence was concluded. “God Bless America,” the president repeated. “The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back,” Trump said in his address at the Flight 93 national memorial site in Shanksville. “Nineteen years ago, on this day at this very hour on this field 40 brave men and women try out over terror and gave their lives in defence of our nation. Their names and their stories are forever inscribed on the eternal rollcall of American heroes. Today we pay tribute to their sacrifice and we mourn deeply for the nearly 3,000 precious and beautiful souls that were taken from us on September 11, 2001. “While we cannot erase your pain, we can help to shoulder your burden…,” the president said. Other hijacked planes struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center and then the South Tower and then the Pentagon. “The terrorist on Flight 93 had a fourth target in mind. It was called our nation’s capital. They were just 20 minutes away from reaching their sinister objective. The only thing that stood between the enemy and a deadly strike at the heart of American democracy was the courage and resolve of 40 men and women, the amazing passengers and crew of flight 93,” he said. In New York, both Pence and Biden visited the 9/11 memorial. “In the memory of all those we lost on this day 19 years ago, in memory of the heroes that were forged that day and heroes forged on battlefields ever since and for the families, loved ones, and friends they left behind, I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours,” Pence said in his brief remarks as he read verses from Psalm 23. Biden said: “Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short on that God-awful September day: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of sons and daughters, parents, siblings, grandchildren and grandparents, neighbours and friends — loved ones faced with the harrowing, hollowing news that the dearest thing in their life had been suddenly taken away”. “Like a generation once did in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this generation of Americans bore the burden that history placed on our shoulders that day. “And this year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans, testing our resolve and character with each passing day,” Biden, who also visited the memorial in Shanksville, said. Defence Secretary Mark Esper led the ceremony at the Pentagon memorial. “It was a vicious assault directed not just at our people and our institutions, but also at our most sacred ideals, freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, in their attempt to shake the very foundations of our republic, to destroy our way of life, they underestimated our strength, our resolve and our unbreakable spirit. “We came together as a nation on that fateful day and witnessed a tremendous outpouring of courage, compassion and sacrifice amid the grief, darkness and the disarray,” Esper added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-first-lady-mark-9-11-moment-of-silence-on-air-force-1/story-ZQzDqghs1kxWuxLqr1nhsI.html

If we don’t fight for our freedom, we live like a slave and we promote a deadly ideology,” he said.Charlie Hebdo’s republication of the cartoons drew new condemnation from states including Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. But Sourisseau, who now lives under round the clock protection, said it had to republish them.“If we had given up the right to publish these cartoons, that would mean that we were wrong to do so” in the first place, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/al-qaeda-threatens-charlie-hebdo-for-republishing-mohammed-cartoons-site/story-7N9XjwnCaJhnhihAOkBmQJ.html

11-09-2020||World||Covid vaccine trial stopped after volunteer shows neurological symptoms||A woman who received an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed severe neurological symptoms that prompted a pause in testing, a spokesman for drugmaker AstraZeneca said Thursday.The study participant in late-stage testing reported symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord, said company spokesman Matthew Kent.“We don’t know if it is (transverse myelitis),” Kent said. “More tests are being done now as part of the follow-up.” On Tuesday, AstraZeneca said its “standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.” It did not provide any details other than to say a single participant had an “unexplained illness.” The vaccine was initially developed by Oxford University after the coronavirus pandemic began this year.Kent said an independent committee was reviewing the study’s safety data before deciding if and when the research could continue.The study was previously stopped in July for several days after a participant who got the vaccine developed neurological symptoms; it turned out to be an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccine.Late last month, AstraZeneca began recruiting 30,000 people in the U.S. for its largest study of the vaccine. It also is testing the vaccine in thousands of people in Britain, and in smaller studies in Brazil and South Africa. Several other Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in development.Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, said the U.N. health agency wasn’t overly concerned by the pause in the Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine trial, describing it as “a wake-up call” to the global community about the inevitable ups and downs of medical research.Temporary holds of large medical studies aren’t unusual, and investigating any serious or unexpected reaction is a mandatory part of safety testing.AstraZeneca pointed out that it’s possible the problem could be a coincidence; illnesses of all sorts could arise in studies of thousands of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-trial-stopped-after-neurological-symptoms-detected-in-volunteer-astrazeneca/story-lWrJvqiN5dEZjyBE9gl9eI.html

He (Donald Trump) would push anything to get re-elected. Don’t fall for it, and by the way, I would take the vaccine if Ivanka takes it,” Behar is heard saying on the show.Taking up the challenge, Ivanka Trump took to Twitter to root for the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).“Deal @JoyVBehar. I would come on your show to do so. I trust the FDA and so should all Americans. Vanquishing this virus should be our collective top priority," she tweeted. Deal @JoyVBehar. I would come on your show to do so.I trust the FDA and so should all Americans. Vanquishing this virus should be our collective top priority. https://t.co/FXb0DqjdioNot just from Behar, but Trump has been receiving a lot of criticism on his promised Covid-19 vaccine, many calling it a campaign tactic to gain advantage at the upcoming US presidential election.On many occasions including campaign rallies, Trump has claimed a vaccine for coronavirus will have been found by the end of this year.Trump on Monday insisted that a vaccine may be ready “even before a very special date”, referring to November 3, the Election Day. “We are producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we are gonna have soon, very very soon...by the end of the year but much sooner than that perhaps,” Trump had said.On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and vote to elect a new government for the next four years or re-elect the Trump for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-will-take-covid-vaccine-on-your-show-ivanka-trump-accepts-tv-host-joy-behar-s-challenge/story-PT7xs0vF956lnJfqqr717N.html

The head was sitting on the chest, Trump is believed to have said to the writer.Jang Song Thaek, accused of treason, was executed in 2013.Five things to know about Jang Song Thaek:1. Jang Song Thaek became part of North Korea’s first family by marriage. He got married to one of the daughters of North Korea’s founder kim Il Sung, Kim Kyong Hui. Both attended Kim Il Sung university. The duo got married in 1972. they had a daughter who reportedly killed herself in 2006. 2. When Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, it is believed that Jang helped him cement his authorities.3. He was believed to be a reformist who wanted to open the doors of North Korea.4. Jang Song Thaek’s execution was one of the major purges that Kim Jong Un undertook after he came to power. Pyongang accused Jang of plotting to overthrow the government. Jang was described as “worse than a dog”, and “despicable human scum” by North Korea’s official news agency KCNA.5. Several conspiracy theories floated about how Jang was killed. It was rumoured that he was stripped naked and fed to dogs. But the account was later attributed to a satirical post that appeared on a Chinese social media network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-showed-off-headless-body-of-his-executed-uncle-all-you-need-to-know-about-jang-song-thaek/story-1JPaONyTIlUgpispkfMnbP.html
11-09-2020||World||Beijing to impose restrictions on all US diplomats in China||Beijing will impose “reciprocal restrictions” on all American diplomats on Chinese soil in response to curbs on its embassy personnel in the United States, China’s foreign ministry said Friday.Relations between the world’s top two economies have deteriorated in recent months, with both sides locked in fierce recriminations over trade disputes, human rights and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.China’s latest move comes days after Washington announced new restrictions on staff working for Beijing’s foreign missions, such as a requirement to seek approval for university visits or meetings with local officials. “The Chinese side has recently sent a diplomatic note announcing reciprocal restrictions on the US embassy and consulates,” the ministry said in a statement.It added that the unspecified countermeasures will apply to all US embassy and consulate staff, including the consulate-general in Hong Kong and its personnel.“It must be stressed that these measures are China’s legitimate and necessary response to the erroneous US moves,” the ministry said, urging the US to “immediately correct its mistakes” and lift the earlier curbs.A tit-for-tat dispute over foreign missions flared up in July when Washington ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to shutter the American presence in Chengdu.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that new measures targeting Chinese envoys were a response to long-established controls on American diplomats in China.Washington’s restrictions will force Chinese diplomats to seek US permission to hold cultural events involving more than 50 people outside mission grounds.They also require embassy social media accounts to be publicly identified as being affiliated with the Chinese government.Escalating confrontationThe battle over foreign embassies is only one front in an escalating confrontation between the US and China.Washington has imposed sanctions on officials accused of helping orchestrate China’s mass internment of Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province, a programme that has prompted a global human rights outcry.Last month it blacklisted officials it accused of suppressing “freedom and democratic processes” in Hong Kong, after the imposition of a national security law aimed at quelling civil unrest in the financial hub. The move prompted China to issue its own sanctions against several prominent Americans, including prominent senators and senior figures in US-based human rights organisations.President Donald Trump has also provoked a furious reaction from Chinese officials by blaming Beijing for the global spread of the coronavirus, saying authorities there failed to contain the pandemic in its early stages. And Washington has also accused Chinese tech firms and platforms -- from Huawei to TikTok -- of working in the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.Beijing denied on Friday it was attempting to meddle in the upcoming US presidential election after American tech giant Microsoft said it had thwarted cyberattacks from overseas groups -- including from China -- against both the Republican and Democratic campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-impose-restrictions-on-all-us-diplomats-in-china/story-viKm4R3qoVORU4ALQjzH3M.html
11-09-2020||World||India-US statement panned Pak over terror. China rushes to its defence||China on Friday staunchly defended Pakistan’s record in fighting terrorism, saying its all-weather ally has made “tremendous efforts and sacrifices”, countering calls by India and the US that Islamabad must ensure that its territory is not used for terror activities. India and the US in a joint statement after the 17th meeting of the India-US Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and the third session of the India-US Designations Dialogue held on September 9-10, denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms.New Delhi and Washington Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai strike and the Pathankot airbase attack.Asked for his reaction, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian during a media briefing here said that terrorism is a common challenge faced by all countries and Pakistan has made “tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting terrorism.“The international community should fully recognise and respect that. China opposes all kind of terrorism. All countries on the bases of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit engage in anti-terrorism international cooperation to jointly safeguard the international peace and security,” he said.On the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Zhao said that the terror attack brought many challenges to global security.“Now, the counter-terrorism situation is still severe and has posed risks to all countries,” he said.Watch: China defends Pakistan after India & US call for action against terror “China opposes all kind of terrorism and we believe that the UN should play a leading role and we oppose double standards on counter-terrorism and we oppose the attempt to link the terrorism to any specific country,” he said.He emphasised that all countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard world’s peace and stability.“So on this very special day, I would like to say that we hope the US won’t forget terrorism and Covid-19 are common enemies to all mankind. And China and Pakistan are not the enemies of the US,” he said.About the meeting between Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on Thursday on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he said Wang assured that China will continue to provide Pakistan with anti-epidemic support until Pakistan completely overcomes the Covid-19 pandemic.“China will like to work with Pakistan in advancing the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and further agricultural cooperation, which will deliver benefits to people,” Zhao said.India has objected to the USD 60 billion CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK).“We believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the corridor will play a greater role in Pakistan’s economic development and people’s welfare,” he said.China will continue working with Pakistan, firmly supporting each other on international multilateral occasions to uphold international fairness and justice, he said.“Next year is the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. We will build on our friendship, plan for the future, and make new progress in our bilateral relations,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-close-ally-pak-made-tremendous-efforts-sacrifices-in-fighting-terrorism/story-LZxqQ8qKl5oPl5qHsRB0EK.html
11-09-2020||World||‘Nirav Modi won’t get fair trial in India’: Ex-SC judge Katju tells London court||Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi will not get a fair trial in India if extradited to face charges of major financial offences, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju claimed on Friday while deposing as a defence witness in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court.Appearing via video link from New Delhi, Katju alleged in his 130-minute deposition that the judicial system in India had collapsed, claiming that investigative agencies such as the CBI and Enforcement Directorate were acting at the behest of political masters.The five-day hearing is part of Nirav Modi’s extradition trial in which the judge needs to decide whether there is a prima facie case against him in India on the basis of evidence submitted by the government of India – not to reach a judgement of conviction or guilt.Katju talked about several cases and issues to substantiate his allegations, including the 2019 Ayodhya judgement by a Supreme Court bench headed by former chief justice Ranjan Gogoi, the latter’s subsequent nomination as a Rajya Sabha MP, the post-retirement appointment of judges, media trials and alleged corruption in the judiciary.Questioning law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s claim in a press conference in May that Modi was a “criminal”, Katju said: “The government of India has made up its mind that Nirav Modi is a criminal. Is Prasad the judge? What kind of law minister is he? How can we expect a fair trial?”“All ministers have pronounced him (Modi) guilty and the courts will do what they say…The present government needs a scapegoat to divert attention from other issues. Nirav Modi is the scapegoat, blamed for all ills,” the retired top court judge claimed.“They have already pronounced him a criminal. I am definite that he will not get a fair trial in India. No lawyer will pick up his case. The justice system has collapsed; it is beyond redemption; it has bowed before political masters.”Katju clarified that he cannot say anything about the charges of financial offences brought against Nirav Modi by CBI and ED, since he is not aware of the details, but repeated several times that he will not get a fair trial under the present circumstances.Recalling the SC’s 2013 description of the CBI as a “caged parrot”, Katju alleged that things had worsened, claiming that CBI and ED were not politically neutral, with the Central Vigilance Commission “doing nothing”. According to him, such agencies had become “tools of political masters”.Helen Malcolm, appearing on India’s behalf, questioned Katju about speaking to the news media in India on Thursday about his court appearance, and wondered if it was anything to do with his being a “self-publicist” keen to exploit the high-profile case.Malcolm read out Katju’s remarks published in the past on same-sex relationships, about single women allegedly being prone to psychological problems, about “90% Indians are fools”, provoking agitated responses from Katju. At one point, he said: “I know more English literature than you”.Malcolm said: “I don’t want to be discourteous but is it possible that you are a self-publicist who will make any outrageous comment to reach the press in this high-profile case. It is up to others to make a judgement about the use of your evidence”.Katju said that Malcolm’s accusation that he is motivated by personal vanity or vainglory is not fair.The next date of hearing in the case is November 3 and the judgement on Modi’s extradition is expected in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-a-scapegoat-ex-sc-judge-katju-tells-uk-court/story-lFS0QgEXzAHAkDk1rakO0L.html

ByteDance decided last year to locate its regional headquarters in Singapore, which in recent years has ramped up efforts to attract tech firms and investors, the source said.“Even though we are in the midst of an uncertain environment, many companies from all over the world ... continue to grow their operations in Singapore to serve Asia and international markets,” Kiren Kumar, executive vice president of Singapore Economic Development Board said.PayPal, Siemens, Twitter and Zoom had said that they were investing in Singapore this year, Kumar added. Bloomberg earlier reported that ByteDance was planning to make the city-state its beachhead for the rest of Asia as part of its global expansion plans and set up a data centre there.However, the source told Reuters that ByteDance has yet to make a decision about such a move, while another source said TikTok had this year moved some engineers there from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-invest-billions-in-singapore-over-three-years-report/story-VQM763GwTepvjnJaBALrbM.html

Overall, it said the deal with Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, will deliver a 1.5 billion-pound boost to the UKBritain’s Conservative government has said that one of the benefits of Brexit is that it allows the country to negotiate trade deals with whoever it wishes — the EU negotiates trade deals on behalf of its members.Skeptics say the deal with Japan is little different to the one already in place via the UK’s former membership of the EU. They also say that nothing can mitigate for the losses Britain would suffer in the event of a ‘no-deal’ outcome with the EU. Such a scenario would see tariffs and other impediments imposed on trade between the UK and the EU. Though both sides would suffer from the new barriers to trade, most economists think Britain would be hit disproportionately.In 2019, the UK exported some 36.7 billion pounds of goods to Germany, Europe’s largest-economy, or 10% of its total. Exports to Japan were just 7.2 billion pounds, or 1.9% of the total.The talks with the EU have not collapsed yet and discussions are set to resume on Monday in Brussels. Though the UK left the bloc on Jan. 31, it is in a transition period that effectively sees it benefit from tariff-free trade until the end of this year. The discussions are about agreeing on the broad outlines of the trading relationship from the start of 2021.Concerns over a post-Brexit deal have heightened in the past few days since the British government said that new legislation breaches parts of the withdrawal agreement, which allowed for the country’s smooth departure from the bloc.The diplomatic shockwaves from the British announcement could derail any hopes Prime Minister Boris Johnson may have of negotiating a U.S. trade deal. The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned the British government that there will be “absolutely no chance” of a trade deal if the UK violates its international obligations as they apply to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Congress has to ratify all U.S. trade deals.Even before the current standoff, the trade discussions with the EU had made little progress, with the two sides wide apart on business regulations, the extent to which the UK can support certain industries and over the EU fishing fleet’s access to British waters.The renewed Brexit uncertainties come as the British economy gradually recovers from a deep recession caused by the shutdown of businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by a month-on-month rate of 6.6% in July as many sectors, including pubs and restaurants, started reopening. Despite the increase, the economy remains 11.7% smaller than it was in February.The looming end of a salary-support scheme that will likely see unemployment rise and the heightened Brexit uncertainties are expected to weigh on growth in the months ahead.Former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, urged the government to provide more support for those likely to be unemployed after the end of the Job Retention Scheme in October and to avoid a “huge act of self-harm” in its discussions with the EU.“We’ve got a cliff-edge on the furlough scheme on Oct. 31 and we’ve now got a cliff-edge on Brexit,” he told BBC radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-secures-first-major-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-japan-as-talks-with-eu-turn-sour/story-VhqFBPJx09gJHazWDfBhrN.html

And Pakistan has made tremendous efforts and sacrificed in fighting terrorism. The international community should fully recognise and respect that,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular briefing.His remarks came a day after a joint statement at the end of the 17th meeting of the US-India Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and the third session of the Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10.It said India and the US “underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot.” Also Read: Pak needs to take irreversible action against terror groups: Indo-US joint statementNoting that Friday is the 19th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks on the US, Zhao said: “All countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard world’s peace and stability. So, on this very special day I would like to say that we hope the US won’t forget terrorism and Covid-19 are common enemies to all mankind. And China and Pakistan are not the enemies of the US.”“China opposes all kind of terrorism and we believe that the UN should play a leading role and we oppose double standards on counter terrorism.

Republican Vice President Mike Pence will also be on hand for the ceremony.Trump will speak at a morning ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, a White House official said. The event, in remembrance of the 40 passengers and crew who died when the plane plunged into a field after they struggled with the hijackers, will be closed to the public because of coronavirus concerns, the National Park Service said.Later in the day, the Bidens will visit the Shanksville site to pay their respects to the victims. The two candidates were not expected to cross paths in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is vital to the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Biden.Flight 93, bound for San Francisco from Newark, New Jersey, never hit its intended target — the four hijackers were believed to be planning to crash it into either the US Capitol or the White House — after passengers stormed the cockpit and attempted to regain control of the aircraft.In all, nearly 3,000 people died in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which also included a fourth hijacked plane that slammed into the Pentagon outside Washington.The ceremonies marking the attacks are a regular stop for presidential candidates and officials. Trump visited Shanksville for the 9/11 anniversary in 2018, and has attended memorial ceremonies at the Pentagon.Biden went to memorials in Shanksville during his years as vice president under Barack Obama.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton both visited the Ground Zero memorial in New York on the anniversary of 9/11.Biden’s campaign said it was pulling its television ads off the air on Friday to commemorate the anniversary of the attacks.The non-profit 9/11 Day had asked both campaigns to pull its ads. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-to-commemorate-september-11-attacks-in-pennsylvania-new-york/story-FRKHxThXLkotImGjMaLeaN.html

It said the two agreed that the current situation in the border areas “is not in the interest of either side.” “They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.”Jaishankar and Wang had “held full, in-depth discussion with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on the situation in the border areas as well as bilateral ties here on Thursday,” the Xinhua report said.It quoted Wang as saying that it is normal for China and India to have differences as two neighbouring major countries. “What is important is to put these differences in a proper context vis-a-vis bilateral relation,” the report said, quoting the senior Chinese official.Also Read: India, China differences remain despite five-point consensus on easing tensionsState-run hawkish nationalist tabloid Global Times carried opinion pieces, saying the ball is now in New Delhi’s court to resolve the tensions.In an editorial published ahead of the meeting, the tabloid said Beijing’s talks with India “come with war preparedness”.On the outcome of the bilateral meeting, the tabloid said it exceeded the “expectations of most international observers and created favorable conditions for a possible future meeting between the leaders of the two countries”.The article then quickly changed track to say the “successful implementation of the joint statement, however, depends on whether the Indian side can truly keep its word.”Quoting experts, it argued that it is possible that the joint statement will end up as merely “paper talk,” if India did not follow-up.“We should not only observe what India says, but also what it does. For a country like India, the most important thing is how it acts,” it quoted Hu Zhiyong, from the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, as saying.In a separate opinion piece, the tabloid’s editor Hu Xijin claimed the border tension is a result of the aggressive attitude of the Indian army.“The meeting between the two foreign ministers maintained the political communication channels between the two sides under the current critical situation. However, due to the huge differences in the understanding of the actual border control line between the two sides, the Indian army adopted an aggressive stance on the ground,” Hu wrote in a commentary published in Mandarin.“The two foreign ministers eased the political situation. Whether the wishes can be implemented on the spot is uncertain,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-state-media-cautiously-welcomes-india-china-joint-statement/story-bAAPIHV8IU5JZGVBZ5B0FP.html

He called for a swift investigation.Many Lebanese are frustrated that they have yet to be told about any initial findings from a probe into last month’s explosion that killed about 190 people and injured 6,000.The government resigned after the port blast, and Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib is racing to form a new cabinet by early next week to meet a two-week deadline agreed under French pressure. Forming a government in Lebanon usually takes months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-firefighters-douse-remains-of-beirut-port-fire/story-TbUcISpgqg7grJnuqvFaVN.html
11-09-2020||World||Russian police seek to question Alexei Navalny in Germany||Russian police said Friday they were seeking to question opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Berlin after Moscow rubbished Germany’s declaration that he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. The 44-year-old Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia and was hospitalised there before being flown to Berlin.Germany reported “unequivocal evidence” that he was poisoned with the nerve agent but Russia says its doctors found no trace of poison.The Siberian transport police, who have been retracing Navalny’s movements, said in a statement that Russia would be preparing a request for its officers and an “expert” to shadow German investigators.Also read: US could restrict funds for ‘malign activities’ over Navalny poisoningThe police said following reports that Navalny had emerged from a coma, officers could “ask clarifying and additional questions” and be present as “German colleagues carry out investigative activities with Navalny, medics and experts”.The Kremlin has denounced attempts to blame the Russian state for the poisoning as “absurd” and said it wants to know what happened.International politicians have said the incident appears likely to have been state-ordered and urged Moscow to prove its lack of involvement.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday there was a “substantial chance” the order to poison the dissident “came from senior Russian officials,” a claim the Kremlin slammed as “unacceptable”.Navalny’s associates say the use of Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, shows only the Russian state could be responsible.The case has prompted international calls for Russia to carry out a transparent investigation or risk sanctions, but the country has not opened a criminal investigation saying its medics did not find evidence of poison in tests.Siberian transport police have been conducting a “check” into what happened and on Friday published some findings on Navalny’s activities.Wine and cocktail They identified where Navalny stayed, what he and ate and that he drank “wine and an alcoholic cocktail”. They confirmed that he visited the “Vienna Coffeehouse” at the airport at Tomsk where supporters suspect he was poisoned with a cup of tea.The police also said they had questioned all those accompanying Navalny except for one woman, Marina Pevchikh, who “lives permanently in Britain”.They were now working to trace passengers on the flight from Tomsk to Moscow where Navalny fell ill on August 20, the statement said.Russia has repeatedly complained that Germany has not answered its request to see the medical data that led to the declaration that Navalny had been poisoned with Novichok. Russian doctors nevertheless said they administered an antidote to nerve agents that was also used by doctors at the Berlin hospital now treating the anti-corruption campaigner.Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya told the Security Council on Thursday that Russian doctors “saved Alexei Navalny”, Russian news agencies reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-police-seek-to-question-alexei-navalny-in-germany/story-ZZ7g5hmVs5biRi7ip4RxaM.html
11-09-2020||World||Abe plan for land-attack counterpunch could mark major military shift for Japan||Months before he announced his resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set in motion a policy change that could for the first time allow Japan’s military to plan for strikes on land targets in China and other parts of Asia.Japan’s Self Defence Forces are geared toward stopping attackers in the air and the sea. The policy change would direct the military to create a doctrine for targeting enemy sites on land - a mission that would require the purchase of long-range weapons such as cruise missiles.If adopted by the next government, the policy would mark one of the most significant shifts in Japan’s military stance since the end of World War Two. It reflects Abe’s longstanding push for a more robust military and Tokyo’s deepening concern about Chinese influence in the region. The Japanese government is worried by China’s increased military activity around disputed East China Sea islets.“The main reason for our action is China. We haven’t really emphasised that too much, but the security choices we make are because of China,” Masahisa Sato, a lawmaker from Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party who has served as a deputy defence minister and a deputy foreign minister, said in an interview.Japan renounced its right to wage war after World War Two, making the issue of striking targets on land - which would entail attacks on foreign soil - contentious for its Asian neighbours, particularly China. Abe said last month he was stepping down because of worsening health. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who is seen as less hawkish than Abe but is closely aligned with him, is expected to win the race to replace him as party leader and become premier.GOVERNMENT POLICYAbe instructed senior defence policymakers in June to come up with LDP proposals for the military that included a land-attack, or strike, doctrine. That proposal will become government policy if it is included in a revised national defence strategy, which appears likely, according to two insiders, including LDP acting Secretary General Tomomi Inada. “I don’t think there is much opposition to it in the LDP,” Inada told Reuters. “That direction doesn’t change even with a new prime minister.”The military can already use long-range missiles to strike ships. It considers such plans justified because it needs to be able to destroy weapons threatening Japan. The land-attack proposal is framed using the same reasoning, according to former defence minister Itsunori Onodera.Therefore, proponents say, Japan’s laws will not need to change. During his eight years in office, Abe pushed for but failed to achieve his goal of revising the post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9.Japan’s National Security Council, which Abe leads and includes key cabinet officials, including Suga, will meet Friday to discuss defence strategy.US-made BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles would be an option for land-attack weapons, said Katsutoshi Kawano, who until last year was Japan’s most senior military officer, the Chairman of Self Defense Forces Chief of Staffs.Tomahawks can hit targets 2,500 kilometres (1,553 miles) away. That would put most of China and much of the Russian Far East within range.“Japan could probably have strike capability within five years,” Kawano said. “A full strike package including targeting satellites and electronic warfare components would, however, be far more expensive and take more than 10 years to acquire.”In the meantime, Japan would have to rely on the United States for intelligence and surveillance. POLITICSTo move the proposal forward, the next government will need to complete a revised defence strategy and midterm procurement plan by the end of December, before the defence ministry submits its annual budget request. That could meet resistance from the LDP’s coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which worries such a move would antagonise China and threaten Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. “It could spark an arms race and raise tension. It would be technically difficult and would require huge investment,” Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said in an interview. “This is something that has to be thought seriously about under the new Prime Minister.”Even some LDP’s security hawks, including one of Suga’s leadership rivals, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, see a potential downside to acquiring long-range cruise missiles. “What happens if the United States asks Japan to fire them, and we don’t want to?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abe-plan-for-land-attack-counterpunch-could-mark-major-military-shift-for-japan/story-h7OidNNxR3bMghXKGZDhMI.html
11-09-2020||World||Khalistan fantasy exists due to Pak support: Think tank report author||The idea of a Sikh homeland is a fantasy that exists only due to the backing of Pakistan to Khalistan extremists, says the author of an explosive report detailing Islamabad’s role in fomenting terrorism in Punjab and keeping the issue alive abroad.Veteran Canadian journalist Terry Milewski, who wrote the report Khalistan: A Project of Pakistan, also asserted that the so-called Referendum 2020 will only be voted on by those who are already separatist elements and thus may result in skewing the outcome.“I believe that without Pakistan they (Khalistanis) wouldn’t have much to live for. It would be all rhetorical, all performative, with no substance,” Milewski told Hindustan Times in an interview.“This thing isn’t real, it’s just a fantasy. Pakistan gives them something, gives the Khalistanis an illusion that their dream might become a reality,” said Milewki, who spent decades with Canada’s national broadcaster CBC, including years as a prime time news host.Milewski said his objective behind bringing out the report at this time was because the Punjab Referendum 2020, organised by the separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), is scheduled for November. He pointed out that election results in India have clearly shown that Khalistan has little popular support, and that even within the Sikh community in Canada, the vast majority will not participate in the process. However, that will ensure the results of the referendum are skewed in favour of those that actually support Khalistan. “The problem is, it’s a referendum of the people that support the referendum,” he said.The results, however insignificant they may be, “is designed to rally supporters” of a waning Khalistan cause, he added.Milewski’s report was released by the think tank MacDonald-Laurier Institute (MLI) in Ottawa. It places the focus sharply upon Pakistan’s role in the Khalistan issue, which it fanned since the 1970s and continues to till this day.It traces the origins of the Khalistan project to Zulqikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistani prime minister in the early 1970s. It was fomented further by military dictator Zia ul Haq. The report also points to the links of Canadians involved in the movement to Pakistan, including the visits of Talwinder Singh Parmar there. Parmar is considered the mastermind behind the bombing of Kanishka, the Air India flight 182, in June 1985, which claimed 329 lives and remains the worst incident of terrorism in Canadian history. However, many Khalistani elements refuse to believe that fact, or continue to consider him a martyr. Milewski said this “fosters denial and rejection of the Canadian court system” and creates a conspiracy theory catchment like QAnon in the US. “The problem is not they’re planning assassinations and terrorist attacks in Canada, they are telling their children Parmar was a martyr that he was innocent,” he said. Milewski has often faced attacks over his reporting on the matter, including the argument that there was no violence associated with the Khalistan movement in Canada since the mid-1980s. That argument, he said, isn’t completely valid since “death threats against witnesses in the Air India case are still in operation today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalistan-fantasy-exists-due-to-pak-support-think-tank-report-author/story-TFBwKJBkU4QJehBVHQD4xH.html
11-09-2020||World||India-China joint statement stresses need for more confidence building||The joint statement issued after the foreign ministers of India and China met in Moscow proposes a new set of confidence building measures (CBMs) to maintain peace along the disputed boundary, an indication that existing bilateral agreements have failed to cover the cracks in trust between the troops of the two countries at the border.“The two foreign ministers agreed that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite the completion of new mutual trust-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquility in the border area,” said the statement issued after external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met in Moscow on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting on Thursday.It did not detail what the CBMs could be but does indicate New Delhi and Beijing believe more measures need to be put in place before the situation spirals out of control in the hostile Himalayan terrain.The priority, of course, is first to disengage the two militaries along the points of friction.The ongoing, four-month long tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh indicates that some half-a-dozen boundary agreements and dozens of rounds of talks – including 22 rounds under the high-profile Special Representatives (SR) mechanism – failed to prevent what happened on the night of June 15 in Galwan Valley – the death of soldiers and the rapid erosion of trust.Until now, the main agreements which bind New Delhi and Beijing to maintain peace at the border are the Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border (1993), Agreement on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border (1996), and Border Defence Cooperation Agreement between India and China (2013), which list ways to reduce misunderstandings between the two countries along the border, including prohibiting one side from actively following or tailing the patrols of the other side.Other agreements signed in 2005 and 2012 talk about building CBMs, the political parameters and guiding principles of settling the boundary question and the setting up of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on China-India Border Affairs.New Delhi believes that Beijing’s action at Galwan Valley reneged on three of the key bilateral agreements – of 1993, 1996 and 2013 – which have kept the disputed boundary mostly quiet.Evidently, more needs to be done.“The Indian side does not consider the development of India-China relations to be dependent on the settlement of the boundary question and India does not want to go backwards,” a read-out from China on the meeting said, quoting Jaishankar.It is, however, fairly clear that the boundary issue, especially after the current round of tension and the death of troops, are tied to the overall relationship.The friction and violence have impacted economic and trade ties besides dampening people-to-people exchanges – all in a year that’s marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-India diplomatic relations.The new round of friction has also hit the expanding economic interdependence between the two countries.To be sure, the planned new CBMs to maintain peace at the border need to zero in on and address the gaps in trust at the ground-level between the two militaries.The problem is the fact that LAC is not demarcated – perceptions differ on both sides. There also needs to be a consensus among the top leadership on the new CBMs, which may not be that easy.“Both leaders (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping) are embracing a more assertive posture toward all rivals, including each other; attributing military tensions to the other side’s hostility, and demanding that soldiers be firm to defend national borders and strongly push back against perceived aggression,” Toby Dalton and Tong Zhao from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace write in a research paper on the ongoing tensions.Jaishankar and Wang, however, seem to agree that there is an urgent need to disengage from the hostility and reset the engagement both diplomatically and militarily.According to the India-China joint statement, both agreed “the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side”, and “therefore...the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.”The ministers agreed that “both sides shall abide by all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and avoid any action that could escalate matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-joint-statement-stresses-need-for-more-confidence-building/story-Bmekw6nnG16BfitfsugcoI.html
11-09-2020||World||Joe Biden family selling country to China, says Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump has accused his Democratic challenger Joe Biden of being “weak” on China and that his family was “selling” the country directly to the Chinese military. Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee Biden and his Indian-American running mate Kamala Harris are challenging President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the November 3 Presidential election. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday, Trump said, “Biden is weak on China. Yesterday, it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor.” Hunter Biden owns 10 per cent of Shanghai-based private-equity firm Bohai Harvest RST. The president charged reporters that they were not reporting on the Michigan transaction. “You don’t want to write about that, do you? Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China,” he said. “Now the Biden family is selling out our country directly to the Chinese military. He didn’t have a job. Now, all of a sudden, he’s selling companies from Michigan to China,” Trump said. He alleged the Chinese military got American manufacturing jobs, and the Biden family got paid in return. “I said ‘If Joe Biden ever got elected, China will own America’, they will own America,” Trump said. The president also accused his Democratic challenger of undermining his efforts to bring out a coronavirus vaccine. “Joe’s decision to publicly attack the China (flight) ban proved he lacks the character or intelligence or instinct to do what is right. Now, Biden has launched a public campaign against the vaccine, which is so bad, because we have some vaccines coming that are incredible,” he said. “Biden is perfectly happy to endanger the lives of other people by doing something that he thinks is going to help him politically because his polls are getting very bad. They’re getting very shaky,” he said. “This was an election that was going to be very easy, very quick, and then the China virus (COVID-19) came in and I had to go back to work politically, unfortunately. I had to devote more time politically than to the other things we do, which are very important for our country. But I had to go back to work. It looks like we’re going up (opinion polls) very rapidly. More rapidly than the media wants to admit,” Trump said. He alleged that when Biden was vice president, his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous. “His own chief of staff said that when Biden helped manage the swine flu in 2009, they, quote “did everything possible wrong.” And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time,” he said. “In other words, Biden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge of this very serious, highly, highly contagious epidemic or pandemic countless more Americans would have died,” Trump said. The president predicted victory for himself in the key battleground state of Michigan, where he addressed thousands of enthusiastic supporters on Thursday. “This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that,” Trump told his supporters at the rally in Freeland, Michigan, His comments were responded by euphoric chants of “Four More Years. Four More Years,” which is Trump’s campaign slogan. Trump drew parallels between the last time he campaigned in the state in 2016, saying the Democrats did a “lousy job” campaigning in the state the last time and this time would be the same. Trump said the people should vote for him as he revived the economy, stopping a number of car plant closures. “We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right? Long time. It’s been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three-and-a-half-years and we’re going to bring you a lot more,” he said. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the American economy is now on revival mode, he said. “Now we’re building it again and it’s being built fast,” he said. The president said Biden will fill the state with refugees, which will diminish jobs. “He’s promised to flood your state with refugees, and you know that as well as I do and you see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden’s pledged to have a 700 per cent increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie (Sanders). A 700 per cent increase in the flow of refugees. This is in their manifesto,” Trump alleged. Meanwhile, Biden has criticised Trump for withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal negotiated by the Barack Obama administration. “Iran is closer to a weapon now (more) than we were when we left office in 2017,” Biden said at a fund raiser. Biden said he would re-enter the deal if Iran “returns to compliance.” However, he noted that restarting talks would not be easy, and would require support from America’s allies in Europe as well as China and Russia. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden is leading in Michigan by 4.2 points and by 3.9 percentage points in the battleground states. Overall, Biden is leading in national polls by 7.5 percentage points.

11-09-2020||World||Four Houston officers fired for fatally shooting man in April||Four Houston police officers have been terminated after an internal investigation determined they did not use reasonable force when they fired their weapons 21 times at a man who had been experiencing a mental health crisis, killing him in April after he was already injured and on the ground, the city’s police chief announced Thursday.During a news conference, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo presented video footage from body cameras that showed 27-year-old Nicolas Chavez, who had already been shot and was bleeding, kneeling on the ground and grabbing a stun gun that had been dropped when the four officers shot him.Acevedo said although Chavez had picked up the stun gun, the officers had plenty of time to back up and take cover. Investigators later determined the stun gun Chavez grabbed was empty as both of its cartridges had been discharged. The officers indicated they weren’t aware it was empty at the time of the shooting, Acevedo said.Chavez was already injured, having been hit by gunfire earlier in his standoff with police. Officers had also fired bean bag rounds and stun guns at him before he was killed, Acevedo said.“Quite frankly, its inexplicable to me when they had plenty of opportunity to back up and continue to be doing what they were doing for them to stay the line and shoot a man 21 times,” Acevedo said. “I cannot defend that.” Acevedo said Chavez was not a threat to the 28 officers who were at the scene.An autopsy showed that Chavez had 29 total entry and exit wounds, many the result of bullet fragments created when rounds hit the pavement and broke apart. It also showed he had methamphetamine, amphetamine and ethanol in his system.Leaders with the Houston Police Officers’ Union denounced the firings, saying the officers followed their training and tried to de-escalate the situation but were forced to shoot Chavez when he pointed the stun gun at them.“It was clear ... these officers did not want to shoot Mr. Chavez and did everything in their power not to,” said union president Joe Gamaldi.Leantha Chavez, Nicolas Chavez’s mother, said she was pleased that the officers had been fired.“However, it doesn’t change how my heart feels. It’s very hard to be happy and sad about something so tragic,” she said. “Now it’s time to move on to the next step, which is charging them.”Leantha Chavez has been one of many people who attended protests earlier this year calling on authorities to take action in her son’s shooting.His shooting is still being investigated by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office and was set to later be presented to a grand jury.“I met with the mother, father and wife of Nicolas Chavez to listen to their concerns and personally assure them that our Civil Rights Division prosecutors will conduct a thorough, independent review of all the evidence in his death,” Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement.Those fired were identified as: Officer Patrick Rubio, who had been with the department since May 2018; Officer Luis Alvarado, with the department since March 2019; Officer Omar Tapia, with the department since March 2019; and Sgt. Benjamin LeBlanc, with the department since October 2008.Before body camera footage was released on Thursday, cellphone video of the shooting taken by a bystander had been circulated widely online in the week after the April 21 shooting.Chavez’s shooting followed a 15-minute confrontation with police. Officers were responding to a call about a possibly suicidal man who was running in and out of traffic.Chavez’s family has said he had a history of mental illness.In a video presentation of the body camera footage that was narrated by Acevedo, portions of 911 calls made the night of Chavez’s shooting can be heard where callers tell operators that a man is running around and “having a mental breakdown.”In the video footage, officers can be heard telling Chavez, “Hey buddy, hey bud, we’re here to help you, man” and “just relax. No one is shooting” and “we’re trying to help you man.”Chavez, who can be heard cursing at officers, could be seen wildly flailing his arms and legs. Officers fired bean bag rounds from shotguns at Chavez and deployed their stun guns, but it had little affect on him.At one point in the video, an officer said Chavez had a knife. Officers told him to put it down. Investigators later determined that Chavez had a piece of metal that he used to cut himself.Before Chavez was fatally shot, two officers had fired three times at him when Chavez had come toward officers, injuring him. Acevedo said those discharges of officer weapons were justified.“The action being taken today does say in our city, we hold everyone accountable,” said Mayor Sylvester Turner.Gamaldi said the fired officers used every non-lethal option available to them to subdue Chavez, but that he refused to surrender.“These officers were distraught over having to take a life out there,” said Doug Griffith, the union’s first vice president.While Griffith said the shooting was found to be justified by the city’s independent police oversight board, Acevedo disputed that claim. Acevedo declined to comment further, citing confidentiality.Chavez’s shooting took place about a month before George Floyd died in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd’s death sparked protests worldwide, including in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, against racial injustice and police brutality.The police union suggested the firings in Chavez’s case were the result of political pressure following the marches for police reform.Chavez’s death was the first of six fatal shootings involving Houston police over several weeks in April and May.Activists in Houston had earlier called on Acevedo to release body camera footage from Chavez’s shooting as well as the other recent ones.___Follow Juan A.

11-09-2020||World||US President Trump says Kim Jong Un is in great health||US president Donald Trump on Thursday said that no one should underestimate the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he is in good health.Trump wrote in a tweet, “Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!”Several media outlets had reported in the months of April and May, that the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had undergone a heart surgery and speculations arose regarding his health. There were reports that his sister Kim Yo Jong was being prepped for taking his position. Kim made two appearances in the public after these reports had surfaced but speculations regarding his health remain. Trump posted several tweets after excerpts from Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’ came out in the public. The book is a sequel to ‘Fear: Trump in the White House’. Woodward’s book revealed that Trump believed that when he met Kim Jong Un for the summit, he lent legitimacy to the North Korean autocratic leader, according to a report by the Associated Press. Trump also believes that intelligence officials have wrongly assessed that Pyongyang would never give up its nuclear weapons. “It takes me two days. I met... I gave up nothing, they just can’t sell it,” US president told Bob Woodward during an interview. The book also highlights how Kim Jong Un gave a graphical account to Trump about how he got his uncle killed.US president Donald Trump has come under huge criticism after the book revealed that he downplayed the effects of coronavirus. The revelations have come out in the public eight weeks before United States goes into polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-says-north-korean-dictator-is-in-great-health/story-F1CoeilGiM9Y986QrNqAuO.html
11-09-2020||World||Pakistan foments ‘culture of violence’ at home, across its borders: India at United Nations||Hitting out at Pakistan, India has said the country foments a “culture of violence” at home and across its borders and its “deplorable” human rights records and discriminatory treatment of religious minorities is a cause of “persistent concern” for the global community. “Unfortunately, we have witnessed another attempt by the delegation of Pakistan to exploit a UN platform for hate speech against India,” Counsellor in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN, Paulomi Tripathi, said on Thursday at the high-level forum on the ‘Culture of Peace’ at the 74th United Nations General Assembly. “This happens at a time when Pakistan continues to foment a culture of violence at home and across its borders,” Tripathi said. India’s strong rebuke came as Pakistan’s UN envoy Munir Akram made references to Jammu and Kashmir, the Babri Masjid demolition and construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya during his remarks to the virtual forum on ‘Culture of Peace.’ “Pakistan’s deplorable human rights records and discriminatory treatment of religious and ethnic minorities is a cause of persistent concern for the international community,” Tripathi said. “Blasphemy laws are used against religious minorities such as Hindus, Christians and Sikhs, to violate their human rights and dignity,” she said, adding that women and girls remain particularly vulnerable in Pakistan as they are abducted, raped, forcefully converted and married to their violators. The pandemic has only aggravated the situation, she said. “Talk of ‘culture of peace’ from the delegation of Pakistan is nothing but a decoy to divert attention from their own shameful records. Before making absurd allegations against India, where equal rights of people of all faiths are guaranteed by the constitution, the delegation of Pakistan must do itself a favour of looking at their own system and records of protecting minorities,” Tripathi said. The Indian diplomat emphasised that a culture of peace does not merely signify absence of war but embodies a predisposition towards resolving differences through dialogue and understanding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-foments-culture-of-violence-at-home-across-its-borders-india-at-united-nations/story-r7GQ6rrXLwMiZjcJytlxuK.html
11-09-2020||World||US remembers 9/11 as coronavirus pandemic alters tribute traditions||Americans are commemorating 9/11 with tributes that have been altered by coronavirus precautions and woven into the presidential campaign, drawing both President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden to pay respects at the same memorial without crossing paths.In New York, a dispute over coronavirus-safety precautions is leading to split-screen remembrances Friday, one at the September 11 memorial plaza at the World Trade Center and another on a nearby corner. The Pentagon’s observance will be so restricted that not even victims’ families can attend, though small groups can visit the memorial there later in the day.Trump and Biden are both headed — at different times — to the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.Trump is speaking at the morning ceremony, the White House said. Biden plans to pay respects there in the afternoon after attending the observance at the 9/11 memorial in New York.Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is also due at ground zero — and then at the alternate ceremony a few blocks away.In short, the anniversary of 9/11 is a complicated occasion in a maelstrom of a year, as the U.S. grapples with a health crisis, searches its soul over racial injustice and prepares to choose a leader to chart a path forward.Still, 9/11 families say it’s important for the nation to pause and remember the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the trade center, at the Pentagon and near Shanksville on September 11, 2001, shaping American policy, perceptions of safety and daily life in places from airports to office buildings.“I know that the heart of America beats on 9/11 and, of course, thinks about that tragic day. I don’t think that people forget,” says Anthoula Katsimatides, who lost her brother John and is now on the board of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum.Friday will mark Trump’s second time observing the 9/11 anniversary at the Flight 93 memorial, where he made remarks in 2018. Biden spoke at the memorial’s dedication in 2011, when he was vice president.The ground zero ceremony in New York has a longstanding custom of not allowing politicians to speak, though they can attend. Biden did so as vice president in 2010, and Trump as a candidate in 2016.Though the candidates will be focused on the commemorations, the political significance of their focus on Shanksville is hard to ignore: Pennsylvania is a must-win state for both. Trump won it by less than a percentage point in 2016.Around the country, some communities have canceled 9/11 commemorations because of the pandemic, while others are going ahead, sometimes with modifications.The New York memorial is changing one of its ceremony’s central traditions: having relatives read the names of the dead, often adding poignant tributes.Thousands of family members are still invited. But they’ll hear a recording of the names from speakers spread around the vast plaza, a plan that memorial leaders felt would avoid close contact at a stage but still allow families to remember their loved ones at the place where they died.But some victims’ relatives felt the change robbed the observance of its emotional impact. A different 9/11-related group, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, set up its own, simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying there’s no reason that people can’t recite names while keeping a safe distance.The two organizations also tussled over the Tribute in Light, a pair of powerful beams that shine into the night sky near the trade center and evoke its fallen twin towers. The 9/11 memorial initially canceled the display, citing virus-safety concerns for the installation crew. After the Tunnel to Towers Foundation vowed to put up the lights instead, the memorial changed course with help from its chairman, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Tunnel to Towers, meanwhile, arranged to display single beams for the first time at the Shanksville memorial and the Pentagon.Over the years, the anniversary also has become a day for volunteering. Because of the pandemic, the 9/11 National Day of Service and Remembrance organization is encouraging people this year to make donations or take other actions that can be accomplished at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-remembers-9-11-as-coronavirus-pandemic-alters-tribute-traditions/story-VTkG257CMUwyp3ldqGUrhP.html
11-09-2020||World||North Korea issues shoot-to-kill orders to prevent coronavirus: US||North Korean authorities have issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the coronavirus entering the country from China, according to the commander of US forces in the South.The impoverished North -- whose crumbling health system would struggle to cope with a major virus outbreak -- has not confirmed a single case of the disease that has swept the world since first emerging in China, the North’s key ally.Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent contamination, and in July state media said it had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level.US Forces Korea (USFK) commander Robert Abrams said that the border shutdown had increased demand for smuggled goods, prompting authorities to intervene.The North introduced a new “buffer zone, one or two kilometers up on the Chinese border,” Abrams told an online conference organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington on Thursday.“They’ve got North Korean SOF (Special Operations Forces) out there. ... Strike forces, they’ve got shoot-to-kill orders in place.”The border closure had effectively “accelerated the effects” of economic sanctions imposed on the North over its nuclear programs, he added, with imports from China plunging 85 percent.The isolated country is also grappling with the aftermath of Typhoon Maysak, with its state media reporting more than 2,000 houses have been destroyed or inundated.As a result, Abrams did not expect to see any major provocations from Pyongyang in the near future, although he said it might show off a new weapons system at next month’s celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Kim Jong Un’s ruling party.“The regime right now -- the military -- is focused principally on getting their country recovered and to help mitigate the risk of Covid-19,” he said. “We’re not seeing any indications right now of any sort of lashing out.”But CSIS published on its website a satellite image of North Korea’s Sinpo South naval shipyard, which its experts believe shows activity that could indicate preparations for a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.A new North Korean missile test would be yet another sign of the lack of progress in denuclearization talks between the US and Pyongyang, which have been stalled despite multiple meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump.Trump, who is seeking reelection in November, was the first sitting US leader to meet a member of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled North Korea since its founding.On Thursday, Trump tweeted, without further explanation: “Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-issues-shoot-to-kill-orders-to-prevent-coronavirus-us/story-RDeiVEMZK746aHnqH3mdCN.html

11-09-2020||World||Trump says US has incredible N-weapons; denies reports of leaking classified info on them||President Donald Trump has said the US has some “incredible” nuclear weapon systems that nobody knows about but refuted allegations of leaking classified information about them to a renowned investigative journalist in his upcoming book. Penned by American journalist Bob Woodward, the book ‘Rage’ to be launched on September 15 has stirred several controversies around Trump’s presidency, weeks before the US election to be held on November 3. According to the excerpts of the book released by The Washington Post, Trump during an interview with Woodward said, “I have built a nuclear -- a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping have never heard about before. There’s nobody -- what we have is incredible.” “Woodward writes that anonymous people later confirmed that the US military had a secret new weapons system, but they would not provide details, and that the people were surprised Trump had disclosed it,” The Washington Post said. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump denied having talked about classified information about US nuclear weapons. “We have great weaponry. No, I’m not talking about classified (information). I’m talking about what we build. We’re building great weaponry,” the president said when asked if he shared classified information about a nuclear weapons system with Woodward. “What were you talking about when you talked about that?” Trump was asked. “Our military is stronger now than it’s ever been. We spent USD 2.5 trillion on our military over the last three-and-a-half years. We now have new rockets and missiles. And, frankly, our nuclear -- we have to hope to God we never have to use it -- but our nuclear now is in the best shape it’s been in decades,” he asserted. Trump told reporters the US has some nuclear systems that nobody knows about. “And, frankly, I think I’m better off keeping it that way. We have some incredible systems,” he said. James Acton, co-director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s nuclear policy programme, tweeted that Trump might have been mentioning about a 2017 announcement of a plan to reduce the explosive power of some nuclear warheads on submarine-launched missiles. “The timing was kept secret. My guess is that Trump told Woodward about the first deployment before it was made public. This weapon is usually called the low-yield D5 (because the missile is the Trident D5 sea-launched ballistic missiles). The warhead is the W76-2,” he tweeted on Thursday. “I don’t believe that the US could build an actually new nuclear weapon in secret. Too much money for classified budgets. Too many people involved for it not to leak,” Acton said in another tweet. Meanwhile, addressing a public rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump asserted that he did not leak any information and asserted that he just wanted to inform the people that the US has the greatest weaponry in the world. “I said, we have systems and missiles and rockets and military — we have systems that you’ve never even seen before. (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) has nothing like it. Russian President (Vladimir) Putin has nothing like it. “They (the media) said he may be giving away classified information. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology...I just want to let people know we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There is nobody like the US military,” Trump told the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-us-has-incredible-n-weapons-denies-reports-of-leaking-classified-info-on-them/story-5x59HMcvE4UvuVzK8VIOYP.html
11-09-2020||World||China approves first nasal spray Covid-19 vaccine for trials: Report||China has approved for trials its first nasal spray vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus that has claimed over 904,000 lives and infected more than 27 million people globally, official media here reported on Thursday. China’s only nasal spray vaccine against the coronavirus is expected to start phase I clinical trials in November, and it is recruiting 100 volunteers. It is the only vaccine of its type approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration, the state-run Global Times reported. The vaccine is a collaborative mission between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland that involves researchers from the University of Hong Kong, Xiamen University, and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy. Microbiologist from the University of Hong Kong, Yuen Kwok-yung, said the vaccine stimulates the natural infection pathway of respiratory viruses to activate the immune response. The nasal spray vaccination could generate double protection for vaccine recipients - influenza and the novel coronavirus — if it also contains influenza viruses including H1N1, H3N2 and B, Yuen said, adding that it would take at least another year to finish the three clinical trials. A Beijing-based immunologist told the daily that compared with injections, a nasal spray vaccination is easier to administer and would also be easy to mass-produce and distribute as it adopts the mature influenza vaccine production technology. The nasal spray vaccine uses live attenuated influenza vaccine; the other four technical routes China is using to develop the coronavirus vaccines are inactivated vaccines, adenoviral vector-based vaccines, and DNA and mRNA vaccines. The inactivated vaccine is estimated to be the earliest to be in the market, the report said. The immunologist said the new vaccine may not cause systemic side effects, but side effects may occur in the respiratory system such as asthma and shortness of breath. Ideally, scientists do not expect side effects except for minor nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, Yuen said. It is not yet clear whether immunity generated from nasal spray vaccinations will last longer than for injected vaccines, the report said. China has approved three Covid-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials. It has also authorised emergency usage of Covid-19 vaccines developed by some select domestic companies. “We’ve drawn up a series of plan packages, including medical consent forms, side-effects monitoring plans, rescuing plans, compensation plans, to make sure the emergency use is well regulated and monitored,” Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s coronavirus vaccine development task force told the official media here last month. An emergency use authorisation, which is based on Chinese vaccine management law, allows unapproved vaccine candidates to be used among people who are at high risk of getting infected in a limited period. The Global Times has previously reported that employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) preparing to go abroad and the frontline medics have been offered two choices of domestic inactivated vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm for urgent use. The novel coronavirus, which originated from China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has claimed 904,485 lives and infected 27,902,002 globally. The US is the worst affected country with 190,887 deaths and 6,363,729 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-first-nasal-spray-covid-19-vaccine-for-trials-report/story-5z8MMpZzAd1GYD1JdRyo2O.html
11-09-2020||World||At least nine killed as scores of wildfires scorch US West Coast||Dozens of extreme wind-driven wildfires burned through forests and towns in US West Coast states on Thursday, destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least nine people, authorities said.In the past 48 hours, four people died from fires in California, while four were killed in Oregon and a 1-year-old boy died in Washington state, police reported. Thousands faced evacuation orders in the three states.Oregon bore the brunt of nearly 100 major wildfires ripping across the western states, with around 3,000 firefighters battling nearly three dozen blazes.Police have opened a criminal investigation into at least one Oregon blaze, the Almeda Fire that started in Ashland near the border with California, Ashland Police Chief Tighe O’Meara said.O’Meara said investigators were treating the origins of the Almeda fire as suspicious. “We have good reason to believe that there was a human element to it. so we’re going to pursue it as a criminal investigation until we have reason to believe that it was otherwise.”Police in Medford as well as in Douglas County to the north cautioned against rumors left-wing anti-fascists and right-wing Proud Boy arsonists were starting the fires. The Oregon blazes tore through at least five communities in the Cascade mountain range as well as areas of coastal rainforest normally spared from wildfires. In eastern Washington state a fire destroyed most of the farming town of Malden.In central Oregon search and rescue teams entered torched communities like Detroit where firefighters led residents on a dramatic mountain escape after military helicopters were unable to evacuate the town.A 12-year-old boy was found dead with his dog inside a burned car and his grandmother was believed to have succumbed after flames engulfed an area near Lyons, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Portland, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said.To the south, a Reuters photographer saw small communities near Medford, including Bear Lake Estates, reduced to ashes as he drove south on Interstate 5 towards Ashland. Some people counted their blessings after fleeing the Bear Creek trailer park where nearly every house burned.“Thank God we were at home,” said Julio Flores, a resident of the community who escaped with two children who would have been alone had his restaurant working hours not been cut due to the coronavirus pandemic.Firefighters said unusually hot, dry winds out of the east supercharged blazes, spreading flames from community to community, and then from house to house.“When it really gets windy these embers are going for miles,” said Firefighter Andy Cardinal in Eagle Point, north of Medford where the town of around 10,000 was on standby to evacuate.Oregon Governor Kate Brown said up to 40,000 people had evacuated across the state where 900,000 acres had burned, dwarfing Oregon’s average 500,000 acre full-year total.“We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,” Brown told a news conference. “We are feeling the acute impacts of climate change.”Climate scientists say global warming has contributed to greater extremes in wet and dry seasons, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out in the U.S. West, leaving more abundant, volatile fuel when fires.Firefighters expected two of Oregon’s largest fires, burning around 24 miles southeast of downtown Portland, to merge. Nearby Molalla, with about 10,000 residents was evacuated, and Canby, a community of 18,000 around 10 miles from central Portland, was told to be ready to leave.Asked by a reporter whether Portland metro areas might be evacuated, Chief Deputy State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz Temple said she discussed such a possibility with local authorities and everything would depend on wind direction and force. CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON FIRES In California, officials said some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders while crews battled 29 major fires across portions of the most populous U.S. state.About a third of those evacuees were displaced in Butte County alone, north of the capital Sacramento, where the North Complex wildfire has scorched more than 247,000 acres and destroyed over 2,000 homes and structures.The remains of three victims were found in two separate locations of that fire zone, according to Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, bringing the total death toll from this summer’s devastating spate of California wildfires to at least 11.Another person died in Siskiyou County in Northern California, state fire authority Cal Fire reported, providing no further details.Wildfires have now burned over 3.1 million acres in California in 2020, marking a record for any year, with six of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history occurring in 2020. In Washington, a man and a woman were in critical condition with burns after their 1-year-old son died as they tried to escape the state’s largest wildfire burning in mountains about 100 miles northwest of Spokane, the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

11-09-2020||World||Trump administration considers postponing refugee admissions: Report||US officials are weighing whether to postpone or further cut refugee admissions in the coming year amid legal fights over President Donald Trump’s refugee policy and uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a senior official said.The possible postponement - one of several options under discussion - would mean some or all refugee admissions could be frozen until a legal challenge to a 2019 Trump order on refugees is resolved “with some greater degree of finality,” the official told Reuters. It is not clear when that lawsuit may be resolved, especially if the case goes all the way to the US Supreme Court, a process that could take months or even longer. The president typically sets yearly refugee levels around the beginning of each fiscal year and the Trump administration has not yet announced its plans for fiscal 2021, which begins on Oct. 1. The refugee cap was cut to 18,000 this year, the lowest level since the modern-day program began in 1980. So far, roughly half that many refugees have been let in as increased vetting and the coronavirus pandemic have slowed arrivals. The senior official said that even if 2021 admissions are not delayed, next year’s cap could be cut below current levels.“The arc of this administration’s refugee policy is going to continue,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the ongoing deliberations.Trump and his top officials have said refugees could pose threats to national security and that resettlement should take place closer to countries of origin. The administration also contends that refugee resettlement can be costly for local communities, although refugee backers reject those arguments.The possible moves remain under discussion and no final decision has been reached, the official stressed. Democratic challenger Joe Biden has pledged to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 per year if he defeats Trump in November. However, Biden has not said how quickly he would raise the cap and advocates say the program could take years to recover after Trump-era reductions.If he wins, Biden could seek to raise the cap soon after taking office, just as Trump moved to halve refugee admissions in early 2017. But refugee groups say that restoring the pipeline of travel-ready refugees and rebuilding the organizations that receive them in the United States will take months or years as refugees will need to undergo renewed security and medical checks and shuttered resettlement offices will need to reopen.Trump, who is seeking another four-year term on Nov. 3, has made his immigration crackdown a focus of the presidency and 2020 campaign. In addition to greatly reducing refugee admissions to the United States, Trump also issued an executive order in September 2019 that required state and local elected officials to consent to receive refugees, saying it would better ensure refugees were sent to areas with adequate resources to receive them. In January, a Maryland-based US district judge blocked the order from taking effect, prompting Trump administration officials to consider a possible “deferral” of refugee admissions until the court case is resolved, the senior official said. The administration’s refugee cap discussions involve officials from the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and have been coordinated by the White House National Security Council, according to the senior official, who declined to provide the names of those involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-considers-postponing-refugee-admissions-report/story-pHisWxtynWhbXKVI6rb3fI.html

Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent. Moscow has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny, 44, was poisoned.“We urge Russia to cooperate fully with the international community’s investigation,” Norman-Chalet told the council.   ”Wherever the evidence leads, we will work with allies and the international community to hold perpetrators accountable, including through restricting  funds for  malign activities.”Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to know what happened to Navalny but that Russian authorities did not have any grounds to open an investigation as they did not have any evidence.“Our doctors who, by the way, saved Alexey Navalny did not find any chemical weapon substances in his analyses. The German laboratory claims it did,” he told the Security Council.“But we received no evidence from Germany that would allow us to make a conclusion that it was a crime by attempted poisoning and thus start an investigation,” he added.Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said Berlin was working with the global chemical weapons watchdog - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - on the issue and urged Moscow to do the same.“It’s not a bilateral issue – it’s an issue of international concern (when) chemical agents are used, and therefore, the OPCW will have all the evidence and it would be very good if Russia would work with OPCW,” Heusgen told the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-restrict-funds-for-malign-activities-over-navalny-poisoning/story-Te5fuZSCt26M3WoNywDAsM.html

In a joint statement issued after the 17th meeting of the India-US Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and the third session of the India-US Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10, both sides denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms. The Indian delegation was led by Mahaveer Singhvi, Joint Secretary for Counter Terrorism, Ministry of External Affairs, while the American side was led by Nathan Sales, State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism. The joint statement stated that the meeting was a far-reaching conversation on counterterrorism cooperation, resolving to continue close coordination on this important element of the comprehensive global strategic partnership that exists between the two countries. “The two sides underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot,” the joint statement said. The US side reiterated its support for the people and the government of India in the fight against terrorism. They exchanged views on threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasized the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including al-Qa’ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and Hizb-ul Mujahideen, a media statement said. During the meeting, the two sides also shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions and designations against terrorist groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India. There was a joint commitment to strengthen cooperation on information sharing and other steps to disrupt the ability of international terrorists to travel, consistent with the important provisions and obligations outlined in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2396. Participants of the meeting also highlighted their efforts to address some of the world’s most pressing counter-terrorism challenges, including countering the financing and operations of terrorist organisations, countering radicalisation and terrorist use of the internet, cross-border movement of terrorists and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning terrorist fighters and family members. India and the US also discussed mutual legal and extradition assistance, bilateral law enforcement training and cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urgent-need-for-pakistan-to-take-immediate-irreversible-action-against-terror-groups-indo-us-joint-statement/story-l9CknOi36sHr85zee3ewuK.html
11-09-2020||World||In a year of social distancing, coronavirus alters September 11, too||In a year when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged. The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the September 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, while President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden plan to attend a truncated ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania. In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly cancelled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar sparked a change of heart. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly the 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters. Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to “Never Forget” is fading. “It’s another smack in the face,” says Jim Riches, who lost his son Jimmy, a firefighter. The father is staying home on the anniversary for the first time this year because he doesn’t want to take chances with the coronavirus after a prior illness. But he feels others should have the option of reciting the names of the dead on the memorial plaza, instead of listening to a recording. Memorial leaders said they wanted to avoid close contact among readers, who are usually paired at the podium. But to Riches, a retired fire battalion chief and frequent critic of the memorial organization, the decision sounds like an excuse for sidelining the families’ role in commemorating 9/11. “I wish they wouldn’t forget, but they’re trying to,” he says. But Anthoula Katsimatides sees the differences this year as an effort to ensure victims’ relatives feel comfortable attending - including her mother, who hasn’t left home since March because health issues make her especially worried about the virus. But she is determined to go in honor of her son John, a bond trader, her daughter said. In a year when many events have been called off, “this wasn’t canceled. It’s just been changed in such a way where we still get to pay tribute to our loved ones in a respectful and safe way,” said Katsimatides, who’s on the memorial board. She says the change wasn’t motivated by anything except a public health emergency. “Who expected Covid-19? ... It was completely unforeseen. As was 9/11,” she said. This year’s plans have been a balancing act at the sites where hijacked planes piloted by al-Qaida terrorists crashed on September 11, 2001: New York, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The Flight 93 memorial near Shanksville is trimming its usual 90-minute ceremony, partly by eliminating musical interludes. Memorial spokeswoman Katherine Cordek said the names of the 40 people killed there would be read, but by one person instead of multiple family members. The Pentagon hasn’t yet detailed its plans for the anniversary. In New York - where the nation’s deadliest coronavirus spike early happened this spring but has since been fairly well contained - leaders of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum said their plan for a no-reading ceremony would honor both virus precautions and 9/11 families’ attachment to being at ground zero on the anniversary. But another 9/11-related organization, the Stephen Stiller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, quickly arranged its own simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying victims’ relatives could recite names while keeping a safe distance. “We need to keep letting America know what happened 19 years ago. And they need to see that emotion of the day, not a recording,” says chairman Frank Siller. He says he may attend both observances to honor the brother he lost, firefighter Stephen. Meanwhile, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told current firefighters in a memo last month that the department “strongly recommends” members not participate in 9/11 observances. The department did hold a limited-attendance ceremony Wednesday to add names to a memorial wall recognising members who died after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage. Tensions over anniversary plans flared anew when the memorial announced last month it was nixing the Tribute in Light, twin blue beams that shine into the night sky over lower Manhattan. While there’s no official gathering to view the lights, the memorial cited virus risks to the installation crew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-year-of-social-distancing-coronavirus-alters-september-11-too/story-FlG26CV5yJnJs1BcYdz2gO.html

AstraZeneca had to pause their vaccine trials as a woman developed severe neurological symptoms, the drugmaker told news agencies on Thursday.The Drug Controller General of India asked Serum Institute of India to cite reasons on why they had failed to inform of the casualty analysis of the “reported serious adverse events”. The latter said that the trials were ongoing and they were adhering to the DCGI’s safety concerns. Coronavirus has affected more than 28 million people worldwide. More than 900,000 people have died. India has reported more than 90,000 cases and currently is close to reporting at least 100,000 cases per day. Here are the latest developments on the coronavirus vaccine: • The US Food and Drug Administration’s office has said on Thursday that the emergency authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine will have to meet a higher standard of efficacy than what would normally be required for such clearance. • The Bolsonaro-led Brazil government is yet to decide whether to join the COVAX Facility - the worldwide vaccine allocation plan led by the World Health Organisation (WHO). COVAX aims to procure and deliver 2 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2021. The deadline for Brazil to join the WHO-led initiative ends on September 18. • WHO has called the recent halting of the coronavirus vaccine tests of Astrazeneca a ‘wake-up call’. World Health Organization’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said that the global community needs to realize that “there are ups and downs in research.”• Turkey’s health minister Fahrettin Koca said that the nation’s health ministry will decide next week whether to conduct the Phase III testing of Russia’s coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V. “Our vaccine science team will have made its evaluation on the issue in the coming days. We may probably allow Phase III work for the vaccine in Russia next week,” he said while speaking to Reuters.• The Brazilian state of Bahia has signed a confidentiality agreement on Tuesday to undertake the trials of the Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and shall receive 500 doses as soon as Anvisa, Brazil’s health regulator, approves the testing protocols. Governor Rui Costa told Reuters that Brazil will also buy 50 million doses of the vaccine and plans to commit to that decision within Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-turkey-plan-to-conduct-phase-iii-trials-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-the-latest-on-coronavirus-vaccine/story-lNO2tTLRpnZ5c6RkDKtkuO.html
11-09-2020||World||‘I hope I don’t take the bait’ in debate with Donald Trump: Joe Biden||Joe Biden has said he’d “beat the hell out of” President Donald Trump over his comments about women if they were in high school. But on the debate stage, as opponents for the presidency, it’s a different story.When Biden and Trump meet in their first presidential debate later this month, Biden says he has one goal: “I hope I don’t take the bait.”“I hope I don’t get baited into a brawl with this guy, because that’s the only place he’s comfortable,” Biden said Thursday during a fundraiser.His comments offer a hint at how the former vice president is looking at the upcoming debate on September 29, in Cleveland, Ohio. Biden has previously said he plans to be a “fact checker” on the debate stage, and hold Trump accountable for any misstatements or falsehoods. But on Thursday night, Biden said that “people know what a liar” Trump is.“This is a guy who is absolutely tasteless. Completely tasteless. So pointing it out doesn’t do much,” he said.But Biden acknowledged that he expects the president to “say awful things about me and my family” during the debate to try to get a rise out of him — and the debate is almost certain to feature clashes about the two candidates’ families, as such attacks have been central themes that have already played out on the campaign trail.The Trump campaign in particular has targeted Biden’s son Hunter for his ties to Chinese and Ukranian companies. And Biden has grown visibly angry at events in recent days about Trump’s reported comments calling fallen Marines “suckers” and “losers,” speaking about his son Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015. And Democrats often criticize Trump for the use of his children in government positions and policy negotiations, as well as the financial benefit his family’s business has seen from the presidency.While Biden said he doesn’t want to get baited by Trump, he did express confidence that “I know how to handle bullies.”But Biden suggested his strategy in the debate will be focused more on drawing a contrast with Trump on competency and policy, and offering Americans an alternative to the Trump presidency.“The place he is most uncomfortable is on the facts. The place he’s most uncomfortable is in the area of what he’s going to do. The place he’s most uncomfortable is knowing the policy. He’s one of the most ill-informed presidents substantively that I’ve ever worked with,” Biden said.Biden added: “Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. I plan to tell them who I am.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-hope-i-don-t-take-the-bait-in-debate-with-donald-trump-joe-biden/story-zg2vVRKLBeAWtixNJiJaCN.html

The deadline is Sept. 18.One part of ACT, short for Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), is the COVAX Facility that aims to help buy and fairly distribute vaccine shots when they become available.More than 70 nations have so far committed to joining, agreeing to procure Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX for their populations. The United States said last week that it would not join because the Trump administration objects to WHO involvement.COVAX’s aim is to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021. It has nine Covid-19 vaccine candidates in its portfolio that employ a range of different technologies and scientific approaches.Brazil has registered more than 4.2 million novel coronavirus cases, the worst outbreak after the United States and India. The death toll stands at 129,522.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-still-mulling-whether-to-join-covax-vaccine-allocation-plan/story-xJhkGvteEOT5xrQ77zUvTI.html
11-09-2020||World||NASA sets out to buy moon resources mined by private companies||NASA on Thursday launched an effort to pay companies to mine resources on the moon, announcing it would buy from them rocks, dirt and other lunar materials as the US space agency seeks to spur private extraction of coveted off-world resources for its use.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote in a blog post accompanying the announcement that the plans would not violate a 1967 treaty that holds that celestial bodies and space are exempt from national claims of ownership.The initiative, targeting companies that plan to send robots to mine lunar resources, is part of NASA’s goal of setting what Bridenstine called “norms of behavior” in space and allowing private mining on the moon in ways that could help sustain future astronaut missions. NASA said it views the mined resources as the property of the company, and the materials would become “the sole property of NASA” after purchase.Under NASA’s Artemis program, President Donald Trump’s administration envisions a return of American astronauts to the moon by 2024. NASA has cast such as mission as a precursor to a future first human voyage to Mars.“The bottom line is we are going to buy some lunar soil for the purpose of it demonstrating that it can be done,” Bridenstine said during an event hosted by the Secure World Foundation, a space policy organization.Bridenstine said NASA eventually would buy more types of resources such as ice and other materials that may be discovered on the moon.NASA in May set the stage for a global debate over the basic principles governing how people will live and work on the moon, releasing the main tenets of what it hopes will become an international pact for moon exploration called the Artemis Accords. This would permit companies to own the lunar resources they mine, a crucial element in allowing NASA contractors to convert the moon’s water ice for rocket fuel or mine lunar minerals to construct landing pads.Under the initiative disclosed on Thursday, NASA offered to purchase limited amounts of lunar resources and asked companies to offer proposals. Under contracts whose terms would vary, a company mining on the moon would collect lunar rocks or dirt to sell to NASA without having to bring the resources back to Earth.“This is one small step for space resources, but a giant leap for policy and precedent,” Mike Gold, NASA’s chief of international relations, told Reuters.“They are paying the company to sell them a rock that the company owns. That’s the product,” Joanne Gabrynowicz, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Space Law, said in an interview. “A company has to decide for itself if it’s worth taking the financial and technological risk to do this to sell a rock.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sets-out-to-buy-moon-resources-mined-by-private-companies/story-PgHXjp9yNtzfajggljyDLP.html
11-09-2020||World||Russia, China hackers boost election attacks, says Microsoft||Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers have stepped up efforts to disrupt the US election by targeting the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a Microsoft Corp. investigation found.Cyber-attacks have also been aimed at political parties, advocacy groups, academics and leaders in the international affairs community, according to a blog post Thursday from Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft.SKDKnickerbocker, a public affairs and political consulting firm working with Biden’s campaign, was also recently targeted in an unsuccessful hack by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which said that Microsoft had alerted the firm.The attempted hack on SKDKnickerbocker reflects a broader trend documented by Microsoft: that a Russia-based group had attacked “political campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants.”Attempts by foreign adversaries to disrupt the Nov. 3 presidential election echo the efforts by Russia in 2016 to meddle in the campaign on Trump’s behalf. The president is trailing Biden in the 2020 race by more than 7 percentage points in a national average of polls.The findings emerged hours after the US sanctioned Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Trump’s personal lawyer last year, alleging he’s a Russian agent trying to influence the 2020 election.Microsoft’s report also came a day after a Homeland Security Department official alleged that Trump administration appointees suppressed intelligence on Russian election interference while promoting China as the prime threat.Microsoft reported that about 200 organizations directly or indirectly tied to the US election and political organizations in Europe were affected by a Russian-operated group, called Strontium, including US-based consultants serving Republicans and Democrats. The same group was also identified in the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as being responsible for the attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016, according to Microsoft. Strontium is also known as APT28, or Fancy Bear.Microsoft also reported unsuccessful cyber-attacks from Iran on people associated with the Trump campaign, and attempted attacks from China on people associated with the Biden campaign, as well as a “prominent” individual formerly associated with the Trump administration. The people who were targeted weren’t named.The Chinese group, referred to as Zirconium, has mounted thousands of attacks from March through September on campaign officials as well as prominent academics and others in international affairs. Of those attempts, about 150 were successful breaches, but Microsoft didn’t identify the victims other than to say they weren’t associated with the presidential campaigns.According to John Hultquist, who serves as the senior director of analysis at cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc.’s Mandiant, the recent Russian activity poses the greatest threat to the election. “It’s likely Iranian and Chinese actors targeted US campaigns to quietly collect intelligence, but APT28’s unique history raises the prospect of follow-on information operations or other devastating activity,” he said.Microsoft’s findings echo those of US government officials.“Our adversaries are continuously looking for vulnerable US networks to exploit, and networks associated with political organizations and campaigns are no exception,” the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on Thursday.In August, William Evanina, head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said Russia, China and Iran are trying to “use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway US voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift US policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people’s confidence in our democratic process.” And on Wednesday, Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said “the governments of China, Iran and Russia target our election systems, each with its own separate and nefarious motives and tactics.”“Protecting our elections is a team effort with the federal government and the private sector joining together to thwart foreign malign actors,” Wolf said in a Thursday statement about the Microsoft findings.‘Stepped up’The recent attacks reveal that “foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election,” according to Microsoft. “What we’ve seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those who they consult on key issues.”The majority of attacks were detected and stopped by security tools built into Microsoft’s software, Burt said.Foreign groups used tactics including rotating IP addresses to disguise attacks, web bugs planted in purchased domain names and phishing, in an effort to harvest login credentials and gain information on targeted individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks can be for routine espionage against campaigns or, in some cases, to conduct hack and leak operations -- a key feature in Russia’s campaign to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.Disinformation experts are on high alert for strategic leaks of real or fabricated documents in the weeks ahead of election day, as a foreign influence tactic that could significantly harm a candidate’s chances, particularly if there isn’t enough time for them to adequately respond.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released public guidance for combating email attacks related the election. “CISA strongly recommends elections-related individuals and organizations to prioritize the protection of email accounts and systems,” the agency said.“We disclose attacks like these because we believe it’s important the world knows about threats to democratic processes,” Microsoft’s Burt said. He also said more federal funding is needed in the US so states can better protect their election infrastructure.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement Thursday that the “private sector plays a crucial role” in safeguarding elections and national security. “We welcome their assistance and will continue partnering with them to combat foreign efforts to target political candidates, campaigns and others involved in the US elections,” according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-hackers-boost-election-attacks-says-microsoft/story-1L3XGrGqz2w40tybEIECDN.html
11-09-2020||World||Taliban say peace talks with Afghan team to start Saturday||The long-awaited peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government’s negotiating team are to begin on Saturday in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, the Taliban and Qatar’s foreign ministry said Thursday.The talks — known as intra-Afghan negotiations — were laid out in a peace deal that Washington brokered with the Taliban and signed in February, also in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. At the time, the deal was seen as Afghanistan’s best chance at ending more than four decades of relentless war.Shortly after the announcement, President Donald Trump said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would travel to Qatar, to attend the start of the negotiations. Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, confirmed in a tweet that their delegation will be in Qatar’s capital of Doha for the talks and said the president wished the negotiating team success.Pompeo issued a statement welcoming the start of negotiations and saying they will mark “a historic opportunity for Afghanistan to bring an end to four decades of war and bloodshed.”“The people of Afghanistan have carried the burden of war for too long,” Pompeo said.That deal Washington signed with the Taliban aims to end Afghanistan’s protracted war and bring American troops home while the intra-Afghan talks are to set a road map for a post-war society in Afghanistan.The negotiations are expected to be a difficult process as the two sides struggle to end the fighting and debate ways of protecting the rights of women and minorities. The Taliban have promised women could attend school, work and participate in politics but stressed that would all be allowed in keeping with Islamic principles — without saying what that might mean.The Taliban have also said they would not support a woman becoming president of Afghanistan and that while they would allow for women to judges, a woman could not serve as a chief justice.Meanwhile, Kabul’s reconciliation council has an array of disparate figures, including hard-liners such as Abdul Rasool Sayyaf, a former warlord who served as the inspiration for the Philippine’s Abu Sayyaf militant group, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a one-time U.N.-listed terrorist. Both espouse deeply restrictive interpretations of Islam.Hekmatyar in an earlier interview with The Associated Press also rejected women serving as chief justice. Afghanistan’s Parliament has so far been unable to ratify a Violence Against Women’s bill because it is feared that hard-line lawmakers would defeat any such legislation.The government’s negotiation team includes several women who will carry a heavy burden to defend and protect rights for their gender, analysts say. The Taliban have no women on their team.The fate of the tens of thousands of armed Taliban, as well as militias loyal to government-allied warlords, will also be on the agenda, along with constitutional changes for Afghanistan.There’s also the issue of power sharing. While the Taliban have said they do not want to monopolize power, the suggestion of an interim administration has largely been rejected by Kabul. Deep mistrust also exists on both sidesWashington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who negotiated the US-Taliban deal signed on Feb. 29, has been in Doha for the past week, trying to push the talks forward.The withdrawal of US troops are not dependent on the success of the upcoming negotiations but rather on commitments taken by the Taliban under the deal with the US to fight other militant groups, most specifically the Islamic State group, and to ensure that Afghanistan is not used as a staging ground for attacks on the United States or its allies.Washington and NATO have already begun withdrawing troops and by November America expects to have less than 5,000 troops still in Afghanistan.The start of negotiations had been plagued by delays as the two sides squabbled for months over the release of prisoners until the exchange was complete earlier this month — 5,000 Taliban freed by the Afghan government and 1,000 government and military personnel who were released by the Taliban. The prisoner release was also set in the US-Taliban deal as a prerequisite for the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations.However, the negotiations will begin under difficult circumstances, marred by stepped up attacks on Afghan forces by the Taliban, target killings and attempted assassinations. Scores of civilians have died in the crossfire. There have also been attacks on released Taliban prisoners returning to their homes and accusations by the insurgents of being attacked inside their homes with their families.Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, the body that is overseeing the negotiations on behalf of the government, will attend the opening of the talks but the day-to-day negotiations will be carried out by a team headed by Mohammed Masoom Stanikzai, a former intelligence chief.Abdullah was appointed head the council as part of a power-sharing agreement with Ghani to end a political standoff between the two following last year’s controversial presidential elections. The country’s election commission declared Ghani the winner while Abdullah claimed he had won and went on to self-declare himself president.The impasse lasted for months — also delaying the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations — before the US negotiated a power-sharing deal under which Abdullah joined the government.The Taliban’s 21-member negotiation team is headed by their chief justice Abdul Hakim and includes 13 members of the insurgent’s leadership council.Pompeo in his statement warned both sides against squandering this opportunity to hammer out a negotiated end to the fighting.“This opportunity must not be squandered,” Pompeo said. “Immense sacrifice and investment by the United States, our partners, and the people of Afghanistan have made this moment of hope possible. I urge the negotiators to demonstrate the pragmatism, restraint, and flexibility this process will require to succeed. The people of Afghanistan and the international community will be watching closely.”Also Thursday, Trump, who promised in the 2016 presidential campaign to bring US troops home from Afghanistan, announced he has picked William Ruger, vice president for research and policy at the Arlington, Virginia-based Charles Koch Institute, as the next ambassador to Kabul.Picking Ruger, a veteran of the war who advocates withdrawing US forces from the country, is seen as a way for Trump to underscore his desire to do just that.“There are those who would like to see us remain at war in Afghanistan long into the future,” Ruger has said. “But the president should not allow a withdrawal deal to be bogged down by conditions that aren’t necessary for America’s safety.”Trump has a narrow window to get Ruger confirmed by the Senate, which is set to recess in mid-October before the US presidential election in early November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-peace-talks-with-afghan-team-to-start-saturday/story-XwN1GVwnnLRUotDOlQIBeP.html
11-09-2020||World||Questions over Russia vaccine study ‘inconsistencies’||The Lancet medical journal said Thursday it had asked authors of a study on a potential Russian Covid-19 vaccine for clarifications after their research came under scrutiny.Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval.This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous.Russian researchers published their trial findings last week in the Lancet, meaning their research had undergone review from a selection of their peers.Also read: Russia in touch with India over vaccine trials, manufacturingIt said that the vaccine had proven to be “safe and well-tolerated” among a few dozen volunteers.However an open letter signed this week by more than 30 Europe-based experts cast doubt on the findings, pointing towards “potential data inconsistencies”.The researchers identified what they said appeared to be a number of duplications in figures presented and concluded that the data within the study was “highly unlikely” to be correct.The lead study author was quoted Thursday by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency saying he rejected the letter’s claims.A spokeswoman for The Lancet told AFP that they were aware of the open letter.“We have shared the letter directly with the authors and encouraged them to engage in the scientific discussion,” she said.The spokeswoman added that the research had been reviewed by independent experts before publication.The pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.Pharma giant AstraZeneca said this week it was halting Phase 3 trials of its candidate vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, after one volunteer fell ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-over-russia-vaccine-study-inconsistencies/story-7kgaYXvXQL0cfieTC2zaHK.html

The group have attacked Riyadh several times before.“The attacks are a response to the enemy’s permanent escalation and its continuing blockade against our country,” Sarea said in a statement posted on Twitter.He promised more attacks if Saudi Arabia “continues its aggression” against Yemen.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said Houthi forces had launched the missiles and drones at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia, without giving more details.The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and most cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The Western-backed coalition that Saudi Arabia leads intervened to try to restore Hadi to power but the war, which has killed 100,000 people, has been stuck in a stalemate for years.The conflict has led to what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-houthis-say-attacked-important-target-in-riyadh-with-missile-drones/story-hPYu3pu2kS5ZuONjvE7rIP.html

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the government will remove those edicts beginning Monday.The CDC said the current screening, which includes temperature checks and travelers vouching for their health, “has limited effectiveness” because some infected people show no symptoms. The health agency said instead it will focus on other measures including a stronger response to reports of illness at airports, collecting passenger-contact electronically to avoid long lines, and “potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission” of the virus.The extra health screening applies to people who have been in China, Iran, most countries in continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil. Most people coming from those countries who aren’t U.S. citizens have been barred entry to the country.The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-will-end-current-health-screening-of-some-travelers/story-vINuMrXbgzfxboymr1Bv0J.html
11-09-2020||World||What Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’ reveals about US President Donald Trump||American journalist Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’, set to be launched on September 15, has stirred several controversies around the presidency of Donald Trump weeks before US Elections are scheduled to be held in November. The much anticipated book is based on 18 interviews that Woodward conducted with Trump. The journalist was also granted special access to the top officials inside the White House and the book reveals inner workings of the president and his administration.‘Rage’ is the sequel to his 2018 book ‘Fear: Trump in the White House’.Here are a few interesting takeaways from the book:Donald Trump’s equation with the North Korean leader According to an article published in The Washington Post (where Woodward is an editor) containing excerpts of the book, Trump said he was impressed with Kim Jong Un when he first met him in Singapore in 2018 and that Kim was “far beyond smart.”In engaging with nuclear arms talks with Kim, the US President ignored the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) assessments that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons.CIA has “no idea” how to handle Pyongyang, Trump had reportedly told Kim, and the North Korean reportedly described his relationship with Trump as “a fantasy film”.Dismissal of Black Americans’ painWhen asked if the US President, as a white man, had a responsibility to better understand the anger and pain of Black Americans, he said, “No, I don’t feel that at all.”According to Trump, the unemployment rate among Black Americans fell right before the coronavirus pandemic and the systemic racism the journalist was trying to highlight was present everywhere. “I think probably less here than most places. Or less here than many places,” the Trump said. When asked by Woodward whether racism is in the United States in such a way that it affects people’s lives, Trump replied: “I think it is. And it’s unfortunate. But I think it is.” Downplayed the Covid-19 risk“This is deadly stuff,” Trump had told Woodward on February 7. Even as the President told the journalist several times that he was aware of the ‘deadly’ and ‘highly contagious’ nature of coronavirus, he repeatedly downplayed its threat in his public rallies and meetings.Trump revealed that he “played it down” with regard to the severity of Covid-19 to the American people as he “didn’t want to create panic”. “The virus has nothing to do with me. It’s not my fault. It’s -- China let the damn virus out,” CNN quoted Trump in his interaction with the journalist.The President has recently come under fire for not taking the virus threat seriously. Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris in a statement said, “So much of this pain could have been avoided, but President Trump refused to tell the truth or to act to protect the American people. The horrifying toll of Trump’s deadly disinformation and negligence in the lives of grieving families and to our economy is a historic national tragedy.”‘Dangerous’ and ‘unfit’ to be commander in chiefThe book also mentions viewpoints of Trump’s former top national security officials on his presidency. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis, former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are some of them.According to James Mattis, Trump is ‘dangerous’ and ‘unfit’ to be commander in chief. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US administration’s top infectious disease expert, is quoted in the book too. Trump’s leadership is ‘rudderless’ and that his ‘attention span is like a minus number’, he reportedly said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-bob-woodward-s-book-rage-reveals-about-us-president-donald-trump/story-bYeO1SSYC56D3SN0AhqRZJ.html

She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.”Trump said his re-election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, “has now formed an unholy alliance” with the “radical left” through Harris.“You know who’s further left than crazy Bernie?” Trump asked, referring to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. “Kamala,” he said, theatrically stretching out and mispronouncing her name three times in a row.Harris, California’s junior senator and a former attorney general of that state, is the first Black and Indian-American and Black woman on a on a major presidential party ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/us-presidential-election/it-d-be-an-insult-if-harris-became-first-woman-president-says-donald-trump/story-OVQ2EvRAEjLJ3c0il8rEKN.html
11-09-2020||World||Thousands sleep in open after Greek refugee camp burns down||Thousands of refugees and migrants have spent a third night in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos after two consecutive nights of fires in the notoriously overcrowded Moria camp left them homeless.Some awoke Friday after sleeping by the side of the road, having cut down reeds and used salvaged blankets to make rudimentary shelters to protect them from the night-time chill and the scorching day-time sun. Others used tents or had just sleeping bags to protect them from the elements.Greek authorities have said the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday evening were deliberately set by some of the camp’s residents angered by isolation orders issued to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after 35 residents were found to have been infected.The camp had been under a lockdown due to last until mid-September after the first virus case was identified in a Somali man who had been granted asylum and left the camp but later returned to Moria from Athens.“We have spent three days here without eating, without drinking. We are in conditions that are really, really not very good,” Freddy Musamba, a former camp resident from Gambia who denounced the situation in Greece and the conditions under which he had been living.“I want to speak about the European Union, who abandoned us, who left us here like this,” Musamba said. He called for the EU “to come and support us, to not leave us. We are like abandoned children. We have endured things we didn’t know could happen.”Aid organizations have long warned about dire conditions in the camp, which has a capacity of just over 2,750 people but was housing more than 12,500 inside and in a spillover tent city that sprang up in an adjacent olive grove.The situation has led to spiraling tension, both among migrants and refugees inside the camp and with local residents who have long called for Moria to be shut down.Moria houses people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who arrived on the island from the nearby Turkish coast fleeing poverty or conflict in their homeland. Under a 2016 deal between the European Union and Turkey, those arriving on Greek islands would remain there pending either their successful asylum application, or deportation back to Turkey.But a backlog in asylum applications, combined with continued arrivals and few deportations, led to massive overcrowding in Moria and other camps on eastern Aegean islands.The overcrowded camp and its dire conditions have been held up by critics as a symbol of failures in the EU’s migration and refugee policy.“Moria is a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe,” European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, who also handles migration for the 27-nation bloc, said.“The clock has run out on how long Europe can live without a migration policy,” said Schinas, who was in Greece to discuss the Moria fire with Greek officials. The EU’s executive commission plans to present a new “pact for migration and asylum” on Sept. 30, he said.According to Schinas, the pact will foresee agreements with migrants’ countries of origin and transit to persuade people not to embark for Europe, as well a “robust” system to manage the EU’s external borders, including “a new European border and coast guard, with many more staff, boats, instruments and tools.”It will also include “a system of permanent, effective solidarity in shouldering the responsibility of asylum” among EU countries, Schinas said.He said that after the fire that gutted Moria, Greek authorities will have to “set up a new, more modern installation.”“The European Union is ready not only to finance and support the construction of this new facility, but we are ready also to consider any Greek request for a more active role in the management of this new facility,” Schinas said.On Thursday, French President Emanuel Macron announced that France and Germany were in talks to take in some of the children who had been living in Moria.German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Friday that 10 EU countries had agreed to participate in taking in the unaccompanied children from Moria and that talks were ongoing with others.He said Germany and France would take the largest share, “about two-thirds” of the 406 teenagers and children who had been living at the camp without parents or guardians.German officials identified the other countries that would help take in the unaccompanied children as Finland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland.A program was already in place before the fire for several European countries to take in some of the thousands of unaccompanied minors, mostly teenagers, who were staying in refugee and migrant facilities across Greece.The first fire in Moria on Tuesday night left around 3,500 of the camp’s inhabitants homeless, Greece’s migration minister had said. Tents were flown in and a ferry and two navy ships were to provide emergency accommodation. But the remnants of the camp were burned down on Wednesday night, leaving the remaining inhabitants with nowhere to stay.On Wednesday, government spokesman Stelios Petsas stressed that none of the camp’s residents, except for unaccompanied children who had been living there, would be allowed to leave the island. The unaccompanied minors were flown to the mainland and temporarily housed in hotels on Wednesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-sleep-in-open-after-greek-refugee-camp-burns-down/story-LupWQbVBrtKiesevREGzXP.html

The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg”.More than 300 cases have been reported globally in at least 25 countries.Two people have died outside the mainland - one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.The worst-hit central Chinese province reported 2,618 new cases of the NCP on February 9, with 91 new deaths and 356 recovered.The total infection number in the province increased to 29,631, with 871 dead and 1,795 recovered, officials said.The NHC said 6,484 patients remained in severe condition, and 23,589 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.The commission said 399,487 close contacts had been traced, adding that among them, 29,307 were discharged from medical observation Sunday, with 187,518 others still under medical observation.The raging outbreak, first detected in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city, has prompted the government to lock down nealy 15 cities in the province to contain the spread of the virulent virus.China’s new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei province, where the epicentre city of Wuhan is located, has dropped for five consecutive days, the National Health Commission (NHC) said Sunday.A total of 509 new confirmed cases were reported on Saturday outside Hubei, about 42.8 percent lower than the number reported on Monday, said the NHC spokesperson, Mi Feng.The numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 (Monday), 731 (Tuesday), 707 (Wednesday), 696 (Thursday) and 558 (Friday).Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said on Sunday the “stable period” of the outbreak “may reflect the impact of the control measures”.State media reported Monday that China has allocated 71.85 billion yuan (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) of fiscal funds to support the control of the novel coronavirus outbreak.As of 6 pm Saturday, 31.55 billion yuan of the funds were spent, finance minister Liu Kun at a national teleconference on Sunday evening.Meanwhile, WHO chief, Tedros, said though the virus spread outside China appears to be slow but it could accelerate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-kills-nearly-100-in-a-day-in-china-who-says-tip-of-the-iceberg/story-emGqDlWvR6gaaQLzIy2WhO.html
11-09-2020||India||Khalistan push exists only due to Pak backing: Expert||TorontoThe idea of a breakaway Sikh nation is a fantasy that exists only due to the backing of Pakistan to Khalistan extremists, says the author of an explosive report detailing Islamabad’s role in fomenting terrorism in Punjab.Veteran Canadian journalist Terry Milewski, who wrote the report Khalistan: A Project of Pakistan, also asserted that the so-called Referendum 2020 will only be voted on by those who are already separatist elements and thus may result in skewing the outcome.“I believe that without Pakistan they (Khalistanis) wouldn’t have much to live for. It would be all rhetorical, all performative, with no substance,” Milewski told HT in an interview.“This thing isn’t real, it’s just a fantasy. Pakistan gives them something, gives the Khalistanis an illusion that their dream might become a reality,” said Milewski, who spent decades with Canada’s national broadcaster CBC, including years as a prime time news host.Milewski said his objective behind bringing out the report at this time was because the Punjab Referendum 2020, organised by the separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), is scheduled for November.He pointed out that election results in India have clearly shown that Khalistan has little popular support, and that even within the Sikh community in Canada, the vast majority will not participate in the process.However, that will ensure the results of the referendum are skewed in favour of those that actually support Khalistan. “The problem is, it’s a referendum of the people that support the referendum,” he said.The results, however insignificant they may be, “is designed to rally supporters” of a waning Khalistan cause, he added.Milewski’s report was released by the think tank MacDonald-Laurier Institute (MLI) in Ottawa. It places the focus sharply upon Pakistan’s role in the Khalistan issue, which it fanned since the 1970s and continues to till this day.It traces the origins of the Khalistan project to Zulqikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistani prime minister in the early 1970s. It was fomented further by military dictator Zia ul Haq. The report also points to the links of Canadians involved in the movement to Pakistan, including the visits of Talwinder Singh Parmar there.Parmar is considered the mastermind behind the bombing of Kanishka, the Air India flight 182, in June 1985, which claimed 329 lives and remains the worst incident of terrorism in Canadian history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalistan-push-exists-only-due-to-pak-backing-expert/story-11iW4lfEQ9Sbhb0o7m0AYM.html

Upon recovery, he was discharged from the hospital on Friday. “Post discharge, the patient needs close monitoring, bio bubble environment and careful drug control for at least six weeks,” Dr Sandeep Attawar, who led the team of doctors in the surgery, told reporters.Dr Attawar, a thoracic organ transplantation surgeon at KIMS, said Rizwan was admitted to the hospital last month with severe sarcoidosis that later led to fibrosis of the lungs. As the condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly, a double lung transplant was the only permanent option for cure, he said.Also read: Sonia Gandhi reconstitutes Congress; Azad, Ambika Soni dropped as general secretaries“Such patients are extremely sick, undernourished and bed-ridden before the transplant. In the case of Rizwan, the situation worsened when the patient contracted Covid-19 while awaiting his double lung transplant.

The harvested lungs were airlifted to Hyderabad to save Rizwan’s life. “The procedure was complex and had little scope for errors. Only a timely transplant of lungs helped save the patient,” Dr Attawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-doctors-perform-first-ever-double-lung-transplant-for-covid-19-patient/story-xf0AQKxsvhnKwwzhdbJ2CL.html

Ragini Dwivedi was arrested on September 5 and had been remanded in police custody till Friday, while Galrani had been arrested on Tuesday.Even as Ragini’s lawyer argued that since his client was already in police custody for a week and had told them whatever she knew, the public prosecutor sought the custody of all arrested for six more days.Stating that the accused had not been cooperative, police sought further custody of them for further interrogation. The judge finally ordered that all of them would continue to be in police custody for the next three days.Meanwhile, the Central Crime Branch police said that they had arrested alleged drug peddler Pratheek Shetty who is listed as accused No.15 in an FIR filed in the Cottonpet police station.

11-09-2020||India||ED questions Kerala minister in gold smuggling case||Two days after the CPI(M) state secretary’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri was cross-examined, the Enforce Directorate (ED) on Friday questioned Kerala Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel in the sensational gold smuggling case.The minister appeared before the ED in Kochi in a private vehicle and the questioning continued for about three hours. A top official said some of his statements were contradictory and he will be summoned again for more clarity.The opposition Congress and BJP have urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to sack the minister immediately. “It is a shame for the state. It seems the CM is waiting for his arrest. This is the first time such an incident is taking place,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.The minister maintained that it was not a questioning and he will co-operate with the ongoing probe. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is yet to react over this.Trouble began for Jaleel after phone call records of Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently in the list. Soon after the list surfaced, the minister had called a press conference in Malappuram and said he called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate.This clarification invited more trouble for him as he is not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs, experts said, adding it was a clear violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).During the investigation, the customs found that a heavy consignment came on March 4 in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram. The minister admitted he took these packets to his constituency but said they were religious books.The ED and customs officials said even if those were books, his action was a clear violation of the FCRA and there were many discrepancies in his claims also.“Out of 31 packets that came only one packet was opened. Rest are lying in two religious institutions in my constituency. Let any agency probe, my hands are clean,” the minister had said criticising the media trial.Former diplomats said no country usually exports religious books and special permission was needed for such imports, adding he can be booked for violating these norms.The customs had seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now.The NIA has arrested 30 persons in connection with the case.The Enforcement Directorate had submitted a statement in a court in Kochi on Wednesday saying Bengaluru drug haul and gold smuggling cases were closely linked. Key accused in the drug case, Anoop Mohammad, had taken the name of Bineesh Kodiyeri during questioning and claimed he was his close “business partner”. Kodiyeri said he helped him in setting up a hotel and he was not aware of his drug dealings. There are also reports the Narcotics Control Bureau probing the Bengaluru haul will question Kodiyeri soon. The ED also reportedly found that the Communist leader’s son owned properties worth crores of rupees and many firms as benami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-kerala-minister-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-lfpVInPLsiy1EWea7dEtkO.html
11-09-2020||India||Month-long testing of foundation pillars for Ram temple begins||The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust on Friday started the piling work for testing the foundation of pillars for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, an office-bearer of the trust said.Around 1,200 pillars will be laid about 100 feet below the surface to prepare the temple’s foundation. In technical terms, this process is called piling. To begin with, one pillar, a metre-long in diameter, will be laid 100-feet below the ground. This pillar will be subjected to various tests for around a month to check its strength and durability. “Testing for the foundation work started today (Friday). The first pillar will be laid today. For around a month, various tests will be conducted on this pillar to check its strength and durability,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust.“After completing all tests, from around October 15, work will begin for laying the remaining 1,199 pillars,” Rai added.Also read: Ram Temple construction trust account defrauded of Rs 6 lakhFour Casagrand machines, renowned for work on foundations, are being used for the piling process. These pillars will be of stone and no iron will be used. Another foundation layer will be placed on these pillars. Leading construction company, Larsen and Toubro, is carrying out the temple work. The proposed Ram temple will be 360 feet long, 235 feet wide and 161 feet high.According to the trust, the temple’s foundation will be laid by using modern techniques so that it can be preserved for more than 1,500 years and the structure for 1,000 years. Larsen and Toubro took the help of experts from Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee and IIT-Madras to make the temple’s foundation strong so that it can withstand earthquakes and storm for more than 1,500 years.On September 2, the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) approved two layouts for Ram Janmabhoomi after fixing a fee of Rs 2.11 crore and paved way for the trust to start construction work of the temple. After the trust deposited the fee, the ADA handed over the layouts to the trust.On November 9, the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/month-long-testing-of-foundation-pillars-for-ram-temple-begins/story-ZFzjkI50P6BszrXcI27hIK.html
11-09-2020||India||Up, close and musical with Malini!||Folk singer and exponent of Beneras gharana Malini Awasthi is said to have made best use of her time by meticulously working on expansion of music. “Till date I have released seven folk albums but eventually the ongoing Covid phase gave me an opportunity to do my kind of music and songs. All my earlier albums had fine commercial numbers but the songs I have done recently are particularly close to my heart,” said the Padma Shree awardee. The ‘Dil Mera Muft ka’ (Agent Vinod) singer said, “I have been a very busy artiste. It has been a 15-year-long journey with stage shows, lectures, events, workshops and more. Leave alone six months; I never had an opportunity to stay home at stretch of six days. The lockdown gave me a complete rest and immense time to be creative and musically fulfilled. Malini shot for three of her songs before the lockdown out of which two have been released. “All my latest songs were recorded in Lucknow due corona crisis but nevertheless they have come out beautifully. I composed ‘Baba Neeimiya ka Ped…’ which we shot at Residency and Kudiya Ghat. I launched it on Father’s Day and dedicated it to my father. The song has already crossed two million views.” Her second song ‘Preet Main na Dhoka Dhadi…’ was originally sung by Bhojpuri artiste Mohd Khalil some 50 years back. “We wanted to capture the spirit of Chowk and thankfully were able to show the beauty and heritage of Old City. It too garnered a great response on social media.” Malini’s next is a romantic ghazal penned by Ahmed Faraz, ‘Zindagi se Yehi Gila Hai Mujhe, Tu Bahut Der se Mila Hai Mujhe…’ which she has dedicated to her husband. On a lighter note she shared that the lockdown made her a beautician, editor, technician as well as producer and director.After ‘Janta Curfew,’ Malini wrote-composed and sang ‘Mil Kar Use Harana Hai’ which was tweeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and went viral. “My second song on migrant labourers, ‘Jaan ko jokhim mei dal kar chale kaun se desh…Pardesi Bhaiya’ is very close to me as a musician. Besides, I did some multi-artiste songs including (Amitabh) Bachchanji ‘Guzar jayega’,” she said. Malini did FB live show ‘Mulakat Malini Ke Saath’ for 51 days in a row. “Every day we took new topic which ranged from school, childhood, Covid warriors and more. Besides, I did literary live session with prestigious universities all over India including. Virtual concerts including one for Fiji High Commission on I-Day eve with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt also kept me all busy.” Of late, Malini recorded a song of Irish band U2 which has been recreated by Salim-Sulaiman and Karsh Kale. She has also sung for an ad jingle and a film song.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/up-close-and-musical-with-malini/story-Zx7K3GLhD6AVaZHMV34RRK.html
11-09-2020||India||‘Fix reasonable ambulance rates for Covid-19 patients’: SC to states||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered states to fix a reasonable charge for ambulance services that ferry Covid-19 patients.A three-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, also asked states to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) framed in this regard by the Central government in March.“States should follow the SOP and take appropriate measures for augmenting the capacity of ambulances,” said the bench, which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah.The petition filed by an NGO, Earth, had prayed for increasing the number of ambulances by requisitioning private one in order to meet the increased demand in view of Covid-19.The petition had also highlighted shortage of ambulances in several parts of the country and the price hike in ambulance services due to the high demand.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told the court that it had already issued an SOP covering the issues raised in the petition.Justice Shah, however, pointed out that many states were not implementing the SOP.“I can say for Ahmedabad. They (patients) are at the mercy of these people (ambulance service providers) who charge Rs 7,000 to 10,000 for the ambulance,” he remarked.The SOP laid down the procedure for guiding and training the ambulance drivers and technicians in transporting the Covid-19 patients. It is also provided for monitoring the functioning of the ambulances and laid down protocols for cleaning and decontaminating ambulances.The petitioner pointed out that the Centre’s SOP does not cover the pricing aspect.The top court therefore asked states to fix a reasonable cap with respect to the price for ambulance services besides following the SOP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fix-reasonable-ambulance-rates-for-covid-19-patients-sc-to-states/story-jGnmQq1R9nUN6Habq1L1xH.html

However, any hopes of the Jagannath temple, the most famous religious shrine in Odisha, opening in October have been squashed away with several servitors or priests of the temple getting infected. Though the infection in Puri and among the servitors of Jagannath temple was under control during the lockdown, it has been on a steady rise since mid-July after the relaxation of lockdown norms. Though the daily average of Covid-19 cases in Puri did not exceed 20, the district has been recording an average of 200 cases a day. On Friday, the district reported case positivity rate of 20 which is almost 3 times of Odisha’s daily positivity rate.Also read: Kim Jong Un showed off headless body of his uncle | All you need to knowHowever, it is the rising infection among the temple servitors that has become a cause of concern for the district administration. “The servitors live close to each other and that’s one reason for the rise in infection. Many of them have co-morbidity conditions like diabetes and hypertension and that is a matter of concern to us,” said Puri district collector Balwant Singh.Officials in the Puri CDMO office said of the 1,371 servitors who have been tested for Covid-19, 167 have tested positive. Of the 167 who have tested positive, 5 have succumbed to death. “The disease is quickly spreading among servitors as they are frequently coming in contact with each other. The rituals of the temple can’t stop and even if a servitor is infected, he has to come if there is no substitute for him available at the temple,” said Siddheswar Mohapatra, a senior servitor and member of the temple managing committee.Nearly 75 servitors perform about 90 different kinds of rituals daily at the temple and are entitled to get a portion of the total offerings. The temple has 119 categories of servitors who perform different duties as per the ‘Record of Rights’ of the temple.Janardhan Pattajoshi Mahapatra, who heads the Chhatisa Nijog, the most powerful body of servitors in the temple, said as Covid-19 infections rise among servitors, it may not be possible to open the temple before January.“We all are feeling scared. Many of our servitor brothers have co-morbidity conditions. Unless the infection is completely gone, we can’t take a risk. Once the temple opens and devotees start swarming the infection may just jump exponentially,” said Mohapatra.Binayak Dasmohapatra, another senior servitor, said if the temple remains shut for a couple of more months it would be difficult for many servitors to run their family. “We are getting monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 from the temple administration. But it is not enough to run large families of ours. We are also feeling disspirited whenever we go to the temple as there are no devotees. For the Lord, the devotees come first. It’s a testing time for all servitors,” said Dasmohapatra.During the Rath Yatra and Bahuda Yatra of Lord Jagannath in June, around half a dozen of the servitors tested positive after the SC allowed the festival to happen with strict Covid-19 guidelines. However, the Rath Yatra could be conducted successfully by isolating the infected servitors.Two days ago, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Orissa High Court seeking cancellation of the state government order issued restricting/closing religious places/places of worship for the public. Calling the order as illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable and unfair, the petitioner said if malls, fitness centres, gyms, yoga centres, liquor shops can be opened to the public, then there was no reason in stopping the devotees of Lord Jagannath from entering his temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-priests-contract-covid-19-uncertainty-looms-over-opening-of-jagannath-temple/story-HC4MKJy5PuO21k5foMeyuO.html
11-09-2020||India||Rajnath Singh holds high-level meeting on situation in eastern Ladakh: Report||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and top military brass on Friday deliberated on the five-point agreement reached between India and China on de-escalating tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, government sources said.The deliberation was attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh among others, they said.The meeting also carried out a comprehensive review of the security scenario in eastern Ladakh in view of fresh confrontation by two sides in the southern bank of Pangong lake earlier this week, the sources said.“The meeting discussed the agreement reached between the two countries,” said a source.In the meeting, Gen Naravane briefed about the combat readiness of the Army to deal with any eventualities besides elaborating on plans to keep the forces in the high-altitude region during harsh winter months.India and China reached a five-point consensus to resolve the four-month border row in eastern Ladakh that included quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions and taking steps to restore “peace and tranquillity” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The agreement was finalised at two-and-half-hours of “frank and constructive” talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on Thursday evening on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a tense standoff in multiple areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since early May. Shots were fired across the LAC on Monday for the first time in 45 years with the two sides accusing each other of firing in the air.The fresh confrontation further intensified the standoff and triggered a massive military build up by both sides in almost all friction points along the LAC, the de-facto border between the two countries.In the last few days, the Army further bolstered its dominance over a number of strategic heights overlooking key Chinese-held positions around Pangong lake area.  The sources said additional reinforcements have been made in hill tops and strategic locations around Pangong lake to keep a hawk-eye vigil on Chinese-held position of Finger 4.The mountainous spurs in the area are referred to as Finger. China has been holding onto Finger 4 to 8 on the north bank of Pangong lake, the sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-holds-high-level-meeting-on-situation-in-eastern-ladakh-report/story-JGOr3KQYn4GAlYTxUNJCBN.html

The handing over is likely to take place anytime tomorrow, i.e. 12 September, 2020 at a designated location,” Rijiju, who represents BJP from Arunachal West seat, tweeted on Friday evening.The five youths from Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for Indian Army, had gone missing on September 2 reportedly from Sera-7 on the Indian side of the McMohan line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet autonomous region (TAR) of China. Following their disappearance, a brother of one of the youths posted on social media that they had been ‘abducted’ by PLA. The same accusation was made by Tapir Gao, BJP MP from Arunachal East and Congress MLA from Pasighat Ninong Ering in their tweets. Responding to a hotline message sent by Indian Army, China’s People’s Liberation Army had informed on Tuesday that the youths have been found on their side and their condition was fine. “By persistent efforts of India Army, 5 hunters of Upper Subansiri, who had crossed over LAC on 2 September, will finally return on 12 September. PLA will hand them over to India in Damai, China at 0930 hrs morning,” tweeted Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, PRO (Defence), Tezpur, Assam on Friday evening. The disappearance of the youths and the allegation of their ‘abduction’ by PLA had added to the heightened tension between both countries.On Monday, China’s state affiliated Global Times tweeted quoting Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian: “China has never recognised so called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’, which is China’s south Tibet region, and we have no details to release yet about question on Indian Army sending message to PLA about five missing Indians in the region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-to-hand-over-5-missing-arunachal-men-tomorrow-kiren-rijiju/story-n6Ashfoh1B7s040wXbpXcI.html
11-09-2020||India||‘27 days remain for Lalu Yadav to complete half sentence in fodder scam case’: HC||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday discovered that Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad was still running 27 days short of completing half of the sentence in one of the fodder scam cases in which he was convicted and awarded to five years of imprisonment in January 2018.The bench comprising Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh, therefore, adjourned hearing on Yadav’s bail plea for October 9 on the request of his counsel Kapil Sibal.Former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, who has been undergoing treatment in custody at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, moved the bail application on the ground that he had already completed half of the sentence in the aforesaid case realted to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 33.13 crore from Chaibasa treasury over fictitious spends on fodder and other expenses for cattle.Yadav had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.Also read: Bal Thackeray feared Sena will become Congress, Kangana shares videoThe former Bihar chief minister’s trouble renewed again after December 23, 2017, when he had been convicted in three other fodder scam cases in quick succession. Since then, he has been in jail.Of these three cases, he had secured bail in one of them last year on the ground that he had served half of the 3.5 years imprisonment awarded to him. In the second case, he has filed the aforesaid bail application on similar ground.Opposing his bail plea, the CBI contended that Yadav’s custody, in this case, was yet to commence as he had not completed the full custody in previous cases. It pointed out the provision of Section 427 of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC) arguing that the court never ordered that sentences awarded to him in different fodder scam cases would run concurrently.“In absence of any such order, Prasad’s custody in subsequent cases would start only after completion of the sentence of previous cases as per Section 427 of the CrPC,” CBI’s counsel and assistant solicitor general Rajiv Sinha contended.However, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, representing Yadav, argued that the CBI had not raised this point with respect to bail applications filed by any of the fodder scam convicts earlier.In his earlier case also, the agency didn’t raise this contention and the court granted bail to him on completion of half sentence, Sibal argued.The bench, however, after calculating the period of custody served by Yadav in this case, found that 27 days were still left to cover half of the five years sentence. On Sibal’s request, it adjourned hearing for October 9.After spending the initial two months from December 2017, to February 2018, in Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi, Lalu Prasad Yadav had developed health complications in March 2018 and was moved to the hospital. Since then, he never returned to jail.After a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in August, he was moved from the RIMS paying ward to the hospital’s director’s bungalow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/27-days-remain-for-lalu-yadav-to-complete-half-sentence-in-fodder-scam-case-hc/story-11c510kGygLjTdRhELIeMN.html

Maken pleaded that no slum dweller should be evicted without alternative housing as per the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015. The policy provides for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers before such demolitions. Maken’s lawyers have sought an urgent listing the plea as the Railways has issued demolition notices for 48,000 slum clusters with plans to carry out the demolition drive from Friday to Monday.Also Read: Life a struggle, can’t SC rethink decision, ask residents of Delhi slums along railway linesThe Supreme Court’s order barred any court in Delhi from issuing a stay on the eviction proceedings after Railways complained of political interference in the past over the removal of slums and gave the Railways three months for the completion of the proceedings. Justice Arun Mishra, who has since retired, led the three-member bench that passed the order. Chief Justice of India SA Bobde will have to constitute a new bench to hear Maken’s application.Maken said the order violated the principles of natural justice as the affected slum dwellers were not heard individually or collectively. He added the order violated a ruling of the court’s Constitution Bench in Olga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corporation (1986), which held there can be no justification for denying slum dwellers living on pavements or public properties an opportunity to be heard.Also Read: When Covid-19 enters India’s slumsThe direction ordering that no court shall grant stay amounted to “grave obstruction in the Right to Access to Justice”, the plea said. It highlighting the consequences of the order. “The order itself is inhuman and against public policy as lakhs of children, women and elderly, currently residing in the large slum clusters alongside the railway tracks, will be left without a roof on the streets….even a small percentage of the displaced population if affected by COVID-19, then the same will prove to be a recipe for disaster.”The plea said the Centre and Delhi administration kept the court in the dark about the protocol for evicting slum dwellers, which the Delhi high court approved on March 18, 2019 in response to a petition Maken filed. The municipal corporations, Delhi government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, Railways, and Union urban development ministry prepared the protocol.The protocol said all slums in Delhi that came into existence prior to January 1, 2006, and hutments built there before January 1, 2015, shall not be demolished without providing alternative housing.Maken said the 48,000 slum clusters sought to be demolished have been in existence for 30-40 years and are home to over 240,000 people.The high court last year noted that those living in the slums contribute to the city’s social and economic life by working as sanitation workers, garbage collectors, domestic help, rickshaw pullers, laborers. It added they provide a wide range of services indispensable to a healthy urban life and hence they have the right to housing.Maken said the railways accepted the Supreme Court’s judgment and did not file an appeal against it. He added it has now circumvented the high court ruling by directly approaching the Supreme Court without mentioning the norms laid down for the demolitions.“Even the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 provides for in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellers wherever possible and relocation of slum dwellers in other cases. The Rajiv Awas Yojna, renamed as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, also aims towards slum-free India by 2022 and the scheme also provides for either in-situ rehabilitation or relocation in exceptional cases,” Maken’s plea said. “These facts were not brought to the notice of the Court before passing the August 31 order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-slum-demolition-don-t-evict-dwellers-without-alternative-housing-maken-appeals-to-sc/story-ha2Hoc4H9iBotTVLNO0oBM.html

Balasaheb’s biggest fear was that some day his party would become Congress, the actor wrote. Great Bala Saheb Thakeray one of my most favourite icons, his biggest fear was some day Shiv Sena will do Gutbandhan and become congress ⁦@INCIndia⁩ I want to know what is his conscious feeling today looking at the condition of his party ? pic.twitter.com/quVpZkj407In the video interview, shared by Kangana, Balasaheb can be heard saying that he didn’t believe in elections or democracy. “Because I am there the party has survived. Otherwise, it would have become congress,” Balasaheb said in the interview.“Great Bala Saheb Thakeray one of my most favourite icons, his biggest fear was some day Shiv Sena will do Gutbandhan and become congress @INCIndia I want to know what is his conscious feeling today looking at the condition of his party,” Kangana tweeted.Balasaheb Thackeray founded Shiv Sena in 1966 as a right-wing, regional, Marathi political party.In a swipe at the Congress, which is part of the Maha Vikas Agadhi government in Maharashtra, Kangana asked party president Sonia Gandhi to take note of the treatment that she is being subjected to. “Can you not request your Government to uphold the principles of the Constitution given to us by Dr. Ambedkar? You have grown up in the west and lived here in India. You may be aware of the struggles of women. History will judge your silence and indifference when your own Government is harassing women and ensuring a total mockery of law and order. I hope you will intervene,” the actor tweeted.The tussle began after the actor compared Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and Sena leaders reportedly threatened her. She came to Mumbai on September 9 with Y plus security provided by the Centre. On the very same day, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation razed ‘illegal’ portions of her Bandra office, which took the ongoing fight a notch higher. However, the Maharashtra government said it had no role in BMC action.Meanwhile, Kangana Ranaut’s mother Asha Ranaut thanked Union home minister Amit Shah for providing security to Kangana though the family had no BJP connection. The family had long Congress connections, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/balasaheb-s-biggest-fear-was-one-day-shiv-sena-will-become-congress-says-kangana-ranaut-shares-old-interview/story-BxaZrJoSiAOE6u7JIgrU7I.html
11-09-2020||India||Rajasthan govt to work on action plan for introduction of cheetahs||The Rajasthan government will prepare an ‘action plan’ to explore the possibility of introduction of cheetah, the fastest animal on the planet, in the state, officials said.A committee of experts set up by Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WW) has zeroed in three states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat - where cheetah population could be re-introduced. For that, the WII needs to conduct feasibility studies.On Thursday, a WII proposal to conduct the study in Rajasthan was taken up for consideration in the state wildlife board. A presentation was also made by WII scientists on why Rajasthan has possible sites for reintroduction of cheetah and its potential to have the animal.“After finalizing the action plan, a decision would soon be taken on the WII proposal,” Rajasthan forest Minister Sukhram Vishnoi.In February this year, the Supreme Court had allowed the introduction of cheetah under the project which was initiated by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh in 2009.Also read: Supreme Court allows introduction of African Cheetah in IndiaCongress MLA from Sangod (Kota) Bharat Singh, who was present at the meeting, said the Central government has permitted the re-introduction and conservation of cheetah which could be brought from Africa.“The states who could take the initiative and have potential and suitable sites are Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. They can get cheetah which could be associated with the development and promotion of tourism,” Singh said. Singh said at the meeting, the WII representative mentioned two sites - one each in Jaisalmer and Kota - for cheetah introduction, said Singh.“Shahgarh Bulge in Jaisalmer was among the top sites identified in 2010 by an expert panel constituted by the central government to reintroduce cheetah in India,” said a forest department official.Shahgarh Bulge in Jaisalmer was among the top three sites identified in 2010 by the expert panel. The other two sites - Kuno Palpur and Nauradehi - were in Madhya Pradesh.As 10 years have passed since the last assessment was done, experts said Shahgarh Bulge needs to be re-assessed for prey population viability to sustain cheetahs and the ability of the habitat to sustain these animals in the long run.“Shahgarh now has animal population which needs to be relocated if the site has to be considered for introducing cheetah. The then government had reservation over the site and had written to the Central government saying the region has oil deposits and was very close to Pakistan border,” said the official.The WII experts also said that apart from Shahgarh Bulge, relocation sites can also be explored at other places in Barmer and Jaisalmer districts. “With Rajasthan being the biggest state geographically and the availability of dry and plain grassland, the state has the maximum potential,” said an expert who was not willing to be quoted.Divya Bhanu Sinh, member of the expert committee formed by Central government in 2010 and author of ‘The end of a trail: The cheetah in India’ book, said, “The Wildlife Institute of India surveyed possible sites to introduce cheetah where one was Shahgarh Bulge in Jaisalmer; and other two in Madhya Pradesh – Kuno Palpur and Nauradehi”.Kunal Palpur was selected as the site for the introduction of cheetahs and the environment ministry had given its permission to the Madhya Pradesh government to import nine cheetahs in different batches from Namibia for translocation into Kuno Palpur wildlife sanctuary at Sheopur where the last cheetah was hunted in the 1950s.But before the process to import cheetahs could start, the project was challenged in the Supreme Court on the ground that the sites selected were not viable for cheetah re-introduction. The apex court stayed the project and formed an expert committee to examine all aspects. In February, it finally approved the project.MK Ranjitsinh, who headed the expert committee, said that the cheetah’s re-introduction is an interesting project not only for India but for the entire world as such long-distance relocation of big animals in wild has not happened. “As cheetah was native to India till the 1950s, them adopting to hot and humid temperature of the country would not be very difficult. But, we need a proper wildlife management plan of habitats for that,” he said.Cheetahs roamed about India’s grasslands till the 1950s when they were hunted to extinction in the country. Iran has a sub-species of the Asiatic cheetah but has refused to share them with India, forcing the government to look for the African ones. The Asian and the African species separated between 30,000 and 60,000 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-govt-to-work-on-action-plan-for-introduction-of-cheetahs/story-dhAN5IBkgOiDm1Ltqr5dII.html

The day Swami Vivekananda delivered his outstanding address in Chicago. These great men have a lot to teach the entire humanity,” Modi said.Paying tribute to Bhave on his 125th birth anniversary, the Prime Minister said, “In 1918 Mahatma Gandhi wrote about Bhave that ‘I do not know in what terms to praise you. Your love and your character fascinate me and so also your self-examination. I am not fit to measure your worth’.” Modi added that Vivekananda’s address in 1893 perfectly demonstrated the spirit of India’s ethos and the values that are an integral part of our land, as he urged youngsters to read the text of his address. He also tagged a link to the address.  “The world remembers 9/11 for the dastardly attack on this day in USA. If only humankind had walked on the path of ‘Jai Jagat’ given by Acharya Vinoba Bhave & Swami Vivekananda’s message of Universal Brotherhood given in 1893, the destruction that followed would not have occurred,” the Prime Minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-remembers-9-11-anniversary-along-with-two-important-events-for-india/story-T4iXp2HThpwNE1mXnfDWKO.html

I joined a theatre group in Jaipur as I belong to a small place near the city of Kota, and later, joined the National School of Drama for a three-year acting course. “That’s how things started for me before I reached Mumbai and formed my own theatre group, did plays, followed by my screen debut,” said the young actor over the phone.Talking about his theatre group, Bhupendra said, “After my NSD course, I reached Mumbai. I knew that no background works in Mumbai and I was all game to get into the grind of auditions. I started looking for work and did a few commercials. Then, together with three of my batch-mates, I formed a theatre group ‘The Red Mark’ and came up with our first play ‘Man Mana Square.’ The real debut happened for Bhupendra when he got a call for a parallel lead in an OTT film, “When I got a call for the film ‘Class of 83’ I was all excited as it was a big production film. After reading my part my excitement knew no bounds and I got the role of ‘Shukla’ in the Atul Sabharwal directorial. Playing a cop was quite complicated for me. After getting to know that it was an SRK production, it became a larger-than-life project for me. We were trained for two months, we had to prepare ourselves keeping the 80s era in mind. Today, I’m thrilled with the kind of response our film has received. Soon you will see me doing more OTT series as well as films,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/to-succeed-i-had-to-get-into-grind-of-auditions/story-mdGy87ZwuAm8jSyhXBElUM.html

11-09-2020||India||AgustaWestland case: CBI seeks sanction to prosecute ex-CAG, 4 IAF officers||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought prosecution sanction from the Union government against former defence secretary and Comptroller and Auditor General of India Shashi Kant Sharma, former Air-Vice Marshal Jasbir Singh Panesar, and three other Indian Air Force (IAF) officers in connection with the alleged Rs 3,727-crore AgustaWestland chopper scam, people familiar with the development said. Sharma was Joint Secretary (Air) in the ministry of defence when the contract for supplying 12 VVIP helicopters was under consideration, and when operational requirements (OR) for the deal were being finalised. The contract – alleged violations and kickbacks in the deal became one of the biggest controversies during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime -- was given to Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland in February 2010. Sharma was later India’s defence secretary, between July 2011 and May 2013, and then CAG till 2017. This is the first time his name has come up in connection with the case.Also read: AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case: ED raids premises linked to businessman Shravan GuptaThe words “JS Air” – an apparent reference to the designation Joint Secretary (Air) -- appeared repeatedly in Italian court judgments in the matter, as part of a note written by British middleman Christian Michel, who allegedly arranged kickbacks to politicians and officials in India. “As JS (Air), Sharma was part of key meetings in the defence ministry,” said a CBI official when asked about the prosecution sanction. He declined to give any other details, while confirming the request was made in writing to the defence ministry. HT has seen the request document. The details of the alleged role played by Sharma in the case are not clear at this time.Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act makes it mandatory for CBI to seek a prosecution sanction from the concerned department before filing a charge sheet against a government official.“I had a long unblemished service record of over forty years and nobody can blame me for any malafide action or decision. I strongly and firmly deny any such frivolous allegation,” Shashi Kant Sharma told HT. A second CBI officer, who asked not to be named, contended that Panesar and the three IAF officers played important and questionable roles in the purchase and testing of the AW-101 helicopters. More details of Panesar’s alleged role are not known at this time.The three officers against whom sanctions have been sought from the defence ministry include deputy chief test pilot SA Kunte, Wing Commander Thomas Mathew, and Group Captain N Santosh. The three officers have retired.Panesar and the three officers could not be reached. The office of the former air vice-marshal did not share contact details.The second CBI officer added that a supplementary charge sheet, detailing the alleged roles played by Sharma, Panesar, Kunte, Mathew and Santosh, is ready and will be filed as soon as the government accords sanction. The charge sheet will also detail the role of about a dozen other officials and individuals that amount to conspiracy and violation under the prevention of corruption act, he added. On Michel, the CBI supplementary charge sheet will explain how he paid bribes to Indian officials to influence the decision in the favour of AgustaWestland, and later destroyed the trail, said the second officer.Michel was extradited to India in December 2018 and is currently lodged in Tihar jail. CBI filed its first charge sheet in the case in September 2017, naming former IAF chief SP Tyagi; former Air-Vice Marshal JS Gujral; former AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini; former Finmeccanica chairman Giuseppe Orsi; Michel and his two associates, Guido Ralph Haschke and Carlo Gerosa; SP Tyagi’s cousin Sanjeev Tyagi; and Delhi-based lawyer-middleman Gautam Khaitan. They have all denied any wrongdoing. According to a note, allegedly written by Michel sometime in 2008 at his London office, 30 million euros were to be distributed among Indian bureaucrats, politicians, and air force officers. The note used abbreviations of designations under the heads “AF” (which, investigators allege, meant air force), “BUR” (bureaucrats, according to sleuths), “POL” (politicians) and “Fam” (believed to be SP Tyagi’s family). The note mentioned that 6 million euros were for “AF”, 8.4 million euros for “BUR”, 3 million euros for “Pol” and 15-16 million euros for “Fam”. Several of the abbreviations under the header were revealed by Guido Haschke to Italian investigators, according to court documents. The Italian court’s 2016 judgment in the case – it sentenced Orsi and Spagnolini – said that Haschke admitted to these expenses incurred by Michel on the Indian military, bureaucracy, and politicians. Spagnolini and Orsi were acquitted later by an appeals court in Milan in September 2018.The CBI claimed in its first charge sheet (HT has seen a copy) that, in 2004, officials at Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Special Protection Group (SPG) and air force and ministry of defence officials, agreed to change the mandatory service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 meters to 4,500. This, it alleged, ultimately benefitted Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland. CBI also says it has established a “money trail” of 62 million euros (around 415 crore) out of suspected 67 million euros (Rs 452 crore) in bribes allegedly paid to Indian officials through middlemen. The irregularities in the award of contract to AgustaWestland led to estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (around Rs 2,666 crore) to the Indian government in the 556.262 million euros (Rs 3726.9 crore) contract, according to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agustawestland-scam-cbi-seeks-prosecution-sanction-against-former-cag-shashi-kant-sharma-four-iaf-officers/story-J0Jp9wf9se0SCoShND0jtJ.html

A team of police rushed to the spot followed by a team of mobile forensic team along with concerned officials for necessary procedure, the official added.At the request of Gambhir’s family and subsequent submission of a declaration, no case was registered in connection with his death, the sources said.Also read: Bihar medical aspirant shoots self while taking selfie with father’s pistolGambhir, a former member of paramilitary Manipur Rifles, had disappeared from his locality in the late 1970s.

He said that the state government should have focused more on the legal matter and should now take the development as a lesson for future planning. He also said that approaching Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde to vacate the stay is the only option left before the state.“Tamil Nadu and our situation is the same. Despite that, while referring to the constitutional bench, the apex court didn’t stay the reservation declared by them but in our case, it was stayed. We need to see where we lacked in explaining the case effectively before the apex court,” Fadnavis said while speaking to reporters in Delhi on Friday.“The only way left before us is to approach the Chief Justice of India and request him to vacate stay on Maratha reservation as there is no difference between our case and that of Tamil Nadu. The state should also request him to club both the cases,” he added.The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Maratha quota in jobs and education while referring it to the constitutional bench. It is being seen as a major setback to the MVA government and the Opposition leaders are blaming the government for that. The state government is also planning to file an appeal against the three-bench judgement.Responding to former revenue minister and senior leader Eknath Khadse’s allegations that Fadnavis dislodged him from electoral politics as he was the main contender for the post of the chief minister in the state, Fadnavis said Khadse was forced to resign from his position over allegations of purchase of plot of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), a state-run corporation, by one of his family members. The case was filed against him following directives of the Bombay high court.“There is no need to create confusion among people as Khadse ji was forced to resign in MIDC land purchase case and not in Manish Bhangare case, as he claims. The retired judge who probed the allegations submitted a report to the state but by then, a corruption case was filed against him following directives of the high court. This is also the reason the report could not be tabled before the state legislature. People will know the reality once the report is made public,” Fadnavis clarified.Fadnavis also said that the matter between him and Khadse will be sorted out by discussion. “Khadse ji is our senior leader and if he is unhappy we will sit together and resolve the issue. After all, it is a family matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-failed-in-defending-maratha-quota-in-supreme-court-fadnavis/story-TtVUW8cKDsztpJEMpaseiM.html

11-09-2020||India||India, China differences remain despite five-point consensus on easing tensions||Sharp divergences remained between India and China on the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even after the two sides framed a five-point roadmap for easing tensions on the disputed border and speeding up the disengagement of troops. The two sides reached an agreement on the five points during talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on Thursday night. The points include dialogue aimed at quick disengagement, maintaining proper distance between troops of the two sides and easing tensions, abiding by all agreements and protocols on border management, and working on new confidence-building measures once the situation eases. Also Read: How Jaishankar-Wang’s 5-point consensus works out depends on one man | AnalysisWang was quoted by a Chinese foreign ministry statement as acknowledging that it is normal for two major neighbours such as India and China to have differences and that bilateral ties have come “to a crossroads”, though there is no challenge that can’t be overcome if both sides keep moving in the right direction. These remarks marked a slight shift from China’s stance in recent weeks, including during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe on September 4, of holding the Indian side entirely responsible for the standoff. Also Read: India-China joint statement stresses need for more confidence buildingIn other areas, however, sharp differences persisted between the two sides, and experts noted that both countries hadn’t made any mention of the restoration of the status quo on the LAC as it existed in April or set any timeframe for completing the disengagement and de-escalation. The Chinese foreign ministry’s statement also said that the Indian side “does not consider the development of India-China relations to be dependent on the settlement of the boundary question”, but this was dismissed by people familiar with developments. The people, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that Jaishankar had emphasised even before the meeting that “the state of the border cannot be delinked from the state of the relationship”, and that he had repeated this at the talks with Wang. Also Read: India, China agree on 5-point plan for resolving border standoff: Here’s what you need to knowDuring the meeting, Jaishankar made it clear recent incidents in eastern Ladakh had “inevitably impacted the development of the bilateral relationship”, said one of the people cited above. “While the Indian side recognised that a solution to the boundary question required time and effort, it was clear the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is essential to the forward development of ties,” the person added. The people also challenged the Chinese statement’s assertion that the “Indian side believes that China’s policy toward India has not changed”, saying the Chinese side is yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for the massing of troops and equipment in violation of all existing border agreements, which has created new flashpoints along the LAC. The Chinese statement cited Wang as outlining China’s “stern position” on the situation and emphasising the need to “immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions” and to “move back all personnel and equipment that have trespassed”. The people cited above reiterated that Indian troops hadn’t crossed the LAC and it was the Chinese troops that had fired in the air during the latest face-off on September 7 on the south bank of Pangong Lake. “We are committed to a resolution though peaceful dialogue but it is the Chinese side that has repeatedly resorted to aggressive military actions and posturing,” a second person said. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash is among those who remain sceptical about the Chinese side’s intentions and willingness to deliver on the commitments made during Thursday’s meeting. “The India-China joint statement on border disengagement somehow doesn’t inspire. The Chinese don’t seem to have agreed to restore status quo ante. There are no timelines,” he said. “The understanding on quick disengagement is vague at best. It will be a miracle if these commitments are honoured,” Prakash added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-differences-remain-despite-five-point-consensus-on-easing-tensions/story-RK4g93VyPFo85llQS5O5GI.html

11-09-2020||India||PIL says patients dying as Assam hospitals refuse admission; HC defers hearing||Leader of opposition in Assam assembly and senior Congress leader, Debabrata Saikia, has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Gauhati high court against hospitals in the state for allegedly refusing treatment to patients who fail to produce Covid-19 negative reports. Citing several newspaper reports of how patients in need of critical and immediate medical care have died in the state due to hospitals’ refusal to treat them without Covid negative certificates, the petitioner stated it was a violation of fundamental right of citizens. “Such people include accident-related critically injured cases, in which urgent medical care is vital and of paramount importance. Resultantly, many people succumbed to their injuries sustained during the accidents,” the PIL stated. The plea claimed that even pregnant women are not admitted to hospitals without furnishing a Covid-19 negative certificate and cited four instances of patients dying due to lack of medical care.The petition stated that such actions by hospitals were in violation of a directive issued in April by the union health ministry asking hospitals not to insist on Covid test before providing services and not to deny essential critical services to those in need. The PIL states that the actions of the respondents—government of India, Assam government and the state health and family welfare department--were malafide and violated fundamental rights of the petitioner as guaranteed under articles 14 and 21 of the constitution.

The mafia and state government are both in fear and simply hitting out at her,” said Giri.“This is the reason why the Uddhav Thackeray government has demolished Kangana Ranaut’s office and acted in simple retaliation aimed at suppressing her voice,” he added. Ranaut’s office was demolished by the Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC) on Wednesday, alleging departure from the sanctioned plan. The demolition has been criticized by many including the leader of opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, who alleged it was done in haste and was a case of selective targeting.Akhara Parishad president said that Kangana was being targeted by the high and mighty for revealing dirty secrets.“However, the Maharashtra high court has given a huge relief to Kangana by granting a stay on the demolition operations. The bravery, with which she has faced drugs and Bollywood mafia in Sushant Singh murder case, has made many people angry and she is being targeted at their behest,” Giri said.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut’s mother thanks Amit Shah for support, says family was Congress loyalist but will support BJP nowThe demolition case is being heard in Mumbai high court, which has set September 22 as the next day for hearing.Mahant Narendra Giri added that the law and order situation in Maharashtra was very bad.“Even in the lynching case of two saints in Palghar, the Maharashtra government has not taken any action.

11-09-2020||India||How Jaishankar-Wang’s 5-point consensus works out depends on one man | Analysis||When Chinese foreign minister Huang Hua met Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 29, 1981, the two agreed that unless the boundary question is settled, it would be difficult to maintain friendship and goodwill between the two neighbours.More than 39 years later, the People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese foreign ministry appear to be on different pages. The PLA is hard at work in its single-minded effort to reach to the Green Line defined by a 1959 map by then Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai while the foreign ministry is talking about building bilateral economic ties, which over the years, did strongly tilt towards Beijing.Much as State Councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi tried to gloss over a near war-like situation in Ladakh during his two-hour-long meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the fact is that the 1981 parallel track policy of working to build on harmonious ties even as the two countries sort out the boundary issue has not paid any dividends to India.ALSO WATCH | India, China formulate 5-point peace plan during Jaishankar & Wang Yi meet Instead, India has lost territory since then, letting 65 patrolling points defined by the China Study Group in 1976 turn into the de facto Line of Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The patrolling points are well within the Indian perception of the LAC but the movement of the Indian forces to these points has been curtailed by the presence of Chinese troops, face-offs with PLA patrolling parties and on occasions, the harsh weather and mountainous terrain.As Wang and Jaishankar arrived at a five-point consensus in Moscow to first disengage, and then de-escalate in Ladakh, the Communist Party of China mouthpiece Global Times continued to play up its war-mongering editorial.Also Read: India, China troop disengagement in Ladakh is first step before de-escalation“If India wants peace, China and India should uphold the LAC of November 7, 1959. If India wants war, China will oblige,” the tabloid, considered an extended arm of the Chinese government, says. It claims that India does not want to implement the 1959 LAC as it is holding a grudge for its failure in 1962 war.It is this 1962 mindset that pervades the regime of Xi Jinping. President Xi, who evidently sees himself as a true successor to Mao Zedong, decided to target India in 1962 by creating an impression that India was out to occupy Tibet.The aggressive line projected by the party’s mouthpiece is totally at odds with what State Councillor Wang Yi’s stand at his meeting with Jaishankar where the Chinese side did not appear to acknowledge the role that the PLA had played to spike tensions. As one diplomat put it, it was as if the build-up and the friction in Ladakh was an act of God.Given the Chinese expansionist plans to make unilateral cartographic changes in Ladakh, the disengagement process will not be easy as the PLA wants to reach the 1959 Green Line and push Indian Army troops beyond the self-designated line. This is completely in violation of the 1993 Peace and Tranquillity Accord, which talks about mutual and equal security on the border for both sides.Under the circumstances, India will have to wait for PLA Commander-in-Chief and President Xi Jinping to give instructions to his western theatre command troops to go back to barracks if Beijing is seriously interested in rolling back the aggression. While the Chinese political mindset has not changed since 1962, the Indian mindset changed in 2014. Beijing must take this into account before making the next move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-jaishankar-wang-s-5-point-consensus-works-out-depends-on-one-man-analysis/story-HYCOYdtJro5ytg2NtP3ouL.html

All the accused are in judicial custody.Here is what NCB and Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyers said:* Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande, appearing for NCB, welcomed the decision. * Sarpande said the court, while rejecting the bail pleas, has accepted the contentions of the prosecution that the investigation is at a crucial stage, according to news agency PTI.* Rhea’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde said they would decide further course of action after reading the court order.* “Once we get a copy of the order passed by the special NDPS court, we will decide next week on further course of action and about approaching the Bombay High Court,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.* Rhea had claimed in her bail plea that she was falsely implicated in the case. She had also retracted her statement recorded by NCB when she was questioned for three days, claiming that the agency had coerced her into making self-incriminating statements.* NCB had strongly opposed their bail pleas and said that Rhea knew that Rajput was consuming drugs, but she continued procuring and making payments for drugs.* The agency had said that although the quantity of banned drugs seized in the case was small, it was still a commercial quantity and worth Rs 185,200.* “Rhea Chakraborty and Showik Chakraborty financed and arranged drugs for Rajput and at his instructions,” the NCB had said in its affidavit responding to the bail pleas.* NCB added that as per the statement given by co-accused and Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant, he used to procure drugs from other accused in the case on the instructions of Rajput and Rhea.* “The financial transactions were handled by Rhea and sometimes Rajput. Dipesh Sawant used to procure drugs along with co-accused Samuel Miranda (former house manager of Rajput) for Sushant Singh Rajput’s consumption,” the affidavit said.* NCB had further said that if the accused are released on bail, they may tamper with evidence and try to intimidate key witnesses in the case.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-denied-bail-ncb-says-probe-at-crucial-point-actor-to-move-high-court/story-dv8s4SxB1Y41LhNjNyQ4YM.html

It is the responsibility of every state to ensure that every hospitalised Covid-19 patient receives oxygen, the health secretary wrote to the states and the Union Territories In the fourth phase of Unlock, which commenced from September 1, there is no border restriction anywhere in the country. But it has come to the knowledge of the health ministry that the states are exercising some provisions under various acts and also mandating the manufacturers/suppliers located in the state to restrict their oxygen supplies to only the hospitals of the state, the letter said.Medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity, the letter said adding that any impediment in the supplies of medical oxygen may critically impact the management of patients suffering from Covid-19 disease in other parts of the country. Moreover, some of the major oxygen manufacturers/supplies already have existing supply agreements with hospitals in various states with a legal obligation to fulfil such agreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-not-block-oxygen-supplies-for-covid-19-patients-centre-tells-states/story-nmH3FoYOPZuHdFFhrVRmfP.html

11-09-2020||India||Bhave, Vivekananda have a lot to teach humanity: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday recalled two important events that mark this day for India -- the birth anniversary of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and Swami Vivekananda’s famous address in Chicago -- and said both great men have a lot to teach the entire humanity.In his tweets, Modi also noted that the world remembers 9/11 (September 11) for the dastardly terror attack on this day in the USA and said if humans had walked on the path of Bhave’s slogan of ‘Jai Jagat’ and Vivekananda’s nineteenth century message of universal brotherhood, the destruction that followed would not have occurred.  “Today, on 11th September we in India mark two important milestones.  The Jayanti of Acharya Vinoba Bhave. The day Swami Vivekananda delivered his outstanding address in Chicago. These great men have a lot to teach the entire humanity,” Modi said.Paying tribute to Bhave on his 125th birth anniversary, the prime minister said, “In 1918 Mahatma Gandhi wrote about Bhave that ‘I do not know in what terms to praise you. Your love and your character fascinate me and so also your self-examination. I am not fit to measure your worth’.”  Modi added that Vivekananda’s address in 1893 perfectly demonstrated the spirit of India’s ethos and the values that are an integral part of our land, as he urged youngsters to read the text of his address. He also tagged a link to the address.   “The world remembers 9/11 for the dastardly attack on this day in USA. If only humankind had walked on the path of ‘Jai Jagat’ given by Acharya Vinoba Bhave & Swami Vivekananda’s message of Universal Brotherhood given in 1893, the destruction that followed would not have occurred,” the prime minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhave-vivekananda-have-a-lot-to-teach-humanity-pm-modi/story-zaJguk8TDYKO112y1nTWSP.html
11-09-2020||India||Extreme rains lead to more rural farmer suicides than droughts: Study||Not only drought but flooding or even extreme rainfall leading to excess water availability is linked to higher cases of suicides among those above the age of 15 years in rural areas, a new study has suggested.In an analysis of 9,456 suicides between 2001 and 2013 in randomly selected rural areas, the researchers found that compared to normal growing seasons, the percentage of deaths due to suicide increased by 18.7% during extremely wet cropping seasons and by 3.6% during extremely dry cropping seasons.The study led by Robin A Richardson at department of epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University with researchers from department of epidemiology, biostatistics, and occupational health, McGill University in Canada and IIT Gandhinagar used data from Million Deaths Study (MDS), which monitored the causes of death between 2001 and 2013 among approximately 8.5 million individuals living in randomly selected rural ‘small areas.’The researchers limited rural areas selected to those with less than 5,000 population, and a density of less than 1,000 per square mile and where more than 25% of male population was engaged in agricultural work.Water availability was measured with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), derived by taking the difference between precipitation amount and potential evapotranspiration during a specified time period.The team calculated SPEI values using temperature and rain data for districts for the entire growing period from June 1 to March 31. The team found that the most common modes of suicide were poisoning (40%), hanging or strangulation (37%), and burning (10%). Non-suicide deaths saw very minor changes during the same period indicating that they were not linked to extremes in water availability.“To our knowledge, no studies before ours have investigated the link between suicide and water availability at both extremes. We found, perhaps surprisingly, extremely wet conditions more strongly associated with suicide than extremely dry conditions. Our results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses,” the study to be published in Science Direct’s environmental research journal in November (the abstract is already published online) has concluded.Also Read: Maharashtra government to connect farmers with 1,370 market-based value chains“Very wet conditions can be very damaging to crops because of limited means to mitigate conditions. Extreme drought can be offset by irrigation, extremely wet conditions – such as flooding or torrential rain can result in conditions that are less easily mitigated and are more damaging to crops,” said Vimal Mishra, associate professor, civil engineering, IIT Gandhinagar and co-author of the study.Statistics collected from the national crime records bureau (NCRB) find that bankruptcy and indebtedness are the top causes of suicide among farmers and cultivators. Poor crop yield can be devastating for those engaged in subsistence agriculture.“This study looks at how climate change impacts agriculture. Farmers are directly dependent on the environment. There are three categories of people who are particularly vulnerable, those in flood prone or rain fed areas; small and marginal farmers; socially disadvantaged groups like women and Dalits. Climate change is a reality and we are seeing both flash floods and flash droughts. There is extreme rain in a few days followed by no rain for several days. This causes the lives of marginal farmers to go upside down. Insurance mechanisms should serve those affected and PM Kisan should be available to all categories of agricultural workers,” said Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, centre for sustainable agriculture, Telangana who read the study.Also Read: Congress condemn police action against farmers in KurukshetraAccording to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region” a report of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), released earlier this year, from 1950 onwards, there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme heavy rain events over central India, along with a decreasing trend in the moderate rain events.A study published in Nature journal in 2017 by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has concluded that there has been a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India during 1950 to 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-rains-lead-to-more-rural-farmer-suicides-than-droughts-study/story-Pk9BZ6A5QZGtuny9q5qJMO.html

NEET (Advanced), college and university final year examinations are also being held across the country, and will be over by September 30.Here is all you need to know about the revised SOP1. Only asymptomatic students and staff will be allowed inside the examination halls with proper precautionary measures.2. Previously, the ministry said symptomatic candidates can take the exams under isolation. But now the decision to whether allow them or not has been left with the examination conducting authorities.3. According to the new SOP, the symptomatic candidates should be referred to the nearest health centre and given an opportunity to undertake the examination through other means. 4. In general course, they will not be allowed inside the examination hall. The authorities, in this case, are supposed to arrange alternative date for the examination, when the candidate is declared physically fit. 5. However, all examination centres will have an isolation room for symptomatic candidates until medical advice on whether they can take the exam or not arrives.Other guidelines regarding examination centres in the containment zones, candidates and staff belonging to containment zones remain same. For pen and paper-based tests, like NEET, sanitisation of hands prior to the distribution of question papers or answer sheets is mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-symptomatic-candidates-may-not-be-allowed-to-take-exams-says-revised-sop-all-you-need-to-know/story-rqiCUir3EH1j07KCBMqinO.html
11-09-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty could move high court next week after bail plea rejected||Actor Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer said on Friday they would decide about moving the Bombay High Court next week after a local court in Mumbai rejected her bail plea. She has been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) over drugs charges linked to its probe into the Sushant Singh Rajput case.The special court rejected the bail plea of Rhea, her brother Showik and other accused----Abdul Basit, Zaid Vilatra, Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda--in the case.“Once we get the order copy. We will decide next week on the course of action on approaching the high court,” Satish Maneshinde said, according to news agency ANI.Rhea had said in her plea that she was innocent and falsely implicated. Both Rhea and her brother have been booked under section 27A of the NDPS act, which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders.The defence raised the issue of applicability of charges of Section 27A of the NDPS Act against the two. In Rhea’s plea, the defence stated, “The allegations against the present accused would at the most make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug, which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender, and hence the ingredients of Section 27A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances.”The defence also alleged that even though the role attributed to Rhea and her brother Showik is identical to that of another accused, Kaizan Ebrahim, NCB selectively invoked charges of Section 27A only against Rhea and Showik. Ebrahim was released on provisional cash bail on the very first day of his remand by the magistrate court, the defence pointed out.The pleas were opposed by the prosecution, claiming that all the persons accused are connected and each case cannot be looked at in isolation. The agency said that the quantity of the entire contraband seized from all the accused persons, as per law, becomes commercial, in which case, the offence is non-bailable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-could-move-high-court-next-week-after-bail-plea-rejected/story-n0AkLuM3BdPhtvc7El1UYP.html

Today the truth is that marksheet has become a mental pressure sheet for students and prestige sheet for families. NEP’s goal is to remove this pressure,” PM Modi said while addressing a national conclave on school education.PM Modi said marks and marksheet have so far dominated learning-based education in India, adding that the students have to be ready themselves with skills to cope with the 21st century.“These will be: critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, curiosity, communication. We have to increase easy and innovative methods. Our experiment should be the core of new-age learning. Engage, explore, experience, express and excel,” he said.The Prime Minister stressed that NEP 2020 was just the beginning of the long process and its success would be determined by its effective implementation in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marksheet-is-pressure-sheet-for-students-prestige-sheet-for-families-pm-modi/story-lrqNSNhbxbxenauqjO5VoN.html
11-09-2020||India||Pak needs to take irreversible action against terror groups: Indo-US joint statement||India and the US have called on Pakistan to take “immediate, sustained and irreversible action” to ensure that Pakistani territory isn’t used for terror attacks and to speedily bring to justice the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot attacks.The two countries also underscored the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including al-Qaida, Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).Also read: US keeps India on ‘do not travel’ list over pandemicThese issues figured in the 17th meeting of the US-India Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and the third session of the Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10, according a joint statement.Both sides denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms. They also exchanged views on threats posed by United Nations (UN)-sanctioned terrorist entities, the statement said.“The two sides underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot,” the statement said.The 2008 Mumbai attacks, which were carried out by a 10-member team of the LeT from Pakistan, left 166 people dead, including six US nationals.Pakistani security agencies arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, for allegedly planning, financing and supporting the attacks but there has been little progress in their trial in a counter-terrorism court.The 2016 Pathankot attack, blamed on JeM, targeted an Indian Air Force (IAF) base and resulted in the death of seven Indian troops.During the dialogue, India and the US also shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions and designations against terror groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India, the statement said.There was a joint commitment to strengthen cooperation on information-sharing and other steps to disrupt the ability of international terrorists to travel, in line with the provisions and obligations outlined in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSC) 2396.Officials of the two sides highlighted their efforts to address some of the world’s most pressing counter-terrorism challenges, including countering the financing and operations of terrorist organisations, countering radicalisation and terrorist use of the internet, cross-border movement of terrorists, and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning terrorist fighters and family members.The two sides also discussed mutual legal and extradition assistance, and bilateral law enforcement training and cooperation.The US reiterated its support for the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism.Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary for counter-terrorism in the External Affairs Ministry (MA), and Nathan A Sales, the US State Department coordinator for counter-terrorism, led the two delegations in what the statements described as a “far-reaching conversation on counter-terrorism cooperation”.The two sides also resolved to continue close coordination on “this important element of the comprehensive global strategic partnership” between India and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-counter-terror-talks-seek-pakistan-action-against-perpetrators-of-terror-attacks/story-nxe03Ad4DpVLSbjrDYQMCL.html
11-09-2020||India||Let virtual courts continue post pandemic, recommends parliamentary committee||A parliamentary panel has recommended continuation of virtual courts in certain categories of cases like appeals and final hearings with the consent of the parties involved even after the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it will pave way for cheaper and faster means of delivery of justice as a court is more a service than a place. Also Read: Virtual courts can aid in distributive justice by ensuring accessibility and affordability: Bhupender YadavIt has suggested permanent virtual proceedings for appellate tribunals like Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal, Intellectual Property Appellate Tribunal, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, etc. “This will cut down the cost and increase the efficiency in disposal of the cases without being unnecessarily being adjourned. Virtual courts can deliver faster results with fewer resources. They can also reduce commute time to courts and waiting time at the courts,” the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice said in an interim report submitted to Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday.The report underlined digital justice is “cheaper and faster”. The panel added it addresses locational and economic handicaps, ensures the safety of vulnerable witnesses providing testimony besides expediting processes and procedures.The Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Bhupender Yadav-led panel said virtual courts are an improvement over traditional ones “as they are most affordable, citizen-friendly and offer greater access to justice”.Court proceedings have been held digitally for over five months to adhere to social distancing norms as part of the measures to check the spread of the pandemic. The Supreme Court late last month notified standard operating procedures (SOPs) to govern physical court hearings which were expected to commence soon. The physical hearings of matters are expected to initially begin only in three courtrooms, the SOPs said. The court was expected to take a call on how many lawyers and litigants will be permitted inside the courtroom, depending on the capacity and physical distancing norms.Physical hearings of cases in the Supreme Court were suspended on March 23 in view of the pandemic. The apex court has been hearing cases via video conferencing since then. The top court issued a circular on March 23 suspending entry of lawyers and litigants to the court premises and directing that only urgent cases will be taken up for hearing through video conferencing.The panel’s recommendations have come even as various Bar councils have questioned the efficacy of the digital proceedings and pointed out the limitations of the infrastructure required for them. They have said digital proceedings favour tech-savvy advocates besides depriving opportunities to many lawyers to change the course of arguments based on the changing dynamics of a case during hearings.In their submissions to the panel, the councils said over 50% of advocates, mostly at the district and lower levels, do not own laptops or computers and lack the skills required for virtual proceedings.The report maintained virtual courts and hearing cases through video conferencing have gained immense ground during the pandemic and will remain a new reality and new normal. It added virtual courts will promote access to justice since litigants in remote areas will be able to access the Supreme Court without spending money on travel to Delhi. “Litigants need not leave their work to attend court as they can access proceedings from their home or office. It facilitates a lawyer to argue in any court in India. A lawyer can argue in one court in the morning and be present in another court later in the day. It thereby creates a level playing field between the affluent and less well off.”The panel has suggested necessary amendments to the law to give legal validity to virtual courts and their proceedings so that they are not questioned before courts.As many as 13 out of the 25 high courts in the country have introduced and enabled electronic filing of cases. But the district and subordinate courts at many places have been lagging behind due to lack of infrastructure and experience in handling and transitioning to virtual hearings.The committee acknowledged the difficulties in the report and said massive investments would be required to put in place the infrastructure necessary to support the digitised hearings. It has suggested the feasibility of new financing approaches like the public-private partnership model for the purpose.The committee said the transfer of certain categories of cases from regular to virtual courts will reduce the pendency of cases. “[The] Committee feels that the present system should be allowed to continue on an experimental basis with the consent of all parties for certain categories of cases like Appeals etc and final hearings where the physical presence of the parties/counsels is not required and online virtual hearing alone is sufficient. The expenditure involved in the establishment of a large number of Tribunals /Courts can be cut down sizeably. This will also reduce the crowd in the court and cut down other litigation costs and overheads,” the report said.The report said that virtual courts will make court services accessible to all. “No member of the general public should be disadvantaged by locational or economic handicaps or otherwise. The Committee is of the opinion that Digital Justice is cheaper and faster. People living in remote and far-flung areas can also take part in Court proceedings.’The committee said one of the principal benefits of virtual courts will be that they will expedite processes and procedures which would otherwise be protracted and laborious. “Virtual Courts can deliver results faster and with fewer resources. Virtual Courts help in concise, pointed, and focused arguing by lawyers making the system faster,” the report said.The panel said there is no mechanism currently to segregate simple cases from complex ones involving cumbersome procedures and multiple witnesses. “The principle of Proportionate Justice requires that the expense, speed, complexity, and the extent of combativeness of any case should be proportionate to the substance and scale of that case. Petty cases should be dealt with swiftly in a reasonable timeframe. Such cases should not require cumbersome procedures.”Virtual courts, the report said, can address this issue. The committee concluded that physical courts alone will not be sufficient. It added virtual courts will have to be integrated into the country’s legal ecosystem. As a first step towards this, the judiciary should identify cases that can be heard by virtual courts, it suggested.“The Committee is of the view that all such matters where personal presence may be dispensed with can be transferred from regular Court establishments to Virtual Courts. ...Virtual adjudication will bring massive benefits across the system,” the committee said.It also recommended extending virtual courts to cover arbitration hearings. “For instance, if national and international arbitrations are allowed to be conducted through Virtual Courts, there will be hardly any requirement for real-time travel to distant locations. ...this move will unlock the Courts and also mitigate the inconvenience of attending Courts as long-distance travel can be dispensed with and proceedings become less expensive as well.”The other recommendations include setting up of E-Sewa Kendras at all court complexes, speedy execution of National Broadband Mission, the introduction of computer courses for law students, and developing an indigenous software platform to ensure data privacy and safety. The panel has also suggested providing a Wide Area Network facility, adoption of machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc for a transformational change in the dispensation of justice.“The Committee believes that ‘Justice delayed is Justice denied’ but ‘Justice hurried is also Justice buried’. The Committee is of the view that Virtual Courts is a mechanism that will strike a balance between these two extremes and extend expeditious Justice to the litigant public without compromising quality. The Committee feels that transfer of certain categories of cases from regular Court establishments to Virtual Courts will reduce the pendency of cases which has been clogging the wheels of Justice for decades,” the report said.Yadav referred to virtual courts in countries like the US and Singapore and said they have also done a lot of work on aspects like the conduct of remand matters virtually to prevent the movement of prisoners between courts and jails. “We have effectively used virtual courts during the lockdown period wherein more than 1.8 million cases were registered across the country, of which nearly 800,000 have been disposed of.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-virtual-courts-post-pandemic-parliamentary-committee/story-v3zw0wuA2ua3fcI0qG5H4H.html
11-09-2020||India||Virtual courts can aid in distributive justice by ensuring accessibility and affordability: Bhupender Yadav||A department-related standing committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice headed by Bhupender Yadav, a member of the Rajya Sabha (RS) and the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Friday suggested that virtual court proceedings should be allowed to continue beyond the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as well. The panel said virtual proceedings can be extended permanently to various appellate tribunals such as Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) etc located across the country, which do not require personal appearances of the parties and advocates. In an interview to HT, Yadav spoke about the need for virtual courts and what interventions are needed on the ground to make them work. Edited excerpts: Are virtual courts here to stay? There is no alternative to physical courts. Courts are a place for administration of justice. Virtual courts provide services in terms of filing of documents, presenting evidence and other procedural mechanisms. It can at best be called a supplemental toolkit for speedy and effective dispensation of justice by reducing the pendency of cases. The idea is to find a balance between dispensation of justice, pendency of cases and giving speedy justice to the public. There were concerns expressed by the Bar Council of India (BCI) and Delhi High Court Bar Association that virtual courts may leave out many litigants who are poor with no access to the internet. How have you addressed that? It is true that a majority of advocates and litigants, especially from the rural parts of the country, do not have adequate infrastructure such as computers, laptops and high-speed internet connection required for virtual hearing of cases. This problem spans across accessibility, connectivity and want of skill and knowledge quotients. The main challenge is to bridge the divide in terms of accessibility, connectivity and skill-set required to use digital platforms. To address these issues, many steps such as establishment of e-seva kendras in the HCs and in district courts to provide assistance and information to lawyers and litigants and facilitating e-filing have been taken.

From technological advancement the earliest reference of virtual courts is found in other parts of the world and countries such as the United States of America (USA) and Singapore have used them. We have also done a lot of work on this aspect like conducting remand matters through virtual courts to prevent movement of prisoners between courts and jails. We have effectively used virtual courts during the Covid-19-induced lockdown period, where more than 18 lakh cases were registered across the country, of which nearly eight lakhs have been disposed of. So, we will use the technology for the administration of justice in our case as well. In the absence of a vaccine for Covid-19, there is a perception that the pandemic is here to stay. Courts being places where social distancing norms are hard to practice; how does the committee plan on striking a balance between virtual and regular hearings? We are amid a pandemic but certainly have to resume our normal functioning. There is no denying that technology is very effective in ensuring transparency and good governance. After the 1990s, our laws have developed more on the regulatory mechanisms framework. Especially with the coming of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and other such laws have helped us improve our ease of doing business rankings. We have to strike a balance between effective dispensation of justice and expedited disposal of cases. Thus, under Phase II of e-court projects we propose to have dedicated central video conferencing infrastructure for courts, advocates, strengthening of e-filing infrastructure and many other things. But in all this, lawyers are essential stakeholders and they will be part of every consultative and decision-making process.

Do you see a role for virtual courts here? Justice delayed is justice denied, but justice hurried is also justice buried. I believe that virtual courts can be an effective medium to balance between these two extremes and provide expeditious and quality justice. We can transfer certain categories of cases to virtual courts to effectively reduce the pendency of overburdened physical courts. Virtual courts can aid us in distributive justice by ensuring accessibility and affordability and location and economic factors should not be an impediment for those people living in remote and far-flung areas from access to justice. The virtual courts would also help achieve our national commitment of achieving sustainable development goal (SDG) targets such as access to justice for all..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virtual-courts-can-aid-in-distributive-justice-by-ensuring-accessibility-and-affordability-bhupender-yadav/story-7bEtsBqqWL2kjTxMqTh8zK.html

Ranaut was provided Y-plus category security cover by Centre on recommendation of Himachal Pradesh government after the actor, who is originally from Mandi in the Himalayan state, said she had been threatened by Shiv Sena of physical harm when she returned to Mumbai. Claiming there was a serious threat to actor’s life, the BJP MLA from Loni assembly segment of Ghaziabad district alleged that Ranaut’s office was demolished by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on the instructions of mafia don Dawood Ibrahim.

This is the crucial outcome of a terse meeting between external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.“The immediate task is to ensure a comprehensive disengagement of troops in all friction areas so that there are no untoward incidents in future. The final disposition of the troop deployment to their permanent posts and the phasing of the process is to be worked out by military commanders on the ground. That de-escalation should follow comprehensive disengagement was agreed to by State Councillor Wang Yi,” said a senior government official.Also read | India forging key ties, with an eye on ChinaWhile state councillor and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi wanted the bilateral ties to continue on a parallel track with on-going border friction in East Ladakh, he had no answers to probing questions from EAM Jaishankar who asked him about the immense build-up by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in occupied Aksai Chin. At present, the PLA has deployed more than 50,000 men, 150 aircraft, tanks and missiles to pressurize Indian Army on the LAC. .china_wrap {width:auto; border:dashed 1px #999; padding:10px; font-family:"Open Sans", sans-serif; font-size:120%; background-color:#E5E5E5}.china_headline {width:auto; margin-bottom:5px; font-size:160%; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing:-1px}.china_subheadline {width:auto; margin-bottom:5px; font-size:120%}.china_space {width:auto; margin:15px}.clrboth {clear:both; margin:5px}According to authoritative government sources, Jaishankar made it very clear to councillor Wang that positive bilateral ties in the past two decades were due to peace on the border and the PLA build-up had a direct implication on the relationship between two countries. “Jaishankar put across to Wang that good things in bilateral relations were due to peaceful borders, just as the relations will deteriorate if the borders are not quiet,” said a senior official.Although state councillor Wang could not explain the sudden PLA build-up in the area in contravention with the 1993-96 agreement, he only talked about thinning of troops in the depth areas.Also read | India bulks up amid provocation by China’s People’s Liberation Army“The five-point joint statement are the issues on which the two sides agreed for disengagement on the border.

EAM Jaishankar said that the two sides should abide by the past agreements and protocols to make the border peaceful,” said an official from Moscow.However, EAM Jaishankar was candid enough to tell his Chinese counterpart that there was no point of thinning troops in the depth areas when the front-line troops are at each other’s throats. The two ministers will now go back to the respective political leadership to get directions issued that comprehensive disengagement from all friction points will be the first step towards restoring peace to the border. “Given the upgrade of Chinese infrastructure in border areas as compared to India, the mutual disengagement is a must before thinning in-depth or else the PLA will occupy dominant heights on Line of Actual Control (LAC) faster than Indian Army,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-disengagement-in-ladakh-is-first-step-before-de-escalation/story-VXKk8JRpU8rM8JK4Mulj3L.html
11-09-2020||India||ICMR publishes first sero survey results; 6.4 million were likely Covid-19 infected around May||India had 6.4 million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients by early May when samples were collected for the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) first national sero-survey to detect prevalence of the viral disease, according to the findings that were published three months after the results were first made public in June. In percentage, the national prevalence was found to be 0.73%. The worst-affected were those between the age group of 18 and 45 years, as 43.3% had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. While Covid-19 patients in the age group between 46 and 60 years accounted for 39.5% of the sampled individuals. Altogether, 30,283 households were surveyed and 28,000 individuals had enrolled for the study. “Population-weighted sero-prevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 %. Males, who were living in urban slums and with high-risk of exposure to potentially infected persons, were associated with sero-positivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections were estimated in India by early May,” said the findings. A total of 151 (0.5%) individuals reported contact history with a Covid-19 patient and 70 (0.3%) reported that they were tested for the viral infection before the survey. From May 11 to June 4, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages and wards, which were selected from 70 districts in 21 states of the country. The samples were categorised into four strata based on the incidence of reported Covid-19 cases. The survey had enrolled 400 adults per district from 10 clusters and an adult per household. Serum samples were tested for Immunoglobulin G (IgG), a type of a long-lasting antibody, using the Covid-19 Kavach ELISA detection kit. The sero-prevalence ranged between 0.62 and 1.03% across the four strata of these districts. The published paper shows that the IgG antibodies against the viral infection start appearing by the end of the first week after the onset of the symptom and most cases are IgG positive by the end of the second week, according to the researchers. The findings were published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-publishes-first-sero-survey-results-6-4-million-were-likely-covid-19-infected-around-may/story-FAKW5iR14gZ4OgFqa8f8xN.html

West-central India is likely to record above normal rainfall between September 18 and 24. Two low-pressure areas are likely to develop in the next two weeks. The first one will develop near the northern Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast around September 13, which will move along Telangana, Vidarbha, and other parts of Maharashtra bringing in heavy rainfall. Another low-pressure area is likely to develop over west-central Bay of Bengal around September 17 accompanying another spell of heavy rainfall.Drastic rainfall reduction was recorded until September 11. Most parts of the country remained dry except for the southern peninsula. Dry spell over north-west India led to maximum temperatures, as Bikaner in western Rajasthan recorded 39.4 degrees Celsius (C) on September 9.“We have no signal of monsoon withdrawal yet,” said Anand Sharma, the IMD scientist, who presented the weekly weather forecast.“Rainfall will increase over peninsular India over the next few days. From Kerala and Karnataka, rains will shift to AP and then to Maharashtra. Rainfall in September is likely to range between normal and above normal, as the four-month-long south-west monsoon prepares for a withdrawal. A low-pressure area is likely to develop around September 13, which will bring rain and then we are expecting another low-pressure area to develop around September 17. There will be more rainfall in the week ending September 24. Rains are likely to pick up in the second half of September,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.In September, monsoon rain until 9th of the month is 29% deficient across the country.However, rainfall was 35% excess over peninsular India during this period.

It was found the lowest among those aged over 60 (17.2%).“The findings of our survey indicated that the overall seroprevalence in India was low , with less than 1% of the adult population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-May 2020,” the survey report said.“The low prevalence observed in most districts indicates that India is in early phase of the epidemic and the majority of the Indian population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the report further stressed.Based on the overall seroprevalence of 0.73% and the reported number of Covid-19 cases, it was estimated that for every RT-PCR confirmed case of Covid-19, there were 82-130 infections in India.As part of the survey, a total of 30,283 households were visited from 700 clusters in 70 districts. The stratification of the districts as zero cases (15 districts), low (22), medium (16) and high (17) was done on the basis of the reported number of Covid-19 cases as on April 25.India is the currently the second worst-hit country after the United States with a total of 44,65,863 Covid-19 cases thus far.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-4-million-covid-19-cases-were-estimated-in-india-by-early-may-says-first-national-serosurvey-report/story-LtxRYdILJQ2wvXjK6RsyWI.html

Viswam sought formulation of regulations in order to ensure that data collected on UPI platform is not exploited or utilized by the participants in any manner other than for processing the payments. He also prayed that directions should be issued to Google India, Amazon Pay (India) and WhatsApp to ensure that data collected by them on UPI platform is not shared with their parent company or any third party.“Recently, for such allegations, CEOs of these foreign entities were directed to testify before the Judicial Committee of US Congress . During the hearing, US Congress members raised concerns about mishandling of data by the big tech firms,” the plea said.The Supreme Court is already seized of a case relating to non-compliance with data localization norms by Whatsapp. Another petition filed in February by legal think tank, Good Governance Chambers challenging expansion of Whatsapp into the digital payments systems in India through UPI is also pending before the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-supreme-court-over-data-protection-in-upi-platforms/story-NIYg1zRyhJ2UCGOO1xAKsL.html

11-09-2020||India||Odisha forest officer dives into pond to salvage smuggled timber||An Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer of Odisha dived into a village pond to recover priceless sal timbers worth Rs 4 lakh even as scores of villagers resisted his attempt at salvaging the smuggled log.Dhamdhere Dhanraj Hanumant, a 2016-batch IFS officer and now divisional forest officer of Nayagarh forest division on Monday evening was tipped off about large sal logs being smuggled into Dhushma village, a den of notorious timber smugglers.He informed the forest ranger and asked him to rush to the spot and verify. When he called back to say that the logs had been taken away, he asked him to follow the drag marks on the road as the villagers drag the logs using buffaloes. “He said the drag marks were not there. When I personally went to the village, I saw the marks disappearing near a pond. I told my staff to enter the pond and recover the logs as they would be there. But no one was ready to go. They were scared as a few years ago the timber mafia had killed a forester and injured five forest officials. So there was fear among our staff who said the local villagers would gherao them,” said Hanumant.By 10 pm the local villagers had gathered and insisted that Hanumant and his staff can’t enter the pond at night as it was illegal. “Most of the people of the village are notorious timber smugglers. They told me it was night time and you can’t enter our pond just like that. You can come in day time. I told them that I don’t care if it is day or night as they have illegally cut the timber from Barbara and Gochha forest bordering the neighbouring Khurda district. When I entered the pond, the logs were submerged. Seeing me enter, my staff also joined me. We recovered around 200 cubic ft of sal timber worth Rs 4 lakh,” said the officer. The sal logs were 3 ft in girth and around 100 years old.Even after seizure of sal logs, the villagers tried to drag the seized timbers but the presence of police force prevented the attempt. However, not a single villager could be booked as the names of the offenders are yet to be known. The DFO said he suspected at least 15 persons of the village could be involved.Hanumant agreed that the protection of forest may not be happening as it should be. “There are lacunae from Nayagarh and Khurda side. The timber smugglers are cutting and dragging inside the jungle for 12-14 km. They have mastered the skills of cutting and dragging. Though we have reduced smuggling by employing more squads, we still have lots to do,” said the agriculture graduate from GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology in Uttarakhand.Sandeep Tripathy, Odisha’s principal chief conservator of forest, said Hanumant showed leadership quality in salvaging the smuggled timber. “We expect all our forest staff to be as dedicated as him. We have been stressing on foot patrolling by our ground staff to check timber smuggling across forests in the state,” said Tripathy.Though tree cover of Odisha has increased by 655 sq km as per the 2019 forest survey report compared to 2017, timber smuggling continues to be a major headache of Odisha forest department. Last week, the president of a forest protection committee in Keonjhar was caught while trying to smuggle sal wood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-forest-officer-dives-into-pond-to-salvage-smuggled-timber/story-hFioryGHkWbWlZpGBJWjbJ.html
11-09-2020||India||Several senior leaders may skip monsoon session due to Covid-19||Many senior lawmakers are likely to give the much-awaited monsoon session of Parliament a miss, on account of fears of exposing themselves to the coronavirus disease even as Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha authorities are doing everything they can to ensure a safe session. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, according to his office, will attend the inaugural day of the session on September 14 but might be uncertain for the remaining part of the session, which goes on till October 1, as his doctors have strictly advised him against leaving his home. Singh is 87. Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already decided that some of her MPs who are old or suffer from ailments will not attend Parliament. Trinamool’s Lok Sabha floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay will not come to Delhi but will guide the MPs from Kolkata.Bandopadhyay, whose official bungalow in Delhi has been devastated due to rains, said: “Our leader is very cautious about our health. She told me not to go to Delhi in this situation.” According to Trinamool officials, two of its MPs who are former UPA ministers—Sisir Adhikary and Choudhury Mohan Jatua — may also skip this session. Adhikary is 78 and Jatua, 82.Rajya Sabha officials said that the Trinamool has also officially informed the secretariat that two of its MPs from the Upper House would not come.Congress leaders added that former defence minister AK Antony, 79, may not attend the House daily but be there on some days. Similarly, Congress leader and former UPA minister Vayalar Ravi, 83, too may not attend the house every day. Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has left for the US for a routine health check. Both Antony and Ravi are members of the Rajya Sabha. The average age of Lok Sabha MPs is 54 and that of Rajya Sabha MPs, 63. Older people, especially those with co-morbidities, and men are at greater risk from Covid-19. Men account for 85.6% of Lok Sabha MPs and 89% of Rajya Sabha MPs. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu have started personally overseeing all preparations. On Thursday, Birla spent a few minutes in the gallery of the Lok Sabha to supervise how MPs will participate in the proceedings.As a matter of abundant caution, Birla has decided that not many physical copies of papers will be available in the chamber and MPs will mark their attendance in an app and not physically sign in a log book.It has been also decided that not all ministers will be required to lay their documents in the House and that on behalf of his ministerial colleagues, the parliamentary affairs minister will lay the papers.“Adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that the session is held in a smooth manner by ensuring compliance with all Covid-19 related health and safety guidelines,” Birla said on Thursday.While many Opposition leaders and experts have criticised the decision to scrap Question Hour, Birla said: “Parliament represents the hopes and aspirations of our countrymen and even in the present scenario and it will fulfil its constitutional responsibility of ensuring accountability of the government.” There will be seating arrangements for 257 members in the Lok Sabha hall and 172 members in the Lok Sabha galleries. Arrangements have been made for seating 60 members in the Rajya Sabha hall and 51 members in Rajya Sabha galleriesAll lawmakers, officials and journalists covering Parliament will be required to undertake RT-PCR tests before coming to Parliament. Facilities to conduct tests have been set up across the capital and Birla has also ensured that no visitors will be allowed in the complex. “Even the private assistants to MPs and ministers can’t go inside the main parliament building. Government officials who come to parliament can’t bring their car inside,” Birla said.Meanwhile, as tests are underway among parliament officials, senior officials added that about 50 House officials have been tested positive for Covid. “They have been sent into isolation and their offices are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. We are not taking any risk,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-senior-leaders-may-skip-monsoon-session-due-to-covid/story-x2eCIvBOBTvWjv1QorIyYK.html
11-09-2020||India||India nears a grim landmark in Covid-19 cases||India on Thursday added 99,181 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it continued to set new global records for daily cases, inching closer to the sombre threshold of 100,000 cases in a day.The total number of cases in the country touched 4,559,710, data compiled by HT from across the states on Thursday night showed.The virus’ spread has been accelerating in the world’s second-most populous country, with worrying trends emerging, particularly due to the persistently rising number of active cases. At 945,771 on Thursday night, this number inched towards the million mark — a level breached only by the United States that continues to lead in terms of total infections seen till date.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarlier in the day, the global death toll crossed 900,000. Of this, 76,303 are in India, even though the country has logged a relatively lower case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.7% – the proportion of those who died among confirmed cases – compared to the global average of 3.2%.In the seven-day period between September 3 and September 10, India reported 90,195 new Covid-19 cases every day on average. Two months ago (for the week ending July 10), this number was 24,566 cases a day, and it was 58,742 daily infections a month ago for the week ending August 10.In contrast, even when the pandemic was at its peak in the United States (end of July), this number never crossed 70,000 cases a day. US is the worst-hit country in the world with over 6.5 million cases.The national doubling rate – the number of days it takes for a given number of infections to double – has not improved in the last two weeks and has hovered around 32 days. One of the key reasons for the continuously rising daily cases is that the pandemic has shown no signs of relenting even in the country’s worst-hit regions. States such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (at the 1st, 2nd and 4th spot with 990,795; 537,687; and 430,947 cases respectively) continue to drive the number of daily cases. A little under half (45%) of all infections in India in the last week have come from just these three states. In fact, three out of every four infections in the country in the last week have come from 10 states.Daily cases have also hit a new peak in the last two weeks in Delhi, which was one of the only major hot spot states to have brought the outbreak under control. The capital reported 4,308 new cases on Wednesday, albeit on the back of a record number of tests: 58,340.Higher testing has also been one of the key reasons for this rapid rise in cases throughout the country. On average, the country has tested more than a million samples a day through the past two weeks, and this trend is continuously increasing.However, despite the increase in testing, many major states continue to have high positivity rates, a factor that experts said was alarming. The positivity rate shows how widespread the virus is in a region. Nearly a quarter (24%) of all tests in Maharashtra have been positive for Covid-19 in the last week, in Andhra Pradesh more than 15% of all tests have come back positive and for Karnataka this number was around 13%. The high positivity rates in these states indicate that infection numbers there may not be dropping soon, and that they are still not testing adequately. The majority of the cases has been coming from rural areas in the last month where health care challenges, from testing to treatment, are much more significant, HT reported on August 26. The trend is very different from what was seen in the initial months of the pandemic, when the cases were largely in the urban areas.Experts said that the larger focus of the governments, despite the rapid increase in cases, has to remain on keeping the mortality as low as possible. “It is not surprising that the number of cases is increasing day by day. The infection has now spread to most parts of the country and we cannot contain it any longer. The cases will keep going up till a peak is reached. However, this peak will be different for different places. Now, many cases are being reported from smaller cities and rural areas that had not been affected previously. The important thing is to focus on reducing the mortality,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor in the department of community medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“India has a three-tier health care system, with most rural areas having access to a primary health care centre, wellness centre, or a sub-centre. These centres are usually run by paramedical staff and not doctors. And while 80% of Covid-19 patients require no medical attention at all, the remaining need high attention with proper monitoring or ICU (intensive care unit) admission. This cannot be done at primary health care centre. Plus, 70% of our healthcare is provided by private hospitals concentrated in larger cities. So, I expect the mortality to increase a little with the disease affecting rural areas,” he added.

11-09-2020||India||India, China ministers meet for key talks in Moscow amid tension on border||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi met for crucial talks in Moscow on Thursday evening with hopes of making a breakthrough in the face of a spike in tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) after both countries amassed more troops in the Ladakh sector. The two leaders were in the same room twice earlier in the day – first for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and then for a luncheon meeting of the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping – before they began their bilateral talks a little after 8pm Indian time. The meeting continued for almost two hours, people familiar with developments said. There was no word from the external affairs ministry on the bilateral meeting, which was seen as crucial for ending the impasse in the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC after five rounds of talks each by military commanders and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs since June. However, in marked contrast to the studied silence from the Indian side on the meetings in Moscow, China’s state-run media kept up its propaganda even as the talks between Jaishankar and Wang were underway. Before meeting Jaishankar, Wang held a bilateral meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi. A readout from the foreign ministry in Islamabad quoted Qureshi as saying that Pakistan “stands firmly behind China on core issues of its national interest”. Qureshi also said that “India’s expansionist and unilateral actions, particularly since 5 August 2019, have been imperilling regional peace and security”, according to the readout. India did not immediately issue a statement .There have been face-offs between India and China on the south bank of Pangong Lake after Chinese troops carried out what were described as provocative military movements to change the status quo during August 29-30. The latest face-off occurred on September 7, when Chinese soldiers fired in the air after they were dissuaded from closing in on an Indian forward position – the first time guns were used at the LAC since 1975. Since then, both sides have further strengthened their military presence in the region by moving in additional troops, tanks and other weaponry. The Chinese side, however, has been rattled by India’s proactive move of positioning its troops on several strategic heights to prevent further land grabs on the south bank of Pangong Lake. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly virtual media briefing that both sides are in “regular touch” through military and diplomatic channels to resolve the border situation, and this was also the consensus when defence minister Rajnath Singh met his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe on the margins of another SCO meeting in Moscow last Friday. India’s position continues to be the resolution of the border standoff through peaceful negotiations, Srivastava added. A joint statement on the RIC foreign ministers’ meeting said Jaishankar, Wang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov exchanged views on strengthening trilateral cooperation and topical issues of international and regional importance in the spirit of mutual understanding, friendship and trust. They noted that “common development and cooperation of the three countries is conducive to promoting global growth, peace and stability”, according to the statement. They also reiterated their “support for inclusive multilateralism and respect for universally recognised principles of international law”. Lavrov officially handed over chairmanship of RIC to Jaishankar during the meeting. But China’s nationalist Global Times tabloid tweeted a photo released by the National Defense Journal that shows PLA troops patrolling an area along the disputed border and noted slogans in Mandarin on a cliff read “never to yield an inch of our beautiful rivers and mountains”. The tabloid also posted a link to an editorial in a tweet that said: “Facts have proven Indian nationalist forces yield to coercion, but not to persuasion. They very much need another lesson in failure before believing China’s commitment to long-term border peace is not weakness.” In yet another tweet, Global Times cited analysts as saying that if the “China-India foreign ministers’ meeting fails to reach a positive result, or the two sides cannot execute the reached agreement at the front line, this could be a dangerous signal that China and India are unlikely to solve the crisis peacefully”. Hu Xijin, the editor of the tabloid, said in a tweet that if Indian troops “don’t withdraw from the southern bank of Pangong Tso Lake, the PLA will confront them all winter long”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-ministers-meet-as-tensions-soar/story-xN4bFPZGJdTpDFqKgeWPRK.html
11-09-2020||India||RJD leader quits, Lalu says ‘you aren’t leaving’||PATNA: Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh resigned from the party on a bitter note on Thursday, more than two months after quitting as its national vice president, stoking speculation that he could join the ruling Janata Dal ( United) ahead of upcoming assembly polls in Bihar. Singh, 74, sent a handwritten resignation letter addressed to RJD chief Lalu Prasad. The veteran socialist leader is undergoing treatment at the Intensive Care Unit unit of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for some recent ailments. Copies of the letter were distributed to media outlets by his aides. Attempts to reach him on the phone through his close aides in Delhi were unsuccessful. “ Yes, Raghuvansh ji has resigned from the RJD. It is confirmed ,” said Ashok Singh, an aide to the former member of Parliament.Hours after Singh quit the party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad responded in a statement issued by the party. “One letter written by you is circulating in the media. I cannot believe it. Me, my family and the RJD family want to see you recover soon. We will talk after you recover. You are not going anywhere. Just mind it,” Yadav said. The RJD chief ‘s statement underlines how the RJD is still making last ditch attempts to mollify Singh and keep him in the party. RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary declined to comment on Singh’s exit. In his letter, Singh expressed his pain over leaving the party, underlining his socialist background, loyalty to and long association with the RJD chief. “ I have stood solidly behind you for 32 years after the death of Jannayak Karpoori Thakur. But not anymore. I have received lots of affection from the party, supporters and people. Forgive me,” he wrote. The exit of Singh is seen as a setback for the RJD, which has been trying to patch up with the five- term Vaishali MP and prominent Rajput face after he opposed the imminent induction of another former MP, Rama Singh. Rama Singh also is a strong Rajput leader from Vaishali. Singh, who held the rural development ministry in the first term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, steering its flagship rural jobs guarantee scheme, has been upset with the RJD leadership for many reasons, including the denial of a Rajya Sabha berth after he lost the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls. The appointment of another Rajput leader and former MP, Jagdanand Singh, as RJD’s state president last year did not go down well with Singh, who also opposed the RJD’s decision to project of leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Lalu Prasad’s son, as the CM face. People familiar with the situation in RJD said the veteran socialist’s decision to quit the party has much to do with the likely induction of Rama Singh in the coming days;he may have realised that staying put in the party could undermine his stature in his own home turf and in the party hierarchy, the people said, requesting anonymity. Singh’s decision to exit from the RJD triggered speculation about his next course of action. The political grapevine is abuzz that he may join the JD(U) and could be offered a Rajya Sabha berth or made a member of the legislative council from the governor’s quota in the coming days. There is also speculation that Singh could be made chairman of the Bihar legislative council. Awadhesh Narain Singh is acting chairman of the council. The possibility of Singh joining the National Democratic Alliance was evident from the reactions of JD(U) and its partner in the Bihar government, the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP).Senior JD(U) leader and MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, alias Lallan Singh, said: “ RJD could not give respect to one of the prominent socialist leaders of Bihar though the party talks big about protecting the dignity of masses. I salute Singh for leaving the RJD, which is stuck in the quagmire of arrogance and corruption,” he said. BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said Singh was a very respected leader of the state but had been insulted by the RJD. “ Singh commands respect across all parties. But the veteran socialist was insulted by the RJD, which used him for long and then dumped him.” D M Diwakar, a political observer and former director of the A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies in Patna, said the veteran socialist was unlikely to leave the RJD, noting that his resignation had not been accepted and Lalu Prasad had made a fervent appeal to his old-time colleague to stay in the party. “I still feel Raghuvansh would go nowhere and stay in the RJD. This I say because Raghuvansh has played principled politics all his life and raised issues, no matter if it has offended the party’s top leaders. He is not one who believes in opportunistic politics and there is no party which is free from certain shortcomings or faults,” Diwakar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-leader-quits-lalu-says-you-aren-t-leaving/story-RMHd6K8yuCgMmOTSTUttfI.html
11-09-2020||India||Retest symptomatic patients negative in rapid tests: Govt||The Union health ministry on Thursday again directed states to mandatorily retest using the confirmatory reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, all people with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) symptoms who test negative in rapid antigen tests -- a move aimed at addressing the inadequacies of the latter. The ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have jointly written to states after complaints were received that in some states , symptomatic patients testing negative in an antigen test were not being retested using a molecular test such as RT-PCR , increasing the risk of transmission. “…the Union Health Ministry and ICMR have jointly written to all the States/UTs and urged them to ensure that all symptomatic negative cases of RAT (Rapid Antigen Test) are mandatorily retested using the RT-PCR test. This is necessary to ensure that such symptomatic negative cases do not remain untested and do not spread the disease among their contacts,” the health ministry said in a statement. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response in the body in the form of production of antibodies against a disease, and detecting its presence through an antigen-based test determines a current infection. These tests are quick, usually providing results within the hour, making them ideal for use in containment zones, airports and railway stations, and public places where the constraint is time. Unfortunately, many Indian states have been using them indiscriminately. These tests provide a high proportion of false negatives -- a term that means people infected by the virus are shown as uninfected. Abbot Laboratories recently launched an accurate antigen test but it is not available in India. The use of confirmatory RT-PCR tests will “ ensure early detection and isolation/hospitalization of such false negatives. It has also been reiterated in the joint letter that while the RAT is being used to increase access and availability of testing in the field, RT-PCR remains the gold standard of COVID tests,” the ministry added in the statement. States have also been asked to urgently establish a monitoring mechanism in each district, and at the state level, with a designated officer or a team, to follow up such cases.“These teams shall analyse details of RAT conducted on a daily basis in the Districts and State and ensure that there are no delays in retesting of all symptomatic negative cases. The aim of States/UTs should be to ensure that no potentially positive case is missed out. They have also been advised to undertake an analysis on a regular basis to monitor the incidence of positives during the RT-PCR tests conducted as a follow up,” the ministry said in its statement. The contents of the statement are essentially a reiteration of an existing guideline -- one that many states flout with impunity. Accoridng to an ICMR guideline, all symptomatic patients testing negative in Rapid Antigen Tests, or those who test negative in such a test and develop symptoms within 2-3 days, must necessarily be retested through an RT-PCR test.“The idea is to minimise the percentage of missed positives to effectively curb disease transmission. To be able to control the disease better, it is important to pick up all infected at the early stages of the disease. The letter has gone jointly to states to reiterate the need to follow up rapid antigen testing guidelines adequately,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.A senior virologist in a government laboratory, who didn’t want to be named, says, “I won’t recommend antigen test, as a first line of screening test as no positives should be missed. In this case you have a possibility of missing at least 15-20% of the positive cases.”“False positives are still ok as you may be overestimating a disease, but there shouldn’t be any false negatives as that would essentially mean the disease is being underestimated. If symptomatic negative individuals are confirmed through an RT-PCR there still be a percentage of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic (patients) who won’t be tested and will be missed,” the virologist added.According to ICMR, antigen based testing comprises about 30-40% of all tests performed for Covid-19 diagnosis currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retest-symptomatic-patients-negative-in-rapid-tests-govt/story-ZSYJKlKX4jJzICj7z2AvmN.html
11-09-2020||India||Court order on bail pleas of Rhea Chakraborty, brother likely today||A special court constituted to try cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is expected to pronounce its order on bail pleas filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and three others on Friday. Special judge GB Gurao heard the submissions made by the lawyer of the Chakrabortys and the special public prosecutor. The bail applications of four other accused were also heard. The court then adjourned the matter till Friday. After being questioned for three consecutive days, Chakraborty was arrested by NCB on Tuesday in connection with the agency’s probe into a drug angle in the death of her boyfriend and actor, Sushant Singh Rajput. A magistrate’s court remanded Chakraborty to 14-day judicial custody. Apart from Chakraborty and Showik, NCB has arrested Rajput’s house manager, Samuel Miranda, and a member of his personal staff, Dipesh Sawant. The agency has also arrested Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar for alleged drug peddling. Rajput, 34, was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14. Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s unseen videos recorded by Rhea Chakraborty go viral. WatchOn Thursday, Atul Sarpande, the special public prosecutor appearing for NCB, opposed the bail plea of all accused on the ground that the probe was at a crucial stage and releasing the accused on bail may hamper the investigation. Chakraborty and Showik financed and arranged drugs for Rajput and at his instructions, NCB said in its affidavit filed in response to their bail pleas. Sawant used to procure drugs along with co-accused Miranda for Rajput’s consumption, the affidavit said. In her plea, Chakraborty said she was innocent and falsely implicated in the case. The 28-year-old actor said she was coerced into making “self-incriminatory” confessions by NCB and that she was withdrawing them. Among other offences, she has been charged under Section 27A of the NDPS Act, which pertains to punishment for financing illicit traffic. The section carries minimum rigorous imprisonment of 10 years, which may be extended to 20 years. Chakraborty’s plea said “the allegations against the present accused would at the most make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug, which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender and hence the ingredients of Section 27A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-order-on-bail-pleas-of-rhea-brother-likely-today/story-PJAEbghL2WHc4wizgnnCtI.html
11-09-2020||India||Charges of harassment by Kangana false, says BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished parts of an office owned by actor Kangana Ranaut after it found substantial changes were done on the premises in deviation from the sanctioned plan, the Shiv Sena-controlled civic agency told the Bombay high court in an affidavit on Thursday. BMC also said the actor’s allegations of harassment and mala fide action by BMC were false and unwarranted.The civic body’s action against Ranaut’s office in Bandra’s Pali Hill on Wednesday triggered a controversy with the actor approaching the high court seeking relief. Her plea argued that the demolition process was initiated in a hurried manner with ulterior motives. A division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla stayed the demolition process — by then the drive was almost complete — and sought to know how the civic body entered the premises when the owner was not present. Ranaut returned to Mumbai from her home state of Himachal Pradesh later that day.In its affidavit, BMC said the actor did not disclose at least 14 alterations in her petition and only sought an urgent stay on the demolition activity. Section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, 1888, authorises BMC to demolish an illegal construction 24 hours after issuance of a notice seeking a reply. If the response is not satisfactory, a competent officer is authorised to act. Ranaut was issued a notice on Tuesday. She had sought seven days to respond. The affidavit said BMC officials followed all procedures for inspecting the site with proper permissions. When the court pointed out that Ranaut’s petition was filed in haste, advocate Rizwan Siddiqui admitted to the same and sought permission to amend the petition. He submitted that he also wanted to put on record various facts and communications, which his client had with the concerned BMC ward office over two years. The court permitted the same. The court directed Siddiqui to make the amendments and file a rejoinder to the BMC affidavit till Monday. It directed BMC to file its affidavit on the amended petition and posted the matter for hearing on September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-charges-of-harassment-false/story-z7QKA7s5F6riIX30qvdvYK.html
11-09-2020||India||Supreme Court asks AG Venugopal to be amicus curiae in Bhushan case||The Supreme Court on Thursday requested attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal to assist the court as Amicus Curiae in the 2009 criminal contempt of court case against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for his remarks to a magazine that past Chief Justices of India (CJIs) had been corrupt. The request was made after this was suggested by Bhushan’s lawyer.Amicus Curiae, which literally translates as friend of the court, is a neutral lawyer appointed by the court to assist it in cases which require specific expertise.Bhushan’s lawyer Rajiv Dhavan told the court on Thursday that AG Venugopal should be heard as the Amicus Curiae in the case considering the fact that it involves pertinent legal issues relating to whether or not allegations regarding conduct of a judge can be made in the public or not.In a different contempt case concerning Bhushan, Venugopal, on August 25, told the court that several former SC judges have referred to corruption in the judiciary and asked the bench, which had already found Bhushan guilty of contempt in its August 14 judgement, to let him off with a warning. Earlier, on August 20, the AG mentioned a 1987 speech he delivered on the judiciary, where he referred to rumours of corruption and nepotism in the judiciary before the court in the same case, before he was cut short by the bench.On Thursday, a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar asked the court registry to furnish a copy of the records of the case to the AG’s office and posted the case for further consideration in October.The case against Bhushan has its genesis in an interview given by the activist lawyer to Tehelka magazine in which he claimed half of the previous 16 CJIs were corrupt. Senior advocate Harish Salve brought this statement to the attention of the court, based on which contempt action was initiated against Bhushan in November 2009.The case was listed by the top court before a bench headed by justice Arun Mishra on July 24, 2020, more than eight years after it was last heard.Bhushan refused to apologise for his statement, but offered an explanation to the court on his controversial remark. The apex court, on August 10, rejected Bhushan’s explanation and decided to proceed with the case and hear it in detail.When the case was heard on August 17, the court said that certain larger legal issues need to be settled, including whether allegations of corruption against judges can be made by way of public statements and the procedure to be adopted when such allegations are raised against the conduct of a sitting judge.On August 25, Bhushan’s counsel requested that the case should be placed before a Constitution bench since it involves substantial legal issues.The three-judge bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari could not, however, take the case to finality because justice Mishra retired from office on September 2.The matter, thereafter, came to be listed before a new bench, which besides justice Khanwilkar also comprised justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna.When the case came up before the new bench on Thursday, senior counsel Dhavan appeared on behalf of Bhushan and submitted that AG Venugopal had earlier expressed his willingness to assist the court.The top court , on August 31, imposed a fine of Rs. 1 on Bhushan in the other contempt of court case initiated against him for tweets criticizing the Supreme Court and current CJI, SA Bobde. Bhushan refused to tender an apology in that case too despite opportunities offered by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-ag-to-be-amicus-curiae-in-bhushan-case/story-L5JYX9wtPLx1uTpsJ8RP9K.html
11-09-2020||India||Railways to procure AI-based cameras for thermal temp screening of passengers||Indian Railways has begun work on procuring thermal cameras for deployment at railway stations across its network for thermal temperature screening of passengers for Covid-19 via Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based surveillance cameras after it scrapped a previous tender amid allegations of favouring a Chinese firm.Railways has already begun installing the cameras in some zones. The cameras can detect the body temperature of passengers and help in detecting and denying boarding to those with symptoms of the coronavirus disease.“Central railways has begun using thermal cameras already. About two dozen symptomatic passengers were detected through it and were denied boarding. The fresh tender will open on Friday. We plan to induct the AI based cameras across all zones as more trains begin operations,” an Indian Railways official said on condition of anonymity.Railways in July scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for Covid-19 surveillance after Indian firms alleged that the specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times had first reported on July 1. In June, Railtel, the railways’ telecom arm, had issued the tender for thermal temperature screening by AI-based surveillance cameras.The company soon decided to issue a fresh tender after the controversy. “RailTel has floated an expression of Interest( EOI) for finalizing partner for provision of thermal scanning solution in customer premises. The EOI is scheduled to be opened tomorrow and parter will be selected later after due diligence by nominated committee. In the proposed EOI, one partner for each region of RailTel will be identified to offer thermal scanning solution. The selected partner will supply equipment as per purchase orders received from RailTel customers in future,” a spokesperson for RailTel said.The development in June came in the backdrop of a tense military standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.Indian firms had alleged that the AI technology - DeepInMind - which was specified in the tender was a proprietary feature of Chinese firm Hikvision, a company partly owned by the Chinese government. The specifications for the cameras include temperature screening with facial recognition and mask detection, simultaneous temperature screening of multiple persons, detecting whether people wear masks and sounding timely alarms on people without masks.While the initial tender for these cameras issued on June 9 excluded a crucial specification called “black body” temperature -- the ability of cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to say whether a he or she has fever or not - and the DeepinMind technology specification, they were included in the revised tender issued on June 23.Hindustan Times had on November 10 last year reported that the national carrier was planning a complete overhaul of security at railway stations through the use of facial recognition technology backed by artificial intelligence.It also plans to link the facial recognition system (FRS) with existing databases such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) to identify criminals prowling railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ryls-to-procure-ai-based-cameras-for-thermal-temp-screening-of-passengers/story-JS4baSLwZk9ZxnEV56pfbN.html
11-09-2020||India||BJP supporters’ group registers under US law||An overseas group of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters announced on Thursday that it registered with American authorities under a US law that requires groups to disclose any ties with a foreign political entity, a move that came amid reports that it may be under investigation for election interference -- a claim that it rejected. The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) said it “voluntarily” registered under FARA or the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which makes it mandatory for any foreign principals engaged in political activities to declare their engagement and financial transactions.As per the FARA website, the Act enacted in 1938, “requires certain agents of foreign principals who are engaged in political activities or other activities specified under the statute to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities. Disclosure of the required information facilitates evaluation by the government and the American people of the activities of such persons in light of their function as foreign agents. The FARA Unit of the Counter-intelligence and Export Control Section (CES) in the National Security Division (NSD) is responsible for the administration and enforcement of FARA.”For the mission and objective of the BJP as the foreign principal, the OFBJP said in the registration form: “Advocating for welfare social policies, self-reliance, robust economic growth, foreign policy driven by a nationalist agenda, and strong national defense for India.”Adapa V Prasad, one of the three signatories of the registration form, denied the registration was compelled by a US investigation of the organisation as had been contended by some. “OFBJP has voluntarily registered under FARA with DOJ, he said, adding: “OFBJP is not under any investigation,” he added.A response was awaited from the department of justice to a request from Hindustan Times to confirm or deny an investigation was under way.The announcement came shortly after Pieter Friedrich, a US-based researcher specialising in South Asia, tweeted that the US chapter of the OFBJP is reportedly under investigation by Justice Department. Friedrich claimed the OFBJP-US mobilised 1000s of Indian-Americans to travel to India to campaign for the BJP and is reportedly under investigation by the Justice Department.Vijay Chauthaiwale, who heads the Foreign Cell of the party too denied the allegations. He said the OFBJP-US did a self evaluation and following consultations with legal experts chose to voluntarily register under FARA. “There is no financial transaction between the party (BJP) and OFBJP-US. They however carry out messaging for the BJP in the US; organise programmes for visiting leaders, etc.”Chauthaiwale also lashed out at Friedrich and said “where is the proof that it is under investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-supporters-group-registers-under-us-law/story-3JyaB1X8LBwdJihcdK9KpN.html
11-09-2020||India||SII halts Oxford vaccine trials after global pause||Pune-based pharma firm Serum Institute of India (SII) said on Thursday it has paused the India trials for the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, a day after the United Kingdom-based developers announced a global halt of the human experiments because a patient developed a potentially serious condition. SII’s move came hours after India’s drugs regulator issued a show-cause notice to the company for failing to inform it about the suspension of the global trials of AZD1222 (as the vaccine candidate is called) , which is largely seen as the front runner in the race to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 , and is being tested around the world. Till Wednesday, SII said it would go ahead with the trials since no adverse reactions were seen in India. AstraZeneca said late on Tuesday it paused trials in the US, UK, Brazil, and South Africa following reports of a UK participant developing an unexplained severe adverse reaction.This prompted a notice from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), which asked SII to explain why its permission for phase II and phase III trials should not be withdrawn for failing to report an adverse reaction. In response, SII said in a statement on Thursday: “We are reviewing the situation and pausing India trials till AstraZeneca restarts the trials. We are following Drugs Controller General of India’s instructions and will not be able to comment further on trials…”“Normally if there has been a serious adverse event reported from any of the trial sites then safety concerns need to be allayed. It may or may not be vaccine induced but that needs to be investigated, and patient safety established,” said an official in the drugs control department, not wanting to be named. “Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd, Pune, till now has not informed the Central licensing authority regarding pausing the clinical trial carried out by AstraZeneca in other countries and also not submitted casualty analysis of the reported serious adverse event with the investigational vaccine for the continuation of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the subject vaccine in the country in light of the safety concerns,” according to the show-cause notice issued by DCGI’s Dr VG Somani. The DCGI sought an immediate reply to the notice saying else “it shall be construed that you have no explanation to offer and action deemed fit will be taken against you”. The Pune-based vaccine manufacturer got DCGI’s permission on August 2 to conduct Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which was developed in partnership with the University of Oxford. SII is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of vaccines in terms of capacity and its role is crucial in building supplies when a vaccine is finally approved.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified. The first dose of the vaccine as part of the phase II, III human trials to check its efficacy began at Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Medical College and Hospital in Pune last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-halts-oxford-vaccine-trials-after-global-pause/story-HO58UdO32gIVU5siUlv8aL.html

Thipsay had appeared as an expert witness at the request of Nirav Modi’s defence team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/katju-to-depose-in-nirav-modi-extradition-trial-today/story-XmyMPtYPeEH3V5jXv28ShI.html
11-09-2020||India||India forging key ties, with an eye on China||New Delhi: The standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has spurred India’s efforts to forge greater cooperation on security issues, connectivity and trade with other countries that are equally concerned about China’s aggressive actions across the region.While a lot of attention has been focused on the response of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – which brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US – to China’s actions, India has been quietly working with other key players such as Japan and Indonesia to build on cooperation across the Indo-Pacific.On Thursday, India and Japan announced they had signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), a pact for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces with an eye on security across the Indo-Pacific. Also read: Strategic Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis gets off to a flying start amid China tensionThe development is significant as India is only the sixth partner with which Japan has signed such an agreement, after Australia, Canada, France, the UK and the US, and in light of the Japanese Constitution’s commitment to pacifism. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it was significant that India now has concluded logistics support agreements with all the members of the Quad. India and Australia signed the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) in June during a virtual summit. “This increases the scope for interoperability between the navies of all the members of the Quad, and basic standard operating procedures are in place, especially for them to operate in a region such as the Indian Ocean,” Patil said. On the same day that the agreement with Japan was signed, India, Australia and France held their inaugural senior officials’ trilateral dialogue, with the focus again on convergences in the Indo-Pacific and enhanced cooperation in maritime issues. France thus became the first European power to formally partner with India on a mechanism focused on the Indo-Pacific. Not many are aware that France has good reasons for this focus on the Indo-Pacific – the presence of 1.5 million French citizens on island territories, and its exclusive economic zone of more than 11 million sq km, the second largest in the world, with 93% or 9 million sq km m in the Indo-Pacific. France has also been at the forefront of countries that have backed India in its current border standoff with China. French defence minister Florence Parly, who was in India on Thursday for the induction of the first batch of Rafale combat jets into the Indian Air Force, said in an interview that “no country can use the fait accompli policy” even as she pushed for disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC. Also read: Can count on us, France tells India as Rafale fighters take to the skiesParly also noted that the induction of the Rafale jets meant India “will have an edge over the entire region to defend itself and protect its people”. In the pipeline are the maiden virtual meetings of the foreign and defence ministers of India, Australia and Indonesia. The meeting of the foreign ministers could happen within this month, and once again the focus will be working towards a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. As in the case of the trilateral dialogue between India, Australia and France, these upcoming meetings too will work toward increased cooperation through regional organisations such as the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and the 22-member Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Patil noted that external affairs minister S Jaishankar has pointed out that India’s foreign policy options will revolve round working with other countries that have similar interests. “After the 9/11 attacks on the US, president George W Bush had talked about establishing a coalition of the willing instead of relying on other formal mechanisms and coalitions. We are in an era when such interest-based partnerships are a reality,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-forging-key-ties-with-an-eye-on-china/story-71T0PFAX19rWNN7Y2eUjmL.html

11-09-2020||India||RS deputy chair’s post: Oppn may field Manoj Jha against Harivansh||Several opposition parties have decided to field Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj Jha for the September 14 election to the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson’s post against Harivansh of the Janata Dal (United), people familiar with the development said.Harivansh, who was Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson until his term ended in April, will be the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate. The contest between Jha and Harivansh is interesting given that they belong to two main rival parties in Bihar and the election to the deputy chairperson’s post in the Rajya Sabha comes ahead of upcoming assembly polls in the state. Jha will file his papers on Friday, the last date for filing the nominations, in the presence of senior leaders of various opposition parties, said a Congress leader, one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity.Apart from the RJD, the parties supporting him are the Congress, the Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Shiv Sena, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Kerala Congress (M), Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian Union Muslim League. The Aam Aadmi Party is also likely to support Jha because it had reservations about backing a Congress candidate. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Congress party’s deputy leader in the Upper House Anand Sharma, its chief whip Jairam Ramesh and leaders from other parties, including the Trinamool Congress, Left parties, DMK and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), will accompany Jha when he files his nomination papers on Friday, said the Congress leader cited above.. The Congress, an ally of the RJD, has maintained that it will not let the post of deputy chairman go uncontested and had proposed that opposition parties put up a joint candidate in the September 14 election despite the NDA having a clear edge. In the 245-member House, the BJP-led NDA’s strength is 116. There is one vacancy in the Upper House. The Congress had initially approached the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) to suggest a name but the southern party was not keen to put a candidate. It then requested the RJD to allow Jha to contest the election. The Congress had been confident that the DMK would let Tiruchi Siva contest the election. The RJD leadership accepted the proposal and named Jha as the joint opposition candidate against JD(U)’s Harivansh, who was re-elected to the Upper House from Bihar soon after his retirement in April. In August 2018, after the retirement of PJ Kurien of the Congress, Harivansh was elected the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson. As the NDA candidate, he defeated BK Hariprasad of the Congress. While Harivansh secured 125 votes, Hariprasad won 105 votes. On Thursday, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar telephoned his Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik and sought his party’s support for Harivansh. Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD), with nine members in the Rajya Sabha, had supported Harivansh in the last election as well. NDA floor managers are trying to reach out to the opposition parties to build a consensus to ensure that Harivansh is elected unanimously, said the Congress leader cited above..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-deputy-chair-s-post-oppn-may-field-manoj-jha-against-harivansh/story-JU15kJSoTZVzjICIaKACoI.html
11-09-2020||India||Govt considering series of measures to boost economy||The government is considering a series of measures to boost the economy, including offering up to Rs 3 lakh crore in incentives spread over six years to create global supply chains in some sectors, tariff protection to key industries, further relaxation in foreign investment rules, and schemes aimed at the urban unemployed, four people familiar with the plans said.  Various expert groups in the government are working on specific fiscal incentives and policy reforms that are expected to take effect from the third quarter (October-December) of the current financial year to accelerate growth, the people added, asking not to be identified. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by a record 23.9% in the quarter ended June 2020, making the country the worst performer among major economies that have all been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.“These are ongoing reform measures and should not be confused with a mega stimulus package. There is no immediate proposal to announce a second stimulus. In May this year the government announced a ₹20 lakh crore Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative) package, which is already in the works. Some announcements are expected soon that will complement it,” one of the four people, a government official in an economic ministry, said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled relief and economic stimulus measures between May 13 and May 17 this year under the Rs 20.97 lakh crore Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan package , which also included monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).A second person said the government is expected to save about ₹3 lakh crore in the next five to six years by limiting export incentives under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), and this money can be used for focused development of global value chains in sectors such as automobiles, auto components, electronics, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, textiles, food processing, white goods and speciality steel.“The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is approved by an empowered group of secretaries and the matter will soon be placed before the cabinet for its approval,” added this person, who has direct knowledge of the matter. The government is phasing out MEIS, an export incentive scheme, as it has ballooned disproportionately without creating export competitiveness, he said. The scheme incentivises large investments and has worked for India in the mobile manufacturing sector. Also read: FY21 may see worst ever decline in GDPThe government is also considering providing duty protection to select domestic industries from imported finished goods, particularly from China. This could, however, be within the bound rate of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for a period of five to six years under a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) . The scheme is aimed at sectors such as plastics, furniture and toys, the second official said, listing sectors where exports, especially from China, have hurt Indian industry. In order to attract FDI in infrastructure and transportation sectors, the government may also announce a series of policy measures in some sectors. This will include private participation in running about 150 passenger trains, over two dozen airports, greenfield steel plants, agricultural infrastructure, renewable power projects, waterways and tourist sites, a third person said.The fourth person said the government is focusing on inclusive economic growth. “A large part of the ₹20 lakh crore stimulus package announced in May was focused on providing relief to the poor. It has immensely helped the rural poor, especially with their active involvement in MGNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme]. There is a thinking that a similar employment guarantee scheme could be framed for the urban poor,” added this person. Experts expect the government to rationalise fiscal incentives and policy reforms to maximise economic gains as it cannot immediately afford another mega stimulus because of a precarious financial position -- the fiscal deficit has already crossed 103% of the budgeted estimated for the entire 2020-21 financial year.“Another fiscal stimulus may come only after a thorough assessment of the ground situation – availability of Covid-19 vaccine and de-escalation of tension at the border,” the first person said.But experts unanimously suggested demand-side measures to boost consumption. Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners, said: “The government has limited fiscal space as the borrowing target is already over ₹12 lakh crore in the current financial year. Within the limitations, while the government has introduced various supply-side initiatives, it is imperative to balance demand-side measures.” DK Aggarwal, president at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said schemes such as PLI and PMP will certainly attract foreign investments as well as motivate domestic entities to expand their production, but more demand-side reforms are required to lift sentiment and encourage businesses to invest.“The focus needs to be upon increasing consumption expenditure by the government, implementation of ₹111 lakh crore allocated for the NIP [National Infrastructure Pipeline] for next five years... government expenditure through various welfare schemes, and upliftment of the underprivileged through direct benefit transfers, among others,” he added“Urban poor have been significantly impacted due to... Covid-19 and therefore require notable policy attention. At this juncture, similar scheme(s) on the lines of MGNREGS would go a long way to provide employment opportunity to the urban poor, sustenance income in their hands along with social safety,” Aggarwal said.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner of consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said: “The government now plans to expand the PLI to other sectors in addition to electronics. These steps are definitely welcome; however, it needs to balance it with a few demand-side measures. Especially in a low-interest rate regime, the consumption would be generally low. The latest data as well clearly indicates that the demand in urban areas is very poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-incentives-on-anvil-to-boost-economy/story-Z9FslJFHitNLBXEtfh4sTK.html
11-09-2020||India||5 Rafale fighters formally inducted in combat fleet||Ambala: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that the induction of Rafale fighter jets into the Indian Air Force was a game-changer for the country’s security, and a strong message to those who challenged India’s sovereignty, even as IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said the warplanes could not have joined the combat fleet at a more opportune time considering the current security scenario.The comments, made during a ceremony at the Ambala airbase to mark the formal induction of the Rafale fighters, come amid military tensions between Indian and China in the sensitive Ladakh sector.French defence minister Florence Parly said the Rafale jets would give India a military edge in the region.Five of the 36 Rafales ordered by India from France reached Ambala -- India’s oldest air force base -- on July 29 but a formal induction ceremony was held on Thursday. These Rafale jets are part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the Golden Arrows. Also read: Can count on us, France tells India as Rafale fighters take to the skiesThursday’s ceremony marked the full operational induction of the Rafale jets into the IAF, Bhadauria said. “They have already flown and familiarised in our operational environment [after their arrival] and undergone intense integrated training with other combat fleets including firing of advanced weapons…They are good to go and deliver,” the IAF chief said. The Rafales have even flown in the Ladakh sector and the country’s eastern region, officials said, requesting anonymity. In her speech, Parly said the induction of Rafale into the IAF was a symbol of strong ties between India and France, describing the bilateral relationship as “rock solid and time tested.” She said France supported India’s bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The French defence minister assured India of timely delivery of remaining 31 fighter jets. She said France was totally committed to the Make in India initiative that has been a reality for the French industry for several years particularly in defence sector like in submarines. “We are fully committed to the Make in India initiative as well as to the further integration of Indian manufactures into our global supply chains,” she said.She added that Make in India has been a reality for the French industry for several years, particularly for defence equipment like submarines. “Many French companies and design offices are now established in India and now I hope that others will come to offer their support and services,” she said.The Rafale weaponry includes Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles -- weapons that allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges. The IAF chief said after the planes landed on July 29, the Golden Arrows squadron “has been really busy and in an overdrive to operationalise” the Rafales. The Rafale fighters will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the air force with their advanced weaponry, high-tech sensors, superior radar for detection and tracking of targets, and ability to carry an impressive payload, experts and officials said. The defence minister reiterated India’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity under any circumstances, with the statement coming against the backdrop of threatening military moves by China in the eastern Ladakh theatre. “The induction is significant in the context of the recent security developments prevailing along our borders…or if I may say created on our frontiers [by adversaries],” Singh said. “The intentions of military are as strong as it can be... Strengthening our defence is aimed at achieving international peace and stability and we do not want to take any step that can endanger international peace. We have the same expectation of our neighbours and other countries of the world,” he said. The next batch of three to four Rafale jets (out of a total of 36 aircraft) is expected to reach Ambala from France in October followed by a third batch in December. All deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021. “Rafale means gust of wind in French or even burst of fire. In military terms, India will acquire a world-class capability that will give it incredible sovereignty. And in strategic terms, the Rafales will give India an edge over the entire region to defend itself,” Parly said, calling the jet a powerful military aircraft.The jets have been specially tailored for IAF. India-specific enhancements on the Rafales include a helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.“The full range of missions and the capability enhancement this fleet brings to IAF is even more impressive,” Bhadauria said.Before the ceremonial unveiling of the Rafale, a traditional “Sarva Dharma Puja” (multi-faith prayer) was performed at the Ambala airbase which was home to the humble biplane a century ago. The line-up of events included a fly-past by Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and Jaguars, solo displays by the Rafale and the Tejas light combat aircraft, and some breathtaking manoeuvres by IAF’s Sarang helicopter stunt team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-rafale-fighters-formally-inducted-in-combat-fleet/story-P1whVzOl9GPU4nS4O0e2dL.html
11-09-2020||India||Nearly 7 die by suicide in Delhi every day: NCRB||New Delhi: The number of people who died by suicide in Delhi because of mental illness rose by more than two-and-a-half times in 2019 compared to the previous year, although overall suicides because of various health reasons dipped significantly, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).The absolute number of suicides stayed constant – 2,526 in each year, with “family problems” remaining the number one cause. Family problems relate to quarrels in families, relatives not doing well in their lives, etc.The data does not capture the number of suicide attempts. Nearly seven people died by suicide every day on average, much more than the fatalities in road accidents, which left four persons dead every day in 2019.This is the latest data available for suicides in the Capital; Delhi Police doesn’t share suicide statistics. Mental illness was attributed as the reason for 47 suicides in Delhi last year, a 161% jump from 18 such deaths in the year before that. The number of women in both years remained constant at six, while the number of men who died by suicide because of mental illness rose from 12 to 41.In comparison, suicides due to illnesses of all kinds – such as mental, critical and prolonged physical illness.-- dipped by 48%, from 218 to 130. In 469 (18.5%) of all 2,526 suicides, the NCRB couldn’t ascertain the cause.Psychologists could not point to any specific reason behind the trend, even as they contended that NCRB may not have been able to capture the exact data. “If a person did not seek medical treatment for his or her mental illness despite suffering from it, it is not going to be counted as that,” said psychiatrist Samir Parikh, who is the director of Fortis National Mental Health Programme.Unemployment and educationUnemployment was a factor that led to more suicides in 2019 than the previous year. At least 118 people died by suicide on turning jobless, a 20% jump from 98 such deaths in 2018. Also, the number of suicides by jobless people rose from 611 in 2018 to 677 in 2019. Overall, a vast majority of people who died received only a basic education and earned little money, showed the data.Over 80% of the suicides were by people who had studied only up to Class 12, and more than 61% were people who earned less than Rs1 lakh annually. Nearly 10% of all suicides were by daily wager labourers.Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist, attributed the relation between poor financial/educational backgrounds and suicides to a sense of “despondency and gloom”. “This class of people tend to feel a sense of hopelessness and lack of options in their lives. It hurts their self-esteem and leaves them with suicidal tendencies,” said Mitra.He said that a possible solution to this problem was to cultivate the culture of entrepreneurship among such people. “They need to be able to pick up skills to earn a livelihood and the government needs to step forward to encourage them to start their own venture,” said Mitra.Relationship issuesRelationship issues -- be it marriage, family, love affairs or relationships outside marriage -- were the reason for 1,007 dying by suicide, nearly 40% of all suicides. However, suicides related to marriages dipped from 233 to 123.But there were more in the list who recently lost their partners – either due to death or separation. Thirty widows and widowers died by suicide in 2019, up from 10 in the year before that; and the number of people who were recently separated from their partners went up from 31 to 93 in the corresponding period.Hanging was the method used in three out of every four suicides, followed by poison in 6.76% of the cases. Mitra said that most people don’t realise that hanging or even other suicide methods often do not kill people and instead leave them with other injuries, which sometimes last a lifetime.A study by the American Association of Suicidology showed that only one in every 25 suicide attempts in the US ended in death.Until July 2018, suicide was criminalised under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 309, and made punishable with a year in jail, or a fine or both. But the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 (which came into force from 2018) restricted its application and said that unless proved otherwise, a person who attempts suicide is to be presumed to be under severe stress.A senior Delhi Police officer said that the IPC Section 309 was now pressed in rare cases. “If an apprehended suspect, for example, tries to bang his head against the wall with an intention of getting away, we book them under this section,” said the officer who didn’t want to be identified. Eish Singhal, the Delhi Police spokesperson, said that the process followed now is to carry out an inquest proceeding after a suicide to ascertain if it was due to pressure or harassment by anyone. “We look for suicide notes, for statements of relatives of the victims, and to understand if someone had abetted the suicide,” said Singhal.Fear worse this yearWhile the data for this year is not still available, there have been a number of instances when people have died by suicide either after getting infected by Covid-19 or due to financial impact of the pandemic.Mitra feared that suicide figures this year could be significantly higher than in previous years. “People have lost their jobs and their businesses have taken a hit, but right now they are living off their savings. Once they begin getting a sense of the loss and their savings start drying up, the situation could get bad,” said Mitra.He said that such affected people need to acknowledge the loss, look for entrepreneurship opportunities and realise that they can always bounce back. “They must take inspiration from the times of the partition when so many people lost everything, but built up as entrepreneurs to recover,” said Mitra.Parikh said India needs a suicide prevention policy and more and more suicide helplines. “In the long run, we need to impart life skills in schools so that people can cope with such situations,” he said.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

11-09-2020||India||‘I’m afraid they’ll take revenge’: Judge who pronounced verdict in Jaipur bomb blast case cites threat to security||Retired judge Ajay Kumar Sharma, who had pronounced the judgment in the Jaipur bomb case, has written to the director-general of police (DGP), requesting him to maintain the security provided to him. Sharma cited security threat to him and said that he has observed some suspicious activity around his residence. HT has obtained a copy of the letter.“Before and after the judgment, my family and I were provided security of four guards and two personal security officers (PSOs) which is still in place. I have heard that the police line is removing the security provided to me,” read the letter written by Sharma.In the letter, the retired judge said that he has observed some suspicious activity around his residence. “I have seen people roaming around my house. Some were on motorcycle and clicked my pictures twice,” he said. Referring to the four convicts in the Jaipur bomb blast case, Sharma said that the terrorist group is a very dangerous one and any incident can take place with him or his family.“I am not financially sound that I can keep personal security guards. My only fault is that I gave death sentence to four dreaded terrorists and I am afraid that the groups to which they belong will take revenge. Hence, the responsibility of me and my family is on the police and the state government. The intelligence bureau report also indicates that terrorist groups can take revenge. The High Court is yet to confirm the death sentence. My family and I have serious threat from terrorists,” Sharma said in the letter.He also gave the example of Justice Neelkanth Ganjoo, who was killed in November 1989. Ganjoo had pronounced death sentence to Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) terrorist and founder Maqbool Bhatt.“We have received a letter from the IB and we are assessing the security of retired judge Ajay Sharma,” said Anand Shrivastava, commissioner of police, Jaipur city.On December 17, 2019, the special dealing with Jaipur bomb blast cases had convicted four people for the worst terror attack in Jaipur — nine bombs that ripped through the walled city on May 13, 2008, killing 71 and injuring hundreds. On December 20, the four convicts were sentenced to death by the then judge of the court Ajay Kumar Sharma. Sharma had convicted Mohammad Saif, 32, Mohammad Sarvar, 36, Saif-Ur-Rahman alias Saif-ur-Rahman, 36, and Salman, 34 for murder, attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, conspiracy and under relevant sections of the Explosive Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. One of the accused, Shahbaz Hussain alias Shahbaz, was acquitted.The eight locations targeted in the blasts were Manak Chowk police station, Badi Chaupad, Kotwali police station, Tripoliya Bazar, Chandpole Hanuman temple, National Handloom in Jauhari Bazar, Chhoti Chaupad and Sanganeri Gate Hanuman temple. All locations were within a radius of 2 kilometres radius. The trial in the eight cases – one for each of the eight locations – began in December 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-m-afraid-they-ll-take-revenge-judge-who-pronounced-verdict-in-jaipur-bomb-blast-case-cites-threat-to-security/story-rFNXPcBEOldtWqloch6jiI.html
11-09-2020||India||Nadda attacks Banerjee, says Bengal lockdown timed to coincide with Ram temple launch||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Thursday accused West Bengal Mamata Banerjee chief minister of timing the Covid-19 lockdown in the state last month to coincide with the launch the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 and earlier lifting it for Eid.“By imposing the lockdown, she [Banerjee] crushed the wishes of crores of people. It is a different matter that the lockdown was lifted [for] Eid on July 31…This is a politics of appeasement. This politics of vote bank appeasement needs to be exposed,” Nadda said in his address to BJP workers via video-conferencing.Also read: Congress’ Bengal president pick sends clear message to Mamata BanerjeeThe West Bengal government imposed a state-wide lockdown on seven non-consecutive days in August to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.The BJP has been upbeat over its prospects in the 2021 West Bengal assembly polls since its performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Its vote share in the state increased to over 40% in 2019 from a mere 2% in the 2011 assembly polls. The BJP won 18 out of West Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats to emerge as the second-largest party after ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state.The BJP has repeatedly targeted the TMC government over its “vote bank politics” in the state, where Muslims account for 27% of the population. In 2017, the BJP targeted the TMC for imposing restrictions on idol immersion during Durga Puja celebrations as it coincided with Muharram. Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar when Muslims take out processions to mourn the killing of the Prophet’s grandson, Hussain, and other members of his family in the Battle of Karbala in the seventh century.Nadda credited “blessings the BJP got from people in Bengal” to the party’s rise in the state, with an increase in vote share from 2% in 2011 to 18% in 2014 and over 40% in 2019.“…This is how we have to proceed and throw out the TMC. Mamata Banerjee knows the ground beneath her feet has shifted. She knows people are ready to welcome the Lotus [BJP’s electoral symbol] in West Bengal.”Nadda accused Banerjee of blocking the implementation of schemes like Ayushman Bharat that benefit the poorest of the poor. “Nearly 45 million people in West Bengal have been deprived of up to Rs 5 lakh [500,000 insurance cover] that the scheme offers,” he said.Nadda said the state government has not even shared the list of farmers eligible to get three instalments of Rs 2,000 in their accounts under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme annually. “She has not let the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana [crop insurance scheme] be implemented in West Bengal …is it not her duty to worry about the fate of farmers? She changed the name of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana [housing scheme]... the money is coming from the Centre but she has put her stamp on the scheme. “Nadda said Banerjee was not even sharing Covid-19 data. “They stopped a team that had come from Delhi to collect data even as dead bodies remained unattended. This is anti-humanism of Mamata Banerjee.”He referred to political killings in the state and said politics of criminalisation is being encouraged and people are being intimidated. “…But in the elections, it is the very same people who will raise their voice and send you home and bring the BJP to power.”TMC lawmaker Saugata Roy rejected Nadda’s comments as communal statements. “Enforcing lockdown or cancelling it has nothing to do with a programme that was held in another state. Lockdown is imposed or withdrawn by a government based on administrative convenience and on the advice of experts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-attacks-banerjee-says-bengal-lockdown-timed-to-coincide-with-ram-temple-launch/story-BAJ9xqI17Oxtxn7ju2RvRP.html
11-09-2020||Editorials||On China, an opening | HT Editorial||Once again, India and China have agreed to disengage and de-escalate. In previous rounds of negotiations and statements, China failed to translate this commitment into action on the ground. But, perhaps, this round may be different for a set of reasons. The first is simply the high-level, face-to-face nature of the negotiations. The military-to-military meetings ran aground, with local commanders lacking the authority to make decisions that require political sanction. The meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe last week, and between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart, Wang Yi, on Thursday (both in Moscow) were, thus, the first genuinely high-level — and physical — interactions between the leadership of the two countries since the border crisis began.A second reason is the instability inherent in the massive military mobilisation all along the Himalayas. The surprise Indian military deployment along the heights near Spanggur Tso and Finger 4 has reminded China that even for the two largest armies in the world, this particular border is impossible to defend and hold in its entirety, all year round. China made some initial territorial gains, but it is not difficult for India to make similar incursions. With both armies having lost lives, moved within firing range of each other, and with shots being fired at LAC for the first time in 45 years, the confrontation has become much more dangerous than similar incidents in the recent past. A third reason is that India’s economic sanctions, against both digital and physical products, and its technology alignments with the United States, will translate into an enormous lost opportunity for China. The issue was never money; it was about being blowing a hole in more ambitious plans to establish a Sino-centric global standards regime. Ultimately, when the foreign ministers met, the message sent out was that the cost for eight kilometres of lakeshore was high and going to become higher. The entire bilateral relationship was at risk.Beijing must understand that the terms “disengagement” and “de-escalation” mean only one thing for New Delhi: A return to status quo ante. India has provided an opportunity for a genuine settlement. Though not evident in China’s recent actions, it is hoped its fabled statecraft and pragmatism reasserts itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-china-an-opening-ht-editorial/story-RimRBnuJLPNoLhCUKuix3H.html
