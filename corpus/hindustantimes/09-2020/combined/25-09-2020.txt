25-09-2020||News||The key role of CSIR in the battle against Covid | Opinion||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), one of the first publicly-funded Science & Technology (S&T) research organisations in India, turns 79 today. CSIR has played a crucial role in shaping the developments of modern Indian society, and the Covid-19 pandemic is no exception. As India is seeing an accelerated increase in cases, there is an urgent need for innovations and products in drugs, diagnostics, surveillance and devices. In March, CSIR identified the unmet needs, assessed its strengths and capabilities for addressing the pandemic and adopted a multi-pronged strategy of working on diagnostics, surveillance, drugs, hospital assistive devices, personal protective equipment and supply chain and logistics. This strategy is now beginning to yield exciting solutions. A few days ago, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) formally approved the first indigenously-developed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based paper diagnostic test. Such a test puts the achievements of Indian innovators on the world map, as it has a resemblance to the similar tests in the United States (US), and yet has its own unique features that make it simpler to use. Similarly, the generic pharma industry might recollect the years when CSIR laboratories provided cheaper synthesis methods for drugs, as it has done during the current Covid-19 pandemic for remdesivir and favipiravir. Another bit of history might be in the offing as the first-ever Phase-2 clinical trials on a phytopharmaceutical drug candidate has begun after DCGI approval. Likewise, the immunotherapeutic drug, sepsivac has successfully completed Phase-2 trials on critically ill Covid-19 patients, and is now entering Phase-3 trials. CSIR is also working in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical industries for multiple-combination clinical trials in the country. With its engineering strengths, CSIR has been able to make devices like ventilators in record time, which are positioned to receive regulatory approval soon. CSIR-promoted technology in making rapidly deployable hospitals will also be implemented in the coming weeks. All these highly-visible developments now set the stage for the next wave of innovations, which promise to catapult India into the league of the most developed nations.The development of technologies against Sars-CoV-2, within a short time period, has been possible only due to the existing scientific strengths and infrastructure created within the CSIR ecosystem over the past several decades. It is interesting to note that among the many countries that became independent of colonial rule in the middle of the last century, India alone adopted a strong S&T policy — later even including it in its Constitution, a strategy that has yielded rich dividends. CSIR being one of the earliest S&T institutions in the country has played a major role in implementing S&T strategies for the development of the country. Ever since its inception in 1942, CSIR has carried out the pursuit of fundamental science at one end of the S&T canvas, and translated it for societal connect at the other. These distinct-yet-connected aspects demanded that CSIR develop a strong interface with industry and help promote innovations in S&T. The entire spectrum of activities of CSIR, between these two extremes, over the last 78 years, has been fascinating to watch. The implementation of these required establishing strong S&T infrastructure, promoting scientific entrepreneurship, development of programmes for industrial progress through S&T solutions, and bringing the benefits to society. The recent contributions of CSIR towards Covid-19 mitigation in a short span of a few months exemplify the support that the organisation has provided over the years. The industrial and societal connect of CSIR has seen many technologies being adopted at such a large scale that these often get masked by the fact that they once were developed in its laboratories. For example, the technology to make parboiled rice, widely used in many states, was developed at CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru. India became one of the top countries worldwide in the production of Mentha, thanks to the pioneering efforts carried out at CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM), Jammu. The rise of the generic pharmaceutical industry and the goal of making many drugs affordable were facilitated by efforts at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune and CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad. Yet another illustrative example is how the strong infrastructure like the wind tunnel in CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) at Bengaluru was critical in deploying many strategic programmes in space and defence sectors.On the occasion of the 79th CSIR Foundation Day, it is worth recalling that the industrial connect has been in the CSIR genes from the beginning. Among the persons who played a critical role in the formation of CSIR was Khwaja Abdul Hamied, the founder of CIPLA. Interestingly, CSIR and CIPLA launched Ciplenza recently for use in Covid-19 patients continuing this decades-old partnership. The recent partnership of CSIR and Tata Sons for the CRISPR/Cas diagnostic test brings back memories of the support to CSIR at its inception from the house of Tata, which not only gave generous financial support but also garnered public support for funding CSIR. Thus, promoting socio-economic development of the country through S&T innovations forged in partnership with industry has been a defining feature of CSIR from 1942 to 2020. From bringing in self-reliance indelible ink to the fight against Covid-19, CSIR has played a vital role and shall do so in any future pandemic or calamity that may emerge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-key-role-of-csir-in-the-battle-against-covid-opinion/story-bVo8zdbzynhPz6THZ8AFYI.html
25-09-2020||News||Farm bills are welcome, but farmers need a rights-based protection law | Analysis||A decade ago, a few top Indian companies entered the fruit and vegetable market in Himachal Pradesh (HP). For the first few years, they gave farmers a good price for their entire produce. As their control over the market grew, they bought the best quality produce and left the rest to be sold by farmers at depressed prices through the weakened mandi system. Whenever prices increased, the companies sold in mandis, depriving farmers the benefit of higher prices. They built cold storages for themselves, but not for the farmers. Whatever mechanisation happened for farmers was through government schemes. Farmers may have got more for their produce because of the corporates, but profitability has not increased as input costs — labour wages and fertilisers — have almost doubled during this period. The farm reforms bills — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill — approved by Parliament this week will initially do what corporates did in HP; push up prices in the initial years and eventually control the agriculture trade. They may then manipulate prices as commission agents in the mandis do. This is a big danger to farmers. They could take on commission agents through the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), which provides for quick dispute resolution. But, in the case of corporates, according to the proposed laws, grievance redressal is through civil courts, which could take years. The government has said that the minimum support price (MSP) will remain in place. But, the question is whether the private player will buy at MSP or not. The farm bills are silent on this and experience from various states shows that they may not, especially in years when the crop is good. This year, less than 1% of wheat in Bihar, where the APMC Act was abolished in 2006, was bought by the state government and the rest, farmers’ organisations claim, was bought by private players at less than the MSP. In Punjab and Haryana, which has a strong APMC-regulated mandi system, about 90% of wheat this summer was bought at the MSP by government agencies. So, Punjab and Haryana farmers get price protection while those in Bihar do not. The claim that mandis control farm prices is not entirely true. Only 36% of agricultural produce is sold through mandis, mainly in the food bowl states of Haryana and Punjab, where the farmers are most agitated against the current bills. This is because APMC reforms initiated from the time of the previous National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in 2003 through the APMC Model Act has opened the agriculture trade in most states. Electronic trading and direct sale of produce to buyers in allowed in 22 states, deregulation of markets has taken place in 17 states, selling in private markets is allowed in 21 states, according to the 2019 state agriculture ministers’ conference report. The changed scenario in most states allows the farmer to choose between private buyers and the regulated mandi system. The farms bills, by abolishing the second option, leaves farmers at the mercy of unregulated private players. Both mandi and private buying should be based on the principle that a farmer has the right to recover inputs costs plus make some profit. There should be a base price for all agriculture and horticulture crops (a long-standing demand of farmers) below which the produce cannot be sold. Buying at a lower price should invoke penal action against the buyer and commission agent. The government can still have a higher MSP for limited crops they want to procure for food security and the public distribution system (PDS). A base price will ensure a fair price for every farmer, removing MSP limitations, which cover only 22 crops. Such a mechanism would help both farmers and private buyers as it will bring about transparency and accountability in the farm trade. It would be best if this mechanism is introduced through a rights-based farmer-protection law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/farm-bills-are-welcome-but-farmers-need-a-rights-based-protection-law/story-xnMhU4zd2OOQz21jDNpODK.html
25-09-2020||Noida||To protest against reform bills, farmers block Delhi-Noida road at Sector 14A||Farmers from Noida Friday blocked the city’s border with Delhi for over two hours to protest against three farm reforms bills passed by Parliament last week, throwing traffic in the area out of gear till afternoon. A number of farmers bodies, under the aegis of Bharatiya Kisan Union, had come together to march from Noida to Delhi in support of the nationwide protest, but were stopped on the way by police.More than 150 farmers —all members of Bharatiya Kisan Union — reached Noida Gate near Mayur Vihar border around 11.45am, but were met by barricades that had been set up by Delhi Police personnel.Around 150 Delhi Police personnel — armed with anti-riot gear — were deployed at Chilla village on the border on Friday morning in a bid to prevent the agitating farmers from crossing over to the national capital. The deployment of Delhi Police personnel at Alipur on the Delhi-Haryana border was minimal.The farmers parked several tractors and cars on the Noida side of the border, completely halting vehicular movement from both sides. The protesters blocked the road till 2pm, slowing down vehicular movement on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, and forcing the police to divert traffic.According to Delhi deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh, traffic going towards Noida was diverted towards other border points, including New Ashok Nagar, Kondli, and Mayur Vihar Phase-3. Except the Chilla border, which was blocked for nearly three hours, all other routes connecting Noida from Delhi, including the Delhi-Noida Direct flyway, were open for motorists. The traffic diversion, however, caused some confusion among several motorists. At 12.44 pm, the Delhi Traffic tweeted a traffic alert, informing the public about the “obstruction in traffic at Chilla border due to demonstration.”However, the police, in a tweet two hours later, said that the traffic had returned to normal.Uttar Pradesh (UP) police officers spoke with leaders of the farmers’ groups in Noida, said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (JCP), (eastern range), Delhi Police. The farmers were apprised about the guidelines of Unlock 4, which prohibits any kind of mass gathering or protests across the country, including the national capital, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic after which the protests were called off. The three farm bills approved by Parliament, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance; and Farm Services Bill and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, have become contentious issues.The new laws aim to liberalise the agriculture sector by removing hurdles created by the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (AMPC) Act in direct procurement of agriculture produce by buyers and create a level-playing field for all, thereby allowing private players a bigger role in farm trade.Farmer bodies and opposition parties say that these reform bills take away price protection provided through Minimum Support Price (MSP), whereas the government maintains that MSP will remain in place and the bills will ensure higher remuneration for farmers.BKU’s NCR chapter president, Subhash Chaudhary said through the bills, the government will abolish mandis (agricultural produce marketing committees) and open avenues for corporates to directly access farmers’ produce. “There are no measures in the bills to ensure farmers are able to sell their produce at decent rates. The government should at least ensure that grains are bought at or above the MSP. The government is promoting capitalism with the bills, and hence farmers demand amendments in them,” he said.Ashok Bhati, spokesperson, BKU (Noida), said the farmers had held a symbolic protest in different districts of Uttar Pradesh on September 21 as well. “We had requested the government to address our grievances. The government ignored our demands hence we hit the streets,” he said. Bhati said the government framed the three bills— Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020—without consulting farmers and without safeguarding their interest.Vipin Pradhan,a farmer leader, said that the farmers submitted a memorandum to senior police officers demanding the three bills to be rolled back.Kumar Ranvijay, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said the protest was peaceful. “We had diverted the Delhi-bound traffic to DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj. The police personnel were also deployed at the DND Flyway loops and Noida Expressway to guide the commuters. Delhi Police had diverted Noida-bound traffic to internal roads,” he said.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Noida said arrangements were placed on time to divert the traffic in light of the protest and there were no jams on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/to-protest-against-reform-bills-farmers-block-delhi-noida-road-at-sector-14a/story-wWCGladGGXWpkI5bAWCehN.html
25-09-2020||Delhi||Brakes had failed, claims driver of bus that crushed three to death in N-E Delhi||The driver of the speeding cluster bus that crushed three people to death and injured three others in north-east Delhi’s Nand Nagri late Thursday night, told police that the brakes of the vehicle had failed. Senior police officers said they are getting a mechanical inspection of the bus done, which will ascertain the driver’s claim.The accident took place around 9.30pm, police said. Three persons -- 12-year-old boy Karan from Mandoli, 22-year-old Ravinder Pal from Ghaziabad, and 40-year-old Amar Singh, a daily wager -- were killed by the speeding bus plying on Route Number 261 (between Sarai Kale Khan and Nand Nagri). Three injured persons, including a woman and 16-year-old boy, are still undergoing treatment at a hospital in north-east Delhi, the police said.Police said an irate crowd later vandalised the cluster bus and shouted slogans against Delhi Police. They blocked the road and even chased away a police van for “arriving late at the spot”. They also stopped an ambulance from taking the injured persons to a hospital. A video made on phone by an onlooker showed an irate crowd pulling off the ambulance the stretcher carrying an injured boy. In the video, a few people can be heard shouting slogans against the police and were seen blocking the road.The errant driver, Pushpender Singh, who had fled the spot on seeing “the angry crowd”, was arrested in the early hours of Friday, police said. He was booked for rash and negligent driving and for causing death due to negligence.Deputy commissioner of police (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya said Singh told the police that the brakes of the bus had failed while it was descending the ITI flyover with nearly 15 passengers on board and that led to the mishap. “The driver has said after the brakes failed, he first tried to stop the bus by driving it on to a concrete road divider. But the bus did not stop even after ramming the divider -- it went on to hit a mini truck. The driver then lost control of the vehicle and it crashed into a vendor’s cart and ran over a few pedestrians,” the DCP said.Surya said the police are verifying the driver’s claims about the sequence of events. “A mechanical inspection of the bus will be done to verify of the brakes had failed,” he said.Cluster buses are managed by private concessionaires and regulated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System ( DIMTS).When asked about the brake failure of the bus, as alleged by the driver, DIMTS did not respond.Spokespersons of the Delhi government also did not offer comment on the matter on behalf of the transport department.Witnesses told the police that after hitting the mini truck, the bus rammed a vendor’s cart and hit a few more people before coming to a halt. Around six to seven were injured in the accident, of whom a man and a boy died on the spot while the third man died during treatment at Swami Dayanand Hospital.The incident also sparked a law and order situation as a mob of over 100 people vandalised the cluster bus and pelted stones on it. The mob also vented their anger on the personnel of a police patrolling van that had reached the spot. They chased the van away and blocked the main road,before staging a protest and shouting slogans against the police.DCP Surya said nearly 60 police personnel from three police stations and the reserve battalion were rushed to the spot to contain the situation and avoid further violence. “The agitators dispersed when they were assured of swift police action. Some minutes later, some women also arrived there to stage a protest and block the road. But we intervened and cleared the spot. The situation was brought under control within half an hour and no untoward incident has been reported since then,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/brakes-had-failed-claims-driver-of-bus-that-crushed-three-to-death-in-n-e-delhi/story-afSthHkG66N4dWrAUD9rJK.html

25-09-2020||City||Four burglars arrested in Noida; stolen valuables recovered||Noida: The police arrested four men for allegedly committing a series of burglaries in houses and factories in Noida. The suspects were identified as Ravi and Vishnu Thakur, residents of JJ Colony in Sector 8; Jai Prakash, a resident of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad; and Vijay Kumar, a resident of New Ashok Nagar in Delhi. Police recovered a Hyundai Accent car, seven stolen factory equipment, ₹12,400, an iron cutter, a countrymade gun, two live cartridges and a knife allegedly from their possession.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said the gang has allegedly been committing theft and burglaries frequently in Noida. “On Friday, the police received information that the suspects would be near Sector 8. A team from the Sector 20 police station was sent, which signalled the suspects to stop their car near the power house. The vehicle was searched and the police found unauthorised weapons and some stolen valuables,” he said. During interrogation the suspects allegedly revealed that they are part of a gang that commits thefts and burglaries in Noida, the officer added.Ranvijay said that on September 21, a factory in Sector 8 which had been robbed was allegedly the handiwork of the four arrested suspects. “During the robbery, the suspects had held a security guard at gunpoint. They later went to a different floor of the same building and decamped with ₹30,000 from another company’s office,” he said. The same factory had been burgled on August 19 as well. The owner had then filed a complaint against the security guard, and the Sector 20 police registered an FIR under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC and launched an investigation. They scanned CCTV footage from the premises and identified the suspects, which led to their arrest on Friday. Police found that the guard had no role in the robbery.Officers added that the arrested suspects also allegedly admitted to their role in the burglary in the same factory on August 19, as well as in a theft in a house on July 18 in Sector 27, and another on August 28 in Sector 6. “The four suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody. An accomplice, Sarfaraz, a resident of Bijnor, is absconding,” Ranvijay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-burglars-arrested-in-noida-stolen-valuables-recovered/story-G5y2YoZITJtiCltY6RuoNK.html
25-09-2020||Noida||Work on three new community centres begins in Noida||The Noida authority on Friday started work on three community centres with an aim to provide recreational facilities to residents in Sadarpur sector 43, Hoshiyarpur near sector 51 and Aghapur sector 49. The Gautam Budh Nagar Member of Parliament Dr Mahesh Sharma, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and the Noida authority general manager Rajiv Tyagi inaugurated these three projects on Friday.The authority has sanctioned and started work on these three projects after residents of these neighbourhood demanded for these facilities so that they can organize their community events, parties and wedding functions at reasonable rates, said officials.“As the work has been started at the site the authority will finish the work in next 18 months so that the residents can start using these facilities in their respective areas. The work on these three projects will be put on fast-track so that it is completed and delivered within the stipulated time frame,” said Rajiv Tyagi general manager of the Noida authority.The authority will spend Rs76.50 lakh on Aghapur community centre, Rs2.37 crore on Sadarpur sector 43 building and Rs59.60 lakh on community centre building to be built in Hoshiyarpur sector 51 area.Apart from this the authority also reviewed the progress on an underpass project that is being built near Kondli village at (19.400km distance from zero point) Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The four-lane underpass of 840 metres length is being built to provide seamless connectivity for the thousands of commuters, who use this stretch.“In last 2.5 months we have been doing construction on war footing. As a result we have completed 20% of construction work on this project. We feel that the work on this project will be completed even before the deadline if work goes with the same pace,” said Tyagi. The authority has fixed June, 2021 as the completion deadline of the underpass project that has a budget of Rs 44.89 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/work-on-three-new-community-centres-begins-in-noida/story-eda3a59PmjaOdHP0yPpl3O.html
25-09-2020||City||Centre unveils train design for high-speed RRTS corridor||Ghaziabad: The first look of regional rapid transit system (RRTS) trains, which will connect Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut, was unveiled Friday by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The officials of the NCR Transport Corporation, the agency developing the RRTS, said the prototype is scheduled to roll off the production line in 2022.The first 82-kilometres stretch of RRTS, pegged at ₹30,274 crore, is under construction and a priority stretch of 17km is coming up in Ghaziabad, between Sahibabad and Duhai. The priority section of the corridor is targeted to be commissioned in 2023, while the entire corridor will be commissioned in 2025. RRTS is proposed to run high speed trains which will have a design speed of 180kmph, but the operation speed will be kept at 160kmph.“The rolling stock of India’s first RRTS has been designed with a vision to fulfil the aspirations of new India. The rolling stock will be energy-efficient, with about 30% regeneration during braking. NCRTC has awarded the rolling stock work with an integrated, long-term comprehensive maintenance by the manufacturer, thus leveraging the benefits of life cycle costing,” said Vinay Kumar Singh, managing director of NCRTC.The entire rolling stock for Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor will be manufactured at Bombardier’s Savli plant in Gujarat under the ‘Make in India’ initiative.For RRTS, NCRTC has proposed 30 trains of six coaches each, which will operate on the main RRTS track of 82kms. The corporation has also proposed 10 trains with three coaches each, which will serve as a local transit module in Meerut.Officials added that the state-of-the-art rolling stock will be the first of its kind in the country, and will have a radiating stainless steel outer body with an aerodynamic design. “The RRTS rolling stock will have lighting and temperature control systems to enhance passenger experience and reduce energy consumption. This is developed on the line of Lotus Temple in Delhi, which has a design flow of natural sources of light and air circulation,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief public relations officer of NCRTC.Another energy saving feature will be that all doors of the trains will not open simultaneously.“There will be a push button inside and outside with the help of which passengers can open the doors. Otherwise, opening of all doors together leads to loss of air conditioning,” Sharma said. The trains will be lightweight and fully air-conditioned. Each car will have six automatic plug-in type wide doors, three on each side (the business class will have four such doors, two on each side).The RRTS trains will have transverse 2x2 seating with adequate legroom, optimised aisle width with grab handles and grab poles, for a comfortable journey for standing passengers, overhead luggage rack, mobile/laptop charging sockets and on-board Wi-Fi among other commuter-centric features.Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, MoHUA said, “It is a matter of great pride that these high-speed, high-frequency commuter trains for RRTS are being manufactured entirely under the government’s ‘Make in India’ policy. The environment friendly, energy efficient trains will improve the quality of life in and around the national capital region by accelerating economic growth, creating economic opportunities and at the same time reducing air pollution, carbon footprint, congestion, and accidents.” The 82km long Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor is one of the three prioritised RRTS corridors being implemented in phase-1. This is the first RRTS corridor in the country and will overall have 24 stations, including 21 in Uttar Pradesh.The other two Phase-I corridors are Delhi-Gurugram-SNB and Delhi-Panipat. Officials said pre-construction activities are in full swing for Delhi-Gurugram-SNB corridor and its detailed project report (DPR) is under active consideration of the Centre for sanction. They added that DPR of the Delhi-Panipat RRTS corridor is also under active consideration of the respective state governments for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-unveils-train-design-for-high-speed-rrts-corridor/story-Ond3JpoMdizEEu722iW5cK.html
25-09-2020||Noida||Noida district road safety committee holds meeting; officials told to check speeding||The Gautam Budh Nagar district road safety committee on Friday held a meeting with departments of traffic, transport, education to discuss ways to check speeding on expressways and other roads besides taking other safety measures.“We have directed the officials of traffic and transport department to take safety measures and check speeding on the expressways. We have also asked the officials to install some cameras on the Yamuna Expressway which will facilitate issuing fines to the speeding vehicles,” said additional district magistrate, Diwakar Singh, who chaired the meeting.Prashanti Tiwari, assistant regional transport commissioner (enforcement), Gautam Budh Nagar. said, “The maximum speed for light motor vehicle on expressways is 100 kmph, and for trucks and motorcycles, it is 60 kmph. The traffic and transport officials have been told to fines to violators who cross these speed limits,” he said. Tiwari said the transport department has planned to launch a drive to paste reflectors on commercial vehicles in light of the approaching winters. “In winter, visibility becomes poor because of fog, and hence reflector plays an important role in terms of road safety. We will also launch a drive to paste reflectors on all commercial vehicles,” he said.“Buses and vans used by government and private schools are also not in use for the last six months. We will hold a meeting with the school officials regarding fitness of these vehicles, once we get an official notification about reopening of schools in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-district-road-safety-committee-holds-meeting-officials-told-to-check-speeding/story-CFHNCdjlnD6WSGhWQlJfHM.html

The deceased was identified as Bishan Singh, a resident of Gulawathi Khurd village in Bulandshahr. Police said Singh had left home around 6am Wednesday after telling his family that he will be back in some time. However, when he did not return even till late night, the family began looking for him. Later, on Friday around 8am, a villagers who was acquainted with Singh, spotted the body lying in the green belt near a petrol pump in Jarcha. He then informed Singh’s family and the police.

We have sent the body for a post-mortem examination and reports are awaited. It is not clear how Singh sustained the head injuries and the burns,” he said. Police suspect that the man was murdered and dumped in the area. Sunder said primary investigation shows that Singh had come to Jarcha to meet a family and discuss the marriage proposal of a known acquaintance last week and then returned home. “On Wednesday, he left home without telling his family members where he was going. We are checking his call detail records and questioning people to find out more,” he said. Narender Pradhan, Singh’s neighbour, said Singh had gone missing in the past too for a few days but he always returned home eventually. “Singh used to drink heavily.

25-09-2020||City||UP-Rera nudges state govt to implement SC order on lower interest rate to realty developers||Two months after the Supreme Court ordered the Noida and Greater Noida authority to charge a lower interest rate on residential project developers for the land they bought, the Uttar Pradesh government is still to implement it. Now, Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority (UP-Rera) has recommended to the state to follow the order as it would help revive the real estate sector, officials said.According to a state government official, the government is reviewing the order and considering all legal options before it.UP-Rera wrote its recommendation to the state additional chief secretary of the industrial development department and said the sector was witnessing a liquidation crisis in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic Covid-19.“In view of the possibilities that disputes, which are increasing between buyers and promoters in Noida and Greater Noida, may be positively resolved, we decided to send our recommendations to the government on this issue as per the provisions of Section 32 of the Rera Act 2016,” said Balwinder Kumar, UP-Rera member who confirmed that the letter was sent last week. “The real estate sector has been witnessing a huge financial crisis lately. As a result, homebuyers’ interests are also affected as promoters are unable to deliver units due to the fund crunch.”According to their policies, Noida and Greater Noida authorities charge an interest rate of 11% on developers, who pay for the housing land in instalments. On defaulting, a penal interest is imposed.Going by the old interest rates, Noida has around ₹25,000 crore in land dues that it has to recover while GNIDA has to recover around ₹7,000 crore from developers. On July 10, the Supreme Court, while hearing petitions in the matter, directed Noida and GNIDA to only charge an interest rate of 8.5%, as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on land cost, fixed by the State Bank of India. The Supreme Court’s order also says that developers should deposit 25% of total dues within three months and the rest within one year from the date of the order if they want to avail benefits of the apex court’s order. “Many developers have submitted their proposals with Noida and GNIDA asking that their land dues be recalibrated in light of the Supreme Court order. However, the two authorities are yet to settle the dues. If this order is implemented, then at last 250,000 units can be finished and delivered,” said RK Arora, president (UP chapter), National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO).“The commencement certificate required to start work at a new project is issued only after the no financial dues certificate. And the no financial dues certificate is possible only when the financial dues are settled, with the new Supreme Court order on interest rates. We hope that the Noida and Greater Noida authorities implement this new order and help the sector,” said Prashant Tiwari, president (Western UP chapter),Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI).Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari and the Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan refused to comment on the issue. However, a UP government official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The state government is examining the legal aspects of this case before implementing the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-nudges-state-govt-to-implement-sc-order-on-lower-interest-rate-to-realty-developers/story-wQfRh4mPgBZSYO1bYiGSVI.html

25-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Covid disrupts polio, measles drive||The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant drop of immunisations and supplements-- of over 73,000-- in Ghaziabad on women and children from last year between April and August when the lockdown was in force. Even the health department’s corrective measures in May did not seem to have corrected the trend.Most of these immunisations and supplements are critical in preventing diseases such as polio, measels and childhood tuberculosis, pneumonia among others. Some of these also figure in the central government’s Indradhanush programme, which aims at full immunisation for all children and pregnant women.Previous studies, including one from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), pointed that the BCG vaccine administered to prevent childhood tuberculosis averted severe Covid-19 infections and deaths.According to the records of the district health department, about 299,762 children and women received vaccinations and supplements as per the immunisation schedule between April to August in 2019. The same period this year, it was 226,105. “The shortfall has been the result of lockdown when activities and movement of people was not taking place and our health care workers were also focused on Covid-19 duties. Since the period of administering vaccines is fixed, many missed the schedule between March to May,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer. “These include vaccinations given at the time of birth and up to age of 16 years in children. The women are also given preventive vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria and also given supplements like iron. If these are not given on time, there is a higher risk of contracting these diseases.”With Covid-19 surging, the health department resumed the vaccination drive in May.“To make up for the lost time period, we’re holding sessions three days a week, including Mondays,” said Dr Vishram Singh, district immunisation officer. Yet, it has not drawn more people, some of who may have migrated to their home towns during the lockdown have not returned. “Generally, there is no major risk if a child misses vaccination. Such misses take place during routine days and it also happened during the lockdown period. But, it could lead to slower immunity levels in the population and the desired peak is not achieved. After a break, the vaccination schedule is generally resumed from where it had stopped. Thereafter, it is followed as per the timeline,” said Dr. Pramod Sabharwal, president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (Ghaziabad branch). Dr. Sumit Gupta, paediatric from Columbia Asia Hospital (Ghaziabad), said that compulsory vaccines should be resumed as soon as possible. “The vaccines start protection from the time when they are administered. So, they will definitely not protect during the period of delay and the child may be at risk. So, the vaccines, which are compulsory, should be resumed as soon as possible if there is a delay,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-covid-disrupts-polio-measles-drive/story-pyppUNohwZiTuHhTNTSzqL.html

25-09-2020||City||Covid crisis: Ghaziabad officials told to enforce containment norms strictly in hot spots||The state government appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, on Friday directed Ghaziabad officials to ensure strict enforcement of containment norms in hot spots across the district.In light of the directions, the district administration on Friday appointed an officer to oversee sealing efforts in containment zones. “The nodal officer directed us to make sure all containment zones are properly managed and all protocols are duly enforced. For the purpose, we have asked station house officers (SHOs) of respective areas to keep track of enforcement norms, and we have also deputed additional district magistrate (city) as the nodal officer to ensure that boundary tapes, which are provided by the municipal corporation, are put outside containment zones in order to seal them,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.HT had earlier reported that residents and local councilors had alleged that many containment zones were not fully sealed allowing unrestricted movement of people.According to the records of the district administration, Ghaziabad has 415 containment zones.Nodal officer Pandian C on Friday also visited the RT-PCR and TrueNat laboratories at MMG Hospital. He reportedly expressed dissatisfaction over the state of affairs as the TrueNat testing machine was not testing samples for Covid-19 since September 10, while the RT-PCR laboratory was only testing nearly 200-250 samples daily.“The sampling kits for TrueNat machines are yet to be received. We received only 100 today(Friday) and we need more. For the RT-PCR lab, we require more human resources to ramp up testing. We would require about 12 lab technicians to undertake 750 tests per day,” an officer from MMG Hospital, who did not wish not to be named, said.The district magistrate said that he has deputed additional district magistrate (executive) to make a work plan for the RT-PCR lab at the district hospital. “I have deputed the officer to prepare a work plan on the requirement of technicians and infrastructure which is needed to ramp up testing. Otherwise, our Covid-19 samples which are taken by the health department are being sent for testing to Noida. The nodal officer has directed that our RT-PCR laboratory should test at least 750 samples per day,” Pandey added.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said two lab technicians were provided to the laboratory already.“We will provide more technicians for the new laboratory. It is in our interest that the laboratory processes samples collected from the district. Otherwise, we have to send them to other districts. We have received approvals for hiring 20 more lab technicians, and the process for hiring them will start soon,” he added.On Thursday, the nodal officer had directed the officials to test at least 6,000 daily apart from asking officials to trace and test workers employed in industrial units in case they have symptoms of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-crisis-ghaziabad-officials-told-to-enforce-containment-norms-strictly-in-hot-spots/story-zjftk62fkAbDufM2N7cjIP.html

The body of their family member is still unclaimed at the hospital. Both of them had the same name, which led to the confusion,” said Khan’s sister Nilofar Shaikh, 33. “The police had called us and the other family for inquiry. The family which claimed my sister’s body is denying their mistake. I could not see my sister one last time, which is so painful. How will I sleep peacefully now? They also carried out her last rites,” said Shaikh. Shaikh claimed she had checked the unclaimed body several times and it did not match her sister’s features and clothes. “The unclaimed body has mehendi applied on the nails which my sister never did. The police have collected DNA samples for a test. My mother who survived the collapse is in a state of shock,” said Shaikh. Rajeev Muskawad, superintendent in-charge of IGM Hospital, said, “There is an unclaimed body of a woman from the building collapse site at the hospital. No family has claimed it yet.” MB Shinde, senior police inspector of Narpoli police station, said, “The family claimed the body at the hospital is not of their sister. We have collected the DNA samples and are awaiting the report. When we handed over all the bodies to the relatives, we had checked all their records and took their statement on the spot. We will inquire with both the families and take needful action.” Another family has claimed the body of their 2-year-old child, Museb Qureshi, is yet to be found. Saleem Usman Qureshi, 28, the toddler’s uncle said, “The police searched for the body on Friday too, but it was not found. We have filed a missing person’s complaint with the police.

25-09-2020||Delhi||Two former heads of Lakshmi Vilas Bank held for misappropriating Religare funds of ₹729cr||The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the former assistant vice-president of RMG Corporate Credit Group at Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Janpath branch, and the regional head of the bank in connection with misappropriation of fixed deposit funds of Religare Finvest Limited (RFL) to the tune of ₹729 crore, senior police officers said.Police have identified the two arrested persons as 57-year-old Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Inderpuri and former regional head, and Anjani Kumar, 48, former assistant vice-president and resident of Noida Extension.Join commissioner of police (Economic Offences Wing) OP Mishra said as per the complaint filed by Manpreet Singh Suri of Religare, in November 2016, his company had placed an amount of ₹400 crore in two fixed deposits (FDs) with the Lakshmi Vilas Bank.“These FDs were of a short-term tenure,so that they remained free of encumbrances. In January 2017, Religare placed an additional ₹350 crore in two FDs with the bank. These two FDs were also of a short-term tenure,” Mishra said.He said all four FDs were renewed by Religare from time to time till their maturity in July 2017. On July 31, Religare was shocked to receive an email from Lakshmi Vilas Bank containing the fund statement for Religare’s current account. “Religare discovered that the bank had credited the proceeds of the FDs to the current account and then debited the cumulative amount of ₹729 crore from the account without any prior intimation to Religare. The bank and the other accused persons had used RFL’s funds for onward lending without due consent,” Mishra said.He said the bank would have made huge gains from such lending as it held the FDs at an interest rate of 4.5% and had purportedly lent the money further at the interest rate of 10%. It was further alleged that the bank cheated Religare and misused its public shareholder money entrusted with the bank in its capacity as Religare’s banker, thus causing a wrongful loss to the complainant company to the tune of ₹729 crore, Mishra said.Religare’s complaint to the EOW named the arrested persons; brothers Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh; their companies RHC Holding Ltd, Ranchem Pvt Ltd and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, its former directors and employees. During investigation, police found that the bank officials, in collusion with the promoter brothers, deliberately did not complete the mandatory formalities before onward loaning the money to RHC Holding and Ranchem to benefit these companies and to allow the accused persons to square off their liabilities.“Therefore, following searches, Pradeep Kumar and Anjani Kumar Verma were arrested, “ Mishra said.Both Singh brothers are lodged in Tihar Jail following their arrest last year by the Enforcement Directorate. In a charge sheet filed in January, the ED had alleged that the brothers used two sets of “conduit companies” to funnel funds from their finance company Religare over eight years. A large part of this money was used to buy properties and there was no intention of repaying the sum, the charge sheet had said.Officials of the Lakshmi Vilas Bank couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-former-heads-of-lakshmi-vilas-bank-held-for-misappropriating-religare-funds-of-729cr/story-6nydiW9PHYD8f2ldeaVYoL.html

25-09-2020||Delhi||South civic body razes 8 locked gates in Green Park, Safdarjung colonies||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday bulldozed eight gates of two residential colonies at Green Park Extension and at Safdarjung Enclave after receiving complaints from residents over gates being closed during the day, which made it difficult for them to access the neighbourhood. A team of officials from south zone of the civic body, backed by a team from Delhi Police, on Friday afternoon demolished four gates each in Green Park Extension and Safdarjung Enclave, respectively. According to officials in the civic body, it has received similar representations from residents of several other colonies such as Greater Kailash, against closure of gates. But, the corporation has not yet decided if those gates will be demolished yet. “The gates were pulled down after a group of residents repeatedly complained of gates being closed during the day time, causing them inconvenience in accessing the colony. They had met the deputy commissioner of the south zone regarding the matter, after which action was taken today,” said a senior south corporation official. He added that so far they had no plans of pulling down gates in any other colonies. “In order to rebuild the gates, the RWAs will require taking clearances from traffic police and the SDMC. They will also need to ensure that the gates are manned at all times,” the official said. The resident welfare associations (RWAs) of the two colonies, however, expressed shock and said that the SDMC officials did not give any prior notice about the demolition of the gates and it would cost them a hefty amount to rebuild the iron gates, which had guarded the colonies for around 30-40 years. “Four gates (no. 5, 7, 9 and 16) were demolished with JCB machines this afternoon. It came as a shock, as there was no prior intimation. Also, there were no fresh complaints from any residents about the gates being closed and no one in particular had complained regarding the gates,” said Neha Puri, general secretary, Green Park Extension Association. She added that because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the RWA had kept most of the gates shut in order to restrict movement of residents . “There are a total of 18 gates in the colony, of which two along the main road remained open 24 hours. The remaining gates remain closed during 1 pm-4 pm in the day and 10.30pm and 5am. Also, after the lockdown was lifted, several residents had requested that some of the gates be opened at a specific time and an arrangement regarding the same was made,” said Puri, adding, that all gates are open for pedestrian movement during the day. The Delhi High Court in an order on July 17, directed the RWA of N-Block GK-I to open a colony gate during the daytime while hearing a petition filed by a resident challenging RWA’s decision to keep most colony gates closed. K P Menon, president, B-3 RWA, Safadrjung Enclave, said that the gates which have been demolished stood here for the past 40 years. “The least a civic body can do is to give a notice. The gates have been broken down in a discriminatory way at the behest of some residents, who had been opposing the closure of the gates,” said Menon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/south-civic-body-razes-8-locked-gates-in-green-park-safdarjung-colonies/story-8sC69Er5eQzDp13gTLQ69I.html

25-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt schools start second round of admissions to classes 6 to 9 and 11||The Directorate of Education (DoE) on Friday started the second round of admissions in Delhi government schools for classes 6 to 9 and 11 after receiving requests from parents who could not apply in the first round held earlier this month. The window for applications under the second round will remain open till October 3.According to the DoE, as many as 64,450 students had applied for admissions to these classes in the first round and all 64,450 have been allotted schools. The first phase of admissions will be over by September 30. An official in the education department, on condition of anonymity, said, “Many parents have said they were not aware of the admission process due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation and that’s why they could not apply earlier. After receiving several such requests, the government decided to launch a second round of admissions.”The admissions in government schools are crucial this year due to the possibility of migration of students from private schools to government schools in view of the financial challenges wrought by the Covid-enforced lockdown. The education department, however, is still analysing the data. “The admission under the first round will be completed by September 30 and the second round it will go on till October 15. Once both rounds are over, we will analyse and see if there has been any major influx of students from private to government schools. It’s still early to say if the number of admissions is more or less than last year’s as admissions to government schools are open throughout the year. None can be denied admission to a government school,” the official added.In a statement issued Friday, education minister Manish Sisodia’s office said, “The second phase has been launched to address the concerns of parents who could not get their wards registered earlier for online admissions...The Link for submission of online registration form is available on the home page of the department’s website -- www.edudel.nic.in under the tab, “Govt. School Admissions”.”While the registration process for admission to classes 6 to 9 consists of only one step, while admissions to class 11 will entail two levels. “In the first step, a registration number and password will be generated. In the second step, the applicant has to complete the registration form after logging in. The applicants must complete both steps, else the form will be rejected,” the statement read.A centralised helpline number --1800116888 or 10580--has been issued for any admission related queries. “Once the admission is confirmed, the applicant will have to visit the allotted school with all the requisite original documents along with copies for confirmation of admission as per the schedule provided to them. Admissions will be confirmed only after the physical verification of requisite documents by the government school concerned,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-start-second-round-of-admissions-to-classes-6-to-9-and-11/story-w0pyz1hOmSZVJN19NIfwtK.html

25-09-2020||Delhi||Air quality in Delhi likely to worsen, Nasa forecasts increase in PM 2.5 levels||With wind speeds in Delhi gradually decreasing, and the number of stubble burning cases shooting up in parts of Punjab, the city’s air quality is likely to plunge in the coming weeks.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that Delhi is currently receiving north-westerly winds from Punjab and Haryana, which means that plumes of smoke from farm fires were blowing in to pollute the city’s air.On Friday, Delhi overall air quality index was 134, in the ‘moderate’ range. During the day, the hourly average AQI had touched 152.On Thursday, the AQI recording of 104.“Throughout next week the AQI levels are likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ range, but on the higher end. It all depends on how much stubble burning happens in Punjab and Haryana,” said a senior IMD official.The official said that while throughout next week, wind speed in Delhi will range between 15-20kmph, which will be favourable to disperse pollutants. But things will start deteriorating from next Saturday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, also confirmed that wind speed will gradually reduce in the coming week. He added that Delhi for now has no forecast of rain, which could wash away pollutants coming from the neighbouring states.Meanwhile, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa)’s GEOS Composition Forecasting (GEOS-CF) system, which produces global, three-dimensional distributions of atmospheric composition, showed high PM 2.5 (ultra-fine particulate matter) presence over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, which will also bring down the air quality in Delhi.Pawan Gupta, research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research, Universities Space Research Association, said that a mix of dust, smoke and unfavourable weather conditions will play a role in increased PM 2.5 levels in the coming days.“Dust is sneaking into the mix of smoke and pollution in India and Pakistan. The GEOS forecast shows high PM 2.5 levels over the region in the next two-three days. It appears a combination of smoke, dust and weather playing a role,” Gupta said.Gupta also said that NASA’s satellite imagery had shown a significant rise in the number of fires in across various districts in Punjab on Friday.Vini Mahajan, chief secretary of Punjab, in a letter written to Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) chief Bhure Lal on Friday, said that the district administration of Amritsar, from where maximum number of crop residue burning cases are being reported, has been directed to collect environment compensation from erring farmers as challans.“It is intimated that we have also received alerts from the state monitoring agencies about a few paddy residue burning incidents in the Majha region as the area grows vegetables immediately after the harvest of paddy. The area is not a part of the hotspot districts and the window of time available to these farmers to manage the residue is too short for timely plantation of next crop,” the letter read.The letter added, “However, taking a serious note of early incidents of crop residue burnings, the concerned deputy commissioners were asked to send reports after field verification.”EPCA chief, Bhure Lal, had earlier this week written to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana asking them to intensify action against the early instances of stubble burning visible through satellite imagery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-in-delhi-likely-to-worsen-nasa-forecasts-increase-in-pm-2-5-levels/story-YcRJpWG95orHpxPfTVytBP.html

25-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Three injured in clash over garbage collection in Bandhwari||htreporters@hindustantimes.com Three men allegedly suffered gunshot wounds on Friday morning after an altercation between two groups turned violent at Bandhwari waste treatment plant on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road. The police said the fight was between the groups who are involved in contractual work for collection and segregation of garbage at the plant. The three injured men were rushed to two different hospitals in Faridabad. Two of them are said to be critical, said the police. Both the groups hail from Mangar village in Faridabad, the police said, adding that the incident took place between 8.30 am and 9 am. The police said that in a statement, Harinder, who was among the injured, alleged that he and his brother, Manoj, along with several other workers, were segregating waste at the plant when a group of at least seven people arrived. “The incident took place at the plant. He alleged that the rival group arrived and had an argument with them over some contractual work. It escalated into a scuffle with lathis and several gunshots were fired from both sides. Prima facie, there was dispute between the two parties over garbage collection work,” said sub-inspector Praveen, in-charge, Gwal Pahari police post. The police said Manoj suffered a gunshot wound in the head while Harinder suffered minor injuries from pellets. Mohit, from the second group, sustained gunshot wounds in the ribs and arms. Manoj and Mohit are undergoing treatment at different private hospitals in Faridabad, said the police. After the information was received, a team from Gwal Pahari police post was rushed to the spot. “Three persons were injured in the melee. Mohit and Manoj have been declared unfit-for-statement and are critical. On the statement of Harinder, who is also admitted at the hospital, an FIR has been registered against at least seven people. The other party is yet to record their statement,” said the police officer quoted above. A case was registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections of the Arms Act at DLF Phase 1 police station on Friday evening, said the police. A spokesperson from Ecogreen Energy, the MCG concessionaire, said, “This incident has nothing to do with Ecogreen. MCG gave contracts to third parties for treatment of legacy waste. These companies floated tenders for procurement of products and services. In one of the such company procurement process, two vendors came face to face and got personal with each other. Ecogreen Energy Private Limited shouldn’t be commenting further on the incident as the matter belongs to third parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-three-injured-in-clash-over-garbage-collection-in-bandhwari/story-cUo5KsvGeurPADC6NZ8xVK.html
25-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: DTCP allows construction of guard room, toilet in stilt parking areas||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has decided to allow the construction of guard room and toilet in the stilt parking area/floor of those plots which are four storeys and above. The department said that the reason for allowing construction is that in majority of such structures, such facilities are usually constructed behind the stairs. Since buildings with multiple floors need a lift operator and a guard to manage it, the need was felt to allow the construction of such facilities. Ravi Sihag, senior town planner, Gurugram, said that only 200-foot construction in the parking area would be allowed and this will be included in the floor area ratio (FAR) permitted for the plots. “A number of people had given representations in this matter and the matter was taken by the headquarters. We have sought objections from people by October 15 and after which the permission is likely to be granted,” said Sihag. The town planning department officials said that whenever they went for inspection or a sealing drive, they found that such facilities were present at majority of the homes. “Keeping in view these observations, it was decided to allow such constructions within the permissible FAR,” said RS Bhath, district town planner. The notification issued by DTCP stated, “Service/guard room and a toilet (maximum 20 sq m) shall be permissible in the stilt area/floor, subject to conditions that this area be located adjacent to the staircase/ lift, be counted towards FAR and that the parking and other norms (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-dtcp-allows-construction-of-guard-room-toilet-in-stilt-parking-areas/story-800feTwXzsv9lc1Gngmi3L.html
25-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Government schools hold meetings with stakeholders on the National Education Policy||Government schools across the district held consultation meetings on the National Education Policy (NEP) with various stakeholders, such as members of school management committees, parents, village heads and legislators on Friday. School heads said that the meeting was an exercise to seek feedback and convey necessary information regarding the new policy. This comes at a time when Haryana has been pushing for a swift implementation of NEP. The state recently concluded a four-day academic conclave on the policy. State education minister Kanwar Pal on Thursday had said that Haryana aspired to become the first state to implement the new policy.In July this year, the Union Cabinet passed the country’s new National Education Policy. This is the first such policy in the last 28 years. It recommends sweeping changes in the education system, including the introduction of primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities in India, creating a single higher-education regulator, and easier board examinations. As per the policy, the 10+2 structure of school curricula is to be replaced by a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure.Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said that various stakeholders, including parents, local leaders, and members of the school management committee, reflected upon different facets of the new policy. “This policy affects the future of children and the country. It was important to explain various facets of the policy to parents and other stakeholders in the education system. We took the help of PowerPoint presentations to explain the policy in simple terms and received constructive feedback from parents,” said Miglani.Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that both private and government schools in the area had been invited for the discussion meeting on Friday. Raghav said that the discussion mostly revolved around the new provision of teaching in local languages. “People had doubts if private schools would abide by the policy along with government schools. With English being a crucial language, there were mixed reactions to the new provisions. Overall, it was a healthy discussion. While most people have constructive feedback, others raised some concerns,” said Raghav.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that besides discussing the various components of the new policy, feedback had been sought from parents and teachers regarding the provision of teaching in local languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-government-schools-hold-meetings-with-stakeholders-on-the-national-education-policy/story-Chxdvhm7SDe1kyaDnHvWlL.html
25-09-2020||City||Gurugram: NHAI allows partial resumption of work on Sohna road project||abhishek.behl@hindustantimes.comGurugram: The National Highways Authority of India has allowed partial resumption of work on the Sohna road project from Saturday. The work was stopped after the collapse of a concrete slab of an elevated corridor of the project on August 22. NHAI officials said that work would be allowed to start at surface level and not on the elevated structure, which will be resumed only after getting the report of high-level technical committee probing the collapse. The permission to resume work comes after an inspection was conducted by NHAI project director on September 16 and a report was submitted by an independent engineer on the measures taken to improve safety at the site, the officials said.“Permission has been granted to start work at surface level after the contractor installed seamless barricades, grilles and other safety measures. However, work on the elevated section will not resume till further directions,” said Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI. To study the reasons for the collapse of span, NHAI had formed a committee which has directed that concrete strength should be tested in a private laboratory. The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project (from Rajiv Chowk to Sohna) has two parts. The first part includes an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk to a point beyond Badshahpur. The second part comprises the expansion of 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and will involve construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-nhai-allows-partial-resumption-of-work-on-sohna-road-project/story-2jxPLEWezlbR69hSAkiS4I.html

25-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Two bookies held for placing bets on IPL match||Two alleged bookmakers were arrested by the crime branch for placing bets on an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match earlier this week, said police on Friday. Police said a raid was conducted based on a tip. According to police, the two suspects --- identified by police as Virendra and Rajesh Kaushik --- were operating from a flat in a sector 107 society and had placed bets on the match. A crime branch official, requesting anonymity, said, “When the police team entered the house, we found Virendra, opened the door while the other man, Rakesh Kaushik, was on the phone taking bets with a laptop in front of him.” Police said the match was being screened on a television set in the room. On a mattress, several mobile phones were kept. Police seized three mobile phones, a laptop and a notepad. “The bookmaker on the phone was saying that the odds were 39 paise for a bet on the team batting first, which means that a person placing ₹100 on that team at that point of time, would receive ₹139 if it wins. The odds keep changing as the match progresses,” the official quoted above said. Both the accused are from Nangloi area in Delhi. Police said the suspects were produced in district court on Wednesday and released on bail.

25-09-2020||Gurugram||MCG to hold its upcoming House meeting at Sukhrali community centre on October 5||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will hold its upcoming House meeting at a community centre in Sukhrali on October 5. An invitation in this regard was sent to senior MCG officials and councillors by the civic body earlier this week, said officials on Friday.This is MCG’s third House meeting since the imposition of the national lockdown in March this year. But it is the first time that the civic body will be holding a House meeting at the Sukhrali community centre.During the last House meeting on August 28, which was held at a community centre in Sector 27, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh had taken a decision that each House meeting of the civic body henceforth will be held at a different residential sector. Singh said that the rationale behind such a move was to better understand local civic issues of different residential sectors and address them right away. He said that prior to holding a meeting, a team of MCG officials might visit the areas near the community centre and take an on-ground survey of the existing civic conditions. They can also directly communicate with the local residents regarding the civic ailments that continue to bother them. Following the House meeting in Sector 27, MCG officials had surveyed the drainage issues in sectors 27, 28, and Golf Course Road (GCR), and had come up with various plans to address the lack of proper drainage in the area and execute engineering changes.“Further, by holding a House meeting at a new residential sector every time, the local community centres across the city would also get a makeover if needed. This would ensure that various civic buildings across the city are well-maintained,” said Singh.There are 60 community centres in the city, 38 of which are managed by the MCG and 22 by local residents’ welfare associations (RWAs). As per MCG officials, councillors would be submitting their list of agendas for the House meeting next week. Mayor Madhu Azad said councillors have also been asked to compile a list of issues pertaining to Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) that can be discussed in the upcoming meeting, and subsequently be taken up with GMDA and HSVP officials in a separate meeting.“In several House meetings over the last 12 months, councillors have repeatedly raised issues pertaining to the GMDA and HSVP. Hence, we have decided to take up the matter directly with them in a separate meeting. Most issues pertaining to HSVP are related to land. GMDA, on the other hand, operates similarly as the MCG. As such there are multiple overlapping issues that need to be addressed,” said Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-hold-its-upcoming-house-meeting-at-sukhrali-community-centre-on-october-5/story-GvXRjEZh6wcUUr0YO5tuFJ.html
25-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Only 57 families in district under distress ration token scheme||archana.mishra@hindustantimes.com The number of families with distress ration tokens (DRTs), which were issued during the Covid-induced lockdown to the needy without ration cards in Gurugram, has drastically plunged from 9,751 in June to 57 in August, according to the data available with the district administration. Officials said that the mass exodus of migrant workers (almost three lakh people left the district) during the lockdown led to the significant decline in the number of people entitled for DRTs. Under the DRT scheme, the Haryana government is providing five kilogram of wheat and one kilogram pulses per month to each member of the entitled families.The distress ration tokens come under the Other Priority Household (OPH) category of regular ration card issued by the state government, the officials said. “A large chunk of migrant workers, who applied for DRT and were entitled under it, left the district when the government arranged trains and buses for them in June and July,” said, Monika Malik, in-charge of district food and supply department. “Out of 57 families at present, 42 are in Gurugram block, with majority of them in the Arjun Nagar area. Remaining beneficiaries are in Sohna, Badshahpur, Farrukhnagar and Pataudi blocks. In June, such beneficiaries were clustered in Nathupur area, especially in small colonies adjoining Delhi border,” said Malik. According to the data, the district in May received more than 21,000 applications for DRT, of which 4,980 were accepted for the entitlement. In June, more applications came in and the total number of beneficiaries under the scheme increased to 9,751. This was peak month when nearly 151,705 kg of wheat and 9,342 kg of pulses as dry ration were distributed to the entitled families. In July, however, the number of beneficiaries drastically plunged to 57, the second lowest in the state after Ambala having only 27 beneficiaries. Over 1,045 kg of wheat and 54 kg pulses were distributed through these tokens. In August, the number of entitled families remained the same and almost similar quantity of ration was distributed across the district. “Considering that many people in the state do not have ration card or fail to fulfil the eligibility criteria for a ration card, the state government in April decided to provide DRT to these people,” said Malik. At that time, local level committees were constituted with the help of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to survey such families. Malik said that details of such families were uploaded online for verification at the state level. “The token does not automatically entitle the holder to a regular ration card. It was provided to them at the nearby fair price shop for three months -- April, May and June. Now, the scheme is extended till November,” she said.At the state level too, there has been a significant reduction in the number of beneficiaries. In May, over 25,000 tokens were distributed across the state which came down to 5,682 in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-only-57-families-in-district-under-distress-ration-token-scheme/story-QUzznfwKNKzBeyjo5Aj99H.html
25-09-2020||City||Sisodia stable, administered plasma therapy||New Delhi: Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who has Covid-19 and dengue, was administered plasma therapy on Friday. His situation is now stable, senior officials in his office said.Sisodia tested Covid-19 positive on September 14, following which he was isolated at his residence. He was admitted to the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday, with fever and low oxygen count.His platelet count was found to be low and later he was also diagnosed with dengue. On Thursday, he was admitted to Max Superspeciality Hospital in Saket and moved to the intensive care unit (ICU).“The deputy CM was administered plasma therapy today. His condition is stable now. The vitals have improved significantly,” said a close aide of the minister who did not wish to be identified.After health minister Satyendar Jain, Sisodia is the second cabinet minister in the Arvind Kejriwal government to contact Covid-19 infection. When Jain was unwell, Sisodia took over as the interim health minister and was in charge of the portfolio when Delhi witnessed its first peak in June.Medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital Suresh Kumar told PTI that though there is no scientific evidence to prove that plasma therapy benefits a patient, it has been administered for various ailments for several years. “In Covid-19 patients, it helps in bringing the oxygen level to the normal value besides other benefits, which aid in recovery. But in some cases, plasma therapy does not work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-stable-administered-plasma-therapy/story-cKJqTnGRDlslTq7DNoz5hN.html

Factory workers could not reach in time due while many didn’t come at all. If the protests go on the industry would suffer daily loss around ₹1,500 crore.”However, few industrial associations also backed the farmers’ protest stating that they are the backbone of the state and needed support at this time.Janta Nagar small scale manufacturers’ association head Jaswinder Thukral said, “No doubt the industrial activities have been affected by the protests, but we stand by the farmers.”The chairman of All India Motor Transport Congress and Ludhiana Goods Transport Association, Charan Singh Lohara, said trucks remained off the road on Friday as the transporters had earlier extended support to the farmers. The services would resume from Saturday.However, Pankaj Sharma, general secretary of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings, said, “The administration supported the industry, thus factories were able to operate normally despite the agitation. Though the dispatch of industrial goods could take place due to the suspension of transport, the same would be covered in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-industrial-shipments-to-ludhiana-delayed-as-trucks-pull-over/story-YWA44yjiwO9ysteDEsMkrJ.html
25-09-2020||Delhi||Two women killed by their husbands in separate incidents, both suspects nabbed||Two women were murdered, allegedly by their husbands, in two separate incidents in Delhi on Thursday. The suspects in both the cases have been arrested, police said.In the first incident, on Thursday afternoon, a 32-year-old man allegedly bludgeoned his 28-year-old wife to death in front of their four-year-old son before trying to die by suicide by slitting his wrist in southwest Delhi’s Dabri. The man, however, was saved after a police team rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he got immediate medical attention.Police said that marital discord seems to be the reason that led to the murder. The man, identified as Bhanu Pratap, will be arrested and booked for killing his wife once he is discharged from the hospital.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said a call was received that around 3 pm on Thursday, stating that a person had “cut his veins” inside his house in Dabri. A police team reached the house and found that a couple lay bleeding on the floor. Both of them were rushed to a nearby hospital, where the woman was declared brought dead, said Meena.“The woman, Soni Devi, was attacked on her head with a blunt object that caused her death. Her husband has cut wounds on his wrist that suggests that he tried to kill himself. The couple’s child, who was in the one-room house at the time of the crime, is now living with a relative,” said DCP Meena.The police said that the initial probe into the case has revealed that the couple had strained relations since their wedding five years ago. Their frequent altercations forced them to live separately. The husband, who works as a mechanic, had started living in north-east Delhi while the woman stayed with their child in the Dabri home, a police officer associated with the probe said.On Thursday, Bhanu Pratap visited his wife. Neighbours have told the police that they heard the couple quarrelling but did not intervene since it was a routine affair. Around 2.30pm, they heard Soni Devi screaming and the child crying. They later rushed in to help and found the couple bleeding on the floor. One of them called the police, the officer said.“The exact reason behind the fight will be ascertained only after we record Pratap’s statement,” the officer added.Elsewhere, nearly 10 hours before Soni’s murder, a 29-year-old woman was strangled to death allegedly by her husband following an altercation over his extra marital affair and her checking his cellphone at their home in central Delhi’s Multani Dhanda, Paharganj.The 31-year-old husband, Sunny, was arrested later in day from Paharganj area. Sunny was driving an e-rickshaw with a mask covering his face when a police team nabbed him, said DCP (central) Sanjay Bhatia.The woman’s body was found on the floor of her home by a relative who informed the police. Her two children were at her in-laws home. Her husband Sunny was also missing after Wednesday night.“Since Sunny was an e-rickshaw driver, we started stopping and checking all e-rickshaws in the neighbourhood. Sunny tried to flee after seeing the police. But our team caught him and he confessed to having strangled his wife using her dupatta after having an altercation over his extra marital affair,” said DCP Bhatia.The woman wanted to check his cellphone’s call details to confront him on his affair. Sunny refused to hand over his cell phone. It led to an argument and he killed her in a fit of rage, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-women-killed-by-their-husbands-in-separate-incidents-both-suspects-nabbed/story-2bBXuyQiL2gKS4fy6MSHrM.html

He added that as per the provisions of the law when the farm land would be taken on lease, the industrial houses would have the right to draw loans on them. Bains said 70-80% of the farmers of Punjab were already in debt and their lands were mortgaged with the banks, under which the industrial houses would first buy their crops at half price and later usurp their land.Effigy burnt outside Jama Masjid Meanwhile, members of the Muslim community here came out in support of the farmers and joined their cause. They also burnt an effigy of the central government outside Jama Masjid on Friday.Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Sani Ludhianvi, national president and Shahi Imam of the Jamaat Ahle Islam Hind, said people must stand up and save the nation from being sold out to crony capitalists.Earlier during the day, trade unions also joined the protesting farmers and took out a procession from Jagraon Bridge to oppose the agriculture-related bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agri-bills-death-knell-in-garb-of-reform-says-lip-chief-simarjit-singh-bains/story-WxgL92sl4jvOpSp2JLfXaP.html

In Pune, they have surveyed 182 villages and 13 municipal councils,” the CM said.He said the campaign was being extended in Pune to include factories, housing societies and civic wards.He said easing of lockdown restrictions, also called ‘unlock’ and ‘begin again’ by authorities, increased the threat of the virus spreading and asked people to ensure they wear masks and maintain social distancing norms.“Now we see two kinds of people. One who has tremendous fear for the coronavirus and the other who is very careless about the outbreak.

I will never waiver on delivery,” he said, as he spelt out part-2 of the new seven-point governance priority for the new term.

Last year, the first cutoff list was announced on June 28. The DU has also announced dates for admission to entrance-based undergraduate and postgraduate courses. While the undergraduate admissions will begin from October 19, postgraduate admissions will start from October 26.According to the admission schedule released by the DU’s admission department, there will be five cutoffs scheduled this year. However, in case seats remain vacant even after the five, further cutoffs will be released. The admissions under the first cutoff will be conducted between October 12 and 14. The second cutoff is scheduled to be released on October 19.There will be a three-day admission window for each cutoff. The third, fourth and fifth cutoffs are scheduled to be released on October 26, November 2 and November 9, respectively. A special cutoff will be released on November 18 for seats vacant and admission under that will be conducted between November 18 and 20.Dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said the session for the first-year undergraduates will begin from November 18. “We are hoping that we manage to wrap up admissions under at least the five cutoffs before November 18.

25-09-2020||City||Hope visuals of distressed farmers mellow Centre: Capt||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday expressed hope that the pain of the agitating farmers, who are braving the pandemic to oppose agriculture laws, will reach the Central government and the latter will show some regard to the farming community. In a statement issued here, the chief minister said the BJP-led Union government, with its “ill-conceived and unconstitutional” farm laws, had pushed the farmers to the brink, forcing them to come out on the roads and endanger their lives. “Maybe the distressing visuals of tens of hundreds of farmers out on the road in Punjab, and in several other states, will touch the hearts of the central leadership,” he said. Reiterating his commitment to fight the draconian laws till his last breath, Amarinder also urged the President of India not to give his assent to the Bills, which, he said, were crafted to destroy not just the economy of Punjab and the food security of the nation but also the lives of lakhs of farmers and their families. “The Bills, if implemented, will have devastating effects for the border state of Punjab, as well as for the entire nation,” he warned, accusing the Centre with ignoring the farmers’ concerns to promote the interests of their capitalist cronies. The CM said his government, along with the Punjab Congress, will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers to oppose the laws, and will take whatever steps needed, including moving the courts, to scuttle the Centre’s dangerous attempt to demolish the state’s well-established farming network. Amarinder also lashed out at the Akalis for their public posturing on the laws, which even the farmers had dismissed as crocodile tears. Reacting to the attack by Sukhbir Badal and Harsimrat Badal on him (Captain Amarinder), the CM dubbed it a “blatant tactic to divert attention from their own failure to protect the farmers’ interests and their decision to stay on in the government, after actively supporting and defending the farm ordinances”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hope-visuals-of-distressed-farmers-mellow-centre-capt/story-IaYWxImj545SxeyzyfLjLJ.html

So, I boarded a bus to reach Ludhiana from where I was expecting to get on one to my hometown. But now the roads are blocked and no buses are operational. I am stuck here since morning. The bus operators are saying that private buses might start plying after 5pm, but that’s not for certain. The protesters should think of the inconvenience public has to face before blocking rail tracks and roads.”Similarly, a migrant labourer from Bihar, Sonu, was seen waiting for the bus service to resume so he could reach Moga for work.He said, “I had gone to meet my family in Bihar and was on my way back to Moga on Friday. The bus operator, however, cut the journey short and left us at the Ludhiana bus stand stating that the roads ahead were blocked. Now, I am waiting for the service to resume so I could reach my destination.”Meanwhile, the officials said the services were halted as a precautionary measure to avert any untoward incident during the farmers’ protest.On an average, around 150 buses depart from the city bus stand for inter-district journeys and towards Chandigarh.Punjab Roadways Ludhiana general manager Inderjit Singh said, “The public transport was suspended as a precaution against any undesirable situation amid the large-scale stir. Also, there was low footfall as people refrained from moving out due to the protests. The services would resume from Saturday.”Intra-city buses don’t ply eitherThe bus service presently active on two routes within the city, also remained suspended due to farmers’ protest on Friday.

He said it will also allow development of private market infrastructure in the state besides improving market access for farmers through farm-gate sales.“It will help introduce new technologies in the farm sector through private investment,” said Thakur, adding that buyers and investors who directly purchase farm produce from the farmers will not have to pay any market fee or cess, which will motivate reputed agri-businesses and companies to purchase directly from the farm fields.“The Focus will be on electronic mode of transactions, which will help meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of one nation, one market,” he said.The CM said it will usher in development of cold chain infrastructure in the state as licensing would be deregulated, which will ensure ease of doing business and increase investment in the agro processing sector.Accusing Congress leaders for misleading the people of the state, the Chief Minister said the new law will give price assurance to farmers at the time of sowing with better income options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-produce-bill-will-double-farmers-income-says-hp-cm/story-mPtQx1bLaTvqsl71goCp7I.html
25-09-2020||Lucknow||Entertainment and ‘fatafat’ money amid ‘Covid slowdown’||For businessman Rahul Agarwal (name changed), the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) has come as a big boost to his confidence and his finances, as he has been betting a handsome amount on the matches every day, and winning most of the time. After the 13th edition of the league started in the UAE last Saturday, his family has been enjoying the entertainment in the shortest format of cricket at a time when the world is going through a bad phase due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Agarwal’s bet of Rs 2,000 on the first match between the MS Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and the Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians (MI) fetched him Rs 6,000 as the odds were not high for the favourites and three-time champions CSK in the opening encounter. Agarwal has no plans to bet on all the matches, but the entire family plans to watch all the matches without any interruption. “As I have my business outlet and house together at one place, I close my shop at 7pm and by the time the match starts, I am settled on the couch to watch the proceedings till the end. In fact, IPL has given the much needed entertainment to me and my family of five, including my 70-year-old father,” said Agarwal. How things start for him on the betting front everyday is quite interesting. His favourite betting sites ‘Guru Nine’ and ‘Betway’ have unique systems of collecting and paying back the money only to ‘well-known’ clients. “I call on a certain number and put my money. The person on the other side of the phone only says yes or no and we hardly talk for 10-15 seconds. The next morning of the match, either I pay my dues or get my winning purse as per the rate by a pre-designated messenger.” Agarwal said he gets a new phone number every time he bets. “If you dial on the same number the next day, it won’t exist. Moreover, no new person is allowed to make it to the betting circle unless you are being introduced by someone known to the people running the show. One has to take your guarantee as no one believes in your paying capacity or your loyalty,” added Agarwal, who runs his big outlet in the heart of the state capital. Agarwal isn’t the only one, who is betting on IPL games. There are many across the state who are making a fast buck. In Prayagraj, one of the ‘priests’ in Gaughat area has been known for his betting operations for many years. He is happy that business this time has grown manifold. “I have been managing the show in Prayagraj for many years, but this time the number of betters is phenomenal. Its only because of corona I believe that people are fed up of this crisis situation and looking for an option of entertainment as well as some extra income as businesses are sluggish,” said one ‘Mishra Ji’. “I don’t entertain unknown people as there is always a chance of catching police’s attention. This time, I have added 50-6 new people on my list of 150-odd regulars. I get a good cut for my efforts as I own the responsibility of collecting and paying money to the betters here,” he added. “This year, the IPL is happening at such a place, which is notorious in terms of fixing and betting. We should legalise betting in India too,” said Kanpur’s Shakeel (name changed), who had been a tennis ball cricketer in the past. Meanwhile, the UP police are tracking down betting rackets. “The activities of such people are being monitored at the district level. Our special units are also vigilant in the state,” said Jyoti Narayan, inspector general (law and order), UP police. A police team recently busted a betting racket in Kanpur and arrested six people. The accused ran the betting operations through various social media applications. “Our social media team also keeps a tab on suspicious activities through online platforms. If such activities are noticed, the teams alert the other police units for required action,” said the officer. According to police sources, the more these bettors use technology in a limited group, the more difficult it gets for the police to nab them. “Social media apps and other technology have allowed bettors to run operations in a small closed group. The monetary transactions in these cases are done via digital medium with limited or absolutely no physical interaction,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/entertainment-and-fatafat-money-amid-covid-slowdown/story-Cf6ngRCXKzWBldUsjtAXqK.html

A dozen children were killed in Udhampur district of Jammu by drinking the cough syrup. According to Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, these children died due to a substance called ethylene glycol, a dye present in the cough syrup.The petitioners had challenged this year’s orders of Sirmaur chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of March 11 and May 2 in the court. In this case, the CJM allowed the drug inspector to take additional samples of the seized syrup. According to the drug inspector’s application, the government analyst found that the dye found in the drug was not sufficient for ethylene glycol testing. Therefore, the court was requested to allow taking of additional samples. The magistrate also rejected the objections of the applicants, who pleaded not to send 20 bottles of samples taken on March 11 for testing, but wanted only four bottles, taken on February 26, for testing. Although the magistrate allowed only four bottles to be opened for examination, he also made it clear that if the sample was inadequate, another 20 bottles will be tested. The applicants had challenged these orders in the high court through two separate petitions, which justice Vivek Singh Thakur has dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-dismisses-pleas-of-pharma-firm-on-cough-syrup-testing/story-FSoKjTjzPK0cN4B8Ib9MpL.html
25-09-2020||Bhopal||Shifting of deer to maintain ecological pyramid in national parks of Madhya Pradesh||The Madhya Pradesh (MP) forest department authorities have started translocation of 3,000 spotted deer from Bandhavgarh and Pench Tiger Reserves to three other national parks and a wild sanctuary in the state in a bid to ensure that there are enough prey for tigers, a forest department official said on Friday. “The decision of translocation of the spotted deer was taken in early September to cater to the tigers’ prey in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Sidhi, Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary in Damoh and Satpura Tiger Reserve in Hoshangabad. The population of tigers in these national parks and wildlife sanctuaries have risen in the past few years. But the population of their prey has not increased in equal proportion,” said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), wildlife, MP. The population of deer in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries should be 40 per square (sq) kilometre (km) and 35 or less per sq km, respectively. In the absence of adequate prey, the tigers can move out of their natural habitat and hunt domestic animals in adjoining villages, leading to human and tiger conflict. “The translocation of spotted deer is being done from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Umaria and Pench Tiger Reserve in Seoni, where there is an abundance of the animals, who are causing havoc by destroying crops. The population of spotted deer is 50,000 and 70,000 in Bandhavgarh and Pench Tiger Reserves, respectively. There are around 50 spotted deer per sq km,” Kumar added. Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary, which has at least five tigers after two big cats -- a tiger from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and a tigress from Kanha National Park – were shifted in 2018, has reported a decline in its deer population. “It is imperative to maintain the balance, as the population of tigers has increased to five. However, there is an acute shortage of prey, including deer in the sanctuary. The state forest department granted permission of translocation of 200 spotted deer on Thursday and in all, 500 spotted deer will be shifted,” said Rakhi Nanda, divisional forest officer (DFO), Damoh. The translocation of spotted deer, which started in September, will be completed by March 2021 through the Boma method, where an enclosure is placed to catch the animals and its exit open into a truck, said Nanda. “We are taking care of vegetation and environment before the translocation of the spotted deer. Altogether, 2,400 spotted deer will be shifted from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Umaria to Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Sidhi. Umaria and Sidhi have similar kinds of vegetation. As a result, the spotted deer won’t face any difficulty in their survival,” said Vincet Raheem, field director, Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. Experts said there is no threat to shifting of spotted deer by using the Boma method and the animals also have good adaptive features. “Spotted deer might have faced problems while mingling with the local population. But that’s not a big issue. Similarly, spotted deer take a very short span of time in adapting to a new environment. The chances of survival of spotted deer are 100% after the translocation,” said SK Mandal, a former PCCF, wildlife, MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/shifting-of-deer-to-maintain-ecological-pyramid-in-national-parks-of-madhya-pradesh/story-oWY3x3Z3PYrTTKNlKwBl8O.html

The letter adds that due to the sale of fruit in such shipments, there was potential threat of losses to fruit crop growers in the state. Apples are grown in Shimla, Kullu, Mandi and Kinnaur districts and contribute around Rs 4,500 crore to the economy. This year, growers have already suffered due to the lockdown, heavy rain and hailstorm and absence of labour force during the plucking season.Imported apple from Iran and Turkey is the latest worry for growers as the price of their produce has witnessed a dip. Apple imports from these two countries started in August and will continue till October, giving tough competition to Himachal apples.President, Progressive Growers Association, Lokinder Singh Bisht, claimed that in some apple shipments from Iran there was live presence of Cydia pomonella (codling moth), Aspidiotus nerii (acuba scale ) in kiwis and bacterial infection Pseudomonas viridiflava (bacterial leaf blight of tomato) and imports of such infected crop could potentially lead to losses. He added good quality apple produced in Himachal was not getting a fair rate in the market, impacting returns. The imported apple is available between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per kg, while Himachal apple is being sold between Rs 120 and 150 per kg.According to the data with Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), apple import from Iran increased to 21,521 tonne in 2019-20, as compared to 7,020 tonne in 2017-18; while apple imports from Turkey increased to 32,289 tonne in 2019-20 tonne, compared to 7,500 tonne in 2017-18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/check-all-imported-apple-for-quality-orchardists/story-1Un3zRXIilmv7vw8owjrKL.html

With rainfall in ample quantity, most big and medium dams in Maharashtra are also full and the agriculture department also expects bumper crop this year. As of Thursday, cumulative water stock in all the dams in Maharashtra stood at 83.17%. During the same day last year, the dam stock was 72.46%. However, in parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, heavy rainfall in the past one week, has also damaged the crops. According to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) seasonal map for Maharashtra, only two districts from Vidarbha have received deficient rainfall (lesser than 20% to 59% of normal). The two districts are Akola and Yavatmal where rainfall deficiency has been 26 and 23 per cent respectively. The 16 districts which have received normal rainfall are from Vidarbha and parts of Konkan.

25-09-2020||City||Assam sets up commission to redraw BTAD boundary as per Bodo accord||Eight months after the signing of the Bodo peace accord, Assam government on Friday announced the setting up of a commission to redraw the boundary of Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD) as mentioned in the deal. The peace accord signed in January by National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) and United Bodo Peoples’ Organisation (UBPO) with the Centre and Assam government had included the redrawing of BTAD—which comprises Baksa, Kokrajhar, Udalguri and Chirang districts—as one of the main clauses. “The government will set up a four-member commission headed by former chief secretary PP Verma. It would have a tenure of six months from the day of its formation,” health, finance, PWD and education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists. The present administrator of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) Rajesh Prasad, Jayanta Basumatary of ABSU and Dalim Bayan, a non-Bodo representative, are the other members of the commission. Also Read: Politics picks up pace in Assam ahead of next year’s assembly pollsAs per the accord, villages contiguous to BTAD with a Bodo population of more than 50% can apply to be included within its boundary and villages within BTAD which are contiguous to its boundary and have a non-Bodo population of over 50% can apply to be excluded from its area. “As provided in the accord, the commission will advise the state government on increasing the number of seats in BTC from 40 to 60 as well as delimiting constituencies,” Sarma said. The minister said that Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi has already approved the renaming of BTAD as Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), as specified in the accord. “Once these clauses are implemented, the state government will initiate the inclusion of Bodo as an associate official language in Assam as well as set up a Bodo-Kachari Welfare Council for Bodos living outside BTAD,” said Sarma. The new initiatives announced on Friday follow a meeting between Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on September 20 regarding the implementation of the accord. Elections to BTC, which was ruled by Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), a partner in the BJP-led ruling coalition in the state, was scheduled in April this year, but the entire BTAD was placed under governor’s rule the same month as polls couldn’t be held due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown. “The health department is of the view that elections for BTC can’t be held till November-end. The chief minister will hold an all-party meeting regarding the polls soon and a decision on holding the election in December may be taken. We are also watching how assembly polls in Bihar are conducted,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-sets-up-commission-to-redraw-btad-boundary-as-per-bodo-accord/story-IUFWbplwwEnuuQfPpvPAkM.html
25-09-2020||Pune||No entry for Covid: How housing societies in Pune, against all odds, kept the virus out||The city’s Covid-19 case count 1,47,634, as of Thursday, leaves little doubt that few areas and even fewer multi-apartment housing societies can claim to be unaffected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the infection. As the virus has claimed 5,478 lives since the first recorded case in Pune in March, housing societies have worked hard to build a common, societal response to ensure virus-protective norms issued by the authorities have been met. Aapla Ghar society in Kirkatwadi and Konark nagar in Vimannagar and Astonia Society in Balewadi are three such housing complexes that for all the Covid data indicators, have kept the virus out… so far. No residential member of these three housing societies have contracted the virus yet. HT meets the “groundsmen”, the “captains” and the “fielders” of these residential complexes to understand how Covid-19 was kept out. Aapla Ghar society, Kirkatwadi, 88 apartments, 125 residents“Ever since the lockdown, we stopped entry of persons from outside. For daily needs and eatables we called vendors to the gate and everything was distributed at the gate. From eggs and chicken to groceries, everything was distributed at the gate,” said Yogita Bagnikar, ex-chairperson, who took on a lead role during the last six months. Bagnikar made sure that even orders from D-mart were made in bulk, at one time, the distribution of which was controlled by the society. “Avoiding contact with outsiders and strict protocols of not leaving the home without gloves and masks made things easy to manage,” added Bagnikar. Ninety per cent of houses have stopped maids coming in to work for the last six months. “Only in exceptional cases, where there are toddlers or only senior citizens, maids are allowed. We will allow maids once the situation becomes normal. Most have still continued ‘half payment’ to maids as financial support,” explained Bagnikar, who also is the administrator of the Aapla Ghar WhatsApp group where all information is relayed to residents. Thermal scanning at the gates and sanitisation points within the society are the other de riguer measures in place. “Residents who leave the society premises sanitise themselves completely before coming back into the building premises,” Bagnikar claims. “It is the support of people from within the society which has made things possible for us. We ensure that no one breaks the protocol,” said Poonam Savarkar, a resident. “We had vendors for all essential services like milk, fruits, vegetable. The biggest challenge was in initial days to get people used to the new norms. The committee did a fantastic job in our building, said Shabana Shaikh, a resident. The Shaikh family has five members living in the society.Konark Nagar, Vimannagar, 131 row houses; 23 buildings, 518 apartments For Konark Nagar in Viman nagar, early precautionary measures played a trump card as the society has 518 families and a population of 1,500. “We were monitoring the rise in the number of Covid in other countries. Our management was alert and started a discussion regarding precautionary measures early on. We cancelled all Holi celebrations and stopped outsiders from entering the society,” explains Sandeep Singh, chairman of Konark Nagar, who has a PhD in Agriculture. “My agriculture background helped me and we started quickly spraying a disinfectant – sodium hypochlorite and viroxide - in the society, every day, thrice,” says Singh. Special care was given to senior citizens, who make up 30 per cent of the complex’s residents. “Strict controls on the movement of senior citizens was kept and door delivery services were provided to them,” adds Singh. “I kept myself busy with gardening. Being a senior citizen, we were treated very well by society members,” said Lakshmi Narain Batra, 81, former assistant works manager, Ammunition Factory Khadki.The society allowed watchmen to stay on premises. For the first two months – April and May – maids were not allowed to go home and lived on the society premises. “We then increased the salaries of maids and it has ensured that they will only work at our society and go home. They agreed as they also wanted to secure themselves against the virus,” says Singh. Astonia Society, Balewadi, 96 apartments “We have created our own bubble” is how Vaishali Kambli, a resident who shifted to Astonia Society, two months before the virus broke out, explains it in one sentence. “Only going out, if it is very urgent is the protocol followed by all. And since we are a little far out from the city, we have managed to keep social distancing norms with ease,” adds Kambli. Currently, at Astonia, if any renovation, or moving of residence has to be done, no more than four persons are allowed to work together at a time. “Even after work is completed, the person who hired the workers has to sanitise all areas where the work, and the workers, operated,” added Kambli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-entry-for-covid-how-housing-societies-in-pune-against-all-odds-kept-the-virus-out/story-SFt8dyG9lDLWTxu5HUHmxH.html

The Customs officers, however, acted arbitrarily on September 14, and refused to process Let Export Orders (LEOs) even before the notification was issued, said the petition.The counsel for the petitioner association, senior advocate Darius Shroff, pointed out that the notification came in the evening, at about 6 pm on September 14, but the Customs officers refused to process LEOs from the morning of September 14, even when the consignments were brought to the parking plaza outside the Customs area.Senior advocate Pradeep Jaitley, who represented the Customs, however, claimed that most of the consignments for which export bills were submitted have been cleared by the authorities and allowed to be exported. He added that if any consignments are still remaining, the authorities would certainly consider the same.The bench appreciated the efforts made by Customs to mitigate hardship faced by onion exporters because of the abrupt ban, but added the case of the members of the petitioner association were also required to be considered.The bench directed the authorities to consider the case of the petitioners at the earliest, as the goods are perishable, and posted the petition for further hearing on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consider-allowing-export-of-pending-onion-consignments-bombay-hc-tells-customs/story-yji8mBgJGZ6GEMYMicUOOM.html

25-09-2020||City||Assam launches 4 schemes to boost Covid-hit tea industry||The Assam government on Friday announced four new schemes to boost the state’s tea industry, which has taken a severe hit because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions. Around 800 tea gardens in Assam had remained closed for around two months due to the lockdown, which were enforced from end-March because of the viral outbreak.Also read: Assam announces infrastructure projects worth nearly Rs 12,000 croreTea production until August is estimated to have dropped by around 25%, as compared to the corresponding period last year. Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who announced the schemes, hoped that the initiatives would help the tea industry in the state to recover. The new schemes will cost the state exchequer around Rs 200 crore. “If any tea garden has taken a working capital loan from a commercial bank, the Assam government will pay 3% of the interest on the borrowed sum. The maximum cap on the subsidy will be Rs 20 lakh for each tea garden per year,” Sarma said. The state government will pay a tea garden a subsidy of Rs 7 per kilogram (kg) to grow orthodox tea in a bid to promote production and export of this variant of the hot beverage. This incentive will be over and above the Rs 3 per kg of tea to be paid by the Tea Board of India (TBI). “The state government will also provide a 25% subsidy to procure plants and machineries to grow orthodox tea,” Sarma said. The state government has also announced an agriculture income tax holiday to tea gardens for three years. “We hope tea gardens will give a 20% bonus for the upcoming Durga Puja to all their workers following the state government’s announcements of the new schemes. Employees of gardens under the Assam Tea Corporation, a state government undertaking, have been assured of a 20% bonus,” Sarma said. TBI data showed that Assam produced 223 million (m) kg of tea between January and July this year, as compared to 274 m kg of the hot beverage during the same period last year. In 2019, Assam had produced 716 m kg of tea.

Police personnel were deployed at key points in town to ensure law and order. Transport services were hit and government departments besides banks and private companies reported low attendance as most residents chose to stay home.

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Saamana hits out at ‘attempt’ to ‘discredit film industry’||Saamana, the mouthpiece of Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena, on Friday hit out at a “systematic attempt” to “discredit the film industry” to ensure that prominent film personalities living in Mumbai leave. In an editorial, Saamana said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several states have used the same film personalities when it suited their needs. It added a “picture” was being painted to show all major film stars are drug addicts and grow ganja in their homes.“Is such an environment being created so that the cinema industry and the personalities working in it leave Mumbai? This speculation is gaining ground. In a systematic fashion, a picture is being painted that the actors, directors, cinematographers, etc have left acting and become drug addicts and leaving art, they have started farming ganja and afeem in the galleries, and balconies of their homes,” the editorial said.Also read: Glided like snakes, now silent, says Sena, slams BJP’s silence on Kangana’s ‘terrorist’ remarkThe editorial comes as the Narcotics Control Bureau has summoned prominent actors in connection with its probe into the case related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.It said the “mudslinging” is going on to discredit the industry. “Prime Minister Modi and several states have used the artists of this film industry for [enhancing] their political status. In Gujarat, Modi and Salman Khan were flying kites. Amitabh Bachchan was the brand ambassador of Gujarat. Modi had given the responsibility of teaching people how to eat mangoes to Akshay Kumar. Vivek Oberoi has made earnings from the film made on Modi, and Anupam Kher on the film made on Manmohan Singh.”The mouthpiece said attempts were being made to “finish off” the Mumbai industry as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced a film city in his state. It added that the idea of starting a film city is good but running it is hard as several studios in Mumbai are facing tough times.The editorial said Mumbai as a film city will always stay relevant.

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Commuters bear brunt of farmers’ bandh in Punjab||The bandh called by farmers in Punjab on Friday left scores of commuters stranded at various places in the state, including the busy Ladhowal Toll Plaza on the Ludhiana-Delhi National Highway 44. Passengers were left with no choice as they waited at Jalandhar Bypass for the agitation to end at 4pm. “I had no clue that buses won’t be operating. I was returning to Hoshiarpur from Ludhiana,” Kamla, 85, said. Pargat Singh, 48, a mason from Beas said, “I was in Ludhiana for work and was returning to Beas. Now we have no choice but to wait for the bus service to resume.” Shahnawaz Khan, 40, said he was on his way to Gurdaspur. “I checked out of a hotel in Ludhiana a short while ago to catch a bus but now I don’t know where to go.” Some autorickshaw and private taxi operators made most of the situation. While taxis charge between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per passenger to Jalandhar, a commuter, Vishal Kumar, said they were demanding Rs 3,500 for a trip to Jalandhar during the bandh. Sharanjit Singh Kalsi, the vice-president of Azad Taxi Union, however, said the taxi operators’ union has joined the protest at Ladhowal. “We are not operating our vehicles today in support of the farmers. If farmers suffer how will our business survive?” he said. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, the vice-president of a Bharti Kisan Union faction, said “Prior information was given about the protest.

25-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi cluster bus mishap: Another person succumbs to injuries; toll rises to 3||One more person succumbed to his injuries on Friday morning following the previous night’s accident on a busy road in north-east Delhi’s Nand Nagri, where a speeding cluster bus allegedly ran over around seven people and killed two of them on the spot.The accident, which had occurred at 10 pm on Thursday, had triggered a violent protest in the area. The errant driver, Pushpender Singh, who had fled the accident spot in a bid to escape an irate mob, was arrested from north-east Delhi in the early hours on Friday, Delhi Police said. The mob had vandalised the cluster bus that ran on route number 261 -- between Sarai Kale Khan and Nand Nagri. The agitators shouted slogans against Delhi Police and chased away a police van for arriving late at the accident spot. “The third accident victim was identified as Amar Singh (40), who worked as a labourer and lived at Harsh Vihar in north-east Delhi. We have arrested the bus driver and booked him for rash and negligent driving causing death and injuries. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (causing death by negligence), and 337 (rash or negligent act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at Nand Nagri police station,” said Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (north-east), Delhi Police.DCP Surya said that the arrested driver has claimed that the accident occurred because the brakes of the bus failed while it was coming down from the ITI flyover. The bus had 15 passengers on board when the accident occurred.The driver told the police that after the brakes failed, initially, he had tried to stop the vehicle by hitting a concrete road divider. Later, he rammed into a mini truck, but still failed to stop the moving bus. He lost control of the vehicle and it crashed into an egg vendor’s cart and ran over some pedestrians, the DCP said, quoting the driver.“We are trying to ascertain the driver’s claims about the sequence of the events that led to the accident. A mechanical inspection will also be done by experts to verify whether the brakes of the bus indeed failed,” added the DCP. Eye-witnesses told the police that after hitting the truck, the bus rammed into a vegetable cart and hit a few more vehicles before coming to a grinding halt.Up to seven people were injured in the accident, among whom a youth and a boy, died on the spot. The accident victims were identified as Ravinder (22) and Karan (12). Three injured persons, including a woman and a boy (16), are still undergoing treatment at a hospital in north-east Delhi, the police said.Over 100 people had gathered at the accident spot and vandalised the cluster bus by pelting stones at it. There was swirling rumour that the accident had claimed five lives. The mob also vented their anger at a police patrolling van that had arrived at the accident spot after receiving an emergency call. The agitated people blocked the main road where the accident took place, staged a protest and shouted slogans against Delhi Police. They also stopped an ambulance from taking an injured person to a hospital. A video made by one of the onlookers showed some angry people were pulling out a stretcher, where an injured and unconscious boy was lying down, from the ambulance. Some people can be heard in the video shouting slogans against Delhi Police and talking about blocking the road. DCP Surya said that around 60 police personnel from three police stations and the reserve battalion were rushed to the accident spot to bring the situation under control and avoid further violence. “The agitators dispersed when they were assured of swift police action. A few minutes later, some women also tried to stage a protest and block the road. But we intervened and cleared the spot for vehicular traffic. The situation came under control within half an hour and no untoward incident has been reported since then,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cluster-bus-mishap-another-person-succumbs-to-injuries-toll-rises-to-3/story-WnbWdiv3VOea348ehMqftI.html
25-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM says farm bills for ‘one nation one market’, Opposition protests||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday said the three farm bills, passed by the Parliament during the Monsoon session, will strengthen the concept of ‘one nation one market’ and directly connect farmers with the market, eliminating the role of middlemen. Rawat added that these bills will bring revolutionary changes in the lives of the farmers. “Modi government has tried to aid farmers in two ways; if they want to sell their produce in (farmer markets) mandis, they will get a high MSP and if he wants to sell it outside the mandis, he can sell it anywhere at a good price and the government will provide him technical assistance in the process,” Rawat said, adding, “There will be no role of middlemen now.”Rawat said the Narendra Modi government is pro-farmers and the people of the country know it well. “Some people are however, trying to mislead farmers and provoke them. Farmers will have to themselves understand these agrarian reforms. They very well know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi always thinks about their welfare,” he said. Listing the steps taken by the central government for farmers, Rawat said MSP of various crops has been increased and recommendations of the Swaminathan report have been implemented by the government for the benefit of farmers Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state unit have announced a series of protests against these bills Terming the bills as ‘anti-farmer’, Congress state unit president Pritam Singh, in a press conference here on Thursday, announced the calendar of protests in the state till October 31. “We will start an online campaign Speak Up on September 26. Then on September 28, we have decided to take out a protest march from the party office in Dehradun to the governor’s house. On October 2, we will organise state-wide protests at district and assembly segment level. Between October 2 and October 31, we will start a signature campaign against these bills which will be then presented to the AICC (All India Congress Committee),” he said The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, were passed by both the Houses of Parliament during the monsoon session recently and await Presidential assent.

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Congress-ruled Punjab at standstill till 4pm in support of farmers’ bandh call||Congress-ruled Punjab is observing a total bandh till 4pm on Friday in response to the call given by farmer organisations against the three bills passed by the BJP-led NDA government last week. The Shiromani Akali Dal, which is still an NDA ally but draws its strength from its farmer constituency, and the Aam Aadmi Party are also backing the farmers. Farmers and farm labourers, supported by the Left, blocked state and national highways since early on Friday morning, disrupting the supply of milk and essential commodities in several areas. No vehicle was allowed to ply on the main artery of the state, the national highway from Shambu barrier in Patiala district that cuts across Punjab. “It’s a total shutdown and the response is overwhelming. Even people who have no concern with agriculture are out in our support. I think they have realised the bills are suicidal for the agrarian community,” said BS Rajewal, who heads a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union. PEACEFUL PROTEST ACROSS STATE The bandh has been peaceful with all parties barring the BJP backing the farmers. Reports of a total shutdown were received from Bathinda, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Gurdaspur districts with people belonging to different social and religious organisations, including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, expressing solidarity with the farmers. The railways cancelled all passenger and freight trains in the state as farmers have blocked key rail routes. PUNJAB GOVT URGED NOT TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee has given the bandh call, supported by 31 farm organisations, including factions of the BKU. The committee wants the Centre to revoke the bills and has urged Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to pass a resolution in the state assembly that the central bills will not be implemented in the state once they become a law after Presidential assent. The committee said farmers apprehend the move will bring to an end to the system of open-ended assured procurement and minimum support price (MSP) and the entire agricultural operations will go into the hands of corporate houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-ruled-punjab-at-standstill-till-4pm-in-support-of-farmers-bandh-call/story-TTpcHF01zat1PAUi4JrClI.html

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Farm bills: Maharashtra farmers participate in nationwide protests||Farmers in Maharashtra participated in nationwide protest against the farm bills passed in Parliament early this week. Farmers burnt copies of the bills and demanded them to be withdrawn at the earliest. The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party have extended their support to the protest, which will be spread headed by farmers’ organisations, including Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS) and Lok Sangharsh Morcha among others in Maharashtra. Members of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, led by former MP Raju Shetti, burnt copies of the bills in Kolhapur and have announced they will intensify the protest if the bills are not withdrawn by the Central government.“Shetkari Sanghatana has always been against the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), and our leader late Sharad Joshi used to call these committees ‘abattoirs’ of the farmers. However, we do not endorse the way the existing system is being thrashed out by the Central government. This is an attempt to make farmers slaves in the hands of industrialists,” Shetti said. Also Read: Farm protests may hit transport of essentials: RailwaysHe said that this was the first step towards the privatisation of Food Corporation of India and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), who purchase about 30% of farm produce in the country.Shetti has announced that the protests will be intensified against corporate companies that are expected to benefit from the bills.ABKS will begin the protest at 1pm Friday. “At least four or five organisations that have supported the nationwide protest are participating in them in 21 districts in Maharashtra. We will burn copies of the bills and hand over our memorandums to the district collectors in peaceful manner, ” said Ajit Nawale, general secretary, ABKS. Also Read: Cong terms farm bills ‘unconstitutional’Nawale said that though APMCs have become dens of corruption and monopoly, the bills passed by the Centre are more dangerous for the farmers. “At least the farmers have some mechanism in place to market their produce at a reasonable price in the form of APMCs today. The bills passed in Parliament are the first step towards handing over farm marketing to a few industrial houses who will decide the prices of the produce. Though the Centre has been claiming these bills are a way to be free from the clutches of APMC, the government has freed itself from the responsibilities of fair and remunerative prices to the farmers. In Maharashtra, the Fadnavis government had brought bills to regularise APMCs, but it could not set up an alternative mechanism to the APMCs to give farmers remunerative prices for their produce. It was a failed attempt,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farm-bills-maharashtra-farmers-participate-in-nationwide-protests/story-kWXkYpqFXPJAFHrRH8CTRJ.html
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||All employees must have email id: Himachal high court to chief secretary||The Himachal Pradesh high court has asked the state chief secretary to ensure all government employees have an email id. A division bench, comprising justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua, issued this order on Thursday while hearing a writ petition filed by a junior engineer challenging his transfer. The court asked the state chief secretary to issue instructions to all government employees, including staff of various boards, at least to the level of Class-III, to mandatorily create email IDs. The officer was transferred from the community development (CD) block in Kullu to Anni on the basis of a department order to accommodate the respondent. The court, in its earlier order, directed to issue a notice to the respondent junior engineer via email. The state project director was asked to provide the email id. However, the respondent junior engineer was not served the notice. While hearing the petition, the court observed that during the Covid pandemic, it has been hearing petitions mainly relating to service matters, but during proceedings, it is found that despite advancement of technology, many officials don’t even have email IDs, making it inconvenient to issue notice when they are party to litigation. The court posted the matter for hearing on October 1. BANS POWER BOARD STAFF’S STRIKE The court also banned a protest by employees of the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Ltd. The division bench of justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Jyotsna Rewal Dua said that the employees can’t hold protests or strike work to press for their demands as the law doesn’t permit this. If the employees are unhappy with decisions of the board of directors, they can move court or the electricity regulatory commission. The court said that it can’t allow anyone to take law in their hands. If the employees fail to comply with the order, they may have to face departmental and criminal proceedings. The court will hear the matter on October 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-employees-must-have-email-id-himachal-high-court-to-chief-secretary/story-ThEizmlYS7aaSV4AAaYFxH.html
25-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC sets three sex workers free, says women have right to choose vocation||Observing that prostitution is no offence under the law; an adult woman has the right to choose her vocation and cannot be detained without her consent, the Bombay high court on Thursday set free three sex workers detained at a women’s hostel.Justice Prithviraj Chavan said the purpose and the object of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (PITA), 1956 is not to abolish prostitution. “There is no provision under the law which makes prostitution per se a criminal offence or punishes a person because he indulges in prostitution,” said the judge.Clarifying that what is punishable under the law is exploitation or abuse of a person for commercial purposes and soliciting in public places, the court set free the three young women, aged 20, 22 and 23, respectively.The women were “rescued” by the social service branch of the Mumbai police from Chincholi Binder area in Malad, in September 2019, after laying a trap using a decoy customer. They were produced before a metropolitan magistrate, who remanded them to a women’s hostel and called for a report from a probation officer.On October 19, 2019, the magistrate refused to hand over the custody of the women to their respective mothers as the magistrate found that it was not in the interest of the women to stay with their parents. The magistrate, instead, directed that the women be kept at a women’s hostel in Uttar Pradesh.That was because the probation officers’ report revealed that the women were from a particular community from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and there was a long tradition of prostitution in the community.The women had moved the court through advocate Ashok Saraogi after the magistrate’s order was upheld by Dindoshi sessions court on November 22, 2019.The high court on Thursday struck down both the orders. “It is important to note that the petitioners / victims are major and, therefore, have a right to reside at the place of their choice, to move freely throughout the territory of India and to choose their own vocation, as enshrined the Constitution of India,” said the judge.The court said the magistrate ought to have considered the willingness and consent of the women before ordering their detention. It added that the magistrate appeared to be swayed by the fact that the petitioners belong to a particular caste and it had long history of initiating girls of the community into prostitution.The single judge bench added that keeping in mind the interest of the women, the state government can, under PITA, seek directions from the court to send them to corrective homes. institution, but their fundamental rights stand on a higher pedestal vis a vis the statutory right or any other right conferred by a general law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sets-three-sex-workers-free-says-women-have-right-to-chose-vocation/story-8inKJ8LrFohrkq4Dl45rwO.html

She further said that farmers were happy as no additional fees was charged at the mandi for selling their produce and the mandi would also help them by providing seeds and fertilizers at subsidized rates in future.A Delhi-based rice export company has established the future agromart pvt ltd and has plans to establish similar mandis in Aligarh, Hapur and Bareilly in coming years to procure paddy and other produce from farmers of western UP.The company’s director Ajay Bhalotia said that over a dozen farmers sold their produce on the opening day of the Agromart. He claimed to have procured paddy at the market rate and said that they would ensure best possible facilities and assistance to farmers in future.Latest Updates: Farmers’ Protest LIVE NewsBhalotia admitted that a group of people tried to disrupt the function but the situation was controlled.Farmer Jagdish of Shyampur village arrived at the mandi with 40 quintal basmati which he sold at Rs 1950 per quintal. “I am happy, I got a good price of my produce”, said Jagdish. Responding to ongoing protests by farmers against the farm reform bills that have enabled selling of agriculture produce directly to private firms, he said, “ Kisano ki to durdasha ho hi rahi hai” (The condition of farmers is miserable).Also Read: Bharat bandh call over farm reform bills: UP police put on alertBharatiya kisan union’s (BKU) state spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said that the union government was more interested in shielding the interest of corporates instead of farmers and the former were ready to use all resources to exploit the agriculture sector with the help of the government.He said that the government’s tall claims that the farm bills were for the benefit for farmers were an eyewash and farmers had decided to fight a decisive battle.Madhur Chauhan, president of Arania block gram pradhan sangthan, who also attended the inauguration, said that opening of private mandis would create a competitive atmosphere but the government should also protect the interest of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-first-private-farm-mandi-opens-in-bulandshahr-amid-protests/story-l2KyZlkCa7V1uF31TF5FON.html

Nitrogen blanketing -- a method of applying nitrogen gas to the vapour space or top layer of a container carrying chemicals to control its composition and reduce oxygen access to curb emission -- bottom filling of trucks to ensure liquid does not spill out, constructing a parking area to avoid congestion of vehicles, developing a green belt, and granting permission to park vehicles on the Eastern Freeway during non-peak hours for smoother vehicular movement and curbing spillage were some of the measures that the action plan had proposed.Also Read: Farm fires growing in Punjab, plumes of smoke seen over Delhi in satellite imagesOn Thursday, the state environment department met four agencies -- the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) authorities -- to review the pollution control targets.“As per the updates received, nitrogen blanketing has been completed by three of the four firms,” said Thackeray.“Most companies have adhered to bottom filling of trucks, except for a few truck companies. I have asked the MPCB authorities to review it within a month. A parking area will be provided by MMRDA and the process is near completion. The BMC will undertake a green belt development programme in this zone, and traffic permissions have been granted to reduce congestion of vehicular traffic,” he added.The minister added that 90% of the pollution norms were being followed, and compliance for the rest is expected soon. “However, we need to understand why the area is unfit for human habitation,” said Thackeray.In February, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) had transferred 300 of its available flats at Gorai to rehabilitate residents from Mahul following an order from the state government. “So far, 202 flats have been handed over to residents from Mahul, who have shifted to Gorai,” said Bilal Khan, a social activist.In August, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had termed the Mahul-Chembur area as Mumbai’s “gas chamber” while directing the four industrial firms to pay Rs 286.2 crore as environmental compensation due to air pollution damages. However, the companies have challenged the order and moved the Supreme Court (SC).As per NGT’s order, a 10-member joint committee was constituted in September to prepare a separate action plan for pollution reduction over the next five years and address the health hazards of the residents of Mahulgaon, Ambapada and its surrounding areas due to severe air pollution, MPCB authorities said.The committee members met for the first time on Wednesday. “The basic framework for the action plan and how it needs to be implemented was discussed during the meeting and the final plan will be drafted soon,” said PK Mirashe, assistant secretary (technical), MPCB.The committee is headed by Justice VM Kanade, a former judge of the Bombay high court (HC). The other members of the panel comprise two officials from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a representative from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), an MPCB member as the nodal agency, Maharashtra health secretary, Mumbai district collector, and representatives from the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay and King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Parel.Residents of Ambapada and Mahul Koliwada have complained to the NGT about a foul stench emanating in the area around midnight daily and the source of the noxious substance is reportedly originating at an industrial area, which is located 10 minutes away from these villages.“The stench comes from the SeaLord industrial area. We have filed several complaints with the MPCB and CPCB authorities, but they have only responded through emails. They are yet to make a site visit,” said Devram Mahulkar, one of the applicants before the NGT.“We have also requested Thackeray to meet the residents of Mahul and take cognisance of the grievances that we have been raising in court,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/mahul-firms-catching-up-with-state-s-pollution-abatement-plan-environment-minister/story-UsCUhfRnAYUxlxbvmh6NgP.html

The suspended policemen, along with other personnel, had seized nearly 160 kilograms of marijuana from a room in Jahangirpuri B-block on September 11. Anil, the alleged drug peddler (identified by his first name), had stored the narcotic substance in the room after procuring it from Odisha, a police officer said, requesting anonymity. “The seized marijuana was brought to the local police post (chowki). The policemen in question allegedly took Rs1.5 lakh in bribe from Anil’s family to “settle the matter”. “Instead of documenting of the entire recovery, the policemen noted they had seized only 920 grams of the contraband and he was let off from the chowki itself,” the officer said.

25-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Simply sooji, and yet||The most simple things can be the toughest, especially in cooking. Everybody can boil an egg, but not everybody can boil it perfectly. Take sooji halwa. So easy to make, apparently, and so many do it reasonably decent. This makes it tough for a sooji halwa to stand out from the crowd.In Santosh Rani’s hands, the delicacy becomes truly sublime—a truth acknowledged way beyond her 30th floor apartment in Gurugram.“My secret is I add a little besan to the sooji,” Ms Rani disarmingly reveals this afternoon, on WhatsApp video. The lady’s deep-throated voice is like comfort food—so affectionate and protective that you’re tempted to give her a hug. Indeed, she is like one of those cordial Jane Austen characters who spark a nice feel every time they turn up on the page, even when just passing through. Right now she is distressed she can’t offer her halwa through phone screen.Living with husband, son and his family, Ms Rani says she learnt her basic skills in cooking from Swarajvati. “She was my Chaiji.... in my town we address mummy as Chaiji.”In her early 70s, she has mostly lived in the Delhi region, but spent the first 18 years before her marriage in Amritsar, Punjab. “Our house was near Dal Mandi, close to Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple).” She often visited the iconic temple and recalls eagerly receiving the sacred halwa prasad. “It was always delicious and used to be of atta, not sooji.”Ms Rani now prepares her edition of the sooji halwa. She makes it whenever “dil kehta hain (heart says)”, including on religious occasions and birthdays. Most recently she cooked it during the Lakshmi Pooja in Shradh, the traditional month to offer homage to one’s ancestors. She is partial to desi ghee, “which is good for overall health if taken moderately.” And good for skin too, she asserts—her husband rubs it on his hands every morning after his pooja.But is Ms Rani’s sooji halwa as tasty as her late Chaiji’s? The lady burst into giggles, saying tactfully, “No comments!”Here’s the recipe. Ingredients 1 cup sooji 2-3 tbsp besan 1 cup sugar3 cups water 1 pinch saffron3 whole elaichi Handful of almonds & cashews 1 cup ghee MethodPut water, saffron, elaichi and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. While that boils, heat ghee in a kadahi and roast the sooji and besan on medium heat until it turns fragrant and golden. Lower the flame and add boiled sugar water, while stirring continuously (it bubbles up at this point so be careful). Keep stirring until it thickens and the fat separates. Transfer to a bowl, garnish with nuts, and serve hot||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-simply-sooji-and-yet/story-08Q6Aiby4isuh1RNvKs21O.html
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Late night drink-drive checks to restart in Chandigarh||The traffic police plan to restart its late night drink-drive checks and penalise offenders for the first time since March 10 after breathalyser use was suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak to prevent its transmission, officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP-traffic) Manoj Kumar Meena has confirmed.However, even though nakas will be set up in a few days, breathalysers to test drivers’ blood-alcohol levels will not be used.“Ever since traffic has normalised and bars have opened in the city, we had been studying how traffic police in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi are working to restart nakas and challans for drunken driving. A meeting was held with all traffic deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) and other stakeholders on Thursday in which the decision to start late night nakas has been taken,” Meena said.Double zigzag nakas to be set upWith breathalysers still not being used, the police plan to set up double zigzag nakas with barriers instead of the easily negotiable ‘S’ shaped checkpoint to easily detect those driving under the influence. “They will have trouble negotiating the turns, and we will be closely monitoring driver behaviour. Anyone who behaves suspiciously will be stopped and if the cops suspect the driver of being drunk he or she can be taken for a medical test to measure their blood alcohol percentage,” said Meena.The new checking system with double barriers will also prevent instances of drivers ramming their cars into nakas and escaping or injuring policemen in the process,” he added. Effectiveness remains to be seenSuch nakas are needed urgently, said Kamal Soi, a member of National Road Safety Council, adding that their effectiveness had to be ascertained. “Rather than allowing an intoxicated person to get inside the car, a vigil can be maintained outside markets with a lot of bars. Anyone who seems to be intoxicated can be stopped before he can drive the car and endanger himself or others,” Soi suggested.Harman Sidhu, member, UT Road Safety Council, advised: “Anyone who the traffic police suspects of being drunk should be made to walk in a straight line as is done in some Western countries. This is also an effective way of determining whether someone is drunk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/late-night-drink-drive-checks-to-restart-in-chandigarh/story-5u5afzFJAees6TLWJ3hASN.html
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab braces for bandh against Centre’s three agriculture bills today||Nearly all farmer unions in Punjab have joined hands to observe a statewide bandh on Friday (September 25) with various social and religious organisations coming out in their supportagainst the Central government’s contentious agriculture bills that were passed in both Houses of Parliament. At least 31 farmer bodies, including various factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), sangharsh committees and mazdoor sabhas, have divided the state into different zones where the activists will stage the day-long dharnas. On Thursday, hectic parleys were going on to finalise the modalities of the sit-ins. Jagmohan Singh Patiala, an office-bearer of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee which is leading the protests, said they are opposing the draconian legislations which the NDA government has decided to impose on the country’s farmers. NEVER RECEIVED SUCH RESPONSE, SAYS BKUBS Rajewal, who heads a faction of the BKU, said, “We have never received such an overwhelming response to the protests in the past. Scores of social and religious bodies have come in support for the farmers’ cause. Even the political parties, except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have extended to us their support.” “Today, activists of farm bodies took out motorcycle rallies in different parts of the state requesting the traders and shopkeepers to keep the markets shut on Friday,” he added. The farmer unions are pressing for repealing the bills besides asking the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab to bring in a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha not to implement the legislations, which they say, will bring to an end the system of open-ended assured procurement and minimum support price (MSP) while the entire agricultural operations will go into the hands of the corporate houses. SAD GEARS UP FOR A PARALLEL SHOWThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), an alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which runs government at the Centre, has also decided to organise parallel protests (‘chakka jam’) after Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned as the Union food processing industries minister. Many farmer organisations feel that the SAD planned a parallel protest to torpedo their stir for which preparations were already going on. SAD spokesperson Dalit Cheema said their party cadre will hit the roads in full strength. The party has asked its MLAs, halqa incahrges, and district chiefs to mobilise their workers. CONG ASKS MLAs, CADRE TO SHOW SOLIDARITYPunjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar has asked the party MLAs and other leaders in all the districts to show solidarity with the protesting farm bodies and provide them all support besides offering langar. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too has decided to support the farmers’ protest. “Our activists will sit with the farmers during the protests. We are in discussions as to how the senior leadership of our party will move out,” said Harpal Singh Cheema, leader of opposition in Punjab assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-braces-for-bandh-against-centre-s-agriculture-bill-today/story-KPs4Pji8RZGOqk4TJGzcUM.html

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Survey monkey population, sterilise them, high court tells Chandigarh admn||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Chandigarh administration to carry out a survey to find out the exact population of monkeys in the city and sterilise them if the numbers were alarmingly high.The high court bench of justice Arun Monga was hearing a petition from one Divyam Dhakla, who had approached the court in 2018 seeking directions to UT to deal with the monkey menace in city’s residential areas, especially in Manimajra. The petitioner had said that residents were forced to keep themselves as well as their children indoors. Whenever parents boarded their children in school buses, monkeys attacked children for their tiffins and bottles by snatching their school bags. Monkeys even jumped all over the roofs, pelting people with stones and causing injuries. Residents were not even able to dry their clothes as monkeys snatched and tore them off. This menace was increasing only because of the negligence of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the petitioner had alleged.Taking note of the plea, HC sought a status report after six months on how many monkeys were released in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The court held that the respondents will also do well if they set up a special monkey sterilisation centre in case the monkey population is alarmingly high. For this, a census will have to be carried out as a pre-requisite, the bench observed. The court did not agree with the petitioner’s demand to declare monkeys vermin. “The suggestion of culling monkeys like vermin, on the face of it, is outrageous, cruel and preposterous, to say the least, given that the monkey menace is self-created by the residents and/or the visitors to the adjoining religious establishment, where, invariably the visitors/residents either out of the fondness or by way of religious offerings feed the monkeys. Garbage littering by residents is another contributor,” the bench said.The court was informed by UT that a special task force had been set up to attend to the residents’ complaints and catch the monkeys within 30 minutes of complaint, before releasing them in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. Besides, fruit-bearing trees had been planted in many sanctuary areas to provide a secure habitat with enough food and water to the monkeys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/survey-monkey-population-sterilise-them-high-court-tells-chandigarh-admn/story-6ZtXlQKUOdB3u7AcfVDlYL.html

25-09-2020||City||Environment group challenges green clearance renewal request for Navi Mumbai International Airport||Activists have filed objections before a government panel against the fresh environment clearance (EC) and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) renewal request made for the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) by planning agency City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco). The request will be heard by an expert appraisal committee (EAC for infrastructure projects) under the Union environment ministry on Friday.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Conservation Action Trust (CAT) has objected to the request, highlighting alleged violations and non-compliance of conditions imposed during previous EC clearances. From objections related to site selection, violation of wetland rules, bird strike hazard safety, furnishing incomplete and misleading information by Cidco, livelihood risks, and impact of heritage areas and ecosystems near NMIA, the group has requested the EAC through a letter (which HT has reviewed) to scrap the clearance and allow CAT a hearing before renewing any future clearances.“NMIA is an environmentally disastrous project. It is unsafe and will cause serious flooding to surrounding villages and urban nodes. Apparently, neither Cidco nor the Union environment ministry seems to have heard of climate change, sea level rise or bird strikes. Now that the adverse impacts of this project are clearly visible, this is a good time to stop wasting money on this project,” said Shweta Bhatt, director-conservation, CAT.A member of the EAC, requesting anonymity said, “The objection has been noted. We will hear Cidco’s presentation on Friday, and request them to respond to allegations made in the letter.”The new greenfield NMIA, first proposed over 20 years ago and approved in 2007 by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), is to serve as a second major airport for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region after the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. It is to be built on 1,160 hectares (ha), of which 250ha is forest land (including 108.5ha mangrove forests, roughly equivalent to 73 Wankhede Stadiums). On November 22, 2010, the Union environment ministry granted EC and CRZ clearance for NMIA, and wildlife and forest clearances were granted in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The EC was subject to conditions such as compensatory plantation of mangroves over an area of 615ha, including the development of a 245ha biodiversity mangrove park, a 60-ha area mangrove restoration on the west side of the airport site around Moha and Panvel creeks and 310ha area on the northeast end of the airport between Gadhi River, Mankhurd Panvel Rail Corridor. Additionally, the National Highway 4B was to be declared no development zone, among other conditions.After garnering an extension of validity for the EC again in December 2017 up to November 11 this year, Cidco applied for EC renewal on May, claiming to have almost completed all on-site land development work.According to CAT’s letter to the EAC, the NMIA project site is ecologically sensitive and has been identified as a wetland in the National Wetland Inventory Atlas (NWIA) Maharashtra. “There is rampant destruction of mangroves, mudflats and creeks at the project site. Rivers are being diverted; forests, hills and the outcrops have been destroyed. The site is at serious risk of bird strikes with safety concern for passengers while 266 species of birds including threatened species recognised by the IUCN list will be impacted by the project,” the letter read, adding, “Previous plans for developing a mangrove sanctuary between Karnala and NMIA were deleted while Cidco failed to develop any mangrove park as recommended by the EC. Compensatory mangrove plantation has been undertaken at a site already harbouring dense mangroves.” Despite the fact that this site fell 26% in CRZ-I (most ecologically sensitive) category and comprised 400 acres of mangroves, 1000 acres of mud flats, and 250 acres of forest lands, the present site was selected for this project, CAT’s letter stressed, adding, “The haste in reclamation led to flooding across Kombudbhuj, Dungi, Paragaon, Khalche Owale and Bhangarpada villages across Ulwe.”Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco, said, “Major recommendations involving environmental monitoring and compensatory mangrove plantation have been completed by us as directed in the EC. However, other conditions are yet to be fulfilled. Discussions on the mangrove park are still underway.”Cidco’s chief planner Ramesh Dengle refused to comment on the issue, while chief general manager (transportation and airport) said, “We cannot speak to the media about ongoing projects.”Status report of efforts at NMIA construction siteAccording to submissions made by Cidco before EAC, the pre-development activity, including land development for NMIA, commenced in April 2017 after receiving forest clearance. “This is nearing completion. The cost of approximately Rs3,368 crore has already been incurred on this on-going critical airport project, which is 24% of the phase-I project cost (Rs14,179 crore). Cidco has additionally incurred a cost of Rs1,813 crore towards resettlement and rehabilitation for the project. Thus, a total of Rs5,181 crore has been incurred on the project till December 2019. The schedule of NMIA project implementation has extended as forest clearance was received in 2017, and the project on-site activities could not take place prior to this,” the letter justifying the EC requirement before the EAC read.What activists asked the government panel to considerCAT requested the EAC committee to take into consideration the following suggestions while considering green clearance renewal:•Status of compliance with the conditions imposed in the EC, CRZ, forest and wildlife clearances•Change of project parameters•Cumulative Impacts of additional projects linked to NMIA•Impact of diversion of additional rivers•Status of mangrove reafforestation and destruction as a violation of Bombay high court orders•Bird hazards studies•Rehabilitation of locals•Destruction of wetlands within Cidco’s jurisdiction•Compliance with noise standards•Impact on Elephanta caves||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/environment-group-challenges-green-clearance-renewal-request-for-navi-mumbai-international-airport/story-y3EXlWTHakMe2u46hKbZIM.html

Despite taking various efforts such as releasing inmates on bail or parole to decongest the jail amid the Covid-19 outbreak, Tuesday’s downpour forced authorities to violate social distancing norms inside the prison premises. The Arthur Road jail is situated on a low-lying area, causing rain water to enter the jail premises easily. The jail authorities have written to the court, requesting it to release more inmates, owing to the water logging problem. “On Tuesday night, within hours after it started to rain, the ground floor was filled with water till the waist. Most of the barracks, the superintendent’s office, the canteen and some other rooms were waterlogged. It was difficult to arrange lunch and dinner, but we ensured that no one went hungry,” said an officer from the jail. Sunil Ramanand, inspector general (prisons), Maharashtra said that no waterlogging was reported on Thursday. “By Thursday morning, the water level decreased. All the prisoners were then shifted back to their respective barracks. As the crowd was less it was possible to shift them to other barracks,” added the officer. The jail has a capacity to house around 800 inmates but until the pandemic broke out in March, there were 3600 prisoners in jail. “After the Supreme Court’s order to release inmates owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, there are currently around 1,700 inmates lodged in the jail, but that too, is double its capacity,” the officeerr said. 183 cases reported from jail The jail authorities tested 998 inmates in the jail, of whom 183 were tested positive for Covid-19. All the inmates have recovered. Forty-nine staffers were also tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-downpour-leads-to-waterlogging-in-mumbai-s-arthur-road-jail/story-0AcPCpSgGnFE0vm2Il5f2L.html

Two videos of overcrowded local train compartments on Wednesday afternoon and a crowded foot overbridge went viral on social media. Though services are operational only for those in essential services owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, trains and station platforms witnessed huge crowds after services were cancelled. “Water started to accumulate on tracks from Tuesday night at Sion, after which many passengers were stuck at the station,” said Divya Dutta, a civic hospital employee. “There was heavy rain in Mumbai on 23/9/2020, resulting in cancellation on suburban services.

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: NCB probe illegal; witch-hunt by 3 Central agencies, Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer tells Bombay HC||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, in jail for allegedly procuring drugs for the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, on Thursday claimed before the Bombay high court (HC) that a “witch hunt” has been unleashed against her by investigating agencies. She also argued that the investigation conducted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) was “illegal” as it had no jurisdiction to investigate the drug links to the death of Rajput.Counsel for the 28-year-old actor and her brother Showik, advocate Satish Maneshinde, submitted that the drug related case should also have been entrusted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Arguing Rhea and Showik’s bail applications, Maneshinde pointed out that on August 19 the SC had directed that all cases relating to the death of Rajput should be transferred for investigation to CBI, and since the drug trail was also linked, this case should also have been transferred to CBI.Maneshinde maintained that the offences attributed by the NCB to Rhea and Showik were bailable, as admittedly those are related to small quantities and stringent provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS), 1985, like Section 27A (financing illicit trafficking of drugs or harbours offenders), were not applicable.In her application, Rhea also claimed that a witch-hunt has been started against her by engaging three central agencies for investigating cases, but two of those agencies — CBI and ED — have till date found no evidence against her or her family. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who represented the NCB, said they will reply to all the arguments advanced on behalf of the Chakraborty siblings. He, however, sought time to file an affidavit in reply to the bail applications. Justice Sarang Kotwal posted the bail applications for further hearing on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-ncb-probe-illegal-witch-hunt-by-3-central-agencies-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-tells-bombay-hc/story-6hJZqJYIqYNAR6LWYNihpN.html

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai unlikely to have any more water cuts this year||With the overall water level in the seven lakes that supply drinking water to the city at over 98%, it is unlikely that Mumbai will face any more water cuts this year. The decision on water cuts will be formally taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) during a review meeting on October 1. A senior civic body official said, “The catchment areas received good rainfall in the past one month due to which we also rolled back water cuts. Also, due to this there should not be any water cuts this year. However, yearly review of lake levels is taken on October 1.”Last month, BMC had announced a 20% water cut owing to low water levels in the seven lakes. This was rolled back after catchment areas received good rainfall. Previously in 2014, BMC had imposed a 25% water cut and in 2015-2016, there was a 20% water cut.In 2018, BMC had imposed a 10% water cut.

25-09-2020||City||AAP stages protest against agri bills in Mohali||Members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) protested against what they termed ‘black farmer laws’ at Phase-7 light point in Mohali on Thursday. Local leaders Raj Lali Gill and Gurtej Pannu said this ‘black law’ would not only affect the farmers, but also impact businesses and stakeholders associated with farming. “To save our farmers, our business and our state, all of us need to come together and fight to revoke this law,” they said. The AAP leaders said the first step towards revoking this law is to support the ‘Punjab Bandh’ on September 25. Slamming the Badals as well as Captain Amarinder Singh, the leaders said while Manpreet Badal supported the bill when it was tabled before the high-powered committee, the Badals kept promoting the bill till the time people started stopping their cadre from entering villages. Gill and Pannu said that Harsimrat’s resignation was nothing but a “drama” and they were trying to “sabotage” the farmers’ protests by keeping their ‘chakka jam’ on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-holds-protest-against-agri-bills-in-mohali/story-v36R0RrMGjeM8aCI5W8q0M.html
25-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi building collapse: Rescue ops called off 80 hours later; 38 dead, 25 hurt||After 80 hours, rescue operations were called off at Dhamankar naka in Bhiwandi, where a ground-plus-three storey residential building collapsed around 3.30am on Monday, killing 38 people, including 17 children, and injuring 25. The rescue teams, comprising personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Thane Disaster Response Force (TDRF) and Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) and Bhiwandi Police, called off operations around 11.30am on Thursday with the last body of Murtuza Mohammad Mustaffa Khan, 33, pulled out from the debris around 5pm on Wednesday. A family, who on Wednesday claimed their two-and-a-half-year-old boy was missing following which the search was extended, has still not found him and was seeking help from the police to know his whereabouts. The police have also decided to conduct a DNA test of an unclaimed body after the family of 28-year-old Shabnam Mohammad Ali Shaikh claimed that she, too, was unaccounted for.“Rescue operations was called off after we took records from all rescue teams and then finalised the number of victims and injured. Those with disputes on missing bodies will be dealt by the police after checking records and details,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner, BNCMC. “As our team was planning to call off the operations, one family claimed that their son was not found. We decided to search all over again and continued the search for around 15 hours, but didn’t find anyone. We did canine search all over the site and also moved the debris to see if we have missed someone,” said Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant, NDRF. Shakeel Qureshi, 32, “My brother’s son, Museb, is missing since after the incident. The rescue team had searched the site on our request, but he was not found. My brother is devastated. He has already lost his wife and one child in the incident. He managed to survive with his two other children.” “When we approached the police for a missing complaint, they said there is no such proof of his missing as all bodies were recovered from the site. On Thursday, while the transportation of debris was on from the site, few police were checking again to confirm,” added Qureshi. Senior police inspector of Narpoli police station MB Shinde said, “The family is claiming that their son is missing. We will take a decision tomorrow with the guidance of our senior officials on what further action should be taken in this case. Meanwhile, our team is checking the debris being cleared from the site.” He added, “In another such case [of Shabnam], we have decided to carry out a DNA test of an unclaimed body with her family member.” After rescue operations were called off at the site, the team stood in silence for two minutes for those who died in the incident. They also made announcements to inform people about the operations ending. “This is a tragic incident. Even if I was not in the building, I could feel the pain that the families would have gone through. I can never forget the sight of bodies being removed from the debris, with their families waiting to see them for one last time,” said Shabana Ahmad Khan, 38, who is from the locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-rescue-ops-called-off-80-hours-later-38-dead-25-hurt/story-7P5siWAU73YmLZDGWa8m3O.html

Of the state’s total 36 districts, 92.91% or 11.92 lakh cases and 94% or 32,284 deaths were reported in 20 districts, statistics revealed.Of the 459 fatalities reported on Thursday, 256 were from the past two days, 125 were from over past week and remaining 78 were from the period before it, according to the state health department. A total of 54 fatalities were from Mumbai, 49 from Pune (26 in city, 11 in rural parts and 12 Pimpri-Chichwad), 47 from Nagpur (including 30 in Nagpur city) and 29 from Jalgaon. Pune remained the highest contributor to the daily caseload with 3,555 cases, which included 1,572 cases in city, 1,238 in rural parts and 745 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Other key districts Nagpur and Nashik logged 1,571 and 1,231 new cases respectively. During the video conference with prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, the state has been asked to concentrate on these districts. District administrations have now been asked to increase the tracing of suspected patients. Besides Pune and Thane; Kolhapur, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Chandrapur, Nagpur were some of the worst- affected districts identified. The local authorities have also been directed to implement the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ drive effectively, so that the vulnerable section of the society is tapped early. “Prime minister Narendra Modi has asked the state administration to focus on 20 districts with high number of cases. The CMO has been asked to monitor situations on a regular basis by contacting officials at the tehsil level in these districts. Dedicated officials are being appointed to monitor the situation in these districts to ensure that the situation is brought under control at the earliest. Districts are being directed to ramp up health facilities with adequate number of beds, oxygen supply and ventilators and at the same time, go for massive tracing of contacts. By doing this, the district administrations would be able to contain the spread,” said an official from the health department.State health minister Rajesh Tope, who was on the Vidarbha tour on Thursday, said the district administrations have been directed to increase tests and go for more tracing of suspected contacts. “The state average of tests is 40,000 per million, which needs to be maintained by all districts. The ones with fewer tests per million have been directed to increase them so that the spread is arrested,” he said.Against the state average of 44,622 tests per million, as many as 29 districts are below it. In 20 districts, the average was less than 30,000 tests per million population. 2,17,364 patients have reported to have been recovered from the infection in past ten days, taking the tally of the recovered patients to 9.73 lakh.

State conducted 83,602 tests in the past 24 hours with a positivity rate of 22.92%. 18.84 lakh Covid-19 patients are home quarantined, while 33,412 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-maharashtra-93-cases-and-94-deaths-from-20-districts/story-FMjDoZw8sVje5AsJ1J96CI.html
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||CAG flags design defects, financial viability of Chandigarh’s water treatment plant||Pointing out lapses in the set-up and function of the tertiary water treatment plant built by the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC), the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) has in its report stated that the plant suffers from design defects, while raising questions over its financial viability.Significantly, the matter was reported to the civic body in July 2018 and then in August 2019, besides to the ministry of home affairs in August 2018. The latter’s response is awaited as of December 2019, states the auditing body’s report. The CAG report notes that the Chandigarh MC decided to design and build a tertiary treatment plant in Diggian in Mohali and associated facilities with a capacity of 10 million gallons/day (MGD) to treat the discharge from its sewage treatment plants (STPs). The treated sewage was to be supplied for irrigation purposes, replacing the potable water being used otherwise. The design wrongly assumed sufficient availability of sewage, states the report. One of the underground reservoirs was shifted to the older network with lower than required discharge capacity pumps and the old STP was not technically upgraded, the report mentioned. The civic body, it said, did not ensure the required BOD level, that is below 5mg/l in the output, at the treatment plant, which likely led to the non-acceptance of treated water among the consumers. Moreover, the MC could not recover the 43% of the operational and maintenance cost of the project as planned. The report states, “Treated water was supplied for free to the green spaces being maintained by the MC’s horticulture wing. The civic body also did not bill the tertiary water connections. An audit revealed that the intended results could not be achieved even after six to seven years post-project completion, and the audit could not assure itself of the viability of the project.”KEY FINDINGSOnly six to nine MGD tertiary treated water, instead of 20 MGD as planned, is being supplied due to design and implementation failures, while the project viability is affected due to factors such as non-billingAgainst the administrative approval of Rs 4.73 crore for the aforesaid work, Rs 7.29 crore (54% excess) was incurred. The justification for enhancement of the project cost to the extent, without any significant change in the capacity/technology of the tertiary plant to be installed, could not be found on recordAgainst the capacity of 10MGD tertiary treated water from the aforesaid plant, on average, only three to four MGD tertiary treated water was being suppliedParameters of BOD level as agreed upon between the agency and Chandigarh MC was up to 20mg/l, which was far above that approved in the DPR — 5mg/l.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cag-flags-design-defects-financial-viability-of-chandigarh-s-water-treatment-plant/story-fTW8bFclKOyMeZdfpfU0VO.html

Sector 4 resident Dharmender Kumar, who is the complainant in the case, said, “On the way from my office on Basai road, I stopped at a bakery. As I approached the counter, I noticed that a man standing next to me was not wearing a mask. I politely told him to wear a mask and take all precautions of social distancing. Another person was with him. They started misbehaving and arguing, and then called several aides. They all attacked me and my son (22-year-old Kush Kumar).

25-09-2020||Gurugram||HSVP shortlists 116 applicants for plots amid protest by land owners||Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Thursday shortlisted 122 applicants for allotment of plots under the oustees quota amid protests from land owners whose claims were rejected due to policy issues.HSVP officials said the plots will be allotted after a further screening. The applicants were called on Thursday at HSVP estate office II for draw of lots. It was, however, not held due to the protest. As per details shared by the HSVP officials, 622 landowners had applied for plots under the oustees quota as their land had been acquired for development. Only 116 were only found eligible. “The reason for the rejection of these claims is that, as per policy, only those who had over 75% land acquired were eligible for plots. Also, as per the directions of a high court order, the legal heirs of land owners cannot be considered for allotment of plots under this quota,” said Vivek Kalia, estate officer II. Kalia, however, said that the claims of shortlisted applicants will be further screened and they would be allotted plots at the earliest. “There were some landowners who expressed resentment as their claims were rejected but we have taken written submission from them in this regard and we will look into their issues. The final decision will be taken as per the oustees policy and directions of the court and it would satisfy all the stakeholders,” said Kalia. HSVP officials said that the process of shortlisting the applicants was carried out from 11 am to 2.30 pm. “The entire process of shortlisting was carried out as per rules. Shortlisted applicants would be allotted plots after completion of formalities,” said Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator.The landowners, however, said that their claims were being rejected on frivolous reasons and they would approach the Punjab and Haryana court against these arbitrary decisions. “When the applications were called, no such conditions were mentioned and years after acquiring our land and two years after seeking applications, the authority is now rejecting our rightful claim,” said a landowner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-shortlists-116-applicants-for-plots-amid-protest-by-land-owners/story-TF4jDW7xxPUyp1JGQS4zJL.html
25-09-2020||Gurugram||Members of Gurugram unit of AAP protest against farm bills||Members of Aam Aadmi Party(AAP), Gurugram, on Thursday, took out a protest march from Sohna Chowk till the Mini Secretariat building to raise their voice against the three farm bills that were recently passed by the Parliament. AAP members also submitted a memorandum addressing the President to the district administration. The Parliament in its monsoon session passed three farm bills namely,The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. While these bills await presidential assent, farmers across the northern states of Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against them, alleging that these bills go against the interest of the farming community. AAP member RS Rathee said that the party had submitted a letter addressed to the President, asking him not to give his assent to the bills. “The objections raised by the farmers are being suppressed and the bills were passed in the Parliament by silencing the opposition parties. These parties kept seeking a division of votes but no attention was paid to their objections,” said Rathee. He said that the party would continue to protest against the legislation until the demand of the farmers are accommodated. “Small farmers will suffer if the bills are made into a law,” said Rathee. Mewat-based social organisation, Mewat Vikas Sabha (MVS), will also be demonstrating against the legislations at Badkali Chowk in Nuh on Friday. “Farmers across the country are protesting against the anti-farmer legislation passed by the government. To extend our support to farmers, we will also be protesting against the bills,” said MVS president Salamudeen Meo.BJP Haryana spokesperson Raman Malik said that criticism from AAP and other parties was unwarranted. He said that the bills would not have an impact on the minimum support price (MSP) and were aimed at giving more choices to farmers. “The bills have nothing to do with MSPs. The agricultural produce market committee (APMC) laws are not being changed. Further, the mandis (markets) are not going anywhere. These three laws will open up the market, if desired by the farmers. They will have the freedom to choose where they want to sell,” said Malik||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/members-of-gurugram-unit-of-aap-protest-against-farm-bills/story-ZSn8DbxFGi3sUg3CeasaaK.html
25-09-2020||Mumbai||E-classes: Tough test for students of Mumbai’s night schools and colleges||When most students in the city were busy adapting to online learning in March, 30-year-old Seeta Patel, a Class 10 student of a night school, was not able to join her online classes. The same month, Seeta and her family were evicted from their hutment in Tardeo, after an adjacent plot was taken over by a builder. Struggling to find food and shelter in post-Covid-19 times, she found it difficult to attend her classes. “When Covid-19 cases in the city started to rise and a lockdown was imposed, we were battling to find shelter while trying to feed ourselves at the same time. Somehow, we got a small hutment in Worli and moved there, but I did not have a smartphone,” said the student of Modern Night School, Mumbai Central. While Seeta finally got a phone with the help of her school, she still has to juggle her work and studies and find time for studies. As learning still remains online, the new normal in post-Covid times is a new challenge for students of night schools and colleges. Since the virtual reopening in June, attendance at most night schools has been as low as 10-20%. Of the 120 students that are enrolled in Amar Shahid Hindi Night School in Sion, only 20 are present for classes every day. “Most students who come to our school live in Dharavi. Most of their parents have lost jobs after the lockdown and have migrated to their hometowns in April. Many are yet to come back. Even the ones who have returned are now struggling to find work. This explains the poor attendance,” said Darshana Pandav, a social science teacher at the school. Niranjan Giri, who teaches at Modern Night School in Mumbai Central where Seeta studies, said while about 120 aided night schools are operating in the city, only eight schools have been able to start online learning. “Very few students are in a position to attend online classes. As night schools mostly cater to students from Classes 8 to 10, students who join them have either dropped out in the past or have some challenges to go to a regular school. This makes it difficult for them to prioritise learning over other fundamental concerns like getting a source of livelihood and food to survive. In such a situation, they have several challenges – physical, financial and social – to adapt to online learning,” said Giri. As per a survey conducted by Masoom, an NGO that provides support to over 70 night schools in the city, of the 1,160 students who were surveyed, over 54% students have migrated to their family homes elsewhere during the lockdown. While 12.5% students said they had to go back because of lack of jobs, others had to leave as they could not pay rent in the city and hence felt unsafe. “The biggest concern is drop-outs and falling enrolments over the days to come. If schools and NGOs are not able to engage them into learning while also understanding their emotional needs, these students will not be driven towards continuing their education,” said Nikita Ketkar, CEO, Masoom. While access to technology is a big hurdle in the way of online education, another big challenge is vacant teaching posts. After the government cancelled the appointments of over 1,300 teachers who were working in the night schools along with their day jobs in 2018, only about 300 teachers were recruited against these vacancies. “This has put an additional burden on the existing teachers as they have to teach multiple subjects at the same time,” added Giri. “The situation is very grim. The government needs to intervene and address the plight of both students and teachers in night schools,” said Meenal Vagal, treasurer, Utkarsha Night High School, Worli. Night colleges, too, are struggling to get students on board, with many unable to pay their fees. Vitthal Rokade, principal at one of the city’s oldest night colleges, TK Tope College in Parel, said as opposed to three merit lists for degree admissions every year, this year, there was only one. “Until last year, not all students who applied would get a seat, but this time, everyone got a seat because there are very few applicants. Most of our students work during the day and with the pandemic, some of them also lost their jobs. Even from the students who have been able to enrol, only about 60% attend regularly and many have not been able to pay their fees. We have given them concessions and have extended the deadline because the times are really very tough,” he said. Vinay Raut, secretary, Vidya Vikas Education Society that runs Vikas College in Vikhroli, said, “Some are working as auto/taxi drivers, maids etc and live in slums and chawls. Their parents do not have the money to pay fees and many also do not have android phones.” Sudam Waghmare, a former night school teacher who now works in a day job, said the most challenging task for schools is to teach subjects like mathematics and science that are fairly complex. “Many students need a lot of help and support to pass. But many schools are now providing worksheets and activity sheets to supplement online learning with offline exercises,” he said. Since April, Masoom has been conducting 22 batches of online classes for students across night schools in the state every day. “The response has been good and we are happy that we have been able to overcome the obstacles involved in the process,” said Ramadas Alanghat, administration manager at the NGO. Students, meanwhile, are looking forward to physical reopening of schools now. “I work at a factory in Andheri all day and then attend school. In addition to studies, the school would give us nutritious meals and help us by even giving us emotional support. The online model lacks these things,” said Ramesh Singh, a student from a Santacruz-based private night school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/e-classes-tough-test-for-students-of-mumbai-s-night-schools-and-colleges/story-E2Zfjl0ejIFyIHa4VlwmaJ.html

25-09-2020||Delhi||Rushdie, Chomsky, Mira Nair, among 200 personalities demanding Khalid’s release||More than 200 national and international scholars, academicians and artists issued a statement on Thursday, demanding the release of former JNU student Umar Khalid, who is under arrest for his alleged role in the north-east Delhi riots. The signatories -- including linguist Noam Chomsky, authors Salman Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Ramachandra Guha and Rajmohan Gandhi, filmmakers Mira Nair and Anand Patwardhan, historians Romila Thapar, Ramchandra Guha, and Irfan Habib, and activists Medha Patkar and Aruna Roy -- have termed Delhi Police’s investigation in the case as a “premeditated witch-hunt”. They said the government should free Khalid and all those who they say were “falsely implicated” and “unjustly incarcerated” for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Also read: Umar Khalid sent to Tihar till October 22They said the government should “ensure the Delhi Police investigate the Delhi riots with impartiality under the oath they took as public servants bound by the Constitution of India”. When approached, the Delhi Police spokesperson did not comment on the matter. “We stand in solidarity and outrage, with the brave young scholar and activist Umar Khalid, arrested in New Delhi on Sept 14, 2020, under fabricated charges of engineering the Delhi riots in February 2020. He is charged with sedition, conspiracy to murder, and under sections of India’s stringent anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). This process of criminalising all dissent has been underway for a few years and even under a Covid-19 pandemic, relentless political arrests under fabricated charges are punishing the innocent long before they are brought to trial,” the statement read. Terming the anti-CAA movement as the largest most peaceful democratic rights movement in independent India, the signatories said, “Umar Khalid became a powerful young voice of truth in this movement, speaking at close to 100 meetings across India, in small towns and big cities, upholding the values of India’s constitution; articulating the dreams of all young Indians – of freedom from hunger, deprivation, discrimination and fear. He staked his claim to the full measure of citizenship, he spoke for all marginal peoples, and above all Umar spoke for peace.” “Currently, 19 of the 21 people falsely accused under terror laws, are Muslim. If we allow their identity to become their crime, India shall stand shamed in the global community of secular nations. These people are not terrorists, and the police investigation into the Delhi riots is not an investigation. It is a premeditated witch-hunt,” the statement added. Earlier this month, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava had said they had examined a large number of persons regardless of their religion and party affiliation and dismissing allegations that they were targeting a particular community.Also read: Delhi Police’s Umar Khalid investigation hinges on witnesses X and YThe signatories said no case has been registered against leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for their alleged hate speeches and criticised Delhi Police for their investigation into the riot cases. Many activists have said that in the name of investigation, police arrested anti-government voices while going soft on members of the ruling party for their alleged role in the riots. The Delhi unit of the BJP, however, said the police had investigated the alleged charges against their members but found no evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rushdie-chomsky-mira-nair-among-200-personalities-demanding-khalid-s-release/story-mb1rsm6eHrAP6OKbo9jZBJ.html
25-09-2020||Delhi||Red zone count hits 2k, over 16% in S-W district||The number of containment zones in Delhi crossed the 2,000-mark on Thursday, according to government data, even as the national capital added 3,834 cases of the coronavirus disease. Of the 2,059 containment zones, most are concentrated in the western part of the city, with the highest number in the southwest district, which has 341 restricted areas (16.6%), followed by the west (234), and northwest (229) districts.With 72, northeast district has the fewest such zones (less than 4%) of the city’s 11 revenue districts, the data showed. The city had 1,987 containment zones as on Wednesday. The hot spots crossed the 1,500-mark on September 14, and over 50 such zones have been demarcated in the city on average every day since then.At least 10 of these zones have been sealed for more than two months now, officials said, including hot spots in Rohini Sector 1, RPS colony in Khanpur, an apartment in Dwarka’s Sector 16B, Valmiki Basti in Jhatikara village, Lohia Mohalla in Shikarpur and five separate areas in Dakshinpuri locality. The data showed that the localities that have the highest number of containment zones include Rohini (with 58 containment zones spread largely across sectors 3, 8, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 21), Pitampura (30), Uttam Nagar (11), Dwarka (with 40 containment zones spread largely across sectors 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 23) and Paschim Vihar (24). Around 19% of the city’s total active Covid-19 cases are located within containment zones, showed a report published by HT on Monday. Containment zones are sealed areas where free movement of individuals and traffic is prohibited, so are economic activities. All residents are put under strict surveillance, are periodically screened and the area is sanitised. These areas are subject to these curbs for at least 21 days from the date the last new case was recorded.The Capital had 31,125 active cases of the infection as on Thursday, and 5,123 have died so far. The city has seen a surge in cases since the first week of September, with over 3,700 infections added on average daily over each of the past seven days.“Quickly identifying containment zones has helped Delhi arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease significantly,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, on the sidelines of his visit to the Indian Agriculture Research Institute for the live demonstration of a crop stubble decomposition technology. Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot on Thursday told HT, “The government is aggressively creating containment zones to break the chain of transmission at the earliest. However, it is important to mention that the focus of the government is on creating smaller containment zones so that lesser people are affected. The status of the containment zones is periodically reviewed.” Delhi lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal had last week issued directions to the city administration to re-draft its strategy on containment zones. The new strategy, however, is yet to be finalised, said senior officials in the revenue department. This is the second time that Delhi’s containment zone strategy will be re-drafted. It was first re-drafted on June 26, in adherence to recommendations of Union home minister Amit Shah, following which the number of containment zones had shot up from 280 to 440 over three days. HT’s September 19 report, based on data till September 16, showed how the northwest and southwest revenue districts in Delhi – which rank among the top three in terms of number of containment zones — also account for the highest share of active covid-19 cases — 16.3% and 13.3% respectively. These districts have a mix of planned residential areas (such as Rohini and Dwarka sub-cities) and densely populated unplanned areas including unauthorised colonies, villages and slum clusters. Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Delhi has adopted the right approach. Timely demarcation of containment zones and increased surveillance are helpful strategies in arresting the spread of covid-19. Delhi should continue with its containment efforts.” However, Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “At this point, Delhi can also consider doing away with the concept of containment zones and increase the scale of contact tracing and surveillance for each and every Covid-19 case identified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/red-zone-count-hits-2k-over-16-in-s-w-district/story-1sXjUTLYjOxSGQTcUe14EN.html
25-09-2020||Mumbai||88% pregnant women with Covid-19 are asymptomatic in Maharashtra: Study||A study conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRH), in association with Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) and BYL Nair Hospital has found that most Covid-positive pregnant women are asymptomatic. Despite the absence of symptoms, Covid-19 can cause health complications during pregnancies and delivery, said gynaecologists. The study analysed data collected between April 25 and May 20 by PregCOVID (https://pregcovid.com/), a registry started by ICMR-NIRRH in collaboration with MEDD and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). PregCOVID has data from 18 government medical colleges across rural and urban Maharashtra and the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai. For the study, data from 1,140 pregnant women was analysed and 321 tested positive for Covid-19. However, only 37 (11.5%) exhibited symptoms when they were admitted to hospitals for delivery. The prevalence of the virus in women varied (0-40%) across different hospitals. “Our results estimate the presence of one symptomatic to every nine asymptomatic pregnant women,” reads the study, which was published on September 23 in the European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology. “Detection of asymptomatic women will protect them and their new-borns [as well as] healthcare workers, and curb spread of the infection in the community. The significance of detecting asymptomatic pregnant women is useful for ensuring safe obstetric and neonatal services and assessing the burden of Covid-19 in the region,” said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye of ICMR-NIRRH. Doctors have observed that Covid-19 can lead to health complications in pregnant women. “During pregnancy, the immunity level goes down among women, which makes them more susceptible to the infection. So, women with comorbid health issues develop complications,” said Dr Ashok Anand, head of obstetrics and gynaecology, Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai. The hospital has treated over 600 Covid-positive pregnant women since March. There is also a greater risk of complications during a caesarean section for Covid-positive mothers. “The infection leads to blood clotting in infected mothers and postpartum bleeding or postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital, adding that more studies are necessary to verify these observations. PregCovid is open for all public and private Covid-19 hospitals in India that provide care to Covid-positive pregnant women.

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Benzene levels in Mumbai saw spike during Covid-19 lockdown even as other pollutants dipped: CPCB report||Contrary to most air quality reports during the Covid-19-associated lockdown, a study showed that benzene concentration in Mumbai was higher during all phases of the lockdown as compared to levels in 2019. The findings were released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in its report titled “Impact of Lockdown on Ambient Air Quality” released on Wednesday. Benzene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) released in the air from anthropogenic sources such as emissions from crude oil, gasoline and industrial processes. In urban areas, the presence of benzene is most detected (through scent) at petrol pumps. Long-term exposure to benzene can cause serious health effects, said doctors.The CPCB report showed 30-35% average rise in benzene levels during lockdown. “Benzene increased in all phases of lockdown, compared to the levels during the same period in 2019. It is possible that certain industries, especially those consuming or releasing benzene, might have started operating, resulting in the increase. Local influence of emissions on monitoring stations is also a possibility,” the report said.VK Shukla, principal investigator of CPCB’s report, said, “We must realise that Mumbai experiences very different meteorological variations as compared to other urban cities. The higher benzene emission could be a localised issue near our monitoring stations. We are not sure of the exact source, but based on Mumbai’s source apportionment, there are 39 types of industries (excluding power plants), and benzene rise could be due to some functional industries during lockdown. The report is based on data collated by various stations, but exact reasons for this rise still needs to be investigated.”A similar analysis by Mumbai-based air quality research group UrbanSciences using CPCB data showed similar results. “Areas such as Worli consistently reported unsafe benzene levels with 24-hour averages over 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3). The two month benzene average (two lockdown phases) at Worli was 13.1 µg/m3. Sion reported the next highest daily averages with most days above safe limits. Kurla reported an abnormal spike of up to 58 µg/m3 between April 24 and 30,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder and chief executive officer, UrbanSciences. The annual safe limit for benzene in India is 5 µg/m3 but countries like Israel have more stringent norms (3.9 µg/m3 for 24 hours). “Elevated benzene levels in few areas of Mumbai are a cause for concern and need immediate investigation, especially in locations where the 24-hour averages are above the safe limits,” added Sutaria.Doctors said benzene was a proven carcinogen with severe health effects from long-term exposure. “The pollutant affects the urinary system, mainly the kidneys. It has been shown to cause bladder cancers. Levels are very high at petrol stations where VOCs are emitted. It is surprising that levels would be higher during lockdown when such activities were on hold,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director, Chest Research Foundation, Pune.Experts, however, said the benzene data may not be reliable. “The spike is highly unusual and data has been collated from very few stations. Also, long-term data has not been maintained for this pollutant in Mumbai,” said Professor SN Tripathi, head of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur and apex committee member of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). Meanwhile, the reduction in industrial and vehicular activity during lockdown was divided into two phases (March 25 to April 19 and April 20 to May 3) showing a decline in major pollutant concentration such as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as compared to levels during pre-lockdown (March 1 to 21) and the same period in 2019.PM10 fell by 40% as compared to 2019 levels and 20% than pre-lockdown levels, NO2 fell 56% and 69% compared to the phases, while SO2 fell 56% and 48%. “PM2.5 levels increased during the first lockdown phase by 5% but decreased by 9% in the second phase, as compared to levels during 2019,” the CPCB report said, explaining that from April 22 onwards the Maharashtra government revoked permissions for activities (e-commerce companies, electrical supplies, sweet shops, confectionaries, courier services, activity related to agriculture products, restaurants). “The larger reduction in the second phase of lockdown may be due to this fact,” said Shukla adding, “Overall, like other cities Mumbai witnessed a transitional change in air pollution levels during lockdown, bringing down air pollution and achieving background air quality.”30% RISE IN OZONE LEVELS IN MUMBAI DURING LOCKDOWN: NCAP EXPERT MEMBERNCAP member professor Tripathi said Mumbai was among major urban cities in India that witnessed a 30% rise in ozone (O3). He explained that O3 rise was a complex phenomenon associated with a decline in NO2 and other pollutants, as well as meteorological factors among other reasons. Surface ozone (O3) is a photochemical oxidant, which is formed when pollutants like volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) chemically react in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ground-level ozone is harmful for humans as it can lead to asthma, cardiovascular diseases and other health ailments.“There is an immediate need for a massive urban zone like Mumbai to commence real-time source apportionment (RTSA) monitoring for pollutants like PM2.5 rather than depending on older information for pollution sources. This needs to be done on priority,” said Tripathi. IIT-Kanpur’s RTSA study for Delhi was included in CPCB’s report which highlighted source-specific decline in pollution levels during lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/benzene-levels-in-mumbai-saw-spike-in-covid-19-lockdown-even-as-other-pollutants-dipped-cpcb-report/story-pAUPWfpIenm3lIn0aiHz4M.html
25-09-2020||Delhi||BJP leader Kapil Mishra claims threat to life||New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra on Thursday filed a police complaint, alleging a “hate campaign” against him, and raised concerns over the security of his family members. Mishra filed the complaint with the Delhi Police’s special cell unit, which is probing the conspiracy behind the north-east Delhi riots. Delhi police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police Eish Singhal confirmed that they had received a complaint at the special cell. “It will be enquired into,” he said. On Thursday afternoon, Mishra said on Twitter that there was a hate campaign against him through fake news and that his family’s life was in danger. On February 23, before communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi, Mishra had visited the Jafrabad metro station and delivered a speech, giving a three-day ultimatum to police to remove the anti-CAA protesters present at the spot. Critics of the probe into the riots have often pointed out while the police targeted anti-CAA and anti-government voices, it did not take any action against people such as Mishra, who belonged to the ruling party, even though there was video footage of them allegedly “giving inflammatory speeches.” Mishra said on Thursday,” “What I said is in video and everyone has seen that video. All legal experts have said in one voice that there is nothing wrong in what I said that day. Some forces who want to divert the attention from the truth are trying to fabricate false complaints against Delhi Police and me. Truth of Delhi riots is out, how long they have planned, their funding and why they especially chose the days of (Donald) Trump’s visit...everything is exposed already.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-leader-kapil-mishra-claims-threat-to-life/story-dG8IwYaA6Fbzui9zmlEf3L.html

25-09-2020||Delhi||Farm fires growing in Punjab, plumes of smoke seen over Delhi in satellite images||The number of crop stubble burning cases in Punjab has been increasing over the past five days, especially in Amritsar district, satellite images released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) have shown. Nasa also warned that with plumes of smoke being seen over Delhi, the city’s air quality may also deteriorate in the coming weeks. Delhi government data shows that last year stubble burning accounted for 44% of the city’s air pollution. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes were burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes of the 7 million tonnes stubble were burnt by farmers.The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) had on Tuesday written to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, asking the states to control cases of stubble burning. In his letter to the two states, Epca chief Bhure Lal said it was imperative that early action be taken to control these fires ahead of the winters to control the annual pollution spike in Delhi.Data provided by Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, shows that early instances of stubble burning started appearing on satellite images from September 12 this year, and the number of incidents is consistently increasing. The worst affected district was Amritsar in Punjab. Other districts where ‘red dots’, which indicate fires, are being observed are Tarn Taran, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and parts of Firozpur. Also read: No option but to burn stubble, say farmers as doctors worry about CovidData shows that between September 20 and September 24, 60-100 farm fires were reported daily from Amritsar. From September 22, the satellite images spotted caught plumes of smoke over the national capital. “Satellite images show smoke over north India since September 22. This hazy cover over northern India is most likely because stubble burning activity has started,” said Gupta, who is also leading a community forum of environment experts and government representatives to understand the impact of these fires on the local environment and look for solutions to control crop residue burning. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that currently north-westerly winds are blowing across Delhi, which means that the smoke from Punjab and Haryana will directly be carried to the city, deteriorating the air quality here. “The only respite is that for the next two days the wind speeds will improve to 20-25kmph. But after that, the wind speed will reduce again and if the stubble burning activity continues to grow, the pollution levels will also see a spike in the coming weeks,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. A senior official of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) said stubble burning cases are “under control” and the monitoring teams are keeping a close watch on violators. Also read: First stubble fires start to show up on Nasa map“We are monitoring the stubble burning activity through our remote sensing system. There is awareness among farmers but our teams have started visiting villages to stop stubble burning,” said the PPCB official, on the condition of anonymity. On Thursday, Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), was 104, in the ‘moderate’ zone. On Wednesday, the city’s air was ‘satisfactory’ with an AQI value of 76.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-fires-growing-in-punjab-plumes-of-smoke-seen-over-delhi-in-satellite-images/story-oeMuYCRwplQRN9MIN4ABPK.html
25-09-2020||Delhi||This may be the driest September since 2004, shows IMD data||Delhi has recorded less than 21mm rainfall this month so far, the least amount of rain in September since 2004, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. In September 2004, 3mm rain was recorded in Delhi. In September 2015, the city recorded 22mm rain. The average normal monthly rainfall for September is 129.8mm.This year, the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded only three days of rain on September 5, 6 and 8. According to IMD, monsoon is likely to begin withdrawing from Monday — a week later than the normal date. The monsoon season will officially end on September 30.  “While the average monthly rainfall considered normal for September is around 129.8 mm, the three days of rain this September accounted for 20.9 mm, which shows a huge deficit. This time, the two major factors responsible for triggering rain --- western disturbance and low-pressure system close to Delhi --- were missing. The monsoon trough remained largely in the Himalayan foothills and did not reach closer to Delhi. Even on the three days when some rainfall was recorded, the system was weak and not enough to cover up the deficit for this month,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC). He said it may cloudy over the next two days but there is no weather system that can induce rain in Delhi. “We are closely monitoring the withdrawal of monsoon. In the north-west region, it starts withdrawing from west Rajasthan and then from Delhi. It is expected to withdraw over the next few days,” said Srivastava. The normal date for the beginning of the monsoon’s withdrawal from north-west India is September 17, and October 15 for the complete withdrawal from the country, according to the new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates issued by IMD in April this year. Until last year, the normal date for commencement of withdrawal was September 1 and October 15 for complete withdrawal. The new onset dates are based on monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and withdrawal dates are based on data from 1971 to 2019 analysed by scientists in IMD, Pune.“We are expecting rainfall to stop and moisture to reduce beginning next week because the low-pressure area that is lying over east Uttar Pradesh is likely to move eastwards. We are not seeing the possibility of development of any other system that could bring rain next week to the north-western region,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre.R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD’s National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC) said while overall Delhi has had a normal monsoon this year, September has remained rain-deficient in not just Delhi but many other parts of northwest India, including Jammu and Kashmir. “This month, the low-pressure system did not move beyond Madhya Pradesh, which otherwise goes to Punjab and Rajasthan and then moves towards Delhi. Also, there was no disturbance to pull the low-pressure system forward. When these two factors interact, it brings rain, which was absent this September,” said Jenamani. This year so far, Delhi (from June 1- September 24) has received 467.7 mm rain -- a 19% deficit, according to weather department officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/this-may-be-the-driest-september-since-2004-shows-imd-data/story-z5ORBwmbWNltpOyx7CQeRP.html

Qadri had been suspended from the HC Bar Association two years back owing to his public utterances against the Bar. He had also started a separate lawyers’ group. He had sought for his suspension to be revoked in September this year after Bar Association president Mian Qayoom was released from detention. However, his application was turned down by the Bar. Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah condemned Qadri’s murder. “The assassination of Babar Qadri is tragic and I unequivocally condemn it. The sense of tragedy is all the more because he warned of the threat,” Abdullah wrote on Twitter.“Mournings are a constant feature in every Kashmiri’s life. Vehemently condemn the assassination of Babar Qadri,” wrote PDP on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmiri-lawyer-shot-dead-in-srinagar-by-unidentified-gunmen/story-GH3NyZw9f3PsegQBIvAGbI.html
25-09-2020||Pune||Patient goes ‘missing’ from jumbo Covid facility in Pune; kin stage protest||PUNE: Even after several measures and change of guard at Pune’s jumbo facility, controversies have refused to die. The latest is about a protest staged outside the facility on Thursday by a 33-year-old woman patient’s family members who claim that she has allegedly gone missing since her admission in the Covid care centre. The woman was admitted to the 500-bed facility built on the grounds of College of Engineering, Pune, on August 29, according to her parents. “The patient was discharged. Once she left the centre, we have no idea where she went,” said Vikram Kumar, Pune municipal commissioner. “Sassoon General Hospital had advised us to send her here on August 29. Ambulance came to our house and took her. Next day, I got a call saying she was misbehaving and not cooperating and I was asked to take her back home. So, I reached the hospital. After a few hours, they told me that she will be kept for 14 days and that I should pick her up on September 13. When I got here on September 13, she was nowhere to be found,” said missing woman’s mother. The parents filed a missing person case at Shivajinagar police station on September 14. “The deputy commissioner has assured us access to the CCTV camera footage of the hospital. We have also sought information from Sassoon hospital about the woman’s stay,” said inspector (crime) Manisha Zende of Shivajinagar police station. The missing woman lives at home with her parents after getting divorced from her husband. She has a minor son. “I called the hospital on the night of September 13 and asked them to show us her bed. They video called me and showed us an empty bed. The last record of the bed was that of a man. Since then, we have had multiple stories narrated to us, like she left on September 1, one doctor who recognised my aunt said she was discharged on September 8, and today (Thursday), my aunt was told that she was discharged on September 5,” said paternal cousin of the missing woman. Hospital officials are citing changed administration for the missing information. During the first week of September, television journalist Pandurang Raykar’s death at jumbo Covid facility after he failed to get cardiac ambulance raised questions over the mismanagement at the facility. Many relatives of patients came forward with complaints about the way jumbo facility was run, prompting district administration to change the operating agency. After changing the agency, administration claimed that management of jumbo facility has improved though the latest case of missing woman has once again raised questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jumbo-hospital-once-again-in-focus-as-patient-goes-missing/story-zrlE9nDayVa2eCCnwALolI.html
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Owner, three labourers die in Dera Bassi building collapse||Four people, including the owner, died after a commercial building under construction collapsed in Meera Milli Mohalla, Dera Bassi, on Thursday morning. The bodies of three labourers were recovered from the debris in a three-hour rescue operation, while the owner, Haridev Singh, 72, succumbed to his injuries at Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh.The labourers were identified as Gopi Chand, 60; Raju, 46; and Ramesh Sardara, 45, all migrants hailing from Bihar.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has ordered a magisterial inquiry to be conducted and closed by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Kuldeep Bawa within 10 days. Dayalan said according to the on-the-spot report by the Dera Bassi municipal council building inspector, the collapse appeared to have been caused due to old material and faulty sanitary fittings used in construction, while structure stability and load-bearing capacity were also ignored.Action will be taken after the inquiry report, he added.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has announced ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased.“District Administration along with @NDRFHQ team reached the spot but unfortunately, all 4 people trapped had succumbed to injuries,” Singh said on Twitter.Showroom came crumbling down at 9.30amPolice said Haridev Singh was getting the ground and first floors constructed of his 100 X16 square feet showroom. The showroom was coming up after demolishing old houses. While Singh and three labourers were on site, three other labourers were working around the building, when the structure suddenly caved in around 9.30am, trapping the four men inside.Singh and Ramesh were rescued within the first hour, but the latter had already died, while Singh was rushed to GMCH-32. Over an hour later, a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team recovered the lifeless bodies of Gopi and Raju. Singh died at the hospital during treatment.

Only those having dues less than Rs50 lakh can take benefit of the scheme. The municipal corporation imposes a two per cent fine every month on the due amount after the stipulated period.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, said, “Last year due to rains and this year due to Covid-19, many citizens have not been able to repay the property tax. The incomes have also reduced this year. Hence, it was decided to introduce the amnesty scheme for defaulters. All the parties supported the proposal. It is applicable for all residential, commercial and educational institutes. A total of 80 per cent fine would be waived off under the amnesty scheme.”“It is expected that around Rs1,000 crore revenue would be generated through the amnesty scheme in the next two months. It is necessary to give relief to the citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic,” added Rasne.Congress leader Aba Bagul, said, “We earlier opposed giving relief in the due amount, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accepted a cap of Rs50 lakh and we welcome the decision. Those having dues more than Rs1 crore are not small players and we do not want to waive off money for big defaulters.”Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar, said, “We support giving relief to citizens. It was unanimously decided to bring in a cap of Rs50 lakh.”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member Mahendra Pathare, said, “It was the party’s stand since day one that there should not be any relief to big defaulters and hence, we supported the cap of Rs50 lakh for amnesty scheme.”Relief for residentsAs per the scheme, if tax defaulters repay the amount between October 2 and November 30, they will be eligible for 80 per cent relief in the fine amount. The scheme will be executed between October 2 and November 30. Those having dues less than Rs50 lakh can take benefit of the scheme. Ruling BJP wanted to execute the scheme for all the defaulters who have dues worth Rs1 crore, but after opposition from Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, it was decided to that the scheme will be only for defaulters below Rs50 lakh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-announces-amnesty-scheme-for-property-tax-defaulters/story-sYEinWIAuBb4hrAOR1ni1L.html
25-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut’s Rs 2 crore case against BMC to be heard today||Kangana Ranaut’s petition against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for demolishing portions of her bungalow will be heard by the Bombay High Court from Friday afternoon, the court ruled on Thursday. The actor had sued the municipal corporation and its officials, claiming Rs 2 crore in compensation for the demolition that she alleged was an outcome of malice, and not implementation of the civic body’s rules.Shiv Sena lawmaker and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut and the BMC’s Bhagyawant Late, the civic body’s designated officer for H-West ward, who were made parties in the case on the court’s directions have been told to file their response by the time their turn comes at the hearings. Ranaut’s lawyer has also been told to make corrections in the petition.Sanjay Raut and Bhagyawant Late had requested the court for more time. The bench contrasted the request for more time to the hurry with which they had gone ahead to demolish parts of the actor’s building in Mumbai’s plush Bandra area. She had purchased the building for Rs 200 crore in 2017. It houses the office of Manikarnika Films Private Limited.“We cannot leave the demolished house the way it is. You need more time here but otherwise you are fast,” the court comprising justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla observed.A demolition team of the Shiv Sena-controlled BMC had demolished parts of an office owned by Kangana Ranaut on September 9 that they contended had been built in violation of the rules. Ranaut had rushed to the high court to seek relief but by the time the court completed its hearing and stayed the demolition, the damage had been done.The court had then noted that the manner in which the BMC had rushed to demolish parts of the building within 24 hours of the notice did not “appear to be bonafide (in good faith) and smacks of malafide (dishonest intentions)”.The demolition also escalated a war of words between Ranaut and the Sena-led Maharashtra government leaders.In her petition, Kangana Ranaut has asked the judges to rule on her claim for Rs 2 crore as compensation. She said the BMC had damaged nearly 40% of her bungalow and other movable assets.She has also underscored that the BMC had failed to prove its allegations as it had not attached any photographs, which should have been taken when the designated officer inspected Ranaut’s property on September 7. She said that this pointed to high-handed action by BMC.The actor has said that the BMC demolished her building as soon as the 24-hour deadline expired but gave designer Manish Malhotra, who was issued a notice on the same day, seven days to respond.The confrontation between Kangana Ranaut and the Maharashtra government is seen to be linked to her criticism of the Mumbai police and the state’s handling of investigations into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June. The controversy took a larger political tone after the Congress accused her of carrying forward the Bharatiya Janata Party political agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-s-rs-2-crore-case-against-bmc-to-be-heard-on-friday/story-AGOSPtDBCV2OKbRpuR5MqN.html
25-09-2020||World||US proposes rule to cut stay for foreign students, journalists||The Trump administration has proposed a new rule to limit to four years the period of stay for non-immigrant international students and foreign media representatives.It plans to cut the duration further to two years for those from certain countries under the F, J and I category visas, used for students, exchange visitors and media representatives, respectively.Foreigners on these visas can currently stay for “duration of status”, or the period of course in case of students, and employment in case of media representatives. This applies also to the dependents of principal visa holders.The proposed rule, published by the department of homeland security, will be open for comments for 30 days. But it was not clear when it will go into effect. President Donald Trump has only a few months to finalise the rule by January 2021, and longer if he is re-elected. If he loses the November 3 election to Joe Biden, the Democrat will be under no obligation to implement it.The duration of stay can be extended either by filing for extension with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or by going back to their countries of origin for fresh visas.The two-year rule will apply to people from countries that are either on state department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism or who have an overstay rate of over 10%.“The significant increase in the volume of F academic students, J exchange visitors, and I foreign information media representatives poses a challenge to the Department’s ability to monitor and oversee these categories of non-immigrants while they are in the United States,” the notice said.The department added it is “concerned about the integrity of the programmes and a potential for increased risk to national security” from people on these visas.There are an estimated 200,000 Indian students in the US, which has admitted an estimated 1 million international students every year. Together, they have generated around $41 billion’s worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-rule-to-cut-stay-for-foreign-students-journalists/story-9KuaVBWLbV4xofdjagbVHP.html

25-09-2020||World||Covid-19 can’t crush human rights, declares UN gathering||In a diminished spotlight because of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading human rights defenders on Friday urged people in these fractured times to connect through politics — and vote, too.“In many places around the world, participation is being denied and civic space is being crushed,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on the sidelines of the annual UN gathering of world leaders, this year held online.People must take part in the decisions that affect their lives, he said, noting “new heights” of inequalities and and warning: “The window to address climate change is almost shut.”In the cautious language of diplomacy, no names were named, no governments called out. But around the world, the crack of batons and the tang of pepper spray have been common as some authorities are accused of using the cover of Covid-19 restrictions to commit abuses and limit free speech.In Venezuela, advocates said quarantine was used to erode civil liberties. In Kenya, watchdogs said police enforcing curfew beat or shot dead civilians including a 13-year-old boy.People must push back even in this socially distanced world, speakers said.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned of a “crisis of governance” and a marginalization of voices that she said will only deepen grievances and harm all of society.“We are witnessing an erosion of public trust in institutions and traditional politics,” said Eamon Gilmore, the European Union’s special representative for human rights.Young people in particular are feeling increasingly insecure, he said. Economies are crumbling in the pandemic, erasing job opportunities, and millions of students are unable to return to school.Speaking up for youth, the founder of Action for Justice and Human Rights in Liberia, Satta Sheriff, told the gathering that people like her should not be seen as simply waiting for an empty seat at the table.Youth in the West African nation successfully pressed the government to declare rape a national emergency after days of peaceful protests, she said. Despite that win, access to decision-making spaces remains limited for youth, who face the “stereotype of constantly being labeled troublemakers,” she said.Such frustration is especially potent in Africa, with the world’s youngest population and a median age of 19. The continent’s population is expected to double by 2050, and already a small corps of young opposition leaders in places like Uganda is challenging heads of state who have spent years, even decades, in power.The Covid-19 pandemic is a crucial chance for governments to fight the urge to impose repressive measures and instead win the trust of citizens that’s key to combating the spread of the virus, speakers said.“It’s the good governance” that has kept Latvia’s confirmed virus case rate relatively low compared to the rest of Europe, said the country’s ambassador to the UN, Andrejs Pildegovics. South Korea’s ambassador, Cho Hyun, agreed, citing people’s voluntary wearing of face masks in his country’s relative success in containing the virus.As scores of heads of state this week are making urgent calls to band together to fight the crises of Covid-19, Friday’s speakers on human rights stressed that governments must open the political space for everyone.As the global toll closed in on 1 million deaths, the UK’s minister for human rights, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, reminded listeners: “It’s only over when it’s over for all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-can-t-crush-human-rights-declares-un-gathering/story-PzYVK69OIQVw3J4yFHcSUK.html
25-09-2020||World||2 charged in deadly Covid-19 outbreak at Massachusetts veterans’ home||Two people were indicted for their alleged role in a COVID-19 outbreak at a Massachusetts veterans’ home that contributed to the deaths of at least 76 residents, the state’s attorney general announced on Friday. A grand jury on Thursday indicted superintendent Bennett Walsh and David Clinton, the former medical director of the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, on charges of criminal neglect related to their work at the facility. “We allege that the actions of these defendants during the COVID-19 outbreak at the facility put veterans at higher risk of infection and death and warrant criminal charges,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. Healey said the charges stem from the two individuals’ roles in decision-making at the home that led to the consolidation of two dementia units into one. The move placed symptomatic residents, including some who had tested positive for the coronavirus, and asymptomatic residents in close proximity, “increasing the exposure of asymptomatic veterans to the virus,” officials said. “We believe this is the first criminal case in the country brought against those involved in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Healey told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-charged-in-deadly-covid-19-outbreak-at-massachusetts-veterans-home/story-AaGVlbidBC03IFx2zsTZDI.html

Tariq Ahmad, foreign office minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth, said in a statement on China at the UN Human Rights Council that there is “compelling evidence of systemic human rights violations in Xinjiang”. On Hong Kong, Ahmad described the UK’s deep concerns about the “direct threat” that Beijing’s new National Security Law allegedly represents to rights and freedoms in the Special Administrative Region, the foreign office said.Ahmad said: “(Of) grave concern, in Xinjiang, there is compelling evidence – including from the Chinese authorities’ own documents – of systematic human rights violations. Culture and religion are severely restricted, and we have seen credible reports of forced labour and forced birth control. Staggeringly, up to 1.8 million people have been detained without trial”.He added: “Across the country, we also remain seriously concerned about the pressure on media freedom…(We) call on China to uphold the rights and freedoms in the Joint Declaration, to respect the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, allow unfettered access to Xinjiang and to release all those who are arbitrarily detained”.Ahmad said Beijing’s imposition of the National Security Law amounts to a serious breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration, allegedly violating Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and directly threatens rights and freedoms.“The National Security Law is being implemented with the apparent intention to eliminate dissent. It allows prosecution of certain cases in mainland China, a jurisdiction where defendants are often held for long periods without charge or access to legal counsel, and where we have concerns about judicial independence, due process, and reports of torture”, he told the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-asks-china-to-allow-un-unfettered-access-to-xinjiang/story-gQdBUUq0D68hiG9HSlgRII.html
25-09-2020||World||Covid-19: London is at very worrying tipping point, says mayor||London mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday said the British capital is at a “very worrying tipping point’ as officials revealed that it is being placed on the countrywide Covid-19 ‘watchlist’ following a rise in infections.New local lockdowns were announced in Cardiff and Swansea, amid growing concerns over an exponential rise in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week announced more curbs short of a full national lockdown, urging people to take basic precautions.Khan said: “London is at a very worrying tipping point right now. We’re seeing a sharp rise in 111 calls (for medical care), hospital admissions and patients in ICU. The near-collapse of test and trace and the resurgence of the virus means new measures to slow its spread were absolutely necessary”.“Testing capacity was diverted away from London in the last two weeks to other national hotspots…The lack of testing capacity is totally unacceptable and it is why London has been added to the government’s coronavirus watchlist as an area of concern”, he added.New daily cases in London are below 500, but it has been added to the list of places of concern. The daily new cases in the UK rose to 6,634 on Thursday evening, nearing the daily rise recorded in April and May. There were 40 deaths in the last 24 hours.London Councils, representing all 32 boroughs, said London is being placed on the national Covid-19 watchlist. No new measures were being taken, but London’s entry on the list was a “stark reminder that now is time for all Londoners to pull together and take action to keep themselves, their families and their communities safe, and to ensure that London’s economy is protected”, it said in a statement.“There are no additional measures at this stage but it is welcome that the city’s testing capacity is boosted so that Londoners have timely access to Covid-19 tests and the government must ensure that this is sustained from now on. We ask all Londoners to work together and abide by the national restrictions announced on Tuesday”, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-is-at-very-worrying-tipping-point-says-mayor/story-mBiUOEarRInFkQ6D8aTjcI.html
25-09-2020||World||Highly effective coronavirus antibodies identified, may lead to passive Covid-19 vaccine||Scientists have identified highly effective antibodies against the novel coronavirus, which they say can lead to the development of a passive vaccination for COVID-19.Unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time. However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, the researchers said.The research, published in the journal Cell, also shows that some SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bind to tissue samples from various organs, which could potentially trigger undesired side effects.The scientists at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin isolated almost 600 different antibodies from the blood of individuals who had overcome COVID-19, the disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2.By means of laboratory tests, they were able to narrow this number down to a few antibodies that were particularly effective at binding to the virus. The researchers then produced these antibodies artificially using cell cultures.The so-called neutralising antibodies bind to the virus, as crystallographic analysis reveals, and thus prevent the pathogen from entering cells and reproducing, they said.In addition, virus recognition by antibodies helps immune cells to eliminate the pathogen. Studies in hamsters -- which, like humans, are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 -- confirmed the high efficacy of the selected antibodies.“If the antibodies were given after an infection, the hamsters developed mild disease symptoms at most. If the antibodies were applied preventively -- before infection -- the animals did not get sick,” said Jakob Kreye, coordinator of the research project.The researchers noted that treating infectious diseases with antibodies has a long history.For COVID-19, this approach is also being investigated through the administration of plasma derived from the blood of recovered patients. With the plasma, antibodies of donors are transferred, they said.“Ideally, the most effective antibody is produced in a controlled manner on an industrial scale and in constant quality. This is the goal we are pursuing,” said Momsen Reincke, first author of the research.“Three of our antibodies are particularly promising for clinical development,” explained Harald Pruss, a research group leader at the DZNE and also a senior physician at Charite – Universitatsmedizin Berlin.“Using these antibodies, we have started to develop a passive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2,” Pruss said.In addition to the treatment of patients, preventive protection of healthy individuals who have had contact with infected persons is also a potential application, the researchers said. How long the protection lasts will have to be investigated in clinical studies, they said.“This is because, unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time,” Pruss said. In general, the protection provided by a passive vaccination is less persistent than that provided by an active vaccination, the researchers said.However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, they said.“It would be best if both options were available so that a flexible response could be made depending on the situation,” Pruss added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-effective-coronavirus-antibodies-identified-may-lead-to-passive-covid-19-vaccine/story-cEENdXizjGZQJJMta69VEO.html

The world doesn’t need lessons on human rights from a country which has been known as nursery and epicentre of terrorism,” he said, according to ANI.‘Pakistan exploited our youth, ordered killing of fellow Kashmiris’: EFSAS directorKumar also highlighted the atrocities Balochs have to suffer in Pakistan. “Enforced disappearances, state violence and forced mass displacements, harassment, extrajudicial killings, army operations, torture, kill-and-dumps, torture camps, detention centres, military camps are regular features in Balochistan,” he said, according to ANI.The Free Balochistan Movement (FBM) issued a statement on September 20, saying Pakistan continues to promote unhindered religious extremism in occupied areas of Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to ANI. India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism recordThe organisation’s spokesperson Gamshaad Baloch said that on September 13, the armed wing of Jamaat-e-Islami attacked Baloch and Sindhi human rights activists who were peacefully protesting against the disappearances of their loved ones. FBM believes that Pakistan has adopted the policy of religious extremism, ANI reported citing its statement said.Kumar also pointed out that in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the neighbouring country has driven the original Kashmiris out. He said Pakistan is attempting to change the demography of the region by driving its real inhabitants out.He also pointed out that since 1947 the percentage of minorities has decreased in Pakistan. He said, “It’s a matter of great concern that the population of religious minorities in Pak which was 23% in 1947 has reduced to an insignificant number. In PoK, Pakistan has affected demographic change by reducing & driving real Kashmiris out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-need-lessons-on-human-rights-from-nation-which-nurtures-terror-india/story-9EHgzai8DfWRPc8psQWKvL.html

Those who subscribed to the Indian Constitution, were specifically targeted”, said Junaid.He added, “Today, led by its Foreign Minister, Pakistan is demanding a return of the autonomy that Jammu & Kashmir had earlier enjoyed under the Indian Constitution. The same Constitution against which, it started this proxy war in which Kashmiris were massacred”.India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism record“Will Pakistan be allowed to get away just like that?”, he questioned.Junaid told the United Nations, “Even after it ruptured our social fabric, ordered the killing of thousands of my fellow Kashmiris, exploited our youth as pawns in its proxy war, and was majorly responsible for getting our autonomy diluted through unleashing its terror-policy?”“I humbly urge this Council to summon the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for an audit.

It changes in an instant.” In the years since the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, war-torn Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants hoping to get to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route. At least 20,000 people have died in those waters since 2014, according to the IOM.Those who survived Friday’s disaster were taken to the Tripoli port, where they received medical care for their burns, a common consequence of leaked engine fuel mixing with saltwater, said Safa Msehli, an IOM spokeswoman.Libyan authorities took the survivors to the Zliten detention center, run by the Tripoli-based government’s Interior Ministry. Migrants rescued at sea and returned to Libya routinely land in detention centers notorious for torture, extortion and abuse. Amnesty International revealed in a report Thursday that thousands of migrants have been forcibly disappeared from unofficial militia-run detention centers.The shipwreck, the second to be recorded by the UN in as many weeks, “signals the need now more than ever for state-led search and rescue capacity to be redeployed and the need to support NGO vessels operating in a vacuum,” said Msehli.Since 2017, European countries, particularly Italy, have delegated most search-and-rescue responsibility to the Libyan Coast Guard, which intercepts migrant boats before they can reach European waters. Activists have lamented that European authorities are increasingly blocking the work of nongovernmental rescue organisations that patrol the Mediterranean and seek to disembark at European ports.(AP) RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-at-least-16-drown-in-migrant-shipwreck-off-libya-coast/story-cYeDMFpoxozHCDSQ8NqOEO.html
25-09-2020||World||‘You are good people:’ Alexei Navalny thanks Russian pilots, medics||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in Germany recovering from what authorities there determined to be nerve agent poisoning, thanked Russian pilots and paramedics for acting quickly after he fell into a coma on a flight from Siberia.Navalny, who collapsed on a plane to Moscow on August 20 and spent nearly three weeks in a coma, said in an Instagram post on Friday that pilots “quickly landed the plane in Omsk” and medical workers at the airport “jammed a dose of atropine” into him, immediately recognizing “a toxic poisoning.”“Thank you, unknown good-hearted friends. You are good people,” the 44-year-old politician wrote under a photo of him hugging his wife Yulia.After 48 hours in a hospital in Omsk, where Russian doctors said they found no trace of any poisoning, Navalny was transferred to the Charite hospital in Berlin. German chemical weapons experts determined that he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.Navalny, a longtime foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was discharged from the hospital earlier this week. Charite hospital said that based on Navalny’s progress, physicians believe a “complete recovery is possible.”Russian authorities have been resisting the international pressure to launch a criminal investigation, saying no trace of poisonous substances has been found in Navalny’s system and demanding Germany, France and Sweden to share their findings.The Russian delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons sent a note to Germany on Wednesday, requesting “comprehensive information on the so-called Navalny case,” including “test results, biological materials and other clinical samples” to be provided within 10 days.German government spokeswoman Martina Fietz confirmed Friday that the Germany mission to the OPCW received the note. The mission will respond in keeping with rules that provide for a 10-day deadline, Fietz said.“But let me repeat again what we have said here repeatedly in the past: Russia already has everything necessary to be able to conduct investigations itself,” Fietz added. She once again pointed out that German, Swedish and French labs have confirmed that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, and that the OPCW has taken samples.Navalny has remained in Germany to undergo rehabilitation after being released from the hospital, which may take weeks, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said Thursday. Nevertheless, he planned to return to Russia at some point, according to his allies.Navalny’s team blamed the Kremlin for the poisoning, claims which officials brushed off.In Friday’s Instagram post, the politician said that “a series of happy coincidences and sharp actions” by pilots and medical workers sabotaged what Navalny said he thought may have been “the plan of the killers.”“I was supposed to fall sick 20 minutes after takeoff, and in another 15 minutes lose consciousness. There was guaranteed to be no access to medical help and in another hour I would continue travelling in a black plastic bag on the last row of seats, scaring all passengers going to the bathroom,” the politician wrote.“Everything that happened next was very dramatic and deserves a separate story, but there would have been nothing to tell if not for these guys.”___Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-are-good-people-alexei-navalny-thanks-russian-pilots-medics/story-UEWdVd41iocaaxlr49gl7K.html
25-09-2020||World||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is first woman to lie in state at US Capitol||Commemorations are set to begin Friday honoring the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the US Capitol, the first woman in American history to lie in state at the domed building, capping days of commemoration of her extraordinary life.Mourners are paying tribute to Ginsburg, who died last week at age 87, as her casket was on public view at the court’s iconic steps. It made the short procession across the street Friday morning for the private Capitol ceremony with elected officials, family and other invited guests amid coronavirus social distancing restrictions.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived, walked quietly through the Capitol hallway, and running mate vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris is also attending. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is planning to welcome Ginsburg’s casket as the Capitol under turmoil as President Donald Trump’s prepares to announce a conservative nominee to replace the liberal icon weeks before the election.Speaking ahead of the event, Pelosi told CBS that Americans need to know what’s at stake for the “rush” to confirm Ginsburg’s replacement.The politics of the moment, in a tense election year, rippled throughout the celebrations this week of Ginsburg’s life and career. But the ceremony is expected to be a celebration and honoring of her life and work, with musical selections from one of Ginsburg’s favorite opera singers, mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves.Several member of Congress, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a former presidential contender are attending. Members of the House and Senate who are not invited to the ceremony because of space limitations imposed by the coronavirus pandemic will be able to pay their respects before a motorcade carrying Ginsburg’s casket departs the Capitol early afternoon.The honor of lying in state has been accorded fewer than three dozen times, mostly to presidents, vice presidents, and members of Congress. Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon, was the most recent person to lie in state following his death in July. Henry Clay, the Kentucky lawmaker who served as Speaker of the House and also was a senator, was the first in 1852. Rosa Parks — a private citizen, not a government official — is the only woman who has lain in honor at the Capitol.Ginsburg has lain in repose for two days at the Supreme Court, where thousands of people paid their respects, including President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Thursday. Spectators booed and chanted “vote him out” as the president, who wore a mask, stood silently near Ginsburg’s casket at the top of the court’s front steps.Trump plans to announce his nomination Saturday of a woman to take Ginsburg’s place on the high court, where she served for 27 years and was the leader of the liberal justices.Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, will be buried next week in Arlington National Cemetery beside her husband, Martin, who died in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-is-first-woman-to-lie-in-state-at-us-capitol/story-MuHUUQj4zZ9IFS8v3CR4sM.html
25-09-2020||World||First man cured of HIV infection now has terminal cancer||Timothy Ray Brown, the first person known to have been cured of HIV infection, says he is now terminally ill from a recurrence of the cancer that prompted his historic treatment 12 years ago.Brown, dubbed “the Berlin patient” because of where he lived at the time, had a transplant from a donor with a rare, natural resistance to the AIDS virus. For years, that was thought to have cured his leukemia and his HIV infection, and he still shows no signs of HIV.But in an interview with The Associated Press, Brown said his cancer returned last year and has spread widely. He’s receiving hospice care where he now lives in Palm Springs, California.“I’m still glad that I had it,” Brown said of his transplant.“It opened up doors that weren’t there before” and inspired scientists to work harder to find a cure, which many had begun to think was not possible, the 54-year-old said Thursday.“Timothy proved that HIV can be cured, but that’s not what inspires me about him,” said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has worked with Brown to further research toward a cure.“We took pieces of his gut, we took pieces of his lymph nodes. Every time he was asked to do something, he showed up with amazing grace,” Deeks said.Brown was an American working as a translator in Berlin in the 1990s when he learned he had HIV. In 2006, he was diagnosed with leukemia.Dr. Gero Huetter, a blood cancer expert at the University of Berlin, believed that a marrow transplant was Brown’s best chance of beating the leukemia. He wondered, could he also cure Brown’s other life-threatening disease by using a donor with a gene mutation that provides natural resistance to the AIDS virus?Donors like these are very rare and transplants are risky. Doctors have to destroy the patient’s diseased immune system with chemotherapy and radiation, then transplant the donor’s cells and hope they develop into a new immune system for the recipient.Brown’s first transplant in 2007 was only partly successful: His HIV seemed to be gone but his leukemia was not. He had a second transplant from the same donor in March 2008 and that one seemed to work.Since then, Brown has repeatedly tested negative for HIV and has frequently appeared at AIDS conferences where cure research is discussed.“He’s been like an ambassador of hope,” said Brown’s partner, Tim Hoeffgen.A second man, Adam Castillejo -- called “the London patient” until he revealed his identity earlier this year -- also is believed to have been cured by a transplant similar to Brown’s in 2016.But donors like these are scarce and the procedure is too risky to be widely used.Scientists have been testing gene therapy and other ways to try to get the effect of the favorable gene mutation without having to do a transplant. At an AIDS conference in July, researchers said they may have achieved a long-term remission in a Brazil man by using a powerful combination of drugs meant to flush dormant HIV from his body.Mark King, a Baltimore man who writes a blog for people with HIV, said he spoke with Brown earlier this week and is grateful for what Brown has contributed to AIDS research.“It is unfathomable what value he has been to the world as a subject of science. And yet this is also a human being who is a kind, humble guy who certainly never asked for the spotlight,” King said. “I think the world of him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-man-cured-of-hiv-infection-now-has-terminal-cancer/story-Mu5P7NilrdfSB7wiHJNpYN.html
25-09-2020||World||Kim Jong Un apologizes to Seoul after killing South Korean to curb Covid-19 spread||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un apologised on Friday for the shooting death of a South Korean man to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the South’s national security adviser said, as public and political outrage over the killing grew.The apology came in a letter from the North’s United Front Department, which handles cross-border ties, to South Korean President Moon Jae-in a day after South Korean officials said the North’s soldiers killed the man, doused his body in fuel and set it on fire. The rare conciliatory message from the North Korean leader came as Moon faced intense political fallout over the incident, which coincided with a renewed push by him for engagement with North Korea.“Chairman Kim Jong Un asked to convey his feeling that he is greatly sorry that an unexpected unsavoury incident occurred in our waters which hugely disappointed President Moon Jae-in and compatriots in the South,” the adviser, Suh Hoon, told reporters. Suh said the letter was a response to requests for an explanation for the incident and included a promise to prevent any recurrence. North Korea expressed hope the incident would not undermine recent efforts to foster trust, Suh said, adding Moon and Kim had exchanged letters this month. Moon praised Kim’s “strong resolve to save lives” and steer anti-virus and flood recovery work in his Sept. 8 letter, his office said. In a Sept. 12 reply, Kim said Moon would win the battle against the coronavirus and “good things” would happen later.The leaders have held three summits and signed pacts to ease tension since 2018, but relations have soured since the collapse last year of a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, at which Moon had offered to mediate. Defection or accident?The shooting of the man, a fisheries official who had gone missing this week, shocked South Koreans and sparked a barrage of criticism from the opposition and the public, prompting an unusually tough response from Moon, who called it “unpardonable”.Critics accused Moon of failing to save a citizen’s life while being soft on North Korea, saying the military did not attempt to save him despite spotting him six hours before he was shot dead.South Korean officials said the man has run up debt and likely sought to defect to the North. But his brother refuted that, saying he had just got a new boat and must have had some sort of accident.“Not everyone who has debts wants to go to the North,” the brother, Lee Rae-jin, said on social media. “What the military was doing when he was floating around our waters for almost a day?” The North’s soldiers fired more than 10 shots at the man after he tried to flee without revealing his identity, Suh said, citing the letter. But the North Korean side denied burning his body, saying the soldiers had burned a floatation device he was using in line with their anti-virus procedures, Suh said.Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the apology showed Kim did not want the incident to escalate but it remained highly contentious in the South.“The letter showed Kim’s willingness to quickly resolve the situation but publicly it’s a very sensitive matter,” Yang said.The shooting came a day after Moon proposed a new initiative including North Korea to the U.N. General Assembly and called for a formal termination of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an armistice, a long-standing North Korean demand.But opposition politicians derided Moon’s olive branch.“Now is not the time to speak of ending the war,” said Thae Young-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who is now an opposition lawmaker. He called for a formal investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-apologizes-to-seoul-after-killing-south-korean-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-RIMQNwH5JbkPa8Jdi46jeL.html
25-09-2020||World||China’s Covid-19 vaccine shows promise in animal test: All you need to know||Marking progress in the race to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease, the experimental candidate by China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals has made a breakthrough and has been labelled as safe and capable of triggering immune responses in animal testing, researchers have said.The result of the study on monkeys comes months after Clover began an early stage human trial in Australia in June, as the coronavirus pandemic has killed nearly 1 million people across the globe.Here is all you need to know about China’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate:- The vaccine candidate, called S-Trimmer, is among the nine players competing in the global race in the final stage of efficacy and safety clinical trials.- S-Trimmer, China’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, was tested on monkeys earlier this year. It uses adjuvants, ingredients that could boost immune responses from Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline and US’ Dynavax Technologies.- Researchers have said that two doses of S-Trimmer with the GSK’s adjuvant which induced antibody levels in monkeys were higher than those seen in blood samples of patients who have recovered from the viral infection.- In a promising development, the vaccine candidate did not trigger a disease enhancement effect when it was tested in monkeys. Stirring a reverse effect, experts around the world have feared that the Covid-19 vaccines guaranteeing immunity can worsen the disease instead of preventing the patients’ sickness.- The study states that the vaccinated monkeys appeared to be protected from weight loss, fever and organ damage when challenged with the virus after inoculation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-in-animal-test-all-you-need-to-know/story-sybSrcxpDL7Qmy7lFuA6VL.html
25-09-2020||World||China aims to make 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses a year||China claimed on Friday that the World Health Organization (WHO) had conveyed its support for using experimental Covid-19 vaccines on high-risk groups during clinical trials in June.The National Health commission (NHC) also said that China’s annual production capacity of vaccines is expected to reach 610 million doses by end of this year and is forecast to reach 1 billion doses per year by 2021.China had informed the WHO about inoculating high-risk groups on June 29, Zheng Zhongwei, director-general of NHC’s Development Centre for Medical Science and Technology said at a press conference.State media reported that China had approved the plan on June 24 and authorised emergency use of the vaccines on July 22.The NHC had argued that under the Chinese vaccine management law, emergency vaccines were allowed to be used on certain people at high risk of contracting the disease, such as medical workers, frontline pandemic control workers and customs workers.“After the approval, on June 29, we made a communication with the relevant representatives of the WHO Office in China, and obtained support and understanding from WHO,” Zheng said.High-risk groups also include workers at border ports, agricultural and sideline products, and frozen food markets besides the elderly, pregnant women, children, and patients with underlying diseases.Speaking at the same press conference, Wu Yuanbin, director of the Department of Science and Technology for Social Development of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said four new coronavirus vaccines had entered phase 3 clinical trials.Wu said that currently 11 new coronavirus vaccines in China had entered clinical trials. Four vaccines entered Phase 3 clinical trials, of which three are inactivated vaccines and one an adenovirus vector vaccine. The phase-3 clinical trials are being conducted in several countries in the Middle East, South America, and Southeast Asia.Meanwhile, two stevedores in east China’s port city of Qingdao were reported as asymptomatic Covid-19 cases on Thursday.The workers aged 40 and 45 had both handled imported frozen seafood on September 19. Nucleic acid tests revealed they were positive for novel coronavirus on Thursday. So far, 132 close contacts have been tracked and put under quarantine, official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-aims-to-make-1-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-a-year/story-Qq0oo18WRJ6NMzXFPfvvWI.html
25-09-2020||World||In despair, protesters take to streets for Breonna Taylor||Some of them raised their fists and called out “Black lives matter!” Others tended to the letters, flowers and signs grouped together in a square in downtown Louisville. All of them said her name: Breonna Taylor.People dismayed that the officers who shot the Black woman in her apartment during a drug raid last March wouldn’t be charged with her death vowed to persist in their fight for justice. The big question for a town torn apart by Taylor’s death and the larger issue of racism in America was how to move forward.Many turned to the streets — as they did in several US cities — to call for reforms to combat racist policing.“We’ve got to take it lying down that the law won’t protect us, that they can get away with killing us,” said Lavel White, a regular protester in downtown Louisville who is Black. He was drawn to a march Thursday night because he was devastated by a grand jury’s decision a day earlier not to charge the officers. “If we can’t get justice for Breonna Taylor, can we get justice for anybody?”He was angry that police in riot gear were out in force when protesters had been peaceful as they streamed through the streets of downtown Louisville past a nighttime curfew. Demonstrators also gathered in places like Los Angeles where a vehicle ran through a crowd of protesters, injuring one person. In Portland, Oregon — a city that has seen many protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis — a fire was set at a police union building.Taylor, a Black woman who was an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them, authorities said. He said he didn’t know who was coming in and opened fire in self-defense, wounding one officer. Police entered on a warrant connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.State Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Wednesday that the investigation showed officers acted in self-defense. One officer who has already been fired was charged with firing into a neighboring apartment.The FBI is still investigating whether Taylor’s civil rights were violated. But the burden of proof for such cases is very high, with prosecutors having to prove officers knew they were acting illegally and made a willful decision to cause someone’s death.While there was despair after the decision in Taylor’s case, others saw reasons to hope.Reginique Jones said she’ll keep pressing for increased police accountability and for a statewide ban on “no knock” warrants — the kind issued in the Taylor case, though the state attorney general said the investigation showed police announced themselves before busting into her apartment.“I believe that we are going to get past this,” Jones said as she returned Thursday to the park in downtown Louisville that has been at the center of the protests. “We can still get some justice.”Taylor’s family planned to speak Friday in the park that’s become known as Injustice Square.The case has exposed the divide in the US over bringing justice for Black Americans killed by authorities and the laws that allow officers to be charged, which regularly favor police.Since Taylor’s killing, Louisville has taken some steps to address protesters’ concerns. In addition to the officer who was fired and later charged, three others were put on desk duty. Officials have banned no-knock warrants and hired a Black woman as the permanent police chief — a first for the city.Louisville also agreed to more police reforms as it settled a lawsuit that included $12 million for Taylor’s family. But many have expressed frustration that more has not been done.And so they took to the streets.Louisville police in riot gear barricaded roads and cars honked as the crowd marched past a nighttime curfew. Officers blocked the exits of a church where protesters gathered to avoid arrest for violating the curfew.Several people were detained, including state Rep. Attica Scott, a Louisville Democrat. Scott unveiled legislation recently that would ban the use of no-knock search warrants in Kentucky. The measure, called Breonna’s Law in honor of Taylor, also would require drug and alcohol testing of officers involving in shootings and deadly incidents and require that body cameras be worn during the execution of all search warrants.Police eventually pulled back late Thursday after negotiating with demonstrators to end the protest.At least 24 people were arrested as of 1 a.m. Friday, police said. Authorities alleged the protesters broke windows at a restaurant, damaged city buses, tried to set a fire and threw a flare into the street.Earlier, it got heated between some protesters and a group of 12 to 15 armed white people wearing military-style uniforms, but it didn’t turn physical.The curfew will last through the weekend, and Gov. Andy Beshear called up the National Guard for “limited missions.”Peaceful protests a night earlier gave way to some destruction and violence. Two officers were shot and were expected to recover.Larynzo D. Johnson, 26, was charged and he’s scheduled to be in court Friday. Court records did not list a lawyer for him.In the Louisville square where protesters often gather, Rose Henderson has been looking after the flowers, signs and letters placed at a memorial for Taylor and hopes officials won’t try to remove them.“We’re going to stay out here and hold this place,” Henderson said.___Associated Press writers Rebecca Reynolds Yonker, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Bruce Schreiner and John Minchillo in Louisville, Kentucky; Kevin Freking and Michael Balsamo in Washington; Aaron Morrison in New York; and Haleluya Hadero in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-despair-protesters-take-to-streets-for-breonna-taylor/story-xCnfzWyD3CLRPPx5ZBEFRI.html
25-09-2020||World||US records over 7 million Covid-19 cases, 20% of the world’s total||The number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States topped 7 million - more than 20% of the world’s total - as Midwest states reported spikes in Covid-19 infections in September, according to a Reuters tally.The latest milestone on Thursday comes just days after the nation surpassed over 200,000 Covid-19 deaths, the world’s highest death toll from the virus. Each day, over 700 people die in the United States from Covid-19.California leads the country with over 800,000 total cases, followed by Texas, Florida and New York. All Midwest states except Ohio reported more cases in the past four weeks as compared with the prior four weeks, led by South Dakota and North Dakota. South Dakota had the biggest percentage increase at 166% with 8,129 new cases, while North Dakota’s new cases doubled to 8,752 as compared to 4,243 during the same time in August.Many cases in those two states have been linked to the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that annually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.According to a Reuters analysis, positive cases rose in half of the 50 US states this month. Ten states have reported a record one-day increase in Covid-19 cases in September, including Montana, South Dakota and Utah on Thursday.New cases rose last week after falling for eight consecutive weeks. Health experts believe this spike was due to reopening schools and universities as well as parties over the recent Labor Day holiday.A study by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Indiana University, the University of Washington and Davidson College said recent reopening of college and university campuses for in-person instruction during late summer this year could be associated with more than 3,000 additional cases of Covid-19 per day in the United States in recent weeks.US confirmed cases are the highest in the world followed by India with 5.7 million cases and Brazil with 4.6 million.The United states is currently averaging 40,000 new infections per day. Top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he would like to see the number to fall below 10,000 per day before flu season starts in October.Health officials and President Donald Trump have presented different views about the nation’s health crisis. Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term on Nov. 3, early this month had claimed that the United States was “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Fauci contradicted the claim the next day, saying the statistics were disturbing.(Reporting by Anurag Maan and Roshan Abraham in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-over-7-million-covid-19-cases-20-of-the-world-s-total/story-Aqw4eLaNd331JcBo0mxZ3I.html
25-09-2020||World||Manhattan DA Vance, Trump lawyers go head-to-head over Prez’s tax returns||With the US presidential election looming, lawyers for Donald Trump will ask a federal appeals court on Friday to block Manhattan’s top prosecutor from obtaining the president’s tax returns in connection with a criminal probe into Trump and his businesses.The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments from lawyers for Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, whose investigation began more than two years ago.The probe has been stalled as Trump fights an Aug. 2019 grand jury subpoena to his accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of his corporate and personal tax returns.Vance began his probe after Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen paid hush money to silence two women before the 2016 election about claimed sexual encounters with Trump.The probe now appears to go beyond the payments, with Vance saying in court filings he might have grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax and insurance fraud, and that possible bank fraud might also be examined.Trump’s lawyers have said the subpoena was “wildly overbroad,” issued in bad faith, and part of a “fishing expedition” designed to harass him.Vance is a Democrat, and Trump is a Republican.Friday’s arguments follow the US Supreme Court’s July 9 rejection of Trump’s claim he was absolutely immune from criminal probes while in the White House.The Supreme Court said Trump could raise other challenges to the subpoena. Trump has said he expects a return to that court if the appeals court rules against him, as it did last November.In an Aug. 20 ruling, US District Judge Victor Marrero said Vance should obtain the returns, saying Trump’s effort to prolong the dispute could cause statutes of limitations to run out and give him the immunity the Supreme Court rejected.“Justice requires an end to this controversy,” Marrero wrote.Trump’s lawyers want the case returned to Marrero so he can review the substance of the president’s arguments, rather than treat them as a repackaging of his immunity claim.Though the appeal was fast-tracked, the public will likely not know what’s in Trump’s tax returns before the Nov. 3 election.Grand jury proceedings are secret, and if Vance gets the returns it could be months before their contents become public.All three judges on the appeals court panel were appointed by Democratic presidents, as was Marrero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manhattan-da-vance-trump-lawyers-go-head-to-head-over-prez-s-tax-returns/story-tKmUXS2rnDa8vzkw2cxi2H.html

25-09-2020||World||Rio scraps famed carnival as virus surges across globe||Brazil has postponed Rio de Janeiro’s famed carnival for next year, the latest spectacle hit by the pandemic as governments across the globe struggle to contain a surge in coronavirus infections.Rio’s carnival, famous for its gyrating Samba dancers, drummers and dancing crowds, draws millions for all night parties in packed streets, making social distancing all but impossible.Brazil now has the world’s second highest death toll after the United States -- nearly 140,000 fatalities -- and is still battling to bring the virus under control.Rio’s samba schools had already warned in July that without certainty of a vaccine this year it would be difficult to organise the February 2021 festival. “It’s not a cancellation, it’s a postponement,” said Jorge Castanheira, president of the group that organises the parades. “We are looking for an alternative solution, something we can do when it’s safe to contribute to the city.”It was the first time the carnival had been postponed since 1912, joining a growing list of major entertainment and sporting events disrupted by the pandemic with the virus showing no signs of slowing its track across the globe.Australia also postponed plans to host a Test cricket match against Afghanistan and a one-day series against New Zealand Friday, saying the pandemic had made arranging the matches too difficult.French Open tennis tournament will now allow only 1,000 spectators each day in line with tougher restrictions introduced this week by the French government.Worldwide deaths are nearing one million and more than 31 million cases have been detected since the coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.With scientists still racing to develop a vaccine, governments are being forced to reimpose crippling lockdown measures that slowed the virus spread earlier this year but sent much of the world economy into a tailspin.The European Union raised the alarm on Thursday, saying the pandemic is worse now than at the March peak in several member countries, as governments in Europe and beyond order new anti-virus measures.Europe’s death rate has not returned to the levels seen earlier this year but new infections are soaring once again, prompting the bloc’s disease control agency to flag seven countries of “high concern”.France reported an all-time high in new daily cases of over 16,000, one day after announcing tougher infection control measures especially for hard-hit Mediterranean port Marseille.Bars in Paris and 10 other cities will be forced to close early but Marseille will see restaurants and bars close completely. Fierce reactions from local officials underscored the struggle governments face balance health risks against the need to revive businesses battered by lockdowns.“I am angry because there was no consultation,” Marseille Mayor Michele Rubirola told Franceinfo radio. “Why turn the screws when our numbers have been improving for a few days now?”Stay at homeMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Friday also ordered the elderly to stay at home and recommended employers allow home working after the Russian capital saw a sharp rise in virus cases.Sobyanin’s message came after figures that were steady for several months climbed steeply in recent days in Russia, the world’s fourth most affected country, and particularly in Moscow.“We all really don’t want to go back to he harsh restrictions of spring,” Sobyanin said. “I hope we can avoid this.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has warned that a new lockdown could be needed in Athens unless the public can help bring down new cases by respecting distancing and mask-wearing measures.Israel, which closed schools and imposed restrictions on workplaces and leisure activities last week in a second nationwide lockdown, toughened its rules still further on Thursday.Most workplaces and markets are to be closed and prayer meetings and demonstrations will be severely restricted, as the country battles the world’s worst per-capita infection rate.British pubs and bars were also closing earlier than usual from Thursday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson required all premises serving drink and food to shut by 10 pm in a bid to curb growing virus cases.“I don’t think it’s gonna help, it’s too little too late, as usual,” Joyce, a drinker in her fifties at the Prince George in the East London neighbourhood of Dalston, told AFP.“You’re just displacing the problem.”As lockdowns edge back, the rollout of a vaccine is seen as crucial for a return to normal life, with several leading vaccine candidates currently in late-stage trials.That is particularly key for international sports, where many events are taking place are generally behind closed doors and without audiences.However, Olympic boss Thomas Bach said the postponed Tokyo Games could take place next year even without a vaccine.“A number of big sport events have been successfully organised recently,” he said, pointing for instance to the success of the Tour de France.Elsewhere in the world of sport, Swedish striker and AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 38, has tested positive for coronavirus, his club announced on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rio-scraps-famed-carnival-as-virus-surges-across-globe/story-XLGNr7atGS3d3dGUs4ckZO.html
25-09-2020||World||How Harley-Davidson lost its rumble in India||Harley-Davidson Inc. is riding out of India. That’s as much of a problem for the American motorcycle icon as for one of the largest two-wheeler markets looking to make its mark globally.Harley said in a regulatory filing Thursday that it was discontinuing sales and manufacturing operations in the world’s second most populous country as part of its company-wide restructuring, or the “Rewire” plan, a five-year strategy to reset its business, focus on high-priority markets and tighten up by streamlining models. That the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company is pulling out of a thriving market for motorbikes speaks to a troubled international strategy in need of overhaul. It comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing his “Make in India” program, with the autos sector (including two-wheelers) as a key part and potentially $23 billion in production incentives on the way. Nonetheless, Toyota Motor Corp. said last week it won’t expand further there.India hasn’t been an easy market for Harley, where it’s had an assembly plant for a decade and sells a few thousand bikes. The company operates a “complete knock-down” assembly plant, where components and parts are imported from the US and assembled into motorcycles for the local market. It also produces the Harley-Davidson Street series for sale outside North America. Finding the price sweet spot and gaining traction in India, even with models made for the market with smaller engines, has been difficult. Discounts sometimes help; at other times, they turn off buyers. Bike manufacturers have struggled with the existential approach — more for less, or vice versa? Indian consumers are aspirational and not that easy to please: A cheaper model of a high-end brand won’t cut it. Taxes on larger powertrains are punitive. Harley’s bikes can cost as much as 1.1 million rupees (about $15,000). That’s steep for a market where the average bike with decent mileage starts at 50,000 rupees, and its nearest competitor prices closer to 150,000 rupees.  Harley was never going for the mass market, of course. It’s long since moved beyond the Wild One to the Weekend One, selling the emblazoned-leather-jacket lifestyle of the American biker on the open road to those who can pay a top price for it. Still, in India, there has been opportunity. Volumes of premium-segment motorcycles have been growing for the last six years. Top-end models have drawn first-time buyers from higher-income levels, and are potentially an upgrade choice for the 70-some million riders of smaller bikes, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Its main rival in the segment is Eicher Motors Ltd.-owned Royal Enfield — priced well below a Harley, with a similar brand appeal. The Harley cult hasn’t grown big enough to convert into substantial sales. The top 10 brands in India have 70% of the market, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. Most of the best-selling models have been around for at least 17 years, on average. The majority of new launches fail when it comes to gaining share. As the analysts put it, the best way to get a toehold has been when new segments emerge. Harley hasn’t rolled into one. It priced itself too high, then tried to make cheaper versions that didn’t appeal to fans. The company is hamstrung to some extent by the parts it imports and then assembles at its Bawal plant. Tariffs have been a point of contention with US presidents from George W. Bush to Donald Trump. But Harley struggled even after they were cut. The company has also suffered in the wider global trade frictions, with net revenues affected by tariffs imposed by China and the European Union, and by the US on items imported from China. Part of the problem for motorcycles has been the transition to the latest emission norms (a good thing). Keeping up, though, has meant an increase in imported content for parts, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Duties and taxes haven’t been lowered to keep pace, while ownership costs and road taxes have increased. All together, state levies make up to approximately 50% of a vehicle’s on-road price, the highest among comparable countries, the analysts say.Modi’s ambitious plans could have been helped by a symbolic gesture to hold on to Harley. India’s inability to keep a premium manufacturer with an outsize brand points to misaligned incentives and dim prospects for becoming a top-end hub. Middle-weight players are doing fine, and large domestic manufacturers like Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co. export 47% and 26% of their production. But that may be the ceiling.In contrast, Thailand has several production-linked incentives, along with significant research and development expenditure benefits and relatively low corporate tax rates. Premium, larger-engine motorcycle makers have flocked there, including Harley, which has a manufacturing facility.Both India and Harley are walking away from what could have been a big opportunity.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

25-09-2020||World||Terror probe launched after 2 wounded in Paris knife attack||French terrorism authorities are investigating a knife attack that wounded at least two people Friday near the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, authorities said. A suspect has been arrested.The area in eastern Paris remained cordoned off by police two hours after the attack. Children were being sequestered in nine schools while police worked to determine no other suspects were on the run, according to education and police officials.It is unclear what motivated the attack or whether it was linked to Charlie Hebdo, which moved after its offices were targeted in a 2015 Islamic extremist attack that left 12 people dead.Police cordoned off the area, including the former Charlie Hebdo offices, after a suspect package was noticed nearby, but the package was found to be harmless and no explosives were found, according a police official.An investigation was opened into “attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise,” according to an official at the prosecutor’s office. Authorities did not release the identity of the suspect arrested in the area of the Bastille Plaza.“I saw a guy that was in his 30s or 40s with an axe in his hand who was walking behind a victim covered in blood...I cant tell you how many victims there was, I just saw one,” witness Kader Alfa told The Associated Press at the scene.AP reporters saw officers flooding into the neighborhood, near the Richard Lenoir subway station.The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company’s staff members were evacuated.Moreira said a man in the street “attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn’t enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left.” He said the company had not received any threats.A Paris police official said that while authorities initially thought two attackers were involved, they now believe it was only one person, who was detained. The official said police were still searching the area while they questioned the arrested suspect.Police initially announced that four people were wounded in the attack, but the official told The Associated Press that there are in fact only two confirmed wounded. Police could not explain the discrepancies.Police did not release the identities of the attacker or the wounded, who are in “absolutely urgent” condition, the official said. The official was not authorized to be publicly named.French Prime Minister Jean Castex cut short a visit to a suburb north of Paris to head to the Interior Ministry to follow developments.The trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently underway across town. Murmurs broke at the terrorism trial of 14 people, including 3 fugitives, accused of helping the attackers in the January 2015 killings, as the news filtered through. The widows of the Charlie Hebdo attackers are scheduled to testify Friday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-injured-in-knife-attack-near-former-offices-of-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo-in-paris-says-ap/story-92WVuxUOgMt5oxYA868YmK.html
25-09-2020||World||China demolished around 16,000 mosques in recent years: Report||Chinese authorities have demolished thousands of mosques in Xinjiang, an Australian think tank said Friday, in the latest report of widespread human rights abuses in the restive region.Rights groups say more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking people have been incarcerated in camps across the northwestern territory, with residents pressured to give up traditional and religious activities.Around 16,000 mosques had been destroyed or damaged, according to an Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report based on satellite imagery documenting hundreds of sacred sites and statistical modelling.Most of the destruction had taken place in the last three years and an estimated 8,500 mosques had been completely destroyed, the report said, with more damage outside the urban centres of Urumqi and Kashgar. Many mosques that escaped demolition had their domes and minarets removed, according to the research, which estimated fewer than 15,500 intact and damaged mosques were left standing around Xinjiang.If correct, it would be the lowest number of Muslim houses of worship in the region since the decade of national upheaval sparked by the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.By contrast, none of the Christian churches and Buddhist temples in Xinjiang that were studied by the think tank had been damaged or destroyed.ASPI also said nearly a third of major Islamic sacred sites in Xinjiang -- including shrines, cemeteries and pilgrimage routes -- had been razed.An AFP investigation last year found dozens of cemeteries had been destroyed in the region, leaving human remains and bricks from broken tombs scattered across the land.China has insisted that residents of Xinjiang enjoy full religious freedom.Asked about the research on Friday, China’s foreign ministry said the research institute had “no academic credibility” and was producing “anti-China reports and anti-China lies”.Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said there were about 24,000 mosques in the region.“Xinjiang’s total number of mosques is more than ten times the number in the US, and the average number of mosques per Muslim person is higher than in some Muslim countries,” Wang told a regular press briefing.Friday’s report comes a day after ASPI said it had identified a network of detention centres in the region much larger than previous estimates.Beijing has said its network of camps are vocational training centres, which are necessary for countering poverty and anti-extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demolished-around-16-000-mosques-in-recent-years-report/story-uvtYtO81RzSCZfrL96bIlJ.html

In Moscow, the number of new daily infections started to grow last week and was up to over 1,500 on Friday from under 700 two weeks ago.“None of us want to return to severe restrictions (that were in place) this spring. I hope we can avoid that,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in his blog.Sobyanin urged people over 65 years old and those suffering from chronic illnesses to stay at home starting from Monday, limit their contacts with others and leave their residence only when necessary. Employers are recommended to allow as many people as possible to work from home, disinfect the workplace regularly, observe social distancing guidelines and use personal protective equipment in offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-asks-elderly-to-stay-home-amid-new-covid-19-surge/story-an4AYsVcxDceCvLNrNEaSN.html
25-09-2020||World||Some Covid-19 cases turn severe due to faulty genes, misguided antibodies||More than 10 per cent of young and healthy people who develop severe Covid-19 have misguided antibodies that attack not the virus, but the immune system itself, and another 3.5 per cent may carry a specific kind of genetic mutation, according to a new study. The research, published in the journal Science, noted that both groups of patients lack type I interferon -- a set of 17 proteins crucial for protecting cells and the body from viruses. These proteins, according to the researchers from the Rockefeller University in the US, are part of the intrinsic and innate immunity, kicking in before the body produces an antibody response, and are known to play an important role in immediately heightening the cells’ defences in response to several viruses. In the case of some patients with severe Covid-19, they said the interferons could either be neutralised by the patients’ own antibodies, or may not be produced in insufficient amounts due to a faulty gene. They said the findings help explain why some people develop a disease much more severe than others in their age group including in individuals who required admission to the hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) despite being in their 20s and free of underlying conditions. The study results, according to the researchers, may also provide the first molecular explanation for why more men than women die from Covid-19. “These findings provide compelling evidence that the disruption of type I interferon is often the cause of life-threatening Covid-19,” says Jean-Laurent Casanova, a co-author of the study from the Rockefeller University. “And at least in theory, such interferon problems could be treated with existing medications and interventions,” Casanova said. The novel coronavirus can cause symptom-free infection in most people, or can kill some others in a few days. According to the researchers, the unusual susceptibility to certain infectious diseases can be traced to single-gene mutations that affect an individual’s immune response.In the current research, they genetically analysed blood samples from more than 650 Covid-19 patients who had been hospitalised for life-threatening pneumonia due to the coronavirus, of whom 14 per cent had died. The scientists also included samples from another group of over 530 people with asymptomatic or benign infection. They initially searched for differences between the two groups across 13 genes known to govern the production of the type I interferons in the body, which are critical for defense against the influenza virus. According to the study, a significant number of people with severe disease carried rare variants in these 13 genes, and more than three per cent of them were missing a functioning gene. From further experiments, they showed that immune cells from these patients did not produce any detectable type I interferons in response to the coronavirus. The scientists demonstrated that human fibroblast cells with mutations affecting the interferon type I pathway were more vulnerable to the virus, and died in higher numbers, and did so at a faster rate than cells without those mutations. They said three other infectious diseases caused by mutations affecting an immune signalling protein can also be caused by auto-antibodies against that protein. Examining 987 patients with life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia, they found that more than 10 per cent had auto-antibodies against interferons at the onset of their infection, with a majority of them (95 per cent) being men. The researchers confirmed these findings using biochemical experiments which showed that these auto-antibodies can effectively curb the activity of interferon type I. In some cases the auto-antibodies could be detected in blood samples taken before patients became infected and in others, they said, these were found in the early stages of the infection, before the immune system had the time to mount a response.However, the auto-antibodies seem to be rare in the general population, the scientists said, adding that only four out of 1,227 randomly selected healthy people were found to have them. “All of these findings strongly indicate that these auto-antibodies are actually the underlying reason some people get very sick, and not the consequence of the infection,” Casanova said. The scientists believe the findings could point to medical interventions that may help control the disease severity. Citing an example, they said two types of interferons available as drugs and approved for use to treat certain conditions, such as chronic viral hepatitis, could be further investigated for their effectiveness against severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-covid-19-cases-turn-severe-due-to-faulty-genes-misguided-antibodies/story-lMN4aTaFt0WSf56tuNnRIM.html

He is in a critical condition in hospital.Officers did not open fire and the BBC said it was believed the man turned the gun on himself. A murder investigation is underway, police added.“This is a truly shocking incident in which one of our colleagues has lost his life in the most tragic circumstances,” London police chief Cressida Dick said. “We are in the early stages of the investigation and are still working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and we will provide further updates when we have them.”Britain’s interior minister, Priti Patel, said she was shocked and saddened by the killing.“This is a sad day for our country and another terrible reminder of how our police officers put themselves in danger each and every day to keep the rest of us safe,” Patel said. British police officers remain routinely unarmed, and a survey in 2017 suggested most did not want to carry weapons regularly.“This is utterly devastating and heartbreaking news,” said John Apter, chairman of the National Police Federation which represents rank and file officers in England and Wales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-detained-in-custody-centre-kills-cop-in-south-london/story-9gfJHjIr0iWmukq9dlU7YM.html
25-09-2020||World||This is why Covid-19 may be life-threatening for some patients||When two brothers fell critically ill with Covid-19 around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases, genetic variations, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of coronavirus patients.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing evidence suggests that a significant minority of Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an impaired interferon response. Twin landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that insufficient interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”The work highlights the potential for interferon-based therapies to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The possibility that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now recruiting Covid-19 patients.“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said Alexander Hoischen, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’ genetic makeup.New NexusInterferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”Whether sufficient interferon is available early or late in Covid-19 cases has a major bearing on disease severity, according to Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. Ideally, production of the antiviral substance would be triggered when immune cells encounter SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, stopping rapid viral reproduction inside the body and averting complications, he said.“But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has anti-interferon genes which can stop or antagonize the production or effect of interferon,” said Yuen, who measured the effects in human lung tissue. If the interferon response is delayed and the amount of virus in the body peaks at a high level, other parts of the immune system will be “awakened.”‘Really disastrous’That may trigger lung-injuring inflammation -- collateral damage from an excessive immune reaction to the virus. “This is really disastrous,” he said.Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to the study in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.‘First explanation’“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”Genetic analysis of Covid-19 patients published in the same journal revealed two dozen gene mutations that had been “silent” until patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers -- many of them also involved in the antibody study -- sequenced the genomes of 659 patients with life-threatening cases of the disease; 3.5% carried genetic variations that inhibit interferon production.Those genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers described in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.Raging feverHis 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this chromosome are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as 14% of critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients. On the other hand, patients who produce antibodies against interferon shouldn’t donate blood products for treating other patients.“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-why-covid-19-may-be-life-threatening-for-some-patients/story-Tfjk8G3iN2UUDNDHgYaEaK.html
25-09-2020||World||Donald Trump infuses politics into his choice for Supreme Court justice||President Donald Trump is infusing deliberations over his coming nomination of a new Supreme Court justice with political meaning as he aims to maximize the benefit before Nov. 3 and even secure an electoral backstop should the result be contested.Even before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death last week, the president had tried to use likelihood of more Supreme Court vacancies to his political advantage. Now, as he closes in on a decision on her likely replacement, Trump has used the vacancy to appeal to battleground-state voters and as a rallying cry for his conservative base.He also is increasingly embracing the high court — which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping -– as an insurance policy in a close election.Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the pandemic have already brought about a flurry of election litigation, and both Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,” Trump said Wednesday of the election, adding, “And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices.”It’s a line echoed by Trump allies, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who said Thursday, “I think that threat to challenge the election is one of the real reasons why it is so important that we confirm the Supreme Court nominees, so that there’s a full Supreme Court on the bench to resolve any election challenge.”Barely six weeks from Election Day, and as millions of Americans are already voting, Trump and his advisers have tried to use the court vacancy to help deliver Trump another term in office.Supreme Court nominations are never entirely devoid of political considerations, but Trump’s decision has been particularly wrapped up in a charged political moment.Within hours of Ginsburg’s death, Trump made clear his intention to nominate a woman in her stead, after previously putting two men on the court and as he struggles to mitigate an erosion in support among suburban women.In discussing his five-person short list, he’s been sure to highlight some from election battlegrounds that he’s aiming to win this fall as much as their jurisprudence.“I’ve heard incredible things about her,” he said of Florida’s Barbara Lagoa, a day after Ginsburg’s death. “I don’t know her. She’s Hispanic and highly respected. Miami. Highly respected.”In an interview with a Detroit television station, he volunteered that hometown Justice Joan Larsen is “very talented.”Trump was even considering a meeting with Lagoa this week in Florida, where he plans campaign events. The appellate court judge was confirmed last year by the Senate in a bipartisan vote and has been promoted for the court by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and others as a nominee with more across-the-board appeal.Trump and his aides, though, appear to have set their sights on nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, who was at the White House twice this week, including for a Monday meeting with Trump.The staunch conservative’s 2017 confirmation on a party-line vote included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. Trump allies see that as a political windfall for them should Democrats attempt to do so once again. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is trying to recapture.On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence defended Barrett when asked whether her affiliation with People of Praise, a charismatic Christian community, would complicate her ability to serve on the high court.“I must tell you the intolerance expressed during her last confirmation about her Catholic faith I really think was a disservice to the process and a disappointment to millions of Americans,” he told ABC News.Trump played up the power to make judicial nominations with conservative voters in 2016, when Republicans senators kept open the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia rather than let President Barack Obama fill the opening. Trump’s decision to release lists of accomplished conservative jurists for potential elevation to the high court was rewarded by increased enthusiasm among white evangelical voters, many of whom had been resistant to supporting the candidacy of the one-time New York Democrat.Even before Ginsburg’s death, Trump had done the same in 2020, releasing an additional 20 names he would consider for the court, and encouraging Democrat Joe Biden to do the same.Biden has resisted that pressure so far, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from trying to sow fear among conservatives about whom the Democrat might nominate.“So they don’t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far-left radicals,” Trump said this week.“If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far-left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition,” Trump said at a rally outside Toledo on Monday. “They will mutilate the law, disfigure the Constitution and impose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-infuses-politics-into-his-choice-for-supreme-court-justice/story-tWepfTSCW1bXKpjbBgtLpL.html
25-09-2020||World||Pence, Ivanka visit salon damaged by Minneapolis unrest||Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump made an unannounced stop Thursday at a hair salon left in rubble by the violence that followed George Floyd’s death, part of a campaign visit aimed at driving home President Donald Trump’s law-and-order message in a key swing state.Pence, Ivanka Trump and Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia stood by on the city’s north side as owner Flora Westbrooks, near tears, pointed at what remained of Flora’s Hair Design.“I never thought this would happen,” Westbrooks said. “Not to me.” “We’re with you,” Pence told her.Pence and President Donald Trump’s eldest daughter later went to a listening session with a “Cops for Trump” group and business owners. Trump has been campaigning on a law-and-order message for weeks and is eager to put Minnesota in play four years after he narrowly lost the state to Hillary Clinton.“I want to be clear: There’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, and justice will be served,” Pence told the crowd at an airport hotel. “But there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued. And those who engaged in acts like these will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed Black man’s neck during an arrest captured on bystander video. His death set off protests around the world, including some that became violent. Property damage in Minneapolis alone is estimated at roughly $100 million.After Floyd’s death, a majority of Minneapolis City Council members pledged to abolish the police department and replace it with a new agency that would take a more socially minded approach. Their hopes of taking the idea to voters in November was blocked by a city commission and won’t happen before 2021, if ever.The talk of abolishing police came as Minneapolis saw spiking violent crime, as many other big cities did, and also as some residents complained that police response times had slowed. Morale in the department has been down, and dozens of officers have retired or are seeking disability leave.“We are expected to be the handyman that fixes everything, and it’s not possible,” Matthew Hagan, a Hennepin County sheriff’s deputy and president of the Minnesota chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, told Pence.Pence said men and women in law enforcement deserve respect every day, and if people want better-trained officers, they need more funding.“We’re not going to defund the police — not now, not ever,” Pence said. “The American people want us to stand by law enforcement and stand by our African American neighbors and all of our neighbors who’ve been impacted by the violence in our cities.” Matt Seyko Thao, a 30-year-old from West St. Paul, said he thinks the Trump campaign is using law-and-order messaging to court those who were unsure about calls to defund the police earlier this summer.“He’s here to give relief to the people who go support the police, people who say ‘what happens if the police are gotten rid of,’” he said. “It’s all a political ploy ... and he’s here for the wrong reasons.” Pence’s visit to the city where Floyd died prompted Minneapolis leaders to ask Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard as a precaution. The governor’s office said 100 guard members were made ready out of what Walz called “an abundance of caution.” The Trump campaign’s visit came a day after several hundred demonstrators rallied at the state Capitol in St. Paul before marching onto an interstate to protest a Kentucky grand jury’s decision not to bring homicide charges against Louisville police officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor, who was Black and unarmed.Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for Joe Biden, said in a statement: “Nothing Vice President Pence says today will distract voters from the truth: four years of the Trump-Pence Administration’s chaos and division has made Minnesotans’ lives worse.” Pence told business owners that he sensed their feeling of helplessness as they watched the unrest unfold in May. He said that shouldn’t happen.“It was hard to stand there and see your business burn. Everything you worked for,” Westbrooks said. “I just want my business back. I just want another start.” Ivanka Trump said the Trump administration will do what America does best “and help you and others like you rebuild, because that’s what we need to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-ivanka-visit-salon-damaged-by-minneapolis-unrest/story-EMaiDX6yQTOBlpBAyDj2AO.html
25-09-2020||World||US Presidential Elections: Joe Biden’s low-key campaign style worries some Democrats||The final stretch of a presidential campaign is typically a nonstop mix of travel, caffeine and adrenaline. But as the worst pandemic in a century bears down on the United States, Joe Biden is taking a lower key approach.Since his Aug 11 selection of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, Biden has had 22 days where he either didn’t make public appearances, held only virtual fundraisers or ventured from his Delaware home solely for church, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules. He made 12 visits outside of Delaware during that period, including a trip to Washington scheduled for Friday to pay respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.During the same time, President Donald Trump had 24 trips that took him to 17 different states, not counting a personal visit to New York to see his ailing brother in the hospital or weekend golf outings.Biden’s aides insist his approach is intentional, showcasing his respect for public health guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus and presenting a responsible contrast with Trump, who has resumed large-scale campaign rallies — sometimes over the objections of local officials. Still, some Democrats say it’s critical that Biden infuse his campaign with more energy.Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said not traveling because of the pandemic was a “pretty lame excuse.”“I thought he had his own plane,” Hinojosa said. “He doesn’t have to sit with one space between another person on a commercial airline like I would.”Hinojosa argued that Biden prioritizing visits to Texas and Arizona could boost Latino turnout and potentially reduce the pressure on him to sweep Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — where he has focused much of his travel so far.“We are campaigning safely and effectively, and our message is reaching voters in battleground states and generating the enthusiasm and energy we need to beat Donald Trump,” said Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo.The race between Biden and Trump has been generally consistent for months. Biden has maintained a comfortable lead in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many of the battleground states that will decide the election.But polls that showed competitive races or even Democratic advantages in traditionally Republican states proved to be false indicators for Democrats in 2016.Four years later, Biden faces persistent questions about whether his campaign is organizing and connecting with voters. When he visited Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday for a Black economic summit, Collette Alston, chairwoman of the local African American Caucus, said she only found out with one day’s notice — when she saw it on TV.Just 16 people attended the event and Alston warned that Biden wasn’t reaching locals she thinks he needs to — “the people that are like, I don’t care, I really don’t want to vote.”“I do believe that he can win North Carolina,” Alton said. “Can he win it based on what he’s doing right now? No. That’s not the way to win it.”Biden’s swing state visits often seem tailor-made for a television package: A small, socially distanced roundtable or town hall, always with fewer than 25 people; occasionally a stop at a local business or a visit with first responders; and then hours of back-to-back local media interviews.Beyond traveling more, Biden is being urged by some Democrats to expand his message. While he has given standalone speeches on issues like criminal justice reform, climate change and, last weekend, the Supreme Court vacancy, Biden largely ignores those issues during his campaign stops. When he appears before voters, he’s generally laser-focused on the virus and the Trump administration’s mismanaging of it.When a grand jury decided Wednesday not to bring charges against police officers directly involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor, he offered condolences to her mother but declined to comment about the specifics of the case on camera. He later issued a more detailed written statement.David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s former strategist and adviser, said the Biden campaign is “wise” to concentrate on the pandemic because it’s an “anchor around the President’s neck.” But he said it would be a “missed opportunity” for Biden if he didn’t speak up more about the Supreme Court going forward, especially the impact it could have on healthcare.“The future of the Affordable Care Act and particularly the future of protections for people with preexisting conditions is a very close issue, and it’s what drove Democrats to victory in 2018,” Axelrod said.Biden’s aides say the relatively light schedule, small events and message discipline reflect the biggest issue still confronting most Americans today: the coronavirus pandemic. Biden also has sought to offer a responsible contrast to Trump and his rallies, where thousands forgo masks.“Every time Trump shows up and has a mask-less rally and says this thing is overblown, Democrats are winning the Covid battle,” said Jim Kessler, an executive vice president of the moderate Democratic group Third Way.Biden maintains a vigorous schedule even when he’s not traveling. His campaign has become a fundraising powerhouse through largely virtual events. He raised a record $364 million in August that has allowed him to blanket the airwaves across the country and outspend Trump.Still, Trump sees the contrast in travel as an opportunity to argue that his packed schedule shows he’s outworking Biden. The president seized on the Biden campaign’s announcement shortly before 9:30 a.m. Thursday that he wouldn’t have any public events for the day.Biden spent the day preparing for his first debate against Trump next week.“Did you see he did a lid this morning again?” Trump said of Biden during a rally Thursday night at an airport hangar in Jacksonville, Florida. “A lid is when you put out word you’re not going to be campaigning today. So he does a lid all the time. ... I’m in Texas. I’m in Ohio. I’m in North Carolina, South Carolina. I’m in Michigan. I’m all over the place.”Biden’s aides counter that they see evidence in public and private polling that the virus remains top of mind for most voters, and that they have a compelling case to make that much of the crisis is Trump’s fault. They also say their focus on small, high-impact events gets results.Still, the cautious approach isn’t shared by Biden’s wife, Jill, who has already ventured as far away as Maine and spent Thursday making four stops in Virginia. She’s going to Iowa, another state her husband has yet to visit in recent months, on Saturday.Hillary Scholten, a Democrat seeking an open House seat in Michigan, spent a morning last week touring a food bank in Grand Rapids, the state’s second-largest city, with Jill Biden. She’s aware that Joe Biden may not follow suit.“People would want to see him here,” Scholten said. “That being said, there is a global pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-joe-biden-s-low-key-campaign-style-worries-some-democrats/story-JOrTIcDPpYWMTT2UZGcWPK.html
25-09-2020||World||Fake license scandal: ICAO advises Pakistan to suspend issuance of new pilot licenses||The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has advised Pakistan to undertake “immediate corrective actions” and suspend the issuance of any new pilot licenses in the wake of a scandal over falsified licenses, according to an official and a document seen by Reuters. The recommendations from ICAO, a specialized agency of the United Nations that works to ensure safety in international air transport, come days after Pakistan opened a criminal probe into 50 pilots and five civil aviation officials who allegedly helped them falsify credentials to secure pilot licences. “Pakistan should improve and strengthen its licensing system to ensure that it takes into account all necessary processes and procedures and prevents inconsistencies and malpractices before new licenses are issued and privileges of suspended licenses are re-established,” said ICAO, in a previously unreported letter to the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) last week.A Pakistani aviation ministry official told Reuters that the country has not issued any new licenses since July, in the wake of the scandal.The Montreal-based agency’s recommendations come ahead of an ICAO audit to assess the country’s aviation safety management systems.The ICAO audit, originally scheduled for November this year, has been moved to June, effectively giving the PCAA more time to work on reforms, the official said.A PCAA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.An ICAO representative declined to comment on specific details, but said in an email that ICAO is “helping Pakistan to recognise concerns, and if they do not take swift action on them we will actively notify other countries about them.” The pilot scandal has tainted Pakistan’s aviation industry and hurt flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which has been barred from flying into Europe and the United States.In addition to revoking the licenses of 50 pilots, Pakistan has also suspended another 32 pilots for a year.

25-09-2020||World||Covid-19: Iraqi youth with development disorders suffer after Mosul lockdown||When Mosul ended its Covid-19 lockdown last month, health specialists faced a disheartening reality: a deterioration among youth with developmental disorders and special needs in the northern Iraqi city.Mosul’s few health centres treating these young people had been shut for around four months to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 300,000 Iraqis and killed over 8,000, according to official figures.Hundreds of children diagnosed with various conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), were deprived of socialisation classes, speech training and physical therapy -- all described by doctors as essential.“The spread of the coronavirus and the lockdown really affected the situation for our young patients, as they were not able to come to hospitals or treatment centres,” said Ilham Khattab, an autism specialist in Mosul.“Their cases got worse and they had relapses. It was disastrous.”Decades of war and poor investment have left hospitals across Iraq in bad shape, but the infrastructure in Mosul -- recaptured from the Islamic State jihadist group in 2017 -- is especially lacking.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEven now, there is only one operational general hospital in a city once seen as a destination for the best medical care in the country.The Fakhri Dabbagh Centre in Mosul’s east is treating 170 children with symptoms of ASD and other special needs, offering help free of charge.Parents wait outside in the public facility’s packed hallways as kids take rehabilitation courses in two small rooms.Private clinics priceyWhile nurses are happy to see their patients again, long-standing challenges remain.Nisrin Hamdi, a 63-year-old social worker, told AFP the centre lacked equipment to provide speech and motor skills sessions, while staff need advanced training.“Our capabilities are limited and we cannot absorb more patients. There’s not even a transportation system to bring in patients” who have trouble accessing the centre, she said.Private clinics offer help too, but their fees are hefty for many Mosul families with no income.One such private facility, the Special Giving Institute, charges 120,000 dinars ($100) for a month of rehabilitation programmes.Its head, 35-year-old Dr Ahmad Sufi, said he had noticed a rise in cases of ASD across Nineveh province since IS overran its capital Mosul in 2014.He said staying at home -- whether to hide from IS rule or during a coronavirus lockdown -- can exacerbate the disorder.“We had about 4,000 cases (requiring treatment) in Nineveh before IS. It reached around 6,000 under IS and now we are at 10,000 cases,” Sufi told AFP.In a small room, about a dozen children practise a short eight-note tune on keyboards to improve their motor skills.“If these children are not treated, their personal and psychological development will deteriorate,” the clinic’s head, Dr Mohammad al-Qaisi, told AFP.Some studies show increased screen time for young toddlers is linked to a higher likelihood of ASD symptoms.Umm Laith, whose four children are all being treated at the Fakhri Dabbagh Centre, told AFP that staying at home seemed to have set them back.“Because I was afraid for my children, I kept them watching television or playing with their mobile phones. This isolation led to them getting worse,” she said.Struggling with stigma Doctors complain of broader issues too, including stigma.“One of the biggest challenges we have is that even after diagnosing a child with autism, their parents won’t accept it,” said Rahmat al-Zuhair, a health worker in Mosul.“That affects how quickly we can begin treating them.” Several international organisations in the city are trying to plug the gap in aid and raise awareness. They include Save the Children, which has offered psychosocial support to 15,000 kids there since last year.“The needs went up a lot with Covid-19 -- when the lockdown happened, many families in Mosul called us asking when centres would reopen,” said spokeswoman Amal Taif.She said the lack of doctors for children with special needs meant that symptoms of developmental disabilities could go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed.“There are mental health workers, but they don’t necessarily have expertise in children, or (there are) paediatricians, but without a mental health focus.”And in Mosul, Taif pointed out, even basic provisions that can help children with special needs improve are often a long way away.Access to education is limited, parents often struggle to provide nutritious food for their children, and families often still live in homes still severely damaged by war, without electricity and running water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-iraqi-youth-with-development-disorders-suffer-after-mosul-lockdown/story-hsOcCMGxdGaJfxCYAgveDM.html
25-09-2020||World||Pakistan cracks down on 49 scribes, journalists’ body vows protests||A leading Pakistani journalist has revealed that the country’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has registered cases against 49 mediapersons and social media activists under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA).“Biggest crackdown against journalists & social media activists to date in Pakistan. FIA register cases against 49 journalists & social media activists under PECA. Names include @UmarCheema1 @AzazSyed @murtazasolang @ammarmasood3 @AsadAToor @bilalfqi etc,” Mubashir Zaidi tweeted on Thursday night.Zaidi, who hosts the popular talk show, Zara Hat Kay, didn’t give more details. Journalist bodies have condemned the move and have demanded that the cases be withdrawn. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists in a tweet vowed to hold countrywide protests if the government didn’t withdraw the cases.In a statement, the FIA said the agency has received complaints against 49 social media activists from a few complainants with evidence. “Cases have been registered against these activists and the FIA is issuing notices to these activists shortly,” the agency said. The FIA said strict action was likely to be taken against the individuals based on evidence that would be found to be detrimental to state institutions, especially the country’s security forces.In a tweet after the FIA’s announcement, Murtaza Solangi, one of the journalists charged, said he would continue to fight for constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. “We shall not bow before fascist thuggery,” he tweeted, adding, “We shall not surrender our fundamental rights.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the FIA’s move, tweeting, “The HRCP is alarmed by the news in circulation that the FIA is registering cases against 49 journalists and social media activists under PECA regulations. We demand that the state refrain from such action and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent.”A fortnight ago, global monitor Human Rights Watch (HRW) had stated in a report critical of the government that a week prior to that, Prime Minister Imran Khan had “asserted there is no media crackdown in Pakistan, and that he and his government are far more unprotected than the media”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-cracks-down-on-49-scribes-journalists-body-vows-protests/story-WLHXziuxLvwquGnFRmitFK.html
25-09-2020||World||China finds first asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in 35 days at Qingdao Port||China detected its first local asymptomatic infections in more than a month as two port workers responsible for unloading frozen seafood tested positive, adding to alarm that contaminated imports could be transmitting the coronavirus.The two cases, found in Shandong province’s Qingdao city during routine testing of port workers, were the first symptom-free infections that China has reported since Aug 20. China hasn’t reported any local symptomatic infections since Aug 15 either.Unlike other nations, China separates asymptomatic and symptomatic cases in its daily tally, and the former are moved into the latter category if and when they start showing signs of illness.The new cases will intensify concern in China over whether imported products are infectious. Traces of the virus have been repeatedly found on frozen, imported seafood and meat and their packaging, as well as in the containers in which they were shipped.China has banned imports from plants in Ecuador, Brazil and Indonesia in recent weeks after finding the virus on their products, disrupting trading channels.Mystery Grows Over Virus Spread Via Food PackagingWhile the US Food and Drug Administration has said that there’s no evidence Covid-19 is transmitted on food or food packaging, Chinese researchers have found coronavirus on chilled salmon may be infectious for more than a week.The growing number of cases linked to cold storage and port workers is in ongoing mystery. There were resurgences in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Dalian earlier this year connected to people working with imported food products, but experts have been unable to say conclusively where the infections came from.In New Zealand, a run of 102 days without a local virus case came to an end when a worker at a cold-storage plant in Auckland fell sick last month. But officials said that preliminary findings from environmental testing at the plant debunked the theory that the route of transmission was through chilled surfaces on materials arriving from overseas.In Qingdao, the local health commission said that 132 close contacts of the two patients have been quarantined, and 129 among them have tested negative so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finds-first-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-in-35-days-at-qingdao-port/story-cmbELdA8ba7ryRSaNFDIXJ.html
25-09-2020||World||DNA link behind severe Covid-19 may lead to a new treatment||When two brothers fell critically ill with Covid-19 around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases, genetic variations, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of coronavirus patients.The common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing evidence suggests that some Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an impaired interferon response. Landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that insufficient interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”The work highlights the potential for interferon-based therapies to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The possibility that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now recruiting Covid-19 patients.“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said Alexander Hoischen, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’ genetic makeup.Interferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to the study in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”Genetic analysis of Covid-19 patients published in the same journal revealed two dozen gene mutations that had been “silent” until patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers -- many of them also involved in the antibody study -- sequenced the genomes of 659 patients with life-threatening cases of the disease; 3.5% carried genetic variations that inhibit interferon production.Read More: Understanding the Virus and Its Unanswered Questions: QuickTakeThose genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers described in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.His 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this chromosome are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as one in eight critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients.“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dna-link-behind-severe-covid-19-may-lead-to-a-new-treatment/story-II9wcoyYLAlU1Tn2hbRGhP.html
25-09-2020||World||Australian think tank finds 380 detention camps in China’s Xinjiang||China appeared to be expanding its network of secret detention centres in Xinjiang, where Muslim minorities are targeted in a forced assimilation campaign, and more of the facilities resemble prisons, an Australian think tank has found.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute used satellite images and official construction tender documents to map more than 380 suspected detention facilities in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, highlighting re-education camps, detention centres and prisons that have been newly build or expanded since 2017.The report builds on evidence that China has made a policy shift from detaining Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in makeshift public buildings to constructing permanent mass detention facilities.This is despite Chinese state news agency Xinhua reporting late last year that “trainees” attending “vocational education and training centres” meant to deradicalise them had “all graduated”. Regional government chairman Shohrat Zakir was quoted as saying that foreign media reports of one million or two million people attending these centres were fabricated.Predominantly Muslim minorities in the remote Xinjiang region have been locked in camps as part of a government assimilation campaign launched in response to decades of sometimes violent struggle against the Chinese rule. Some have been subjected to forced sterilisation and abortion and in recent months, ordered to drink traditional Chinese medicines to combat the coronavirus.Australian Strategic Policy Institute researcher Nathan Ruser wrote in a report released late on Thursday: “Available evidence suggests that many extrajudicial detainees in Xinjiang’s vast ‘re-education’ network are now being formally charged and locked up in higher security facilities, including newly-built or expanded prisons, or sent to walled factory compounds for coerced labour assignments.” At least 61 detention sites had undergone new construction and expansion work in a year to July 2020, the report said. These included at least 14 facilities still under construction this year.“Of these, about 50 per cent are higher security facilities, which may suggest a shift in usage from the lower-security, ‘re-education centres’ toward higher-security prison-style facilities,” Ruser wrote.At least 70 facilities appeared to have lesser security by the removal of internal fencing or perimeter walls, the report said.These included eight camps that showed signs of decommissioning and were possibly closed. Of the camps stripped of security infrastructure, 90 per cent were lower security facilities, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-think-tank-finds-380-detention-camps-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-1YbIxyP8DuxPB7N5eV4oPL.html
25-09-2020||World||Northeast-based insurgent groups forced to relocate by Myanmar army action: Intel agencies||Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs) operating from Myanmar, particularly ULFA-I (United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent), NSCN-K (National Socialist Council of Nagaland – Khaplang), led by its current chairman Yung Aung, and NSCN-IM (National Socialist Council of Nagaland – Isak Muivah), are trying to relocate their bases near the border due to persistent action by the Myanmar Army over the last few months, according to an assessment by central intelligence agencies. People familiar with the developments told HT that ULFA-I and NSCN-K were keeping a close watch on both Indian security forces and the Myanmar Army to save its cadres from action. ULFA-I was relocating its cadres with the help of NSCN-K to safer hideouts. Also Read: BSF and BGB to work together to reduce number of border killingsNSCN-IM, too, was also planning relocation of its bases because of the presence and movement of the Myanmar Army in areas controlled by them across the border. A counter-insurgency official, requesting anonymity, argued that the cadres of north-east-based outfits have always moved to different locations whenever there has been action by the Myanmar Army. “Over the last few years, there has been more coordinated action against these outfits by both Indian and Myanmar armies and rebels have faced huge setbacks but they always manage to move to a different location,” he said. The intelligence inputs also suggest that north-east-based insurgent groups are trying to take advantage of unemployment caused by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic to recruit more jobless youths in their separatist outfits. The reports have come at a time when the government’s peace talks with NSCN-IM have failed because of differences between the insurgent group and the Centre’s interlocutor R N Ravi. Earlier in September, the NSCN-IM had reiterated its demand for a separate flag and a constitution for the Nagas. To be sure, the intelligence inputs largely talk about the movement of insurgent groups near the border during July and August. Another counter-insurgency official, however, said that there is a heightened threat of attack on security forces. “We are alert to the situation,” said a security official, who didn’t wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northeast-based-insurgent-groups-forced-to-relocate-by-myanmar-army-action-intel-agencies/story-kMYXwfFmKqwIpET1s2fSXI.html

Eight years later, she was appointed assistant DA in San Francisco, California. In 2000, she quit and took a job in city hall and just three years later she beat her former boss to become the first person of colour to become DA, San Francisco.Also read: Barack Obama to join Kamala Harris for two Democratic fundraisersAccording to her tax returns, her adjusted gross income ranged from $ 144,754 to $ 262,877, the television news channel reported, attributing the rise in income to the release of her first book -- Smart on crime -- during these years.As California attorney general, her salary ranged from $ 151,000 to $ 159,000, according to the council on state governments. In 2014, after marrying attorney Douglas Emhoff, her income grew tenfold to $ 1.2 million. In 2018, her income grew to almost $ 1.9 million. In 2019, the couple had between $ 2.8-6.3 million worth of assets, the report said.In 2015, Harris announced her senate bid after Barbara Boxer announced her retirement plans and won the seat in 2016. Also read: Indians in US raise $3.3mn for Biden in one night, seek moderate positions on Kashmir, CAAIn 2018, she signed royalty agreements for two of her books that she released ahead of her presidential candidacy.

She wrote in an email to her supporters that it was getting difficult for her to raise money for her campaign, “ I am not a billionaire, I cannot fund my own campaign.”In April 2020, Harris entered a join fund raising effort with the DNC that allowed her to raise six-figure donations for the party, fuelling speculation that she was running for the vice president.

25-09-2020||World||Barack Obama to join Kamala Harris for two Democratic fundraisers||Former President Barack Obama will join Kamala Harris for a pair of fundraisers next week in support of the Democratic ticket, the pair’s first events together since Harris became Joe Biden’s running mate.The two will team up for a grassroots fundraiser focused on low-dollar donations and a high-dollar event on Oct. 2, according to a campaign aide with knowledge of the events who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Both will be virtual. The campaign released a video of the two chatting over video about campaigning and Biden earlier this month.Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, was Obama’s vice president from 2009-2017. Obama joined Biden for a similar virtual small-dollar fundraiser over the summer. In the contest against Republican President Donald Trump, Biden’s campaign hopes to win back some voters who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 then voted for Trump in 2016 and to motivate Obama voters who stayed home in 2016.Obama and Harris are longtime political allies. Harris campaigned for Obama in Iowa during the 2008 presidential primary, when she was San Francisco’s district attorney.In 2010, when Harris was running for state attorney general, Obama endorsed her and attended a fundraising event, giving her a boost in the tightly contested election that she eventually won. Harris was the first woman and Black person elected to that job, just two years after Obama became the nation’s first Black president.The low-dollar fundraiser will be similar to an event Harris recently held with Hillary Clinton and comedians Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, which attracted more than 100,000 people and raised $6 million. People will be able to join even if they contribute just $1, the campaign aide said. The second event will be aimed at donors who can spend far greater sums of money, though the aide didn’t know the minimum amount.Biden and Harris raised a record $364 million in August. Harris has headlined more than a dozen fundraisers for the campaign since joining the ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-to-join-kamala-harris-for-two-democratic-fundraisers/story-xAYQ7KxUQoprKM4uIzstNI.html
25-09-2020||World||Massachusetts man dies from eating bags of black licorice||A Massachusetts construction worker’s love of black licorice wound up costing him his life. Eating a bag and a half every day for a few weeks threw his nutrients out of whack and caused the 54-year-old man’s heart to stop, doctors reported Wednesday.“Even a small amount of licorice you eat can increase your blood pressure a little bit,” said Dr. Neel Butala, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who described the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.The problem is glycyrrhizic acid, found in black licorice and in many other foods and dietary supplements containing licorice root extract. It can cause dangerously low potassium and imbalances in other minerals called electrolytes.Eating as little as 2 ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks could cause a heart rhythm problem, especially for folks over 40, the US Food and Drug Administration warns.“It’s more than licorice sticks. It could be jelly beans, licorice teas, a lot of things over the counter. Even some beers, like Belgian beers, have this compound in it,” as do some chewing tobaccos, said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist and former American Heart Association president. He had no role in the Massachusetts man’s care.The death was clearly an extreme case. The man had switched from red, fruit-flavored twists to the black licorice version of the candy a few weeks before his death last year. He collapsed while having lunch at a fast-food restaurant. Doctors found he had dangerously low potassium, which led to heart rhythm and other problems. Emergency responders did CPR and he revived but died the next day.The FDA permits up to 3.1% of a food’s content to have glycyrrhizic acid, but many candies and other licorice products don’t reveal how much of it is contained per ounce, Butala said. Doctors have reported the case to the FDA in hope of raising attention to the risk.Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, which makes the popular Twizzlers licorice twists, said in an email that “all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations,” and that all foods, including candy, “should be enjoyed in moderation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massachusetts-man-dies-from-eating-bags-of-black-licorice/story-T3ZHD86UYBnHQ1Xgk6GfwJ.html
25-09-2020||World||Donald Trump hopes for India-China border differences to end, reiterates his offer to help||US President Donald Trump hoped on Thursday that India and China would be able to resolve their current border disputes as he reiterated his offer to help the two Asian giants in this regard.“I know that China now, and India, are having difficulty, and very very substantial difficulty. And hopefully, they will be able to work that out,” Trump told reporters at the White House.“If we can help, we would love to help,” he said.Also read: India underlines stability on ground ahead of fresh round of talks with ChinaThe president’s remarks in this regard come days after senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held talks aimed at resolving the months-long standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The two countries agreed to stop sending more troops to their disputed border in the Himalayas.Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that the border conflict is pushing India to look for an asymmetric response: flexing its naval might.“India is intensifying joint naval maneuvers with the US and its allies while building new ships and setting up a network of coastal surveillance outposts that would allow New Delhi to keep an eye on the Indian Ocean’s maritime traffic,” the newspaper said.A “Grand Tamasha” podcast with senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, eminent American expert on India and South Asia Ashley Tellis said the Trump administration has taken a very transparent position of support for India in this crisis.“And, of course, it is motivated in part by the opportunities to confront China on a grander scale, which sort of makes it part and parcel of the US’s own bilateral problems with China. But I think there is something more going on here. And the more is that I do not think the United States had the alternative of doing otherwise.Also read: Donald Trump promotes health care ‘vision’ but gaps remain“That is, Chinese aggression in this instance has been so blatant that the United States could not stand by and either ignore it or not come to India’s defence,” said Tellis, the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs.“What are the issues here? We all agree that those borderlands along the Himalayan territories are undefined. We all agree that they should be negotiated, delimited, demarcated through a peaceful process. We all agree that the agreements that China and India have repeatedly reached among themselves since the 1990s actually offer a good enough framework for how to resolve this dispute over the long term,” he added.What China has done is that it has thrown all those understandings overboard, Tellis said.“And it is very important to recognise this that whatever the provocations may have been, the provocations created by Article 370 or whatever, I do not think they justified a reaction of this kind. Because a diplomatic provocation should have, you know, elicited a diplomatic response, rather than a quick jump to military action, which has enormous risks.“By China taking the step to move quickly to military action, which has now resulted in loss of lives, I think it has put itself on the opposite side of the United States, which is arguing more loudly than ever for a rules-based community,” he added.“And so, even beyond the Trump administration’s own bilateral problems with China, I think they were left in absolutely no position but to support India on this count and I think even a Democratic administration would have done the same in these circumstances,” Tellis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-hopes-for-india-china-border-differences-to-end-reiterates-his-offer-to-help/story-BMIda4KHGe5qCvEORsM9bO.html
25-09-2020||World||Donald Trump promotes health care ‘vision’ but gaps remain||More than three-and-a-half years into his presidency and 40 days from an election, President Donald Trump on Thursday launched what aides termed a “vision” for health care heavy on unfulfilled aspirations.“This is affirmed, signed, and done, so we can put that to rest,” Trump said. He signed an executive order on a range of issues, including protecting people with preexisting medical conditions from insurance discrimination.But that right is already guaranteed in the Obama-era health law his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissively said Trump’s “bogus executive order on pre-existing conditions isn’t worth the paper it’s signed on.” Democrats are betting heavily that they have the edge on health care this election season.Also read: Trump non-commital on peaceful transfer of power after electionTrump spoke at an airport hangar in swing-state North Carolina to a crowd that included white-coated, mask-wearing health care workers. He stood on a podium in front of a blue background emblazoned with “America First Healthcare Plan.” His latest health care pitch won accolades from administration officials and political supporters but failed to impress others.“Executive orders issued close to elections are not the same thing as actual policies,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser with the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works on a range of health care issues, from coverage to quality.Trump’s speech served up a clear political attack, as he accused Democrats of wanting to unleash a “socialist nightmare” on the US health care system, complete with rationing. But Democratic nominee Joe Biden has rejected calls from his party’s left for a government-run plan for all. Instead, the former vice president wants to expand the Affordable Care Act, and add a new public program as an option.Trump returned to health care amid disapproval of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and growing uncertainty about the future of the Obama-era law.In a rambling speech, he promised quality health care at affordable prices, lower prescription drug costs, more consumer choice and greater transparency. His executive order would also to try to end surprise medical bills.“’If we win we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions,” Trump declared.But while his administration has made some progress on its health care goals, the sweeping changes Trump promised as a candidate in 2016 have eluded him.The clock has all but run out in Congress for major legislation on lowering drug costs or ending surprise bills, much less replacing the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare.”Pre-election bill signing ceremonies on prescription drugs and surprise medical charges were once seen as achievable — if challenging — goals for the president. No longer.Trump’s speech Thursday conflated some of his administration’s achievements with policies that are in stages of implementation and ones that remain aspirational.Also read: Trump says he’s ‘not a fan’ of Meghan’s, wishes Harry luck as ‘he is going to need it’Democrats are warning Trump would turn back the clock if given another four years in the White House, and they’re promising coverage for all and lower drug prices.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Trump’s executive order would declare it the policy of the US government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if the ACA is declared unconstitutional. However, such protections are already the law, and Trump would have to go to Congress to cement a new policy.On surprise billing, Azar said the president’s order will direct him to work with Congress on legislation, and if there’s no progress, move ahead with regulatory action. However, despite widespread support among lawmakers for ending surprise bills, the White House has been unable to forge a compromise that steers around determined lobbying by interest groups affected.Health care consultant and commentator Robert Laszewski said he’s particularly puzzled by Trump’s order on preexisting conditions.“So, after 20 years of national public policy debate and hard-fought congressional and presidential approval, how does Trump conclude he can restore these protections, should the Republican Supreme Court suit overturn them, with a simple executive order?” asked Laszewski.The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the president’s order is not the equivalent of Obama’s law. “Should the administration succeed in its case to throw out the law, the executive order will offer no guaranteed patient protections in its place,” said Lisa Lacasse, the group’s president.For Trump, health care represents a major piece of unfinished business.Prescription drug inflation has stabilized when generics are factored in, but the dramatic price rollbacks he once teased have not materialized. In his speech the president highlighted another executive order directing Medicare to pay no more than what other nations pay for medications, but it remains yet to be seen how that policy will work in practice, if it can overcome fierce opposition from the drug industry.Trump said Medicare recipients will soon receive a card that they can use to save $200 on medications. “I will always take care of our wonderful senior citizens,” he promised.More broadly, the number of uninsured Americans started edging up under Trump even before job losses in the economic shutdown to try to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Various studies have tried to estimate the additional coverage losses this year, but the most authoritative government statistics have a long time lag. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says his best guess is “several million.”Meanwhile, Trump is pressing the Supreme Court to invalidate the entire Obama health law, which provides coverage to more than 20 million people and protects Americans with medical problems from insurance discrimination. That case will be argued a week after Election Day.The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has added another layer of uncertainty. Without Ginsburg, there’s no longer a majority of five justices who previously had voted to uphold the ACA.Democrats, unable to slow the Republican march to Senate confirmation of a replacement for Ginsburg, are ramping up their election-year health care messaging. It’s a strategy that helped them win the House in 2018.A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found Biden had an edge over Trump among registered voters as the candidate with the better approach on making sure everyone has access to health care and insurance, 52% to 40%. The gap narrowed for lowering costs of health care: 48% named Biden, while 42% picked Trump.Trump was unveiled his agenda ahead of a two-day swing to several battleground states, including the all-important Florida. There, he held a rally in Jacksonville and was scheduled to court Latino voters at a roundtable in Doral on Friday. Then he’ll fly to Atlanta, Georgia, to deliver a speech on black economic empowerment. He’ll end the day with another rally in Newport News, Virginia.The scramble to show concrete accomplishments on health care comes as Trump is chafing under criticism that he never delivered a Republican alternative to Obamacare.“We’ve really become the healthcare party — the Republican Party — and nobody knows that,” he said Thursday. “The news doesn’t talk about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-promotes-health-care-vision-but-gaps-remain/story-d6Sms0144dWtuA7X6ZoyVL.html
25-09-2020||World||Anger on US streets as cops let off over Black woman’s death||Anger, frustration and sadness over the decision not to charge Kentucky police officers for Breonna Taylor’s death poured into America’s streets as protesters lashed out at a criminal justice system they say is stacked against Black people. Violence seized the demonstrations in her hometown of Louisville as gunfire rang out and wounded two cops. Police said they would enforce a strict curfew for the next two nights in Louisville.Activists, celebrities and everyday Americans have been calling for charges since Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white policemen after one of them was shot while bursting into her home during a narcotics investigation on March 13. The cops had a no-knock warrant but the investigation showed they announced themselves before entering, said state attorney general Daniel Cameron, a Republican and the state’s first Black top prosecutor.A grand jury returned three charges of wanton endangerment on Wednesday against fired officer Brett Hankison over shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.Demonstrators chanted Taylor’s name and marched in cities including New York, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Portland. People gathered in Chicago’s Millennium Park, chanting demands for justice as drivers on Michigan Avenue honked their horns. Police in Atlanta unleashed chemical agents and made arrests after protesters tried to climb on a SWAT vehicle. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, marchers peacefully blocked highway traffic.In Louisville, one of the wounded cops was treated and released with a leg wound, while the other was shot in the abdomen and doing well after surgery. Larynzo Johnson, 26, was charged with two counts of assault on a policeman and multiple charges of wanton endangerment of police officers.White House hopeful Joe Biden called for police reforms in response to the grand jury’s decision. He said that while a probe continues, “we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna”.US President Donald Trump tweeted that he is “praying for the two police officers that were shot” in Louisville.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anger-on-us-streets-as-cops-let-off-over-black-woman-s-death/story-qHQ2AIBCaDfIq5uXVudagK.html

The study, which has not yet been reviewed by outside experts, found that nearly all strains in the second wave had a mutation, known as D614G, which has been shown to increase the number of “spikes” on the crown-shaped virus.The researchers said patients infected with the variant strain had higher amounts of the virus on initial diagnosis. But there was little evidence mutations in the virus have made it deadlier.Meanwhile in the UK, chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday announced another multi-billion-pound package that includes the exchequer picking up parts of the wage bill of all employees until April 2021. The package includes extension of VAT relief, loans to struggling companies and extension of grants to the self-employed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-contagious-virus-strain-dominating-in-us-says-study/story-ej5Q175Xot0m8PrXbO0YhN.html

25-09-2020||World||Cracks in oppn alliance, with help from army||Within days of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s hard-hitting speech challenging the army’s interference in Pakistan’s politics, a grand opposition alliance created to unseat the Imran Khan government appears to be crumbling. Not surprisingly, this comes with a little nudge from the military. While the government was unable to counter most allegations levelled by Sharif, it was the army that sprang into action with leaks and statements that created rifts in not only the opposition alliance but in Sharif’s own PML-N party, pitting his brother Shahbaz Sharif on a collision course with his daughter and political heir Maryam Nawaz. The first statement after the speech came the next day from army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, who told a select group of parliamentarians the military didn’t have a role in politics. He said the military didn’t play any part in recently passed Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-related legislation, working of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and political proposals for Gilgit Baltistan (GB). Insisting that the political leadership was responsible for these matters, Bajwa conceded broad-based consultation was necessary on GB because of its strategic importance. While this debate was gathering momentum, it was leaked that key opposition leaders had met Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed days ahead of the all-party conference. Railways minister Sheikh Rasheed, seen to be close to the military, disclosed this and taunted the opposition for criticising the army and meeting with it at the same time. This leak embarrassed most of those who attended. Shahbaz Sharif confirmed the meeting while Bilawal clarified they attended a briefing on national security, a matter that is usually kept secret. In a hurriedly called press meet, Bilawal justified the meeting because PM Imran Khan had failed to engage with the opposition on national security issues during his tenure, such as worsening ties with India following the Pulwama attack. He said GB was discussed at the meeting. Soon after, Maryam Nawaz criticised her allies and took a potshot at her uncle and party president Shahbaz Sharif for meeting the military. She told the media on Wednesday, “They (opposition leaders) were called [to the GHQ] on the issue of Gilgit-Baltistan. This is a political issue that should be settled by the people’s representatives... These issues should be decided in Parliament, not in the GHQ.” Railways minister Rasheed then disclosed that the PML-N leadership had held not one but two meetings with the military leadership in the past two months. But Maryam’s statement appeared to have upset the military, with the head of its media wing, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, disclosing that senior PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair held two meetings with Gen Bajwa in recent weeks to discuss the issue of Nawaz Sharif and his daughter. Iftikhar said both meetings were “requested” by Zubair, who “talked about Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz”. He added, “The army chief made it clear to [Zubair] that whatever their legal issues are, they will be solved in Pakistan’s courts, while political issues will be solved in parliament.” While the army seems to have won the latest round, it is clear the issue of military interference in politics will continue to be debated. It has also shaken the Khan government, which is being accused of coming to power through a rigged election. Analyst Kamran Yousaf said the days of the government may soon be over and another set-up cobbled with consensus could take charge. But others disagree. Most analysts say Nawaz Sharif’s speech stirred a hornet’s nest, and his contention that the army is a “state above a state” will echo in the corridors of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cracks-in-oppn-alliance-with-help-from-army/story-w47OLQrAgtLcjtyEvShJNN.html

This was among a list of the seven agenda approved by the cabinet on Thursday.“We have now formally created the rules where individuals can sell their homemade wines in the market,” chief minister, Conrad K Sangma told journalists after a cabinet meeting. He affirmed that this strategic move by the state government would go a long way in helping farmers producing a variety of fruits in the state to sell their products locally which can then be value added by the local winemakers.Also read: India, Japan to kick off naval drills in Arabian SeaThe CM assured that there shall not be any heavy encumbrances on the local winemakers to encourage more productivity and generate employment as well. He said, “The state government has ensured that the ad valorem that is paid by these winemakers will be much lesser as compared to other products. Rs 100 per case will be the ad valorem fees and winemakers will not have to pay VAT,” he categorically stated, further adding, “we have also ensured that the license fee will be only Rs 7,500 and (it can be availed) by individuals from different cooperative societies or different companies who are interested.”Welcoming the decision of the government, president of the Meghalaya Wine Makers Association Michael Syiem, who has been in the forefront of the demand since the beginning, told HT, “We are very happy at the decision today and we feel it is the rightful culmination of a long and arduous campaign by all stakeholders.”He felt that the move will not only go a long way in boosting the horticultural sector of the state, tourism and generate revenue for the state exchequer but once it blossoms into a cottage industry, “it will also help generate much-needed employment”.Syiem quipped, “Look at it this way. Amid all the chaos, anxiety, fear due to the ongoing pandemic, at least we have something to cheer about.”Also read: PM Modi’s speech at UNGA to focus on global push to counter terror18 years ago, on the second Saturday of November, Syiem’s Club, Forever Young Sports and Cultural Club organised the first-ever Wine Festival which has now grown into an annual event attracting winemakers and tourists from across the state and even other parts of the North East and the country who converge in Shillong every second Saturday of November to showcase and sell their homemade products.Another senior member of the association and an accomplished winemaker in his own right, Bryan Daly Kharpran, felt that this was a right step in the right direction. He felt that such a move will streamline the entire process right from the beginning itself plugging existing loopholes and lacunae.Speaking to HT, he said, “From now onwards there will be an established process of monitoring the process such as the use of correct ingredients (presently many use baking yeast instead of wine yeast), professional bottling with sealed caps and not just a silver foil over an open cover, wine is properly filtered and not cloudy as some turn out these days amongst many other aspects of the whole process.”Kharpran was also very clear that this decision of the government will ensure that the final product would have a certain standard and quality within the framework of food and consumable guidelines. “That way spurious products will remain off the shelf and people can truly savour quality and safe wine made out of the abundant varieties of indigenous fruits,” he asserted.The plains and hills of Meghalaya are home to many fruits from which wine can be made such as Sohiong (Prunus Nepalenses), Soh Mon (Meyna Laxiflora), Soh Mylleng (Officininalis Orientalis), Soh Phan (jackfruit), Soh Phoh (Indigenous fruit of the pear family), Soh Brap (passion fruit), Mandarin orange, mulberry, litchi, ginger, banana, pineapple and strawberry, amongst a host of others fruits available in abundance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wave-of-cheer-meghalaya-government-legalises-homemade-wine/story-dI5wLnMVmptoGHJ1uSc7iI.html
25-09-2020||India||Indian delegate walks out of Imran’s speech at UN||New Delhi The Indian delegate at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York walked out of the hall when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s pre-recorded statement was played on Friday. The delegate, a junior diplomat named Mijito Vinito from the 2010 batch of the Indian Foreign Service, picked up his papers and left the hall as Khan’s speech was played on a large overhead screen. Khan raised the Kashmir dispute, as he has done in several recent speeches to multilateral bodies, and criticised the Indian government on several issues. After Khan’s speech, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, tweeted that the country would use the “right of reply” facility to respond to the Pakistani premier’s address. “PM of Pakistan statement a new diplomatic low – at 75th UN General Assembly. Another litany of vicious falsehood, personal attacks, war mongering and obfuscation of Pakistan’s persecution of its own minorities & of its cross-border terrorism. Befitting Right of Reply awaits,” Tirumurti said in his tweet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the UN General Assembly through a video statement on Saturday.Earlier in the day, in a thinly veiled attack on Pakistan, India told the UN Human Rights Council on Friday that banned terror groups are collecting funds amid the Covid-19 pandemic ostensibly for charitable activities that would be diverted to finance terrorism. There are also “malevolent attempts by terrorists to exploit the financial and emotional distress caused by the lockdowns to disturb the cohesiveness of societies”, Pawan Badhe, first secretary in India’s permanent mission in Geneva, told a debate on human rights situations that require the council’s attention. “The increased presence of people online and on social media has been targeted by terrorists to disseminate misinformation through hate speeches, fake news and doctored videos,” he said. “The intent has been to entice and establish links with vulnerable individuals and recruit them in their cadres. Terror groups have also exhorted supporters to target security forces and health workers,” he added. Another disturbing trend, Badhe said, was the “collection of funds by proscribed terrorist outfits ostensibly for undertaking charitable activities, but which, in reality, would be used to finance terror”. Though India’s intervention in the debate didn’t name any country, it was apparent the reference was to Pakistan. India has repeatedly accused Pakistan of failing to counter fund-raising and recruitment by UN-designated terror groups operating from its soil, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. “Terrorism is the grossest affront to the enjoyment of the inalienable human right to life and to live in peace and security. It poses a serious threat to economic and social development, undermines democracy and jeopardises the rule of law,” Badhe said. He described terrorism as “an attack against freedom of thought, expression and association” and said: “While acts of terrorism violate the rights of individual victims, it also deeply affects the enjoyment of a range of rights by the families of the victims and society as a whole. Any terrorist incident disproportionately affects the human rights of women, girls and children.” The UN Human Rights Council cannot remain immune to the “devastating human rights impacts” of terrorism, and it needs to play a key role in creating awareness about protecting the rights of the most vulnerable groups, particularly children and youngsters, to prevent their radicalisation and indoctrination by terrorist ideologies, he said. “As the world grapples with Covid-19, it is important to cooperate among states coherently to fight against terrorists, whose disruptive activities have continued and, in fact, increased during the pandemic,” Badhe said. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-delegate-walks-out-of-imran-s-speech-at-un/story-yzIkAZztQ9Xd1PwmkI3EUP.html
25-09-2020||India||Polls set to be a litmus test for Grand Alliance||PATNA: After facing a humiliating defeat in the 2019 parliamentary polls, the upcoming Bihar assembly election is a litmus test for the opposition bloc, Grand Alliance( GA) comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal(RJD), Congress and smaller parties. The coalition won only one of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.Since then, the alliance has suffered the loss of one ally -- former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) -- and many senior leaders within the RJD have questioned the choice of Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial candidate. Rashtriya Lok Samata Party( RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha is peeved over a delay in seat-sharing arrangement and has called the 32-year old Yadav a “ poor opponent” to chief minister Nitish Kumar’ . But Yadav is unfazed. “ We have always respected allies but if some body questions leadership of other parties, it is not right. Our alliance is with Congress, left and people of Bihar,” said Yadav. “Tejahswi is already declared as CM face of RJD and he is face of the GA. There is no issue of leadership in GA,” said RJD state president Jagdanand Singh. In 2015, the GA banked heavily on the caste arithmetic and was successful in building a coalition of backward castes, Dalits and Muslims -- winning 178 of the 243 seats. RJD won 80 seats and Congress 27 This time, without JD(U), HAM-S, and possibly RLSP, the coalition may not be as successful. “ For the RJD and GA, it is a do and die battle. If they do not make a visible presence in the polls, they will be wiped out in next five years,” said, Shaibal Gupta, founder member secretary, ADRI ( Asian Development Reserch Institute), Patna.The absence of RJD chief Lalu Prasad -- who is in jail on corruption charges -- is another crisis for the RJD as experts say it will be difficult to project a charismatic face to unite backward castes, Dalits and Muslims. “ It is true, Laluji is not physically present on the election ground. But he is present psychologically and in hearts of people especially poor and oppressed sections,” said RJD Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson of the party, Manoj Jha.A favourable verdict for the GA may also boost the Congress and other Opposition forces in the national political arena. “Bihar assembly polls importance is crucial nationally as the verdict would have its connotations in national politics.If the GA wins, the verdict would help the Congress and other like minded parties to intensify its opposition against the farm bills, decline in economic growth and have its impact in coming polls in various states. If the NDA wins in Bihar, the BJP will get portray the verdict as validation of the farm bills and other initiatives taken by it in recent months,” said, D M Diwakar, former director, A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polls-set-to-be-a-litmus-test-for-grand-alliance/story-jzB0GSravAC1uz0KcJRObN.html
25-09-2020||India||Delivered on all promises: Nitish||PATNA:Hours after the schedule for assembly elections in Bihar was announced on Friday, chief minister Nitish Kumar underlined that he delivered on all promises made during the 2015 election campaign and pledged to take his development agenda forward if voted back to power.Kumar said his government would launch phase II of the “seven resolves”– which comprised social schemes to provide amenities such as piped drinking water, toilet construction and providing power connections – that was the mainstay of his campaign in 2015.“In a democracy, voters are the master. They have to take a call and decide whom they want to give a chance,” Kumar said.Kumar, also the Janata Dal (United) president, said that phase-II would include enhancing skill of youths to brighten their jobs prospect, promoting entrepreneurship among women by providing them financial assistance, irrigation facility to every agriculture field and additional health facilities for people and animals.“A promise is a promise. I will never waiver on delivery,” he added. Kumar, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term, sought to contrast 15 years of his rule with 15 years of Rashtriya Janata Dal, which was in power between 1990 and 2005.Kumar fought the 2015 election as an ally of the RJD and part of the Grand Alliance but broke away in 2017 and joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) following corruption allegations against RJD members.“All sectors in state witnessed all-round growth. We would like to carry forward our Seven resolves-Part 2. It will focus on the next level of development and have provisions for maintenance of the infrastructure thus created. We will construct and maintain it, on the pattern of present initiative for road and bridges. The new resolves will be finished in next five years,” said Kumar. The chief minister made a slew of promises.He said the NDA government will endeavour to provide access to irrigation facility for every farmer, while highlighting the benefits of student credit card in promoting higher education. Kumar also tried to silence the opposition and alliance partner Lok Janshakti Party by emphasising on the training of young people. “Every district will have mega skill centre and create a skill department,” he said. Kumar also announced programmes to develop entrepreneurship among women. “Women will get special assistance of Rs 10 lakh and we will provide Rs 25,000 to the girls passing intermediate exams and Rs 50,000 to the girls who will graduate,” said Kumar.He said that villages would henceforth be clean and equipped with solar lights and solid waste management facilities. Every town will have a centre for old people along with better healthcare facilities in rural areas.“People of state have decided to oust Nitish Kumar from the power as they feel cheated by the act of CM of hijacking the mandate,” said Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Tejashwi Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delivered-on-all-promises-nitish/story-nJjy5VwLrNOjsejLyn23BP.html
25-09-2020||India||Odisha assembly session begins next week; 2 farm, 1 labour bill on agenda||The Odisha government would bring 12 bills replacing 12 ordinances, including three on contract farming, APMC regulation and allowing companies to sack its workers or close down its units, during the monsoon session of the state state assembly beginning on September 29.The assembly session would be very short in view of the rising infections among the MLAs and ministers with half of the 147 members of the Assembly testing positive for Covid-19. At an all-party meeting convened by speaker Surya Patro on Friday to discuss the conduct of the session, it was decided that there would be no Question Hour and the House will run for four hours everyday. The House will run on Sunday too.The bills are Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (promotion and facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming Services (promotion and facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 and Industrial Disputes Odisha Amendment Ordinance, 2020.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims at registration of farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity by way of land, soil management, seeds, saplings, fingerlings, inputs, feed and fodder, technology and other such services much like the the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill that was passed by Parliament early this week.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (promotion and facilitation) Bill, 2020 seeks to amend the Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Amendment Act, 1957 so as to provide for geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce including livestock across the state and country.The new Bill once passed, would remove the necessity of market yards or sub-market yards, for conducting agriculture marketing activities. Instead there would be a principal market yard and sub-market yard managed by the APMC, a private market yard managed by a person holding a licence granted by the director of Agriculture Marketing and electronic trading platforms (where trading of notified produce is done electronically through the internet). Another important legislation that would be tabled during the monsoon session is Industrial Disputes Odisha Amendment Bill 2020 that exempts a sizable portion of small factories from the purview of Factories Act, 1948, and allows companies with up to 300 workers to sack people or close down units without prior approval of the government. The amendment is seen as a major step to facilitate investment, generate employment and counter the hardships caused to MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) due to covid-19 pandemic by way of creating a more conducive and business friendly atmosphere.Another important Bill that the state government plans to bring is Epidemic Disease Amendment Bill, 2020 to amend Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 for increasing the imprisonment to two years or with fine which may extend up to Rs 1 lakh over non-adherence of Covid-19 guidelines. The amendment is seen as significant as Covid-19 caseload in Odisha has crossed 2 lakh putting the state among top 8 Covid affected states of the country.Assembly speaker Patro said to ensure that no Covid-19 infected person enters the assembly, RT-PCR test of all MLAs and their staff will begin from Saturday morning and sitting arrangements have been made keeping in view the social distancing norm. There would be another round of RT-PCR tests 5 days after the session begins. Those MLAs who can’t come to attend the session can join it from their respective districts through video conferencing facility from district headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-assembly-session-begins-next-week-2-farm-1-labour-bill-on-agenda/story-8yHPTwcNVt4wWbhzVhrBDL.html
25-09-2020||India||Delhi records 3,827 new Covid-19 cases; active cases, containment zones on the rise||Delhi on Friday reported 3,827 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pushing the total positive count past the 264,000 mark. The national capital also witnessed 24 new deaths on Friday, logging the cumulative death toll at 5,147.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday the city has gone past the peak of its second wave of the disease outbreak. Right after Delhi had crossed the first wave in July, Kejriwal had said that “we must be prepared” if Covid-19 cases peak again.Even as the national capital put the aftermath of the second wave behind, it still faces an uphill challenge with active cases rising this month. Delhi has 30,867 active cases, out of which 18,906 are being treated in home isolation. Compared to August, active cases of the coronavirus disease have risen three-fold from 9,000-10,000 to more than 30,000 in September.Containment zones in Delhi have also witnessed an upward trend. As of Friday, Delhi has 2,124 containment zones – almost four times more than the city had in mid-August. The Capital added more than 300 containment zones in the last one week.A total of 59,134 tests were conducted on Friday. While the positivity rate for Friday in Delhi stands at 6.47 per cent, the cumulative positivity rate in Delhi has been recorded at 9.39 per cent. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in Delhi has been marked at 1.95 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-3-827-new-covid-19-cases-active-cases-containment-zones-on-the-rise/story-xsOIZBGYx4WRQDCCKs3hpM.html
25-09-2020||India||‘Will challenge farm bills in Supreme Court’: Punjab finance minister||Punjab’s finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Friday said the Central government wanted to enforce the Bihar model of agriculture for farmers across the country, “but the Punjab government will challenge the three farm bills, passed by Parliament recently, in the Supreme Court”.“In the Bihar model, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) has been scrapped and the farmers there are getting 30 percent lesser price for their produce than what the farmers in Punjab get. The Punjab government will challenge the three farm bills in the Supreme Court. Agriculture is a state subject and the union government has no right to interfere in a state’s matter,” said Badal while speaking to the media at Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters. He was in the state to convey the party’s stand on the farmers’ issues.Also read: Congress, NCP say no to farm bills in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena to decideBadal said the three bills make no mention of minimum support price (MSP) and if the BJP government was sincere about the interests of farmers, it could have added provisions about the MSP in these bills. The minister said that under the proposed laws, corporates would be allowed to do business with farmers without checks and the government would not be able to enforce the MSP. He said the Punjab government would soon declare the whole state as a ‘mandi’ in the interest of farmers.Badal further said that by getting the three bills passed in Parliament without any debate, the BJP government has exposed its anti-farmer stance. He said after assuming power, the BJP government had promised to double the income of farmers. The minister quoted statistical data to make his point that agriculture growth was down to 3.1 percent during the BJP government’s tenure - lowest in the past 14 years, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-challenge-farm-bills-in-supreme-court-punjab-finance-minister/story-gOc8cITNq05QQuIdxRUo8M.html
25-09-2020||India||Odisha Covid-19 cases touch 2 lakh, temporary shutdown in some places||As Covid-19 infections in Odisha touched 2 lakh on Friday on the back of 42,000 new cases in the last 10 days alone, the state swiftly climbed to the eighth position among the top 10 states with Covid patients, overtaking Telangana and Bihar.On Friday, Odisha recorded 4,208 new cases taking the total to 2,01,096 and 15 more deaths taking the total fatalities to 767. While the first lakh cases came in 169 days, the next lakh came in 27 days due to rising positivity rate and increased testing. The positivity rate on Friday was around 8 per cent higher than India’s rate of 5.7 per cent. The average positivity rate over the last 10 days has been 8.6 per cent.Officials said the districts of Khurda, Cuttack and Puri alone have registered more than 32,000 cases this month as they continued to be the hotspots while the infection was fast spreading in 15 other districts - Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Jharsuguda, Balasore, Angul, Kandhamal, Nabarangpur, Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Sonepur, Mayurbhanj, Kendrapara, Bargarh, Bhadrak and Nuapada.The rising infections in these districts have taken the total number of active cases to 34,844, but health department officials said there is little cause for worry as more than 75 per cent of the infected were in home isolation. “The health teams of respective districts are in regular touch with the patients in home isolation. However, we are shifting serious patients to hospitals. We have enough beds for people who need ICU and ventilators. We expect the cases to plateau by the beginning of October,” said PK Mohapatra, additional chief secretary of the health department.Though the state government claimed that the situation was well under control, opposition leaders questioned the state government’s statistics on Covid death toll. With at least 30-40 bodies being cremated at Bhubaneswar’s only crematorium everyday, opposition leaders alleged that the actual Covid death toll may be higher. “Whenever you visit the crematorium, you can find cremations underway. The government should come clean,” said Choudhury.Similarly, BJP leader Bhrigu Buxipatra alleged that the state government is putting up false data. “Ganjam, which used to be the epicentre of Covid a month ago, has not recorded many deaths due to Covid, though patients had tested positive for the virus. The government simply attributed the deaths to some other reasons. If you see the government statistics, the death toll due to Covid is mostly within 10-15 on an average. This is data management,” he alleged.Buxipatra and Choudhury said the recent government directive on not subjecting all dead bodies to Covid test was a ploy to keep the death toll low. “Why could not the government conduct Covid test on the dead patients? Many persons have died showing Covid like symptoms over the last 3 months,” said Choudhury.Well-known microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra said the state government directive on not conducting Covid tests on dead bodies was baffling. “There is no such guideline from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on not conducting the Covid tests on the dead. It seems the state government is exploiting the silence of the ICMR on it,” he said.However, commissioner of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, Prem Chandra Choudhury, said the rise in cremation in Bhubaneswar was due to diversion of bodies to the city instead of Swargadwar crematorium in Puri.“Many of the bodies that are being cremated are from nearby districts and not all deaths are due to Covid,” he said.Meanwhile, the Jharsuguda district administration banned selling of roadside fast food from Friday due to lack of social distancing by consumers. District Collector Saroj Kumar Samal said roadside vending of fast food and other joints will not be allowed for 15 days in Jharsuguda district as people were not adhering to social distancing and mask guidelines.In Nayagarh district, the district collector on Friday ordered a two-day lockdown on September 29 and 30 for complete sanitisation. In Bolangir town, the local traders started a week-long shutdown from Friday as Covid-19 cases went up. Though the district administration said it is not going to impose any shutdown as per the Central Government’s guidelines, the traders association appealed to the businessmen to down their shutters during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-covid-19-cases-touch-2-lakh-temporary-shutdown-in-some-places/story-8Iij3DE8eo82TU32bfEHAJ.html
25-09-2020||India||‘Defections on the rise,’ claim TMC and BJP in poll-bound West Bengal||With around six months left before West Bengal goes to assembly polls, defection of supporters and local leaders in the districts have increased, claim both ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Almost every day, the parties are circulating photos and videos of people crossing over from either side. On Thursday, for example, the BJP tweeted about around 100 families from a minority community that supported the TMC at Baduria in the North 24 Parganas district that have now joined the BJP “to strengthen the arms of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and overthrow the TMC”. Also read: ‘Will never waver...’ - Confident Nitish spells out plans for next termThe tweet appeared barely two hours after the party posted that more than 100 minority community members, who earlier supported the TMC and the CPI(M), joined the BJP in the South 24 Parganas. This happened less than a day after the TMC tweeted that the BJP’s West Midnapore district minority cell general secretary Rajdeep Guha, trade union leader Sailendra Singh, president of the BJP’s Kharagpur north unit president Ajay Chattopadhyay and the same area’s local unit president Sajal Roy joined the ruling party. Without these leaders, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh could not have won the Midnapore Lok Sabha seat, claimed TMC leaders. On Tuesday, the TMC announced that 100 BJP workers and a former BJP youth front leader shifted their allegiance to the ruling party in Hooghly districts. The same day, the TMC said that 250 BJP workers led by their local general secretary left the saffron camp at Cooch Behar district in north Bengal region where the BJP won seven out of eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019.The switching of camps has sharpened the rhetoric in the poll-bound state.“The TMC had claimed for years that the BJP is an insignificant force in Bengal. And now, when it can see the writing on the wall, the ruling party is trying to project that it is not a spent force because people from the BJP are joining it in such large numbers,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. “Those who have joined the TMC are small functionaries. We are not worried at all. Mamata Banerjee should make tall statements if heavyweight leaders such as Mukul Roy and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who left her, return to the TMC. We feel pity for her,” added Majumdar. TMC Lok Sabha member and spokesperson Saugata Roy said the exodus from the BJP is a fallout of the call Banerjee gave two months ago. “While addressing party workers at the TMC’s martyrs’ day programme on July 21, she asked deserters to return home. We are seeing the effect now. The BJP may claim that hundreds of TMC workers are joining it, the reality is quite the opposite. Reverse migration has started,” said Roy.Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay feels that the desertions in both camps have been triggered by aspirations.“In the BJP, a lot of young leaders and party workers are returning to the TMC because their political aspirations have not been fulfilled. This is mainly because of an apparent lack of coordination between the party’s state and central leadership. On the other hand, a section of TMC workers are leaving in the hope of getting something that they cannot achieve in the ruling party,” said Bandopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defections-on-the-rise-claim-tmc-and-bjp-in-poll-bound-west-bengal/story-gWK3N3hsM8n4hJJEO2WxGI.html
25-09-2020||India||Maharashtra health minister asks doctors to work 7-day rotation in Covid-19 hospitals||Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said doctors treating coronavirus patients in designated hospitals should work in rotation- seven days in Covid-19 section and as many days in non-COVID section with one-day holiday in between.He said doctors should follow this pattern instead of working in Covid-19 sections for seven to 15 days and getting home-quarantined for a week.Tope said this rotation system would address the issue of shortage of doctors to some extent.He was addressing a press conference after reviewing the coronavirus situation in Maharashtra’s East Vidarbha. He visited goverment hospitals in Bhandara, Gondia and Nagpur to take stock of the situation.“Every doctor should work in Covid-19 department, except the senior doctors having comorbidities. They should work in rotation. It has been observed that after working for seven to 15 days in Covid-19 section, doctors go for one week of home quarantine,” he said.“But doctors in some big private hospitals work in rotation of seven days in COVID section followed by one day holiday and then seven days of work in non-COVID department, followed by a day off,” he said.“I feel that considering the requirement of doctors now, this system of getting home-quarantined for seven days is inappropriate,” the minister added.According to him, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) would soon issue a circularabout seven- day duty rotation.“This will address the issue of scarcity of doctors to some extent,” he said.Tope stressed the need to increase contact tracing, optimum utilisation of RT-PCR tests and added that home isolation for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms must be encouraged.Tope also asked the Nagpur administration to increase beds for Covid-19 patients in Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) as well asprivate facilities. He suggested that hospitals operated by the railways and Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) be roped in for treating coronavirus patients.The minister said that hospitals empanelled under the state government’s ‘Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana’ scheme should allot 25 per cent beds for non-COVID patients.“There are 20 packages under the scheme available in 32 hospitals in the district. The administration should create awareness among people as some hospitals are misusing this scheme. The administration should also charge five times fine from those hospitals found overcharging,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-health-minister-asks-doctors-to-work-7-day-rotation-in-covid-19-hospitals/story-TbT9cYMqPIbJU3fluPalLJ.html
25-09-2020||India||Parties have to publish details of candidates with criminal records: EC||Political parties will now have to mandatorily publish details of candidates with pending criminal cases on party websites and social media platforms, and provide reasons for their selection so that voters can make an informed choice. Following the Supreme Court’s directions in February this year, the Election Commission had in March asked political parties to justify why they chose candidates with criminal history to contest elections. Assembly elections in Bihar to be held in three phases would be the first full-fledged polls where such details of their candidates would be made public by parties. The parties will also have to explain why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates. “The reasons as to selection shall be with reference to the qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned, and not mere winnability at the polls,” the Commission said on Friday. “It is mandatory for political parties (at the central and state election level) to upload on their website detailed information regarding individuals with pending criminal cases who have been selected as candidates, along with the reasons for such selection, as also as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates,” the Commission said. The information will also be published in one local vernacular newspaper and one national newspaper. Besides it would also be shared on the official social media platforms of the political party, including Facebook and Twitter, the EC explained. Earlier this month, the EC had made the norms of publicity of criminal antecedents of candidates stringent by putting a timeline on when such advertisements should be published and broadcast during electioneering. In October, 2018, the Commission had issued directions making it compulsory for candidates contesting elections and the parties fielding them to advertise their criminal antecedents in TV and newspapers at least three times during electioneering. Now, the EC has made it clear that the first “publicity” of criminal records should be within first four days of the last date of withdrawal of candidature. It said the second publicity should be between fifth and eighth day of the last date of withdrawal. The third and final publicity should be from ninth day till the last day of campaign -- two days prior to polling day. “This timeline will help the voters in exercising their choices in more informed manner,” a statement by the Commission said. An EC official said the timeline would ensure that the advertisements attract the public eye. There was a feeling that candidates time the publicity of their criminal records in such a way that it fails to grab attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-have-to-publish-details-of-candidates-with-criminal-records-ec/story-LZstKk7NWrLVWkEj9cQsbM.html
25-09-2020||India||West Bengal proposes to set up rail fences to rein in elephants||Old railway tracks may now be used to restrict or divert movement of elephants in south Bengal. The West Bengal government is planning to set up fences with these old tracks along with a range of other barriers, including trenches and electric fences, to restrict the movement of these jumbos in the reserve that have been created for them.“As a short term measure, we are planning to put up some barriers like fences made out of old railway tracks, electric fences and digging trenches to restrict the movements in south Bengal. The plans haven’t been finalised though. Discussions are being held. We are also going to dig trenches in some areas along the Bengal-Jharkhand border,” said Rajib Banerjee, forest minister of West Bengal. The issue was discussed in a workshop held on September 22 for the preparation of the national elephant action plan. Top forest officials of various states of the east central elephant division, which comprises south Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, north Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh attended the meeting along with experts.“One of the issues raised by West Bengal was how to check the scale of man-animal conflict in south Bengal. For that it is necessary to ensure that the elephants stay within the elephant reserve and do not stray outside in search of food and water. If necessary, some need to be translocated,” said Raman Sukumar, noted elephant expert who attended the meeting.Data laid down in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday revealed that at least 433 people have been killed across West Bengal between April 2014 and September 2019. In Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattishgarh, the death toll was 447, 391 and 329, respectively, during this period.The idea of putting up barriers to restrict or divert movement of elephant herd is, however, not new to West Bengal. Local community has also been involved in the past to put up and maintain fences in the villages. “The concept of rail fencing may be new to West Bengal but it has been tried out in the recent past in Karnataka. It has been found to be successful as claimed,” said Mukti Roy ,another elephant expert present in the meeting.A recent booklet published by the union environment ministry suggests that rail fencing though expensive is eco-friendly and more effective than solar electric fences and elephant proof trenches which are partially successful. Railway fencing however was criticised after an elephant got stuck in the fence and died in 2018 near the Nagarhole National Park in Karnataka. “But apart from these short term measures we also need to go for habitat improvement in the Mayurjharna elephant reserve without which the elephants can’t stay there. For these long term planning and inter-state coordination is necessary,” said Roy. While south Bengal has around 200-220 elephants, the Mayurjharna reserve is around 414 sq km. Experts, however, said the reserve has to have an area of 1000 sq km which could help it sustain a sizeable population of elephants. North Bengal has around 500 elephants. “While workshops for three elephant divisions including south India, north-east and east-central have already been held, the workshop for the north-west division is likely to be held on September 30. Based on the deliberations of these workshops the draft for the national elephant action plan would be prepared,” said Prajna Panda, National coordinator of the elephant cell of union environment ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-proposes-to-set-up-rail-fences-to-rein-in-elephants/story-AmM72MHN1L0J0tbrhlLmvM.html
25-09-2020||India||Congress, NCP say no to farm bills in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena to decide||Two parties - Congress and the NCP - of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition have declared that they will not implement the farm laws which were passed amid huge protests in Parliament on Sunday. The Shiv Sena, whose chief minister Uddhav Thackeray heads the government, is yet to make its position public on the issue, though it has been criticising the central government over the bills.Deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress leader Ajit Pawar said that the farm as well as the labour bills will not be implemented in the state. State revenue minister and Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said that all ruling parties are against the newly enacted laws and the decision of not implementing them in the state will be taken collectively after due deliberation.The Congress and the NCP supported the nationwide protest by farmers to oppose the passage of three farm bills. Various farmer organisations like Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Lok Sangharsh Morcha held protest marches, blocked highways, burnt copies of the bills and formed human chains in at least 21 districts in Maharashtra on Friday to oppose the bills. The farmer organisations have announced to intensify the protest if the bills are not withdrawn by the central government.“These bills were passed in the haste. We are studying the legalities of the bills. Have taken a call to not implement them in the state,” said Ajit Pawar. His cabinet colleague Balasaheb Thorat also spoke against the bills. “We have been opposing them tooth and nail. We will discuss the laws among us to take steps against their implementation in the state,” said Thorat.The Shiv Sena has invited criticism by Maharashtra BJP leaders for its ‘hypocritical stance’ of supporting the bills in the Lok Sabha and walking out in the Rajya Sabha.“The issue will be discussed in the coordination committee of three parties. Our stand this time was similar to the one taken during the CAA debate in Parliament early this year. But on farm issues we would not support the bills and their implementation in Maharashtra. The stand will be clarified in due course,” said a Sena functionary requesting anonymity. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, led by former MP Raju Shetti, burnt the copies of the bills in Kolhapur. “Shetkari Sanghatana has always been against the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and our leader late Sharad Joshi used to call these committees ‘abattoirs’ of the farmers. However we do not endorse the way the existing system of farm produce marketing is being thrashed out by the central government. This is nothing but an attempt of making farmers slaves in the hands of industrialists,” Shetti said. He said that it is the step towards privatization of the Food Corporation of India and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), who purchase about 30% of the farm produce.Ajit Nawale, general secretary, ABKS, said that the protests were held in 21 districts of the state by farmers.“At least the farmers have some mechanism in place to market their produce at a reasonable price in the form of APMCs today. The bills passed in Parliament are the first step towards handing over farm marketing to a few industrial houses who will decide the prices of the produce. Though the Centre has been claiming these bills are a way to free farmers from the clutches of APMCs, the government has freed itself from the responsibilities of fair and remunerative prices to the farmers. In Maharashtra, the Fadnavis government had brought bills to regularise APMCs, but it could not set up an alternative mechanism to the APMCs to give farmers remunerative prices for their produce. It was a failed attempt,” he said.Farmers from Thane, Palghar, Nashik held rasta roko on national highways, including Mumbai-Jaipur-Delhi. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress announced a programme to be implemented over next five weeks to oppose the farm bills.The party has announced to organise a drive #SpekaUpForFarmers on social media to garner support against bills, virtual farmer rally and gather signatures from 1 crore farmers opposing the bills.Senior Congress leader HK Patil, who has been recently appointed as Maharashtra Congress in-charge, said in a press conference in Mumbai, “Under pressure from big industries, Modi government passed the farm and labour bills which will uproot and destroy farmers and workers in the country. The bills will bring back the feudal zamindari system in the country. The laws should be immediately repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ncp-say-no-to-farm-bills-in-maharashtra-shiv-sena-to-decide/story-88on4s2gYzcTS2vkDjmJ1I.html
25-09-2020||India||EC announces poll dates: Understanding the Bihar elections||Bihar will elect its 17th assembly in a three-phase election between October 28 and November 7 — the first mass poll to be held in the middle of a pandemic. Nitish Kumar, this time leading the National Democratic Alliance’s fight in the state, will be eyeing a fourth term as the state’s chief minister. Here are two things which can help understand the forthcoming contest in Bihar:Caste equations will continue to matter, but they could also be changingAccording to the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey, almost half of the state’s population belongs to Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. Scheduled Castes and Muslims are the other major social groups in the state. To be sure, there are layers of stratification, as far as political preferences are concerned, within these broad social groups. In fact, this has been a conscious strategy of Nitish Kumar, who has created and cultivated categories such as Extremely Backward Classes and Mahadalits. It is this vote bank, rather than support from his own sub-caste (Kurmi), which makes Nitish Kumar a valuable ally in Bihar. While this section voted for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Janata Dal (United) and Congress alliance in 2015, it supported the NDA in a big way in the 2019 elections. Even the traditional Yadav support base of the RJD might be becoming weaker. Only 55% of Yadavs, once considered staunch loyalists of Lalu Prasad, voted for the RJD-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The grand alliance was able to make the 2015 elections into an upper caste versus lower caste issue by using RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement asking for review of reservations. No such polarisation seems to be happening as of now. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Seat shares as well as strike rates are importantThis is the first assembly election in Bihar when the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) will also be a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). This has already led to a lot of friction over seat sharing, with the LJP demanding a higher number. The RJD-led opposition is facing a similar crisis, as it has been unable to sort out its alliance with the Congress, Left parties and other smaller players. Both the RJD and Janata Dal (United) have always been senior partners in their alliances in Bihar. But this time, the RJD is having to negotiate the alliance from a position of weakness; it failed to win even one Lok Sabha seat in 2019. The Nitish Kumar-led government, on the other hand, has been facing criticism from its own alliance partner, LJP, giving an impression that it is the JD(U) which shall bear the burden of anti-incumbency.Contesting the most number of seats, however, is no guarantee of getting a larger number of MLAs in Bihar. The RJD and the JD(U) contested equal seats in the 2015 assembly, but the RJD had a better strike rate. Similarly, the BJP ended up with a bigger seat tally in the 2010 elections, despite contesting fewer seats than the JD(U). Both the seat-distribution and strike rates will matter for the individual fortunes of parties this time as well. The strength of major parties in the new assembly will also decide their bargaining power in future political negotiations, not just government formation.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-announces-poll-dates-understanding-the-bihar-elections/story-79Sb5KU4gib30ECkMafeIM.html
25-09-2020||India||After talks with Yediyurappa fail, farmers to go ahead with Karnataka bandh||A delegation of farmers who met chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday said that they would go ahead with their proposed statewide bandh on Monday after talks failed between the two parties.The group accused the state government of “trying to preach, rather than listen” to their grievances.Farmer organisations have been protesting on a clutch of bills proposed on the farm sector, including those which allow purchase of agricultural land by non-agriculturists, as well as amendments to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, allowing farmers to sell outside Mandis to private players. Farmer organisations claim that these acts as well as proposed changes to the electricity act in the state would be detrimental to their interests.Kodihalli Chandrashekar, President of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Kurburu Shanthkumar, President of Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association, Badagalapura Nagendra and a host of other farmer leaders who met the CM said that Yediyurappa refused to withdraw the bills which were tabled during the monsoon session of the Karnataka assembly.“He is not willing to go against (PM) Modi’s orders. He merely offered to tweak one of the provisions regarding ceiling of landholding as per Land Reforms Act. This was clearly not enough. So we are left with no choice but to go ahead with the protests,” Chandrashekar told HT.On Friday the state also witnessed sporadic protests with traffic being blocked in some parts due to farmers’ agitation on the issue.Meanwhile, JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy indicated that his party is unlikely to support the ‘no-confidence’ motion moved by the Congress against the government.Saturday is the last day of the ongoing monsoon session and the motion will be taken up for debate and voting.Speaking to reporters, Kumaraswamy said, “I don’t know how serious they (Congress) are about the motion. If they were they would have discussed with us earlier itself.”The government enjoys a clear majority with 117 seats in the 224-member assembly, with Congress having 67, JDS 33, three independents and four vacant seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-talks-with-yediyurappa-fail-farmers-to-go-ahead-with-karnataka-bandh/story-s63PhsARsyeqs7JepLgzEJ.html

All our voices are also together with the loud voices of the peasant brothers and today the whole country is opposing these agricultural laws,” Gandhi’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.किसानों से बातचीत करके एक बात साफ़ हो गयी- उन्हें मोदी सरकार पर रत्ती भर भी भरोसा नहीं है। किसान भाइयों की बुलंद आवाज़ के साथ हम सब की आवाज़ भी जुड़ी है और आज पूरा देश मिलकर इन कृषि क़ानूनों का विरोध करता है।#ISupportBharatBandh pic.twitter.com/r2Xhuy10wfThe former Congress president also shared a three-and-a-half-minute video speaking to farmers from several states via a video conference call. Gandhi, who was hosting the talk, was heard asking farmers to explain how the new farm bills would affect them. Farmers were heard explaining their apprehensions regarding the minimum support price (MSP) and food procurement practices.“A flawed GST destroyed MSMEs. The new agriculture laws will enslave our Farmers,” the Congress lawmaker from Kerala’s Wayanad had tweeted earlier in the day with a hashtag ISupportBharatBandh.Farmers from Bihar, Maharashtra, Haryana and other states who joined Gandhi for the discussion also highlighted that they will have no recourse when private players, who they fear that the bills empower, take over the agricultural sector.Farmer groups across the nation have called for strikes against the three bills passed by both the Houses of Parliament during the Covid-19 hit monsoon session.The three bills which were passed are Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The Congress has announced it will stage marches in every state after which memorandums will be submitted to the respective governors on September 28 against these farm bills, which it says are against the interests of farmers and farm labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-have-lost-all-faith-in-pm-modi-led-govt-rahul-gandhi/story-l6epQzT66B0V5oWWiiY8mN.html

The incident is being viewed as a hate crime.The scarred body of the victim, said police, was found at an isolated place in Telangana’s Sangareddy district in the early hours of Friday.Madhapur deputy commissioner of police M Venkateshwarlu told reporters that the victim was beaten up by the relatives of his wife and his body was dumped in the fields.“Though the couple is from an upper caste, the victim was not financially strong. The girl’s parents, on the other hand, are rich,” the police said.The couple had known each other for four years. On June 10, the girl left her parents’ house and married the victim at a temple. The couple had been staying independently,” Venkateshwarlu said.Later, the girl filed a complaint with the Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar, claiming threat to her husband’s life from her parents.“The Chandanagar police called the girl’s father and his relatives and counselled them against causing any harm to the man and his parents,” the DCP said.On Thursday evening, around 10 people came in three different vehicles to the victim’s house and forced the couple to come with them for negotiations with his parents, said the police. However, the girl managed to escape and immediately alerted her in-laws and they, in turn, alerted the police.“We booked a case of abduction at Gachibowli police station in the evening and started searching for the man and the abductors. Finally, we found his body on Friday morning,” the DCP said.He said the police had arrested 13 persons, including teh girl’s maternal uncle, who had confessed to have committed the murder.The victim’s father said that the girl’s family was against the match.“But we had to accept their marriage after they convinced us. But her family resisted the affair and she was forced to marry him secretly,” said the victim’s father.The girl lamented that her parents had chosen to kill her husband.“They had a problem with me and so they should have killed me. I did not expect anything from parents,” the girl claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-abducted-hacked-to-death-in-telangana-hate-crime/story-e5Ek5UDSBJD2Mn4cfMWacP.html
25-09-2020||India||High-speed train, Quad figure in 1st call between Japan’s Suga, PM Modi||India and Japan committed themselves on Friday to take forward the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail project and welcomed a memorandum of cooperation on specified skilled workers to be signed in the near future. Both issues figured in the first phone conversation between Japan’s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Suga said he will promote bilateral cooperation in security and economic matters and work with India to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific. Days ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, to be hosted by Japan, Suga also said he would promote cooperation through the grouping. The foreign ministers of the Quad, which also includes Australia and the US, are expected to meet in Tokyo in early October. Suga replaced Shinzo Abe, who had established a close working relationship with Modi and put in considerable effort to revive the Quad over the past three years. The two prime ministers “affirmed their intention to steadily advance the high-speed rail project” and welcomed the fact that the memorandum of cooperation on specified skilled workers would be signed in the near future, according to a readout from Japan’s foreign ministry on the 25-minute conversation. The text of the agreement on specialised skilled workers has been finalised by the two sides. India has focused on similar agreements with several countries to ensure better mobility for its skilled professionals in fields such as information technology. The commitment to India’s first bullet train project is significant as the venture has been hit by delays and other issues, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The 508-km project is being built with an 80% loan from Japan with an interest rate of 0.1% and a 15-year moratorium on repayments. Though the target date for completing the project was December 2023, it is now expected to be completed in late 2028. Several tenders for key aspects of the project were floated last year but are yet to be finalised, and the total cost of the link is now expected to be more than the original estimate. Suga “expressed his intention to promote bilateral cooperation in the fields of security, economy and economic cooperation, and to work with India towards achieving a ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’,” the Japanese readout said. He also said he would promote cooperation in multilateral mechanisms such as the “Japan-Australia-India-US meetings and the United Nations as well as on issues related to North Korea”, it added. Modi and Suga agreed the special strategic and global partnership between India and Japan has made “great advances over the last few years” and expressed their intention to strengthen the relationship on the basis of mutual trust and shared values, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry. They also agreed that the bilateral partnership is more relevant in view of current global challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic. “They emphasised that the economic architecture of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region must be premised on resilient supply chains, and in this context, welcomed cooperation between India, Japan and other like-minded countries,” the Indian statement said. Suga also mentioned that bilateral ties had developed significantly “under the mutual trust between” Abe and Modi, and said he too would continue to advance the special partnership. The two prime ministers shared the view that the annual India-Japan summit meeting should be resumed after the situation related to the pandemic improves. Modi invited Suga to visit India for the summit after the improvement of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-speed-train-quad-figure-in-1st-call-between-japan-s-suga-pm-modi/story-wAJLBxngXFZ5LnouWv5GHO.html

In some areas, they came out on roads with their tractors. In Kumaon’s US Nagar, farmers held demonstrations across the district and came out on to the roads with their tractors in Rudrapur, Kichha, Kashipur and other places in the district. Congress and Aam Aadmi Party workers and leaders also extended their support to the farmers. US Nagar is considered the grain bowl of Uttarakhand. In Rudrapur, farmers gathered at the old grain market with tractors. Addressing the protesters, farmers’ leader and organiser of the protest, Tajendra Singh Virk alleged that the Central government wants to sell farmers into the hands of the multi-national corporate sector. “Farmers are already suffering due to losses, now these bills will further affect the agriculture sector and hit farmers,” he said. In Kashipur, Ravindra Rana, state president of Bhartiya Kisan Union said, the government ought to have consulted the farmers’ bodies before passing the bills. “Government has no right to decide the fate of the farmers like this”, he said. In Kichha, Bazpur, Sitarganj and Khatima also, farmers staged sit-in protests against the bills. Also read: UP farmers join nationwide bandh over 3 farm bills in a big wayThe farmers are protesting the three farm bills - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 - which were passed by both Houses of Parliament during the monsoon session recently and await Presidential assent.

25-09-2020||India||India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism record||India on Tuesday mounted a sharp attack on Pakistan during a virtual meeting of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, accusing it of sheltering and supporting terrorists and pushing a false narrative on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary (counter-terrorism) in the external affairs ministry who led the Indian delegation for the webinar organised by the UN body, pointed out the meeting was being held on a day when the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked by a Pakistan-backed terror group 12 years ago and Indians and Afghans were killed.“It is very unfortunate that a country which perpetrated terrorist attacks in Mumbai (2008), Pathankot (2016), Uri and Pulwama is now preaching to the world community,” Singhvi said in his intervention during the meeting with the theme “The global scourge of terrorism: Assessment of high risk threats and trends including the rise of violent extremism and hate speech in a pandemic environment”.“While the world is coming together to battle the pandemic, it is unfortunate that Pakistan, a state which sponsors cross-border terrorism, continues to use every opportunity to peddle false narratives and make baseless, malicious and egregious allegations against India and interfere in our internal affairs,” he said, adding that the statement by Pakistan’s representative at the meeting was part of this pattern.Singhvi added, “Even as Pakistan provides shelter and support to terrorists, it continues to peddle a false and motivated narrative on the situation in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is seeking to portray its military, financial [and] logistical support to cross-border terrorism against India as a freedom struggle. It is also peddling misinformation about India’s domestic legislation and policies.”The webinar was part of the UN body’s virtual counter-terrorism week, and Singhvi pointed out that terrorists have made innumerable attempts to infiltrate India “from their safe abodes across the border to carry out attacks and have even used unmanned aerial systems to smuggle weapons across our borders”.At the global level, terrorists have tried to exploit financial and emotional distress caused by the pandemic, and used the increased presence of people online and on social media to disseminate misinformation through hate speech, fake news and doctored videos, he said. Another disturbing trend is the collection of funds by proscribed terror groups ostensibly for charitable activities but which would be used to finance terror, he said.Singhvi described Pakistan’s statement claiming credit for eliminating al-Qaeda as “ludicrous” and said the group’s founder, Osama Bin Laden, was recently glorified as a “martyr” by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Parliament. “This is a chilling reminder of the patronage that international terrorists receive in Pakistan,” he said.Khan had publicly acknowledged the presence of up to 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the UN Security Council had reported that about 6,500 Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are operating in Afghanistan, he said.“Pakistan’s role as epicentre of terrorism has been well documented by numerous international organisations including UN and FATF. Unlike Pakistan, India does not make any distinction between terrorists and invariably condemns terror attacks anywhere in the world, including the one in Karachi, referred to by Pakistan’s representative in his statement,” Singhvi said.The Indian official also criticised human rights violations in Balochistan, Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the discrimination against religious and cultural minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-targets-pakistan-at-un-body-over-counter-terrorism-record/story-0q59jnaxMz5U4ZwSgHSJeI.html
25-09-2020||India||ADB approves USD 570 mn loans for urban projects in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh||The Manila-headquartered Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Friday said it has approved two loans totalling USD 570 million (about Rs 4,200 crore) for urban sector projects in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. ADB said it has approved a USD 300 million loan to develop Rajasthan’s secondary towns and a USD 270 million loan for Madhya Pradesh Urban Services Improvement Project. In a statement, ADB said the USD 300 million loan has been approved to finance inclusive water supply and sanitation infrastructure and services in secondary towns of Rajasthan. “The project is expected to build citywide access for improved water supply services for around 5,70,000 people and enhanced sanitation services for about 7,20,000 people in at least 14 secondary towns. These localities have 20,000–1,00,000 residents,” it said. It further said that through the project, water supply systems in at least eight project towns are expected to improve by 2027, with about 1,00,000 households, including all urban poor households, benefiting from five new or rehabilitated water treatment plants and 1,350 kilometres of distribution networks. Citywide sanitation systems based on the most cost-effective solutions will also be developed, it said, adding that the project will build on three earlier related projects and sector reforms funded by ADB in Rajasthan. In another statement, ADB said it has approved a USD 270 million loan for construction of water supply and integrated storm water and sewage management infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh. The loan is an additional financing intended to scale up the scope of the Madhya Pradesh Urban Services Improvement Project, which was approved in 2017 with a USD 275 million loan. It will expand the outcome of the current project by benefiting an additional 1,85,000 households consisting of about 1.3 million people, ADB said. “The project will receive support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, specifically for the integration of Citywide Inclusive Sanitation principles into the planning, design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the sanitation subprojects,” it said. As in the previous loan, ADB said, the project will support the continued institutional strengthening and capacity building of the Urban Development and Housing Department and Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adb-approves-usd-570-mn-loans-for-urban-projects-in-rajasthan-madhya-pradesh/story-kW9upxBSfCv3wwwIgwBl1J.html

25-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand CM orders probe after minister claims IAS officer ‘missing’||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has ordered an inquiry after a minister of his complained that a senior IAS officer V Shanmugam was missing from office. Others say that the officer had “applied for leave” and was under home quarantine. The direction came after the minister for women empowerment and child development Rekha Arya on September 22 wrote to deputy inspector general Dehradun to find Shanmugam. The minister feared that the officer was abducted as she could not contact him for two full days. Arya, in the letter, also alleged that the IAS officer “may have also gone underground to save himself from the irregularities found in the ongoing recruitment process in her department”. She had claimed that the bureaucrat couldn’t be contacted. However, later it was found that he was in home quarantine at his residence. Media coordinator of the CM, Darshan Singh Rawat, confirmed the development and said, “The CM ordered the inquiry in the whole matter after speaking to chief secretary (CS) Om Prakash on Thursday evening.”Additional chief secretary Manisha Panwar will oversee the inquiry. “As per the directions, I have started the inquiry. However, I cannot reveal the details of it before the media and would submit the inquiry report only to the CS (chief secretary),” Panwar told reporters.Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “The minister has raised some issues pertaining to irregularities in her department which she has every right to do so. An inquiry will be done in that and action would be taken against any officer found guilty.” When contacted, Saujanya (only uses first name), secretary women empowerment and child development department, said that Shanmugam, who is the director women empowerment and child development, had “applied for leave before going under home quarantine”.“He had applied for leave as per the operational procedure before going under home quarantine citing health grounds,” she said. V Shanmugam could not be contacted despite several attempts.The episode has come into light amid the allegations by ruling party MLAs and ministers in the last few months that bureaucrats don’t listen to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-orders-probe-after-minister-claims-ias-officer-missing/story-6306MtyRRr36pjHnYNRzII.html
25-09-2020||India||‘Global climate strike’: Youngsters, activists take to streets in Delhi, demand action||Several school children and youngsters took to Delhi’s streets on Friday demanding climate action from authorities as part of the Global Climate Strike. From socially distanced sit-ins to demonstrations at Vijay Chowk, climate activists across the national capital put forward their demands to the authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic.A group of protesters had gathered at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on Friday afternoon demanding inclusive, attainable environmental plans, among other things. Their list of demands included saving the Aravallis, improved sewage treatment plants to tackle pollution in the Yamuna, decentralized waste system, and better environment education in schools.“Most of the climate activism groups were continuing with digital strikes. The global Fridays for Future gave the call for a strike all over the world and we decided to join for the physical strike this time,” said Srijani Datta, who recently graduated from school.Protesters said they were adhering to social distancing norms and reducing the risk of spread of infection by carrying their own sanitisers, consumables and posters.Also read: DNA of 3 men killed in Shopian encounter matches with family - J&K police“Since we are building back from the pandemic, you want them to do so in a green and socially just manner. That would include maybe investing in renewables and creating green jobs in the solar and wind sector among others, investing in public and non-motorised transport,” she said.Before Covid-19 lockdown, school children and youngsters across the national capital were participating in the global ‘Fridays for Future’ movement. As a part of the strike, the protesters took to the streets on Fridays —at least once a month— to protest the government’s inaction to curb climate change. The movement was inspired by teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who started the school strikes demanding change against climate change and other environmental issues.Another group of protesters did a shoe strike outside the Prime Minister’s office. Bhavreen Kandhari, one of the organisers, said less than ten people had gathered keeping in mind Covid-19 regulations. Yet, officials detained four protesters.“Since children cannot come out in large numbers and protest due to the pandemic, we placed shoes and other footwear outside to make our point and demand action. Every pair of shoe represented a Climate Striker who have been demonstrating had it not been for the pandemic,” she said.Requesting anonymity, a senior police officer said, “No one was detained. There were three to four minors who were removed from there but not detained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-climate-strike-youngsters-activists-take-to-streets-in-delhi-demand-action/story-67gC6GF2HvYe9W9g8K7MfP.html

He said that ideology was wrong, not linked to the motherland and traditions,” Nadda said in the virtual address.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also addressed BJP workers earlier in the day in an event to mark the occasion. “I was not lucky to have seen Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji in person but his thoughts, the path shown by him, and his ideology give us inspiration and energy,” Modi said during the address.“Deendayal ji’s contribution will inspire generations to come. For BJP workers it is the path which he has shown that is encouraging and inspiring,” he also said.Union home minister Amit Shah in his tribute message on Twitter called the late leader “master of Indian politics” and said, “as an excellent organiser, Deendayal ji laid the foundation of alternative politics which is today doing the work of bringing poor, deprived, and exploited class in the mainstream of development.”“His life is an example of social harmony and patriotism,” Shah also said.Born on September 25, 1916, in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura district, Upadhyay became the president of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in December 1967.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deendayal-upadhyay-rejected-nehruvian-model-says-bjp-president-jp-nadda/story-KzM79NRhtvqfn9cQorstzI.html
25-09-2020||India||SC reserves order on refund of cancelled air tickets during lockdown||A day after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) informed the Supreme Court that its credit shell scheme will not be open for lockdown flights that originated outside India, the Solicitor General on Friday informed the apex court that a concession could be made in this category for tickets that were booked in India.This crucial clarification came on a day when the court concluded arguments on a PIL filed by Pravasi Legal Cell and reserved orders on the scheme to be made available for passengers seeking refund on tickets booked for travel during the lockdown beginning March 25.Concerns over the exclusion of this category were raised during the hearing by the counsel for the Pravasi Legal Cell and other intervention applications moved on behalf of passengers. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, pointed out that much prior to the lockdown, Indians working in the Gulf had booked tickets for travel to and from India. “As per the Government’s latest affidavit, we will be eligible for refund for one side travel only even though our tickets were booked at Air India offices in the Gulf,” Hegde said.Hegde was referring to the DGCA’s affidavit filed on Thursday which said, “The ambit of the regulatory mechanism of the DGCA does not cover international flights, which originate from any foreign destination. It is stated that the said flights are governed by the regulatory mechanism of the country of origin, irrespective of the fact whether the carrier is Indian or not….issue of refund of tickets/credit shell of such international flights would be governed by the law of such sovereign country from where such international flights originate.”Advocate Puneet Jain representing another passenger claimed that his client’s tickets were booked on both sides between Delhi and New York. “As per the DGCA decision, how can I approach the US regulatory authorities for refund.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “If the ticket is booked within the jurisdiction of our country, you will certainly be entitled for refund.” The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah recorded this submission before closing arguments in the case.As per the scheme proposed by the DGCA, immediate refund will be available for tickets booked during the lockdown period (March 25 to April 14). For tickets booked prior to March 25 for travel up to May 24 (as calibrated domestic operations recommenced from May 25), the airline will be liable to refund within 15 days, failing which it must create a credit shell in the name of the passenger to be availed for travel on any route within March 31, 2021. Interest of 0.5 per cent till June 2020 and thereafter 0.75 per cent would accrue on the credit shell that will be transferable and if unused, will return to the passenger with interest after March 31, 2021.Airlines such as GoAir demanded the court to consider extending the refund deadline of March 31, 2021 by another six months. Senior advocate Arvind Datar appearing for GoAir said, “In two months we have disbursed Rs 40 crore refund and have to still repay Rs 266 crore. Our flights are operating at 60 per cent strength, prices have been capped, fuel charges have increased and we have to pay salaries to our workforce. From today, the deadline to make a full refund expires in six months. If this scheme has to work, the deadline must be extended to September 30, 2021.”Senior advocate Pinaki Mishra, appearing for Vistara and AirAsia, objected to the interest component on the credit shell. He said, “On fixed deposits, the current interest rate is 5.5 per cent. Why are airlines asked to pay higher interest? We will go completely bankrupt.” IndiGo Airlines also pleaded financial distress but backed the DGCA’s refund scheme. The bench said it will consider the plight faced by airlines in its order.The travel agents told the Court that many of the international tour agents had put their money for booking tickets. In the event of refund, the credit shell should be created in the name of the agent and not the passenger. Mehta suggested a way out. He said, “The credit shell is transferrable. We have no objection if the passenger would like to surrender the travel voucher to the travel agent. But this has to be ordered by the Court as the Centre has no regulatory mechanism over travel agents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-order-on-refund-of-cancelled-air-tickets-during-lockdown/story-KDwlpIz2WSTdi2H63z4RXM.html
25-09-2020||India||Family of terror suspect believed he was working in Saudi for 12 years||The family members of the Saharanpur resident Mohammed Gulnawaz, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from a Kerala airport for his alleged terror links earlier this week, were under the impression that he had been working in Saudi Arabia for the past 12 years, said senior officials of Uttar Pradesh Anti Terror Squad (ATS) after verifying his details over the last two days.However, as per the investigation, Gulnawaz was based in Dubai and was allegedly involved in terror funding through hawala (illegal money transfer channels). His name allegedly surfaced in connection with terror funding during an NIA investigation in 2016.On the other hand, his family members said Gulnawaz had left the house at the age of 20 to work in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and did not return.“His father, Qameel, was in a deep shock when informed about Gulnawaz’s arrest for terror links. For him, he (Gulnawaz) was the most hardworking among his three sons. His father stated that he only knew that Gulnawaz was away from the family to earn and give them a good lifestyle,” said an ATS official privy to the investigation.Also read: Farm bills - Farmers protest, block Delhi-Noida road at Sector 14-AThe official said the family had no clear idea about the company which employed him in Saudi Arabia. He said Gulnawaz’s two brothers, Shahnawaz and Ahtesham, also worked in Saudi Arabia. While Shahnawaz returned home during the Covid-19 outbreak, Ahtesham was still in Saudi Arabia, he added.“Our team reached the Saharanpur address of Gulnawaz which was shared by the NIA. His family, comprising five members, including his parents and a brother, were found living there. They were not aware of Gulnawaz’s involvement in any terror activities,” said UP ATS additional director general (ADG) of police Dhruv Kant Thakur.“We are waiting for further inputs from the NIA and information extracted from Gulnawaz on the basis of which the investigation will proceed further.”Earlier, Gulnawaz was arrested from Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram international airport on Tuesday for his alleged links with terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Al Qaeda. A senior UP ATS official said Gulnawaz was also suspected to be involved in serial blasts in Bengaluru on July 25, 2008, in which one person was killed and 20 others were seriously injured.The official said two others were arrested and sent to jail in connection with those blasts while Gulnawaz managed to sneak out of the country. He said Gulnawaz’s name also surfaced in connection with terror funding through ‘hawala’ network in 2016. After that, the NIA had issued a lookout notice for him and was looking for him.Gulnawaz’s arrival at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport was revealed by three alleged Al-Qaeda operatives held by the NIA after a raid on a migrant workers’ settlement in Kochi in the early hours of Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/family-of-terror-suspect-believed-he-was-working-in-saudi-for-12-years/story-P99ZebVgedCqnI72BPDGkI.html
25-09-2020||India||Always this swift to demolish? HC’s piercing query to BMC in Kangana Ranaut case||The Bombay high court on Friday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) if it always acts with the same swiftness to demolish other unauthorised structures as it did with actor Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow. The high court has asked the civic body to explain why it did not proceed against Ranaut under provisions of the law that would have required the corporation to give the actor sufficient time to respond to the charges.The bench also remarked that Pradeep Thorat’s client (Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut) had indeed done what he said, a reference to the title of an article in Sena mouthpiece Saamana ‘Ukhad diya’ (uprooted) that was seen to link the BMC action to the Sena leader. The article was published after parts of the actor’s Pali Hill bungalow were demolished on September 9.The bench has asked the BMC to explain why it had carried out the demolition in the ground floor when there was no ongoing work and asked for details of the workmen alleged to be carrying out the alterations when the premise was inspected. The court’s observations and directions came after Kangana Ranaut’s lawyer told the high court that the BMC had invoked section 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act to initiate action against the actor’s building which pertains to ongoing work at a construction site. Senior counsel Birendra Saraf, who represented the actor in the proceedings, told the two-judge bench that there was no ongoing work at the premises when the BMC staffers claimed to have detected the unauthorised construction on September 5 and September 7.The court has asked the BMC to produce the phone of the mukadam who detected the unauthorised construction in Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow on September 5 to verify if the photographs of the alleged ongoing unauthorised alterations and additions were taken on that day. The report of the unauthorised construction is reported to have provoked the BMC team’s inspection of the building on September 7. Birender Saraf contended that the real reason for the demolition wasn’t the discovery of the unauthorised construction but Kangana Ranaut’s tiff on social media with the Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut over she called out the government.The two-judge bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla is hearing Kangana Ranaut’s petition - initially filed to seek a stay on the demolition on September 9. She later sought compensation of Rs 2 crore for the damage to her property caused during the demolition.Kangana Ranaut told the high court that she had photographic evidence to back up her claim that the unauthorised alterations and additions alleged by the BMC in its notice were completed in 2019. This could be established by photographs taken in January 2020 during a pooja that was held on the premises.Birender Saraf told the judges that the actor was a public-spirited person and had taken to social media to criticise the government for its handling of various issues that led Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut to target her. The senior lawyer added that the demolition was carried out at the behest of Raut since she had countered and confronted him on social media.Ranaut’s team told the court that there were several discrepancies and contradictions in the two BMC affidavits filed on September 10 and 17 and asked the judges to get the BMC to provide complete details of the detection, inspection and stop work notices issued as well as provide any evidence that some work was going on at the bungalow in the first place. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy who represented BMC along with advocate Joel Carlos submitted that the actor was trying to improvise its arguments as she had not denied the unauthorised alterations and additions pointed out in the BMC notice. Chinoy further said that while only two demolished toilets would have been exposed to the rains, the rest of the demolition was internal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-bandra-office-demolitio-is-bmc-always-this-swift-to-demolish-asks-high-court-in-kangana-ranaut-case/story-0gYHbbb9btuvIol6uWQTAO.html

I tell everyone that though I come from a small settlement, still I dream big and know how to achieve those dreams.” It was during his second-year in college that Aashish joined theatre in Delhi. “I joined theatre and did a number of plays with different groups before joining an international modelling agency as their face and shifted to Mumbai. I did a big commercial and simultaneously started doing theatre and acting workshops,” he said. He did a number of editorial shoots, ads and commercials that made him survive in the industry. “As I have no industry background so this was how I was learning and earning both. I auditioned throughout my stay for almost all production houses till I got a call from Ekta Kapoor’s production house for their ongoing show ‘Kasauti Zindagi Kay’ and finally I got the show. I’m still doing the daily and along with it I have finalised a few scripts too.”Talking about his Lucknow connection he said, “In my teens all my focus was cricket.

25-09-2020||India||UP farmers join nationwide bandh over 3 farm bills in a big way||Farmers in Uttar Pradesh, like their counterparts in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country, on Friday took to the streets in protest against the contentious farm bills passed by Parliament recently.Friday’s was the first major protest in UP, unlike Punjab and Haryana that have been on the boil since the bills cleared the Parliament hurdle. Responding to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by various farmers’ bodies and supported by opposition parties, the farmers blocked state and national highways, organised tractor rallies and held demonstrations disrupting traffic for three-four hours in several districts of the state with police having a tough time dealing with protesters. There were reports of clashes between police and protesters in some districts, including Shrawasti and Kannauj. The opposition parties, who lent their support to the farmers by joining the cause in various districts, included Samajwadi Party, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and left parties.With Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a farmers’ organisation with a strong presence in several states of north India, being in the forefront, the impact was most visible in the Jat-dominant western UP districts that were on high alert with heavy police deployment. BKU state president Rajveer Singh Jadaun claimed Friday’s ‘chakka jam’ was completely successful with wide support from traders and the public. He regretted that police tried to sabotage the peaceful agitation at some places.“Ours was a totally peaceful agitation and we ensured no emergency services, like movement of ambulances, were disrupted but some policemen, who wanted to spoil the state government’s image, unnecessarily misbehaved with and lathi-charged our people at some places,” he alleged. Reports of protests started trickling in right from the morning, with a group of Lucknow-bound farmers blocking the Lucknow-Ayodhya highway in Barabanki and burning crop waste on the road in protest. The farmers intensified the agitation as the day advanced. The protests lasted till about 3 pm.In Lucknow, farmers protested at the Shahid Path crossing as well as in Bakshi Ka Talab while other groups demonstrated on the highway near Akbarpur Mati in Kanpur Dehat and blocked the national highway in Gursahaigunj in Kannauj. In western UP, farmers blocked the Delhi-Noida highway, NH 58 in Muzafarnagar, Delhi-Saharanpur highway in Saharabpur, Meerut-Karnal highway in Shamli, Delhi-Pauri highway and Falauda road that connects Delhi to Haridwar and Dehardun etc. At some places, farmers were seen riding tractors with loudspeakers blaring patriotic songs while at others they were seen cooking food sitting on the road itself. In many cases, they parked their tractors on the roads to cause a blockade. Reports of similar road blockades came from Mahoba and Jalaun in Bundelkhand too. SP members joined the protests in various districts, including Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Agra. They submitted memorandums for the governor through the district administration demanding that the Centre withdraw the ‘anti-farmer’ bills.Congress workers took out a march in Varanasi, while AAP members and Allahabad University students staged protests separately in Prayagraj. CONTENTIOUS BILLSFarmers have strong reservations over some provisions of the three Bills— the Farmers’ Produce and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill — all passed by Parliament recently.“The three proposed laws, if enacted without suitable amendments, will be a sure recipe for disaster of small farmers,” Jadaun said. “We have three specific demands. First, it should insert clauses in the new Bills, stating that the minimum support price (MSP) system will continue. Second, maximum stockholding limit for traders will not be done away with and third, mandi fee will be abolished for all agri products sold and purchased within the mandi yards,” Jadaun stressed. He said BKU’s national executive will hold its meeting in a day or two to take a call on further course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-farmers-join-nationwide-bandh-over-farm-bills-in-a-big-way/story-UsS5X8MxqSv0W4rD4PF1ON.html
25-09-2020||India||Covid-19, dengue double infection treatment complicated; needs balanced approach: Experts||There is “no standard protocol” for treatment of patients who have contracted a double infection of Covid-19 and dengue, and a very “finely balanced” approach is needed to tackle both the ailments at once, experts said. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was shifted to LNJP Hospital on Wednesday for Covid-19 treatment and tested positive for dengue a day later. On Thursday evening, the 48-year-old AAP leader was shifted to the ICU of Max Hospital Saket here. He had tested positive for Covid-19 on September 14 and is perhaps the first prominent personality in the city to have been diagnosed with both infections. Medical Director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) B L Sherwal said both the diseases have no specific treatment, which makes it even difficult for treating doctors of such patients. “Both Covid-19 and dengue need symptomatic treatment and in some aspects the treatment is kind of contradictory and thus tricky. In Covid-19, we inject heparin drug subcutaneously which ultimately reaches the blood stream, and this is done to prevent embolism in these patients which can prove fatal,” he told PTI . Embolism is sudden blocking of an artery which can obstruct flow of oxygen, and that is why some patients get complications even after treatment, the doctor said. RGSSH is a dedicated Covid-19 facility run by the Delhi government. “In dengue, on the other hand, platelets infusion is needed in cases where its count has fallen to dangerously low level. So, it’s kind of opposite. And, therefore, we can’t inject heparin if a Covid-19 patient has dengue too,” Sherwal said. So, for a treating doctor it is like “walking a tight rope” and a very “finely balanced approach” is needed, he said. Vikas Maurya, Director and Head of Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh, also feels a balanced approach is needed in tackling the “double infection” of Covid-19 and dengue. “One will have to also see which disease takes preponderance in such a patient, and the course of treatment will depend accordingly. Both are spread by virus, so it is quite an unusual scenario for a doctor as well as the patient,” he said on Friday. Maurya also referred to a “study done by a university in Brazil along with an American varsity”. “Though the study is yet to be peer-reviewed, one of its findings was that in patients who had suffered dengue infection earlier had developed anti-bodies, and in some patients, a false positive result was coming for Covid-19, even with RT-PCR test. But it is too early to say anything,” he added. Rajesh Rautela, Medical Superintendent of GTB Hospital, said a doctor “will have to be like a juggler, balancing two things at the same time”. “So, best way is to take precautions and preventive measures to avoid stagnation of water where mosquitoes can breed. No medicinal cure is there for either of the two ailments, just symptomatic treatment, so people should be alert,” he said. Mugdha Tapdiya, senior consultant, internal medicine at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj said, “Diseases like malaria and dengue have overlapping symptoms with Covid-19, except where there are respiratory symptoms.” “If there is a co-infection with dengue in which there is a risk of hemorrhage, then management becomes very tricky. Similarly there is a capillary leak in dengue fever which is treated by intravenous fluids, whereas with co-infection of Covid-19, large intravenous fluid is a risk in the view of potential trial risk of ARDS and pulmonary oedema,” she cautioned Sources at LNJP Hospital on Thursday said “there is no standard protocol” for treatment of double infection of Covid-19 and dengue, and treatment is “patient-specific”. LNJP Hospital is the largest hospital under the Delhi government and a dedicated Covid-19 facility. “The patient’s age, condition, comorbidities and other factors are taken into account for treatment of both the ailments,” a source said. Asked if there are any side effects of treatments in cases of a “double infection”, the source said, “Any treatment can have a side effect, but the treating doctor decides the methodology for it”. A dengue patient, if his or her platelets level falls dangerously below the normal level, needs external platelets infusion. A normal platelets level is considered in the range of 1.5-4.5 lakh, according to doctors. “If a patient needs plasma for Covid-19 treatment, he can be administered that, and if he needs platelets that too can be infused. The treating doctor will decide the course of treatment,” the source said. Common symptoms of Covid-19 are high fever, breathlessness, cough, body fatigue and loss of sense of smell and taste. In dengue, a vector-born disease caused by aedes aegypti mosquito, a person runs high fever, suffers red rashes on skin, pain behind eye sockets, joint pain and in serious case internal bleeding which can prove fatal. “In about 10 per cent of dengue cases, a patient suffers haemorrhagic fever which leads to deaths. Internal bleeding can manifest through nose, gums and those are danger signs,” Sherwal said.

Headmaster Sapan Patralekh has turned roadside clay wall of village houses into blackboards and is conducting classes ensuring social distancing.Upgraded Middle School, Dumarthar village under Jarmundi block, is around 40 kilometres away from Dumka district headquarter and has around 290 students. Each student gets a separate blackboard keeping in mind social distancing norms. The school has four teachers, including the headmaster, and all attend classes in rotation.The innovative way of conducting school classes has caught the attention of people and authorities in the region.Headmaster Patralekh said having seen the closure of the school for a long time due to Covid-19, they thought students would forget their lessons if the lockdown continued. “The village is in a remote area where the facility of internet and mobile services are not available. So, in the interest of students, we decided to hold classes for them in a group at their own houses,” he said.“Since tribal kids learn wall painting easily, we decided to teach them by using the walls of their houses as blackboards. This way, we succeeded in attracting students,” Patralekh added.Also read: Bihar to vote on October 28, November 3, 7; results on November 10Teachers of the school, along with the villagers and guardians of students, managed to set up four points in the village where students - a batch of 50 each - could attend classes in rotation. Each teacher takes up one class point to attend.Every day, these students get dressed in their school uniform and sit outside their houses as per the school schedule. In order to save them from infection, each student is provided with chalk and duster. Teachers also get their blackboards where they write tasks for students. Students resolve their doubts by asking queries on their respective boards and teachers respond by answering on their own blackboards.Headmaster Patralekh said the credit for successfully holding these classes amid Covid-19 goes to the deputy commissioner who gives his inputs and direction from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walls-turn-into-blackboards-jharkhand-headmaster-s-innovative-way-to-maintain-social-distancing-for-students/story-FotdogBB7gjCddkZLwaAmI.html

The new process will help in quick resolution of about 4.6 lakh appeals pending at various levels in the I-T department. Of the total pending appeals, about 85% cases will be handled under the faceless appeal mechanism, it said.The Prime Minister last month announced three key structural tax reforms under the ‘Transparent Taxation - Honouring the Honest’ platform—faceless assessment, faceless appeal and taxpayers’ charter. While faceless assessment and taxpayers’ charter were formally implemented immediately, faceless appeal was scheduled to be launched on September 25.The technology-driven faceless assessment system also aims to end overreach by officials and the charter defines the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers.Also Read: CBI raids 3 in 2019 Vellore Lok Sabha cash-for-vote caseNow, I-T appeals will be finalised in a faceless manner with the exception of appeals related to serious fraud, major tax evasion, search matters, international tax issues and matters pertaining to black money, a finance ministry statement said.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said that now all income tax appeals, ranging from e-allocation of appeals, to e-communication of notices, e-verification, e-enquiry and e-hearing will take place online without the need for any physical interface between the appellant and the department.“There will be no physical interface between the taxpayers or their counsel/s and the Income Tax Department. The taxpayers can make submissions from the comfort of their home and save their time and resources,” it said.According to CBDT, the faceless appeal system will include the allocation of cases through data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) under a dynamic jurisdiction.

As part of this effort, a proposal for a clinical study to assess the role of Vasa Ghana, Guduchi Ghana and Vasa-Guduchi Ghana in therapeutic management of symptoms in Covid-19 positive cases has recently been approved…,” the ministry said in a statement.In order to generate scientific evidence in favour of these herbs known for their medicinal properties and used in treating various health conditions, a “randomized, open label three armed” study will be conducted at the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), New Delhi, in collaboration with the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) unit of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Also read: This is why Covid-19 may be life-threatening for some patients“The detailed proposal with methodology, including outcome measures, clinical and laboratory parameters and the logistics of the research has been prepared.

The CRF and study protocol has also been peer reviewed by experts from different domains, including modern medicine, and their suggestions have been incorporated. The study will be undertaken subject to the required approvals like that of the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC),” the ministry said.The study aims to look into the efficacy of mono-herbal formulations of whole extracts of vasa and guduchi respectively, and polyherbal formulation of vasa-guduchi whole extract on therapeutic management of SARS-CoV2 positive asymptomatic and, or, mild Covid-19 symptomatic cases, along with the impact of the said formulations on the speed of viral replication.It will also try to determine whether these mono-herbal and polyherbal formulations can alter the expression profiles of key bio markers associated with the viral disease. “Vasa and guduchi are time tested herbs in Indian healthcare traditions, used in a variety of disease conditions.

25-09-2020||India||Yes Bank case: ED attaches Rana Kapoor’s London flat worth Rs 127 crore||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached a residential flat in London worth Rs 127 crore (13.5 million pound) belonging to Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank’s former chairman and managing director, who has been booked for alleged money laundering by the agency, officials said on Friday.The property was bought by Kapoor in 2017 for Rs 93 crore (9.9 million pound) in the name of DOIT Creations Jersey Limited, according to officials. “Information from a reliable source revealed that Rana Kapoor is trying to alienate this property in London and that he has hired a reputed property consultant. Enquiries from open sources confirmed that this property has been listed for sale on several websites,” they added.ED had initiated a probe into allegations of money laundering after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered two cases of corruption against Kapoor in March. In one first information report (FIR), the bureau alleged that Yes Bank had invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) between April and June 2018.Kapoor was allegedly paid ‘kickbacks’ amounting to Rs 600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan in return.

Kapoor’s daughters, Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor, are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures. Based on the case registered by CBI, ED began its probe into allegations of money laundering by Kapoor.In the second case, CBI alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than its valuation. In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of Rs 600 crore, but he sold it for Rs 380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in which Kapoor’s wife was a director at the time.After the probe, ED filed a charge sheet against Kapoor, his wife, and their three daughters for money laundering. After the charge sheet was filed, Kapoor’s lawyers moved a bail plea on the merits of the case.The total attachments under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in this case come to Rs 2,011 crore. Among these attachments proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 600 crore belong to Kapoor and remaining attachment of assets worth Rs 1,411 crore are related to Wadhawan brothers. Prosecution complaints have been filed against Kapoor, Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and others.In another separate PMLA case, ED has also attached an asset amounting to Rs 307 crore belonging to Kapoor.Kapoor, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were arrested by ED for their role in alleged money laundering and they are in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-case-ed-attaches-rana-kapoor-s-london-flat-worth-rs-127-crore/story-huDmKQsetKziKFPpQJ9A6M.html
25-09-2020||India||Kerala man convicted for ‘waging war against friendly country’, quantum of punishment on Monday||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Kochi on Friday found a man from Kerala, Subahani Haja Moideen (34), guilty of waging war against a friendly country. His punishment will be announced on Monday. The man is said to have links with Islamic State and recently returned to the country. Legal experts said this is the first case wherein Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) - for waging a war against a friendly government - was invoked in a terror case in south India. Besides Section 125, Moideen was found guilty under various sections including 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). For the first time, a senior Indian Foreign Service official was also called as a witness in the case. Moideen was earlier questioned by French intelligence agencies in connection with the Paris attacks. While in Iraq, he told agencies that he worked with Abdel Hamid Abaaoud, a Belgian-Moroccan militant, who was the mastermind behind the November 2015 Paris attacks. The NIA had arrested him from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu in 2016 where he was living discreetly after his return to the country. According to the prosecution, Moideen, who hails from a small town in Kerala’s Idukki district, had left for Jeddah in 2015 and later reached Turkey. Later he was taken to Syrian borders by his handlers before he was moved to Raqqa for an intense arms training. Also read: Bihar to vote on October 28, November 3, 7; results on November 10After three weeks of training, he told investigators that he was sent to Mosul (Iraq) and enrolled in a team led by a French-speaking leader. During one of the attacks, he said he saw one his aides burned alive after which he fled the battle scene but was captured by other IS militants. He told the probe team that he was let off only after assuring the IS leadership that he will carry out terror activities in India. The prosecution said when he was arrested he was planning attacks against some judges and senior political leaders. According to the NIA, Moideen, belonging to a middle-class family, worked in a family-run cloth shop in Thodupuzha after dropping out from college. When he turned to drinking alcohol, his family forced him to marry. To wean him from alcohol, his wife later advised him to take up religious studies and he turned a small-time religious scholar. He told interrogators that he later was attracted to teachings of Anwar al Awlaki, one of the mentors of Al Qaeda, and started chatting with others through encrypted Telegram app and was soon radicalised. Before his trip to Iraq, he also participated in Kanakamala terror plot in Kannur in 2015.During the investigation, it was also found that after leaving IS-ruled areas, Moideen came to Turkey and gave a wrong affidavit in the Indian Embassy saying that his travel papers were stolen during a religious trip. The NIA got a whiff of him while it was investigating another IS-returnee from Maharashtra, Areeb Majeed, who is under judicial custody now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/islamic-state-returned-kerala-man-convicted-quantum-of-punishment-on-monday/story-nRJPjHWMSZxVUxLVwnc2uJ.html

The remaining formalities will be completed and further action will be taken,” Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, told reporters in Srinagar.In a statement, the army had said that the inquiry ordered by authorities into the operation at Amshipora in Shopian on July 18 has concluded.“The inquiry has brought out prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the dos and don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable,” the spokesman had said, adding that the evidence collected showed that the three unidentified men killed in Amshipora are actually Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Ibrar -all from Rajouri.Earlier, the families of the three wrote to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, seeking his intervention after the DNA reports were delayed.The three men, related to each other, were gunned down in an encounter on July 18. DNA samples from their families were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) Srinagar, and the FSL at Chandigarh.“Our children left for Shopian on July 16, in search of work where one of our relatives, Imtiyaz Ahmed, works in the house of the ‘Lambardar’. After a couple of days, we lost contact with the children. So, we decided to lodge a missing complaint,” the letter from the families said, adding that on August 10, they came to know, via social media, that all three men were killed in an encounter.“We identified them from pictures of the bodies. On August 13, a Shopian police team collected DNA samples from us. We were assured that the DNA report would be out within 10 days. To date, we have not been informed about the reports,” the plea to Sinha said.“Our children had no connection with militancy. For this, we are demanding an inquiry. They were killed in cold blood, and were merely students and labourers. We are demanding an impartial and fair inquiry into the killings as well as the DNA reports, so that things can be made public,” read the letter.

The farmers were apprised about the guidelines of Unlock 4, which prohibits any kind of mass gathering or protests across the country, including the national capital, owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “We are also trying to keep a strict vigil on other interstate borders through which the protestors may attempt to sneak in,” said a senior Delhi Police officer on condition of anonymity.

25-09-2020||India||Here’s why farm protests have been loudest in Punjab, Haryana||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana have blocked roads and railway tracks on Friday to protest three new legislations, which they claim could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at federally-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by agribusinesses. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has backed the bills, recently approved by Parliament, as historic reforms, which will open up agricultural markets, giving more options to farmers other than notified market yards to sell their produce. Modi has said the new legislations do not dismantle existing markets, known to run as cartels, or in any way jeopardise minimum support prices or MSPs for staples such as rice and wheat. These assurances have failed to reassure millions of farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Farmers’ groups fear the new changes could cause existing notified market yards to collapse on their own and result in new markets, where large capitalists will hold sway. This will indeed be undesirable. But the reforms were long overdue because the current system is corruption-prone and monopolistic. Also Read: For the first time laws have been drafted to benefit farmers and marginalised: PM ModiFarm protests have been loudest in states such as Punjab and Haryana, states where the procurement system and MSP mechanism is strong. The MSP mechanism however is neither equitable nor adequate in providing remunerative prices to all types of farmers, say experts. The key determinants of MSP are demand and supply, cost of production, price trends, both domestic and international, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sectors and a minimum of 50% as the margin over cost of production. Also Read: Haryana farmers block highways and a railway line against farm reform billsHowever, costs of production vary widely from state to state. MSPs are calculated by a methodology based on all India weighted average costs. “This does not necessarily guarantee remunerative prices to all farmers in all regions,” states a 2018 paper by PK Mishra of the international food policy research institute and T Haque, former chairman of NITI Aayog’s land policy cell. Input costs, or the expenses incurred by farmers for inputs, such as fertilisers, have recently risen at a faster pace than the MSPs. From 2004–05 to 2014–15, the average annual growth rate of C2 cost of production of paddy was 11.2% in Bihar and 11.9% in West Bengal, while the MSP of paddy increased only at the rate of 10.6% per year. C2 cost of production is the widest measure of a farmer’s cultivation cost, which includes the imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. A big reason why Friday’s farmers protests is being witnessed more in some states, and not others, has to do with where MSPs are implemented. The government’s procurement system and MSP mechanism do not benefit all farmers. While the government announces MSPs for 23 crops, only wheat and rice are bought in sufficiently large quantities. For wheat, the MSP mechanism is robust only in Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. For rice, only farmers from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Haryana benefit. Farmers in other states hardly benefit from support prices because the government’s procurement infrastructure is missing in these states. The 70th round of National Sample Survey for 2012–13 revealed that only 32.2% of paddy farmers and 39.2% of wheat growers in the country were aware of MSPs. The survey also showed that only 13.5% of paddy farmers actually benefited from MSP, while only 16.2% growers sold their produce to government procurement agencies at MSP prices. For commercial crops, such as cotton and jute, the state intervenes through the Cotton Corporation of India and Jute Corporation of India only when market prices fall steeply. Economist Ramesh Chand, member Niti Aayog, argued in a 2012 paper that it is “not feasible for public agencies to procure the marketed surplus of each and every commodity everywhere in the country to prevent prices falling below a floor level; nor would this be desirable … So, new mechanisms have to be devised to protect producers against the prices falling below the threshold level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/here-s-why-farm-protests-have-been-loudest-in-punjab-haryana/story-G18qzwYWo7UuvrFmb06xuK.html

25-09-2020||India||For the first time laws have been drafted to benefit farmers and marginalised: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that for the first time in decades, the Union government has framed laws that benefit farmers, workers, women and other marginalised sections. In the backdrop of protests from a section of farmers and the Opposition parties’ criticism of the recently passed farm bills, PM Modi lashed out at the Opposition for “misleading” the farmers. “Many governments were formed after promising betterment of farmers and workers. But what did they get—nothing; just a web of promises that neither the farmers understood nor the workers. The farmers were entwined in laws that prevented them from selling their produce at prices that they wanted; consequently, even though the produce went up their income did not go up,” he said. Addressing party workers on the 104th birth anniversary of Hindutva ideologue and leader of Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), the BJP’s forerunner Deendayal Upadhyay, the PM said that over the years the farmers’ burden of loans kept increasing . Also Read: Cong terms farm bills ‘unconstitutional’“The NDA government made relentless efforts to change this. We have taken well thought-out decisions that are not for any political benefit (to us) but for the empowerment and benefit of the farmers. Earlier we decided to give MSP, which was one and a half times the cost of production and created history,” he said. After the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 were passed in Parliament nearly a week ago, the Opposition parties criticised the government for drafting policies that favour the big companies. The bills would allow farmers to sell produce outside agricultural produce market committees (APMCs), allow contract farming agreements, and create farm-to-fork supply chains. Opposition parties have alleged that the new laws will limit APMC markets to their physical boundaries while allowing corporate buyers to land up at farms. The PM slammed these accusations, called them “misleading” and said the government has made efforts to ensure that the farmers are directly provided the benefits via direct transfer. “We have also ensured that Kisan credit card (KCC) should made available not only to those with 2 hectares of land, but even small and marginal farmers and those engaged in fisheries or animal rearing. During UPA’s time, Rs 20 lakh core was given through the KCC to farmers, this was increased to 35 lakh crore during the NDA rule,” he said. Also Read: Stir to intensify as farm groups come togetherHe said the new legislation will allow farmers to get the correct price for their produce. “The small and marginal farmers are the ones who will benefit the most from the changes that have been implemented in the farm and agriculture sector. Eighty-five out of 100 of them are from the small and marginal sections. For the first time they have an alternative option to sell their produce,” the PM said. He urged BJP workers to talk about the provisions of these laws in simple language and tell the farmers across the country what the laws are all about. Referring to the new labour codes, the PM said the laws have been simplified and these will ensure that 50 crore labourers will get minimum wages whether are there in the formal sector or the informal sector. “Only 30% of the workers till now were getting minimum wage; now every industry from the hotel industry to transport will be brought under the ambit of the laws. Concerns of contract labour have also been addressed, they will be treated as regular workers and paid accordingly and will get the benefits of other policies as well. Those who travel from one state to another for work, their health care and other needs will also be taken care of,” the PM said. All BJP Karyakartas should reach out to the farmers on the ground and inform them in very simplified language about the importance and intricacies of the new farm reforms, how these will empower them. Our ground connect will bust the propaganda being spread in the virtual world. pic.twitter.com/LuofRKzL5dThe Prime Minister said the new laws will impact women who make up for 50% of the workforce. Referring to the benefits of caste-based reservation and the 10% reservation that has been extended to the economically backward sections, he said a level playing field has been created for all. “Our ideology and a political mantra are clear. Our mantra is nation first,” he said, and referred to the accomplishments such as the abrogation of Article 370 application and the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya that were achieved after “decades of struggle”. The PM also praised the efforts of the BJP workers in fighting the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and paid tribute to those who lost their lives while serving others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-the-first-time-laws-have-been-drafted-to-benefit-farmers-and-marginalised-pm-modi/story-yJnbjSAkJcNShz6qWH9dfI.html

25-09-2020||India||Tension in 3 Chhattisgarh villages over conflict between 2 groups: Police||Three Chhattisgarh villages in Kondagaon district of Bastar division are tense after some villagers allegedly threatened and ransacked houses of some families living in these villages over Tuesday and Wednesday over a dispute, said police.Police have not registered a case till now and are conducting preliminary investigations to ascertain the details of the case after a complaint over the incidents was filed by Chhattisgarh Christian forum.District police have said that the incidents were triggered over the issue of forest land encroachment between two groups in Kakadabeda, Singanpur and Silati villages.The forum, however, claims that a group of villagers was pressuring some Christian families to either convert or lose the benefits availed by the scheduled tribes (STs) in the state.Arun Pannalal, president of the Christian forum claimed that some affected families ran away from the villages and reached Raipur. He further alleged that their houses were ransacked in the presence of police. “I have also demanded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each for the victim families, immediate registration of FIR and a high level enquiry into the matter by a retired judge of the HC or a district court,” said Pannalal. Kondagaon superintendent of police (SP) Siddharth Tiwari rubbished the claims and said the conflict was not about two communities but was rooted into land encroachment issues. He added that police weren’t present during the incidents as had been claimed by the forum. Also Read: Activist Sudha Bharadwaj seeks bail on medical grounds, SC advises this“The issue is of forest land encroachment and not Christianity versus tribals.

The memorandum will be addressed to the governor of the state. “The bills passed by the BJP government have ignored the interests of farmers and labourers and would make the former lose ownership of land and become labourers in their own farms. Agriculture mandis will be wiped out and farmers would be forced to sell their produce at lesser prices because of uncertain MSP or minimum support price offered by the government.Live: Latest updates on farmers’ protestsThe party further claimed that the removal of wheat and paddy from the Essential Commodities Act would force farmers to sell these grains to business houses and grain traders, at the prices dictated by these enterprises.“But the SP won’t let the farmers be suppressed and will raise its voice,” the statement said. Also Read: Bharat bandh call over farm reform bills: UP police put on alertTaking about labour laws, the statement said that the new laws would badly affect workers and labourers. Till now, an industry with 100 employees had no provision to retrench staff without government permission while the new law would give the right to industries, with even 300 employees, to retrench whenever they wanted.The party said that this would lead to insecurity among workers and encourage their exploitation.The central government has, however, said that the reforms are meant to allow farmers greater freedom in selling produce and the MSP regime was not going away. It has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-to-protest-in-up-against-farm-and-labour-reform-laws/story-xOdB8Eiwd35fP1DKIbv0jP.html
25-09-2020||India||Covid-19 fear kept one in two TB patients in India from seeking care: Report||As high as 51% of tuberculosis (TB) patients surveyed in India said that they were less likely to seek care during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic because they feared contracting the viral infection, according to the Global Coalition of TB Activists (GCTA) report—Impact of COVID-19 on the TB Epidemic: A Community Perspective—released in India on Thursday.About 37% of patients being treated for TB said that they were not receiving enough non-medical support, and as high as 85% of health care workers, policy and programme officers said there was a significant decrease in TB testing in the country during the nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic.The report is based on a survey of five stakeholder groups—frontline health care workers, policy and programme officers, TB researchers, TB survivors or TB advocates, and people currently on treatment for TB—to measure the impact of Covid-19 on the tuberculosis (TB) programme.At least 1,000 people from 89 countries around the world participated, including 132 from India, by sharing their observations and experiences about resource availability and constraints, as well as challenges and opportunities.According to the survey report, about 80% of health care workers said that the number of people coming to their health facilities for TB testing had decreased significantly during the lockdown, largely due to fear of contracting the infection.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know today“Patients are scared to come for follow-ups due to the risk of being punished by authorities for presenting late and they’re also unable to get opinions and services of allied specialists like Ophthalmologists,” the report says.It adds that several TB testing machines have also been diverted to test samples for Covid-19 as part of government’s efforts to scale up Covid-19 testing to test, track and treat those infected.Not just the treatment, TB-related research work has also been greatly affected during this pandemic, with 75% of TB researchers agreeing that they did not have the necessary resources to do so.“We have to protect existing TB resources, otherwise I’m super concerned that next year we would be dealing with stock outs of everything to do with TB. TB medicine, TB tests, TB vaccines, even sputum cups may not be available for us,” said Dr Madhukar Pai, director, McGill TB Centre, professor and Canada Research Chair, Epidemiology and Global Health McGill University, in the report.Also Read: Overcrowding on Mumbai local an unusual occurrence amid Covid-19 outbreak, says Western Railway“The Covid-19 pandemic has created new challenges at all levels of care and treatment and we must look at these as opportunities.

25-09-2020||India||Oil palm push in the northeast may impact biodiversity, water table, say experts||The Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry has informed Parliament on September 21 that the area under oil palm cultivation has increased from 3 lakh hectares (ha) in 2015-16 to 3.57 lakh ha in 2019-20 and edible oil production has also gone up from 8.63 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 10.53 million tonnes in 2019-20.The Centre is trying to increase the cultivation of oil seeds and oil palm that would augment the edible oil production in the country and also benefit the farming community, the reply stated.The government’s initiative is part of the National Food Security Mission (NFSM). Also read: Productive but divisive monsoon session endsThe increase in the area under palm oil cultivation has worried agriculture and environmental experts. The concern comes following the plans of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to make an expansion of oil palm forestry easier in line with its upcoming policy.MoEFCC officials said increasing area under oil palm cultivation would contribute to a rise in forest cover. The definition of forest considered by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) is all lands having trees more than one ha in an area with tree canopy density of more than 10% irrespective of ownership, legal status of land and species composition of trees, including orchards, palms etc.“The forest policy has been finalised. Our focus is trees outside forests because it will help us achieve our nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the 2016 Paris Agreement, which is within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. Besides oil palm plantations, other agro-forestry projects, avenue plantations, community forests etc will be promoted in line with the new policy. The policy is awaiting the Union Cabinet’s nod,” said an MOEFCC official on condition of anonymity.One of the country’s NDCs is to create three billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) by increasing forest and tree cover by 2030.“Monoculture of any kind is damaging for biodiversity. Moreover, oil palm is an extremely water- intensive crop, which will impact groundwater availability. The north-east is a biodiversity rich area, which is still largely intact. Why are we planting oil palm in the north-east? We should be careful even when we are bringing large areas under oil palm cultivation in the plains. Intercropping should be considered, instead of monoculture,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Telangana.“The land ceiling law doesn’t apply to plantations. As a result, getting more area under oil palm cultivation is easier. This will lead to a change of land use and ownership. Oil palm is high yielding, but it has a range of concerns as well,” he added.The government has also placed import of refined palm oil in the “restricted” category from January 8, which is likely to boost the consumption of domestically produced edible oil. In reply to a question in the Lok Sabha last year, the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare had said its emphasis was on the north-eastern states to increase their area under the oil palm cultivation.The funding pattern of the Centre’s oil palm scheme, which was 50:50% share with state government in 2014-15, has been revised to 90:10% share in case of the north-eastern states from 2015-16. Around 37,176 ha have been covered under oil palm cultivation in Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, according to the reply last year. Andhra Pradesh (AP) has the highest area under oil palm cultivation in the country at 1,73,349 ha.Mizoram, which has the largest area under oil palm cultivation in the north-east, is facing environmental and socio-economic impacts of these plantations.“Large scale oil palm plantations not only impact biodiversity and wildlife but also land rights, food security, water table and social structure of the community. We have studied how oil palm impacts biodiversity, particularly forest birds. Oil palm plantations had the lowest forest bird species richness, as compared to both teak plantations and jhum cultivation. Oil palm plantations replace diverse forest growth in many places. This is mainly because of the lack of zones in the oil palm policy. Oil palms are grown on the edge of the Dampa Tiger Reserve, along streams, and have even replaced rice fields in many valleys,” said TR Shankar Raman, a scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation, a non-governmental wildlife conservation and research organisation based in Mysuru, Karnataka.“Oil palm is an extremely water-dependent crop. In Mizoram, water is being diverted from streams to oil palm plantations, which is likely to impact the water table and local residents, who are dependent on various water sources. It may also impact food security because oil palm is replacing cultivation plots where around 25 different varieties of crops such as rice, tubers, vegetables, and bamboo shoots are grown. In Mizoram, the land, where oil palm is cultivated in each district, is apportioned to particular companies as if they were captive districts. Change in land ownership from community lands to private ownership is a cause for concern,” he added.According to a paper by TR Shankar Raman and Jaydev Mandal, which was published in May 2016, oil palm plantations had the lowest forest bird species richness (10 species), followed by teak plantations (38). While jhum (50) plantation had lower species richness than the rainforest (58). Forest bird abundance in the jhum landscape was similar to that in a rainforest, on average 304% higher than in oil palm plantations, the study found. Purabi Bose, deputy coordinator on gender at International Union of Forest Research Organisations, a non-profit, non-governmental international network of forest scientists, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, wrote in her paper in Elsevier’s Land Use Policy journal, published in February 2019, that an increase in oil palm plantation has impacted gender roles in Mizoram, where women’s roles became “submissive”, as compared to their contribution in jhum cultivation.Women’s land-use decision-making roles have been curbed and land use change from shifting cultivation to oil palm has impacted customary land management practices, she had cited in her paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-palm-push-in-the-northeast-may-impact-biodiversity-water-table-say-experts/story-8QwpafRXqKOmglfHeL7HDK.html

With the government putting focus on regional connectivity scheme (RCS) under its Udey Desh ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN) scheme, the two operators are also likely to fly on regional routes only. Also read: No refund on lockdown flights originating outside India, Centre clarifiesTop ministry sources told HT that these two airlines are Indian airlines and are expected to be able to commence their operations soon. A senior ministry official said, “Two scheduled commuter airlines, Big Charter and Aviation Connectivity, are in the final certification stage.”The official also said, “These airlines are eyeing the RCS routes.”An Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said that except Bengaluru-based Star Air that commenced its operations in January last year, currently no airline in service has dedicated UDAN operations. Director general of DGCA, Arun Kumar, confirmed that they have given flying permissions to two airlines. When asked if DGCA had received more applications for commencement of new airlines which was pending for approvals, Kumar said, “No application is pending with DGCA for starting new airlines.”Industry sources confirmed to HT that, apart from other small aircraft, the airlines are to use ATR 72 aircraft for their flight operations.With an aim to make air travel affordable and connect tier II and tier III cities, UDAN was announced in October 2016 and the first flight under this scheme took off in April 2017. Since then, 271 routes have commenced their UDAN flight operations. The aviation ministry has recently sanctioned Rs 108 crore under UDAN for upgrade of three Chhattisgarh airports.

25-09-2020||India||Kangana versus BMC: The case so far||The Bombay High Court will hear Kangana Ranaut’s petition against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for demolishing portions of her bungalow on Friday, a day after the court observed that this case can’t be delayed further as the Bollywood actor’s office can’t be left in the present demolished condition.The actor thanked the court for pulling up the civic authorities. “My heart is healed,” she wrote.Here is how the case shaped up since September 9.* On September 9, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation razed a portion of actor Kangana Ranaut’s office. The actor, who was engaged in a verbal fight with Shiv Sena over her Twitter posts, moved the Bombay High Court against the civic body.* The high court put a stay on the demolition work and noted that the allegedly illegal construction could not have come up overnight.* The BMC, in its affidavit, accused Kangana of making “illegal alterations” to her office structure. The civic body said it followed a Supreme Court judgment, which empowered the civic body to demolish any illegal construction after serving a 24-hour notice.* Civic officials claimed Kangana was served a notice in 2018 as well. The actor appealed against the notice and lost. *Kangana’s lawyer sought some time from the court and submitted an amended petition in which the actor demanded a compensation of Rs 2 crore from the BMC as 40 per cent of the bungalow have been razed which could cause severe damage to movable properties.* BMC said that the actor’s claims were false as “only the illegal and unauthorised portion of the bungalow was demolished” and hence she could not seek compensation for it. * The court asked Kangana to make Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and a designated officer from BMC H-West ward parties to the case. This was because Kangana submitted a DVD of statements made by Raut.* “Case by an actress in honourable high court is about demolition of illegal structure by BMC which is an independent body and demand is to make Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut a party! From Babri case to standing for Maratha price, I have faced several cases! This would not deter me from fighting for the pride of my city and my Maharashtra,” Sanjay Raut tweeted. * On September 24, the court said the hearing in the case cannot be delayed as the bungalow should not be left in partially demolished state during the monsoon season. “Since 40 per cent of the Petitioner’s Bungalow is already demolished on 9th September, 2020 and the Bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-versus-bmc-the-case-so-far/story-pIae5H45LMTwGxSkAk03jL.html

25-09-2020||India||BJP all set to gain in Rajya Sabha after November as Opposition numbers drop by 9||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident that the commotion that had erupted in the Rajya Sabha (RS) during the monsoon session of Parliament, which ended on Wednesday, following the Opposition parties resisting the passage of the contentious farms bills is unlikely to recur, as the party’s tally is all set to increase in the Upper House in November. The RS will have 11 vacancies in November. The BJP’s strength in the 245-member Upper House is not yet close to the half-way mark. Of these 11 vacancies, only three are from the BJP and the rest are from the Opposition’s quota in the Upper House. While 10 of these vacancies are from Uttar Pradesh (UP), one is from Uttarakhand.The BJP is in power in both UP and Uttarakhand, which will pave the way for its candidates being elected to the RS. “The government has been able to pass bills that benefit people at large. Even though the Congress and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) have been opposed to many bills; other parties that are not part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) still supported the government because the bills were for greater good,” said a BJP functionary, who did not wish to be quoted. The farm bills -- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 -- were passed in the RS on Sunday through a voice vote, despite the Opposition parties digging their heels in for further scrutiny and also putting up a stiff resistance. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the BJP’s ally, also opposed the bills. The SAD went to the extent of pulling out its lone member from the Union Cabinet, minister for food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a bid to put its criticism on record about the resistance to the passage of the farm bills. The BJP leadership has slammed the Opposition for trying to stall what they call “revolutionary bills” that will change the farmers’ economic conditions. Party leaders said there would be more ease in the passage of bills in the Upper House since its RS strength is expected to increase in November.To be sure, the BJP has been able to pass contentious bills, including Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019; Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019; and this week, the farm bills, despite being far from the half-way mark in the 245-member Upper House. The current strength of the RS is 243 because of two vacancies. The half-way mark is 122. The BJP has 86 members in the Upper House, its allies, such as the Janata Dal (United) has five members, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Republican Party of India (RPI), have one each and the SAD (2).Several single-member parties such as the National People’s Party, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), and the Naga People’s Front (NPF) also support the BJP. The Congress and TMC are the second and third-largest parties in the RS with 40 and 13 members, respectively.Biju Janata Dal (BJD), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), which are counted as parties friendly to the government, have nine each and six members, respectively.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) (3); the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) (7); the Shiv Sena (3); the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) (1); the Samajwadi Party (SP) (8); the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) (5) are among the parties that are in the Opposition’s camp.The Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will lose two Members of Parliament (MP) each and the SP will lose four of its members because of the upcoming vacancies in the Upper House. The Opposition’s strength in the RS will come down by nine seats. An increase in the BJP’s RS strength will mean widening the gap between the two sides. It will offer the government a cushion when the margin of difference is slim as was the case during the passage of the farm bills. Though a division of votes was not carried out on Sunday, the BJP claimed to have 110 members on its side. Besides those absent from the Upper House, the Opposition’s strength was 109, which narrowed down the difference in the votes.Political commentator Abhay Deshpande said a majority in the Upper House would give the government more elbow room, but until that happens, its floor management would be put to the test. “The burden to pass bills will be greatly reduced after it has the majority in the RS. But until that happens, the government will have to rely on its floor management. It has to reach out to friendly parties outside the NDA for their support,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-all-set-to-gain-in-rajya-sabha-after-november/story-kcq2lZs0hqQpmbFNHBGW7J.html
25-09-2020||India||Monsoon begins withdrawing next week, above normal day temperatures likely over NW India||Above normal day temperatures will impact all of northwest India as monsoon begins withdrawing from west Rajasthan next week. Monsoon withdrawal this year is set to be 11 days late as September 17 is the normal date of its commencement. While withdrawal will begin from northwest India; eastern parts of central India, parts of east India, including Bihar and West Bengal, northeastern states like Assam and Meghalaya will continue to receive above normal rains in the first week of October, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its weekly weather report released on Friday morning. Also read: Delhi sees driest September in 16 years“We had an intense rain producing system which invigorated the monsoon in the past week. A remnant low moved from west Pacific which merged on Bay of Bengal which strengthened the westerlies and caused rain all along the west coast and path of low-pressure area. So, a lot of heavy and extremely heavy rain was recorded during the past week which is likely to gradually reduce,” said Sunitha Devi, scientist at IMD who presented the weekly weather report. She added that for the past five years, monsoon withdrawal has been late, beginning only after September 15. During the first week of September, there was a 30% deficiency in rain but it was covered in the next week, recording 7% excess rain and in the third week, 40% excess rain was recorded. Monsoon rain over the country since June 1 is 9% excess with 29% excess over south peninsula, 17% excess over central India, 15% excess over northwest India, and 4% excess over east and northeast India. The normal date for complete withdrawal of monsoon from the country is October 15 as per the new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates issued by IMD in April this year.

He is such an irresponsible Parliamentarian as he speaks without noticing the facts. When the Congress-led UPA issued an ordinance to protect the convicted MLAs and MPs, Rahul Gandhi had torn up and thrown it away in a press meet,” Dinakar said in a statement.Cornering Gandhi for opposing farm bills, he said: “Rahul skipped the monsoon session of the Parliament intentionally. Now, he is tweeting against the interests of the farmers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central Government passed important bills for the benefit of the farmers. Our suggestion is that let him read and understand the subject and then question the government. But he has been accustomed to criticise the government without proper study.”He emphasised that there is no problem with these bills and said: “Union Government has hiked MSP for several agricultural outputs of the farmers after passing these three Bills.”“After passing these bills, farmers have got the option and opportunity to sell their outputs wherever they want in India. It is ‘One Nation - One Market’ for them to get the best price. In this option farmers can get prices above the MSP as their choice of marketing is wider. Apart from this, farmers and buyers can enter agreement for buyback at prefixed prices. The government has deregulated the food items and cereals, pulses, onions etc. with an aim to raise the farmers’ income,” he added.During the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament, the two Houses passed Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.A bill to amend the Essential Commodities Act was also passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lanka-dinakar-slams-rahul-for-skipping-parl-session-calls-him-twitter-gandhi/story-znnmdNyiXvBkbT640q68FP.html

I try to bring the same calmness within me and I meditate every day before working out,” said Ashiq, who made news three years back when she was photographed pelting stones at security forces in Srinagar’s Kothi Bagh.The 25-year-old goalkeeper and captain of the Jammu & Kashmir women’s football team was among the seven fitness influencers, including India cricket captain Virat Kohli, two-time Paralympic gold medallist Devendra Jhajharia and model-turned-runner Milind Soman, who interacted with Modi during an online fitness dialogue to mark the first anniversary of the Fit India Movement on Thursday. “I did not get much support from my family but I decided to fight it out so that I can bring a change in the society,” said Ashiq, who plays in a Mumbai club — Premier India Football Academy. “You are an inspiration to girls in Jammu & Kashmir. Mostly, football fans say ‘Bend it like Beckham’, but now they will say ‘Ace it like Afshan,” Modi told Ashiq during the online interaction.During the interaction with Kohli, Modi joked about the India captain’s love for chhole bhature. Kohli burst into laughter as he shared his transition from a foodie to a fitness freak. “I used to eat a lot from outside as I was growing up. I had to change my diet and physical fitness regime. I thought fitness should be a priority,” said Kohli. Modi launched the ‘Fit India Age Appropriate Fitness Protocols’ in the presence of sports minister Kiren Rijiju. “I am glad that healthy eating is becoming a part of our way of living,” he said.

25-09-2020||India||SC seeks govt, UPSC reply over prelims exam||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought the response of the Centre and the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on a petition by 20 civil service aspirants to postpone the October 4 Civil Service (Preliminary) Examination amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Citing the pandemic and natural calamities in some states, the petitioners from various parts of the country, led by Vasireddy Govardhana Sai Prakash, told the apex court that holding the examination in the present circumstances would pose a risk to their health and safety.Unlike academic examinations, there would not be any question of loss of an academic year if the exam is not held, they said. That comes in the backdrop of the Joint Entrance Examination for admission to engineering schools and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for medical and dental course aspirants taking place this month on grounds that students were at risk of losing an academic year. The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjeev Khanna issued notice to the UPSC and the Centre and posted the matter for hearing on September 28.“About six lakh aspirants are likely to appear in the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, which is a seven hours offline examination, to be given at limited centres in 72 cities across the country,” advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, appearing for the petitioners, told the court.“Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases are increasing in India at an alarming rate….Conducting the exam at such perilous time is nothing but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death.” In addition, the petition pointed out that candidates in several states were stuck because of floods and excessive rains. Since the exam is usually held during summers, this is a peculiar situation facing the candidates, the petition stated.The examination was earlier scheduled for May 31, but postponed on account of the pandemic. On June 5, the UPSC, the recruitment body for civil services, came out with a revised examination schedule, setting October 4 as the new date.The petitioners alleged that holding the exam during a pandemic will amount to discrimination between states which are majorly affected by Covid-19. They argued that as per Regulation 12 of the Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by Competitive Exam) Regulations 1955, no candidate would be appointed to the service if not found to be in good mental or physical health after the exam. The risk of candidates getting infected is high and those who succeed in the examination may fail the fitness test in the event they contract the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-upsc-reply-over-prelims-exam/story-ylNaSok6vaz3hfWTWSOKwI.html

He was absconding since the day of the incident.During the raids, NIA teams recovered airguns, pellets, sharp weapons, iron rods, digital devices, DVRs and incriminating documents related to Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Popular Front of India (PFI).The central anti-terror probe agency took over the probe from the state police on September 23.The riots had broken out on the night of August 11 over a derogatory social media remark by one Naveen, identified as the nephew of Srinivas Akhanda Murthy, the sitting Congress MLA from Pulakeshi Nagar of Bengaluru. The remark insulted the religious sentiments of Muslims, the NIA said in a statement.“The state secretary, SDPI, Muzamil Pasha and other members of Social Democratic Party of India /Popular Front of India gathered a mob at the houses of Naveen, Akhanda Srinivas Murthy and at the premises of DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations, who vandalised the premises and resorted to arson, creating fear and panic among the masses,” the NIA further stated.More than 300 people, including some SDPI members, have been arrested in connection with the arson and violence in the city that night. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) blamed the SDPI, a political outfit of Popular Front of India, for the riots and demanded a ban on the organisation. The SDPI has, however, rejected the charges as “baseless”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-key-conspirator-in-august-11-bengaluru-riots/story-0w26d8G6h7ZTLA780aExML.html

The NPP on Thursday opened its first unit in Kalimpong. The party’s local functionaries said Sangma will visit the region soon. The development came 20 days after Sangma wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah expressing his support for creation of a separate state for Gorkhas. “The Gorkhas too are rightful Indian citizens who deserve to have their own identity and Bas Bhoomi (homeland),” he wrote, highlighting the contributions of the community during freedom struggle. Kenza Foning, the north Bengal coordinator of NPP, said, “The long term goal of our party is separation of Darjeeling and Kalimpong from West Bengal.” The NPP’s plan has not gone well with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binoy Tamang faction). Keshav Raj Pokhrel, GJM (Tamang) spokesperson, said, “When P A Sangma was chief minister of Meghalaya in the 1980s many Gorkhas were driven out of the state. It is ironic that Sangma’s son is now talking about Gorkhaland while Gorkhas in Meghalaya are still treated as second-class citizens.” The Gorkha National Liberation Front and All India Gorkha League have, however, welcomed the NPP. Sangma is the second chief minister to support the Gorkhaland issue. In March 2011, when Pawan Chamling was the chief minister, the Sikkim state assembly adopted a resolution in favour of creation of Gorkhaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-people-s-party-opens-unit-in-north-bengal-backs-gorkhaland/story-3h3KqliNBwJ8wHN0zk6LZK.html

The carcass was covered with maggots. There were injuries marks on it. The veterinary doctors said that it was 2-3 day old carcass. A post mortem was conducted by a team of doctors to know the exact cause of death.” “The team also found pugmarks of a tiger near the carcass.

25-09-2020||India||Key gap in antigen testing protocol prompts rethink||An analysis of Delhi’s Covid-19 testing data by the health department showed that, on Wednesday, 1,400 symptomatic people who tested negative in rapid antigen tests (RATs) were not administered the gold standard RT-PCR tests as follow up, highlighting a glaring gap in the Capital’s testing protocol. On Thursday, the Delhi government directed all districts in the Capital to ensure no lapses take place in testing people with symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) through the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction procedure, considered the most accurate method of detecting the viral infection.Special secretary (health and family welfare) Udit Prakash Rai issued the directive. RATs, while fast (results are in within the hour as compared to a minimum of 24 hours for RT-PCR ones), have a high propensity to give out false negatives -- which means they identify an infected person as uninfected. HT has repeatedly stressed that these tests should be used only in certain contexts (such as in containment zones, or in airports or railway stations), but many states and Delhi continue to use them. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, for instance, once laggards in testing, have conducted millions of tests, many of them RATs. Delhi too continues to depend heavily on them. In the week to Thursday, RATs accounted for 81.5% of the total 386,924 tests conducted in the Capital. While experts suggest that if RATs must be used, those symptomatic individuals who test negative must undergo a RT-PCR test (or another accurate molecular test), this is not foolproof either -- at least 40% of those infected with Sars-Cov2 are asymptomatic. “Total 1,437 antigen negative symptomatic persons have not undergone RT-PCR. Kindly ensure that this is made NIL from today (Thursday). This means from today there should be no antigen negative symptomatic case who is not tested for RT-PCR,” read Rai’s communication, sent to all district magistrates (DMs) and chief district medical officers (CDMOs).HT could not immediately ascertain if similar data is available for more days.  The directive also had a district-wise break-up of the number of cases recorded on Wednesday of symptomatic people who tested negative in rapid antigen tests and whose samples were not tested subsequently through RT-PCR.According to the data, north-west Delhi, which also has the maximum number of active Covid-19 cases (over 5,000) in the city, had 870 cases on Wednesday alone where symptomatic antigen negatives were not followed up with an RT-PCR test. North-west Delhi was followed by the south-west district, where 258 symptomatic persons were not administered RT-PCR tests after testing negative for Covid-19 in rapid antigen tests.“I guess more than 80% of all tests being conducted in Delhi everyday are rapid antigen tests. Heavy reliance on antigen tests is never advisable,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research. “Rapid antigen test is only a test of choice for routine surveillance in containment zones and screening at the point of entry. In all other situations, RT-PCR tests should be given priority. Merely increasing the testing through rapid antigen tests will not give a true picture of Delhi’s real positivity rate.”A Delhi government spokesperson confirmed that a specific direction was issued by the state Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) to all field teams conducting rapid antigen tests that there should be no lapse in conducting follow-up RT-PCR tests. “Medical officers of each of the 11 districts have been asked to strictly ensure that no symptomatic RAT negative is let go without an RT-PCR test. The DGHS has issued necessary directions in this regard,” the spokesperson said. In fact, the medical officer has been asked to go ahead with an RT-PCR procedure without necessarily having to wait for the result of the antigen test.“Earlier the field teams used to wait until the results came and if negative many people would just leave the centre immediately, despite officials asking them to wait. Now symptomatic people can be tested with RT-PCR right there without waiting for the antigen results,” the spokesperson said. A senior health department official said on condition of anonymity that the Delhi government is also working on a plan to increase the number of RT-PCR testing laboratories. The official added that the Delhi government is awaiting approvals from the Union government on the plan.“Daily RT-PCR tests have now crossed the 10,000 mark, while the existing combined capacity of all the 54 labs in Delhi is around 11,000 tests per day. Modalities are being worked out to scale up RT-PCR sample processing capacity further. It is in various approval stage from the Central government,” said the official. To be sure, Delhi still doesn’t do more than 10,000 RT-PCR tests every day. In the week to Thursday, for instance, this level has been breached four times. Sandeep Mishra, district magistrate of the north-west district, the one with the highest case load, said his administration was now ensuring that access to an RT-PCR test is as easy in the district as to the rapid antigen test. “We are ensuring [that] both RAT and RT-PCR facility should be available at all testing centres.” BM Mishra, DM of south district, said: “They (health officials) do not let people leave the test centres at any cost until the RAT results come. As soon as the result comes negative on RAT, a fresh sample for RT-PCR is also collected from the symptomatic person.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-gap-in-antigen-testing-protocol-prompts-rethink/story-rVEawCSqoS9VbR0qwVEBUL.html
25-09-2020||India||Stir across ‘food bowl’ today over farm laws||Farmer bodies and opposition parties on Thursday intensified protests in food-bowl states in the northern plains amid a call for a nationwide stir on Friday to oppose three bills that they say could pave the way for the government to stop buying grain at minimum guaranteed prices and benefit corporate entities and traders.In a session that was curtailed because of the spectre of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Parliament passed three bills that the government said were aimed at unleashing reforms in agriculture and allow farmers more flexibility in selling their produce. While some experts have hailed the move, farmer bodies and opposition parties allege that the laws will benefit only big businesses.On Thursday, farmers from Punjab and Haryana, which are key producers of wheat and rice, blocked railway tracks, forcing the cancellation of some trains on local routes. Several farmer bodies have come together under the banner of All India Kisan Sangarsh Committee for Friday’s Bharat Bandh, which is expected to disrupt road and rail traffic in several states on Friday. All major opposition parties, including the Congress, Left outfits, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Trinamool Congress (TMC), have decided to participate in the bandh. From the ruling National Democratic Alliance, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will join the nationwide protest.Last week, the SAD’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the minister for food processing, resigned over her opposition to the bills that she termed as “anti-farmer”.The Congress said it will begin a two-month agitation against the new laws by holding news briefings in all state capitals and district headquarters. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the party workers will support the agitation by farm organisations during this period against “Modi’s anti-farmer” policies.During the nationwide “bandh”, the most intense protests are expected in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and some parts of Maharashtra, where farmers have already been protesting over the last one week by blocking road and rail traffic, hampering the supply of essentials such as food grains.“Nothing will work in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh tomorrow (Friday),” said Bharatiya Kisan Union president Rakesh Takait. All farmer and mandi committees in Punjab and Haryana have called for stopping road and rail traffic at various locations and closure of shops. A senior Haryana Police officer said on condition of anonymity: “Additional police force has been deployed to maintain law and order and railways have suspended some of the trains passing from the region.” “We have asked police personnel not to use force,” he added.Strikes are also expected to be observed in Opposition-ruled Kerala and TMC-ruled West Bengal. In Bihar, the opposition parties led by the RJD have made a call for a prolonged agitation coming just before the forthcoming assembly elections in the state. In Opposition-ruled Jharkhand and Rajasthan, All India Kisan Sabha and Congress workers have announced protests at various places.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana, a major farmer outfit in Maharashtra, has decided to burn copies of the bill outside revenue offices. Farmers bodies in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have called protests to show solidarity with farmers in north India, who are expected to be worst-affected by the farm laws.The three farm bills approved by Parliament this week are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance; and Farm Services Bill and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.The new laws aim to liberalise the agriculture sector by removing hurdles created by the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (AMPC) Act in direct procurement of agriculture produce by buyers and create a level-playing field for all, thereby allowing private players a bigger role in farm trade.Farmer bodies and opposition parties say that these reform bills take away price protection provided through Minimum Support Price (MSP), whereas the government maintains that MSP will remain in place and the bills will ensure higher remuneration for farmers.Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the passage of the bills, which will now need to be signed by the President, a “watershed moment in the history of Indian agriculture”.The Prime Minister has accused the Opposition of misleading farmers on the legislations that he said were similar to the economic reforms of 1991.“The bills were passed in a hurry. They lacked greater scrutiny of select committees. They create a system which will leave farmers vulnerable to exploitation. Our protests will continue,” said VM Singh, convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana said: “If the government is so concerned of farmers’ interest, then it should have added a provision that no entity will be allowed to trade less than the MSP.” The evening before the nationwide strike, Union agriculture minister NS Tomar sought to address the concerns by saying there were no provisions in the legislations to end APMCs. He said the bills will promote inter-state trade and farmers will receive more options to sell at the right price. “The new bills allow a farmer to sell their produce outside APMCs, giving them a wider range of buyers,” he said.“In Punjab, there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, because of these bills, farmers will be able to sell their produce even outside of the mandi, even outside of the state at any price they choose,” he said. He also said that fixing MSP is an administrative decision and it will continue. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath praised the laws and said they will not only guarantee MSP to farmers but will help in getting them prices higher than the MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stir-across-food-bowl-today-over-farm-laws/story-pmRUivsTL4IGPnd7IwNIwK.html
25-09-2020||India||Chinese imports 29% down, but up in key sectors||India imported more petroleum products, handicrafts, medical and scientific instruments, agrochemicals and other chemicals from China although overall shipments from the neighbour declined 29% from a year earlier to $16.6 billion in the first four months of the financial year. Purchases of bulk drugs and intermediates registered a minor decline.Recent efforts to replace Chinese goods with indigenous products and more diversified sources have resulted in a significant reduction in imports of 45 out of 50 principal commodity groups from China in the April-July period, but purchases in five sectors increased, said the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S).India has taken a series of punitive actions against China amid a military standoff in the Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC); on June 15, a violent brawl in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh left 20 Indian Army personnel dead and caused an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.Citing national security concerns, New Delhi on June 29 banned 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such as TikTok, UC Browser and WeChat, and added 118 more apps to the list on September 2. India has also restricted the imports of Chinese television sets and prohibited Chinese companies from competing for government contracts.Despite the punitive measures, imports of agrochemicals from China jumped 17.49%, to $377.65 million in April-July compared to $321.43 million in the same period last year. Purchases of other chemicals rose 13.46% to $240.96 million, according to DGCI&S data.Purchases of Chinese petroleum products rose 13.61% to $68.83 million during the period. India’s imports of Chinese handicrafts, excluding carpets, increased by 7.55% to $168.08 million; and medical and scientific instruments by 2.55% to $205.64 million.Although there was a small dip in the import of bulk drugs and intermediates from China, data shows India’s continued dependence on China for this crucial raw material used by the pharmaceutical industry. Imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediaries fell 0.13% to $859.66 million in April-July from $860.85 million in the same period last year.The commerce and industry ministry did not respond to queries on the subject. Two government officials with direct knowledge of the matter said imports from China were on a constant decline, which will be even more prominent in the September numbers. Imports from China have dropped by over $320 million in the first three weeks of the current month to about $1.2 billion, the officials said, requesting anonymity.A significant drop has been recorded in two key categories, with purchases of fertilizer (crude and manufactured) from China falling 70%; and machinery (electrical and non-electrical) declining 30% in first three weeks of September 2020, one of the officials said.That’s the outcome of an Indian effort to scale up domestic manufacturing capacity and diversify the sources of imports of goods and services to reduce reliance on China, the officials said.“The government is also conscious about the needs of the domestic consumer and industry. There are certain essential products such as bulk drugs and APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), which are globally supplied from China. While efforts are there for import substitution, there is no ban on the import of such items from China,” the second official said.Measures are being taken to import bulk drugs from alternative sources such as the US, Italy, Singapore and Hong Kong, and to ramp up domestic capacity to reduce dependence on China. In the medium to long-run, the government has decided to set up three bulk drug parks for ₹3,000 crore and approved a ₹6,940 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) package for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical drug intermediates and APIs.“This is how there is a marginal decline in their imports from China during April-July 2020,” the second official said. Over 63% of India’s pharmaceutical imports are APIs and intermediates, and almost 70% of those come from China. Intermediaries and APIs are crucial chemical compounds (raw materials) required to manufacture formulations or medicines. While India is one of the leading exporters of formulations or generic medicines, China has a virtual monopoly in production of intermediaries and APIs.“It is time we revive our domestic API industry, which has been deeply affected because of policies such as stricter implementation of pollution control norms, implementation of DPCO [Drug Price Control Order], 2013, lower import duties, and complete collapse of the indigenous fermentation industry,” said a report titled  Reviving India’s API Industry, prepared by consulting firm PwC.According to the report, the percentage of API imports from China spiked from around 1% in 1991 to about 70% in 2019.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said a 100% boycott of Chinese products or import substitution was not immediately possible in a scenario where the trade deficit is highly skewed in favour of China. “The import substitution is a long-drawn process and there are no quick fixes as in the case of apps. The government has realised this and is setting up parks for API domestic manufacturing but the results would be visible only a year or two later... Ban or import restrictions on these products, essential in nature, would only hurt India. Import substitution requires long-term vision and strategy which the government is trying to address but l think there is still a very long way to go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-imports-29-down-but-up-in-key-sectors/story-w0POYmBTCRxlcW5Pem1UjI.html
25-09-2020||India||Farm protests may hit transport of essentials: Railways||The railway ministry on Thursday warned that the three-day rail roko (railway blockade) protest called by farmers in Punjab over farm bills passed by Parliament will have a severe impact on the transport of foodgrains and other essential goods to and from the northern state .Railway authorities said 20 trains passing through Punjab will remain suspended between Thursday and Saturday because of the protest , as the state-owned transporter seeks to ensure the safety of passengers and protect its property. Many freight and parcel trains too have been rescheduled.“Punjab rail agitation will severely impact loading of foodgrains and other essential goods. It will hurt ordinary citizens and fast-recovering rail freight and economy,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeking to liberalise agricultural trade, were cleared by both Houses of Parliament in the curtailed monsoon session that ended Wednesday. Opposition parties and farmers groups have alleged that the legislation was aimed at promoting the interests of corporate entities rather than the interests of farmers.The railway ministry said that Punjab loaded 990 rakes of foodgrains procured by the Food Corporation of India in August this year and 816 rakes this month until September 23. Thd FCI is loading more than 35 rakes of foodgrains daily from Punjab. Punjab also loads 9-10 rakes daily of fertilizer, cement, automobiles and mixed goods in containers.“Punjab receives around 20 rakes daily of coal, food grain, farm products, machinery, petroleum products, imported fertilizer etc,” the ministry said.The call for rail roko protest has been called by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee with the backing of different farmers groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-protests-may-hit-transport-of-essentials-rlys/story-Rcwbet7wk3lq18n0bKV43O.html
25-09-2020||India||Cong terms farm bills ‘unconstitutional’||The Congress on Thursday said it will challenge the three farm bills in the court, saying the “black laws” are “unconstitutional” and against the country’s federal structure. The party also extended its support to Friday’s ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by various farmers’ organisations in protest against the bills. The main opposition party also launched on Thursday its nearly two-month-long “mass movement” against the government for passing “anti-farmer and anti-poor” bills in Parliament. The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, have been passed by both the Houses of Parliament and await Presidential assent. The support to the ‘bandh’ was announced by Congress party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. “The diabolical & debilitating attack on Farmer & Farm Labourers by the three ‘Black Bills’ of Modi Govt would be decisively defeated,” he tweeted. Surjewala said the Congress and former party chief Rahul Gandhi stand solidly behind the farmers and support the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by various farmers’ organisations. “Congress worker and leader will join farmers’ dharna and protests,” he added. The Congress and 17 other opposition parties had on Wednesday requested President Ram Nath Kovind not to give his assent to the three farm bills. Addressing reporters at the party headquarters in Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the 18 opposition like-minded parties have urged the President to not sign the bills as they will be against the federal structure if they become laws. “If the President signs these bills, which I want and hope he should not sign, and once they become the law, I feel they will be against the federal structure,” he said. “These laws will be challenged in the court from high court up to the Supreme Court and I have no doubt that they will be quashed. We want that... these laws are stopped and quashed by the court as they are unconstitutional,” Singhvi said. He said the issues come under List 2 of the 7th Schedule and are exclusive rights of states. Singhvi, a Rajya Sabha member, added agriculture is included in List 2 and these laws directly relate to agriculture and trade and commerce within the state. The holding of markets and fairs also fall within the purview of state governments, he said. Singhvi also accused the government of pushing through the bills in the Rajya Sabha while ignoring calls by many members for a division of votes. “These are three black laws and the manner in which they were passed was unconstitutional and against parliamentary traditions and rules,” he alleged. He said as per parliamentary precedents, the chair has to hear the plea by even a single member wanting a division of votes but that was not done. “There were doubts about the quorum in the Rajya Sabha when the bills were passed amid the din.” Singhvi alleged that whatever happened on Sunday during the passage of bills in the Rajya Sabha was not just “unconstitutional but also undemocratic”, as the government sought to push through the bills due to its power. “The government did not have the numbers and that is why it resorted to such measures to get the bills passed, without adhering to members’ request for a division,” he added. Singhvi said Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu “wrongly rejected” the no confidence resolution against deputy chairman Harivansh by opposition parties as a 14-day notice is not required. The Congress had earlier announced that it will also collect two crore signatures from protesting farmers against the proposed legislations. The decision by the Congress to hit the streets was taken at a meeting of general secretaries and in-charge of states at the party headquarters in Delhi on Monday in absence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The six-member special committee formed by the Congress president to help her in organisational and operational matters chaired the meeting in her absence. Its members are AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala. Accompanied by her son and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi had on September 12 left for the United States for a routine health check-up. Both of them returned to India on Tuesday morning. On Thursday, Congress leaders fanned out across the country to address a series of press conferences, attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government on the farm bills. Apart from a chain of press conferences across the country starting from Thursday, senior Congress leaders from states will on September 28 walk to the respective Raj Bhavans and submit a memorandum on the farms bills to Governors to be handed over to the President. On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the Congress will observe ‘Kisan-Mazdoor Bachao Divas (Save Farmers and Farm Labourers Day).’ There will be protests and demonstrations in every district across the country demanding immediate withdrawal of the agriculture bills. On October 10, state level conferences will be held and from October 2 to October 31, the party will collect signatures from 20 million farmers from all parts of the country. On November 14, the birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, a memorandum along with signatures of 20 million farmers will be submitted to the President.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-terms-farm-bills-unconstitutional/story-RUw94wstY0Zrc4b5C5LkkJ.html
25-09-2020||India||SC says Sudha Bharadwaj has ‘good grounds’ for bail on merits||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Thursday observed that lawyer and activist Sudha Bharadwaj, who is an accused in a case related to caste clashes that broke out in Bhima Koegaon near Pune on New Year’s Day in 2018, has “good grounds” to seek bail on the merits of her case, but declined to entertain her bail plea, which she filed on medical grounds.A bench headed by justice UU Lalit said the court was not inclined to grant bail to her on medical grounds, but suggested that she move a plea on standard grounds.“We are not with you on medical grounds. You have a good case on merits. Why are you not filing for bail on merits,” the bench, which also comprised justice Ajay Rastogi ,asked.Bharadwaj’s counsel Vrinda Grover agreed to withdraw the bail plea on medical grounds and file for bail on the merits of the case.Bharadwaj, 59, sought bail citing her vulnerability to Covid -19 because of comorbidities. Bharadwaj is diabetic and also suffers from hypertension and had cited these as grounds for interim bail before the high court.The Bombay high court rejected her plea on August 28 after which she moved the Supreme Court in appeal.Bharadwaj was arrested by Maharashtra police in 2018 for allegedly inciting caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war on January 1 that year.One person died and four were injured in the clashes. The British East India Company, which largely comprised the Mahars, a Dalit community, emerged victorious from the war with the Peshwas. The victory is celebrated by the Mahar community annually. Bharadwaj along with activists Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Anand Teltumbde, and Gautam Navlakha have been charged with offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged role in inciting the violence.After the change of government in Maharashtra in 2019, the central government had intervened and transferred the investigation from Maharashtra police to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in January. Bharadwaj, who was initially lodged at Yerawada jail in Pune, was shifted to Byculla jail in February 2020 after the probe was transferred to NIA.Grover, on Thursday, argued that Bharadwaj had developed two new diseases while in custody -- ischemic heart disease and arthritis.A medical report of July 21 stated that Bharadwaj was suffering from Ischemic heart disease, a condition in which coronary artery becomes narrow, thereby reducing blood flow to the heart. A second medical report which was submitted on August 21 by the jail authorities did not mention such a condition, following which the high court had rejected her bail plea.“Ischemic heart disease is a ticking time bomb. Anytime, her condition can deteriorate,” Grover said, seeking bail so that Bharadwaj can be subjected to a detailed medical examination.Grover also submitted that Bharadwaj was a lawyer in Chhattisgarh who used to fight cases on behalf of marginalised sections of the society.“No incriminating material was recovered from me. I was teaching at National Law University, Delhi when I was arrested,” Grover argued on behalf of her client.“My prayer is to allow me to get myself (medically) examined because the kind of check-up and tests which are required cannot happen in jail,” the lawyer said.The court, however, made it clear that it will not grant bail on medical grounds.Bharadwaj’s bail plea on medical grounds was earlier rejected by a special NIA court on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-says-bharadwaj-has-good-grounds-for-bail-on-merits/story-3N9W4Rfyck43MzdCYEGmDP.html
25-09-2020||India||No provision to end APMCs, says Tomar||Union agriculture minister NS Tomar on Thursday said two new farm bills passed in Parliament do not have provisions to end markets controlled by the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) as is feared by farmer groups. The minister also added that while older laws had no provision to guarantee when payment would be made to farmers , the new laws assure that payments will be made within three days at the most.The bills he said will promote inter-state trade and farmers will receive more options to sell at the right price: “The new bills allow a farmer to sell his produce outside APMCs, giving him a widen range of buyers,” he said addressing the media.The two bills passed, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, aim to free agrimarkets, allow contract farming agreements, and create farm-to-fork supply chains. They do this, partky, by sidestepping APMCs, which have become cartelised over time. Older laws required farmers to sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, and usually in the same area where they (the farmers) resided. The new laws open up APMCs to competition. One of them also allows farmers to strike agreements with agri-business firms or exporters for prospective sale of farming produce. Some farm-groups and the opposition parties believe that the new laws will limit APMC markets to their physical boundaries while allowing corporate buyers to land up at farmgates. They are also worried that because the laws do not guarantee the minimum price of acquisition will be the government mandated minimum support price or MSP, most farmers will end up selling for lower (government acquisition, at MSP, in markets where the APMC law has been repealed, is low, they point out). Finally, they believe that few farmers will cross states to sell produce or take the online route to do so. The opposition has severely criticised the government for passing the Bills in Parliament without sending them for further scrutiny to a select panel . The government has for its part asserted that the bills were passed after discussion with the opposition members to and allow farmers more options to get better remuneration for their produce. The Prime Minister has himself defended the bills, and termed them a “protective shield” around farmers. The government insists that concerns that the legislation will end the MSP and about contract farming are misplaced. The opposition wants the concept of MSP to be written into the law. The minister said fixing MSP is an administrative decision and will continue.He said the government has already declared MSP of rabi crops. Earlier this week, the government raised MSP for several winter-grown or rabi crops , a move clearly aimed at quelling criticism that the new farm laws would kill the MSP regime. Both farmer groups in Punjab and the BJP’s own ally the SAD have been opposed to the bills; and want the government to clarify if the private companies will be asked to buy at MSP as well.“In Punjab, there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, because of these bills, farmers will be able to sell their produce even outside of the mandi, even outside of the state at any price they choose,” Tomar said, without commenting on the absence of a floor price. Tomar also said people have misconceptions about contract farming. “We talk about the agreement of crop through the new agricultural bill. Our bill is not for contracting the field. The farmer is the owner of the farm and of the produce. But now the new bill will allow the farmer to guarantee the value of the crop before sowing.” Lashing out at the Congress, the minister said changes in the APMC law, the interstate trade of agricultural produce were all part of its 2019 manifesto. Tomar also defended the changes to the essential commodities law, the third farm reform bill cleared in the just-concluded monsoon session of parliament. the new law removes most food items from the purview of the law, which is mainly used by the Centre to control inflation. He said at the High Power Committee meeting of the Chief Ministers, Congress leader and then Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath said that the essential commodities act had achieved its objective,and should be abolished immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-provision-to-end-apmcs-says-tomar/story-PJjftbEdVlPYS64xvB2OBP.html
25-09-2020||India||Stir to intensify as farm groups come together||Farmers’ protests in the northern Indian food bowl regions of western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab are expected to intensify on Friday, when farmers groups and opposition political parties organise a national strike, Bharat Bandh, against three farm bills passed by Parliament.All farmers groups in the region have come together to take part in the protests against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 , passed by Parliament during the curtailed monsoon session that ended on Wednesday.A three-day rail blockade is being organised in Punjab that will continue until Saturday to protest against the bills that the government says will liberalise agricultural trade and farmers allege will promote corporate interests over their own.Railway authorities said 20 trains passing through Punjab will remain suspended between Thursday and Saturday because of the protest, as the state-owned transporter seeks to ensure the safety of passengers and protect its property. Many freight and parcel trains too have been rescheduled “Punjab rail agitation will severely impact loading of foodgrains and other essential goods. It will hurt ordinary citizens and fast-recovering rail freight and economy,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.In Punjab, where the protests against the bills started more than a month ago, at least 31 farmers bodies have come together and drawn up a joint protest plan.“We have informed all market associations that they should close the shops tomorrow,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, an office-bearer of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organisation of farmers groups.Farmers bodies have divided Punjab into different zones where the activists will stage day-long sit-in protests and prevent any movement of traffic, said another farmers leader. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a partner of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre, has also decided to organize parallel protests as part of a “chakka jam” (road blockage) campaign. SAD spokesperson Dalit Cheema said the party cadre would be out on the roads in full strength. The Congress and Aam Aadmi Party will also join the protests. In Haryana, major farmers organisations have joined hands to stage protests and announced that road and railway traffic will not be allowed on Friday. They have issued a call for the closure of all markets, including agricultural produce mandis, from 10 a.m. to 4 pm. Haryana president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait faction) Ratan Mann said: “The farmers and commission agents will be on roads against the bills on Friday”. He added that shopkeepers, trade unions and employee unions have been asked to join the protests.This will be the third such protest in the state in the past two weeks; the first, held in Pipli of Kurukshetra, on September 10 resulted in a clash between police and protesters.“We will ensure that the protests remain peaceful and movement of traffic on the important roads like NH 44 will not get affected,” said Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav. He said farmers would be prevented from coming onto the national highway.Farmers in Haryana on Thursday organised a march in villages to create awareness about Bharat Bandh and a week-long campaign their organisations have planned.Farmers’ leader Naresh Tikait said cultivators in western UP on Friday would “aggressively” participate in the Bharat Bandh and will block the movement of traffic in their strongholds. UP police have deployed additional security personnel in the western part of the state to maintain law and order, officials said. BS Rajewal, president of another faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said 185 farmers organisations including those from Rajasthan, Himachal, Telangana, Maharasthra, Madhaya Pradesh and Andhra Pradeseh have agreed to join the protests. Farmers organisations, backed by the Left parties and the Congress, have called for protests across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Friday. In Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi is supporting the protests.In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the ruling YSR Congress Party and opposition Telugu Desam Party have both supported the farm bills.Sarampalli Malla Reddy, vice-president of All India Kisan Sabha and president of the Telangana Rythu Sangham, said the farmers’ associations would block the national highways on Friday. “We shall fight against the implementation of the draconian acts,” Telangana agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said.In Maharashtra, many farmers’ organisations have decided to participate in Bharat Bandh. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana, a farmers outfit in Maharashtra, has decided to participate in the protest against agricultural bills but in a different way. its chief Raju Shetti said.“The people are fed up with the lockdown which lasted for months; thus we have decided not to go for a bandh. Instead we will be burning copies of the bills outside tehsildar offices across the state in protest. It will be a day-long agitation,” Shetti said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stir-to-intensify-as-farm-groups-come-together/story-F68KRocKCQGjwQXs5CEPqL.html

25-09-2020||Editorials||Bihar election dates set | HT Editorial||The Election Commission (EC) has announced dates for the Bihar election, the first major one to take place during the Covid-19 pandemic. It will be held in three phases — October 28, November 3 and November 7. A massive effort has been made by EC to reach masks, gloves, sanitisers and thermal imaging equipment to the state before it goes to the polls. Five main issues are likely to dominate the polls: How the state government has handled the pandemic; the trials and tribulations of 2.36 million migrants who have returned to Bihar from other states; unemployment; the aftermath of the floods; and the agrarian crisis.The Sushant Singh Rajput death probe could figure as well — but perhaps not as a major issue.While the BJP-JD(U)-LJP ruling coalition is a formidable force, it has its task cut out in convincing people that it has handled the crisis thrown up by the pandemic effectively. Covid-19 has brought into stark relief the many problems that the state faces. One is that of the huge reverse flow of migrant labour, leading to a spike in Covid-19 cases and heightened unemployment. Chief Minister (CM) Nitish Kumar has sought a skill-based profile of migrants, but critics have termed this pointless as there are no jobs to be had. The state’s health care system has been stretched thin and its testing strategy, with a huge bias towards inaccurate rapid antigen tests, is faulty. Farmers complain that they cannot harvest their crops in time as they have not been able to bring in heavy machinery from states such as Punjab; nor are they able to find workers; and supply chains have been disrupted as a result of which they have not been able to move their crop in time to the markets. Some of these problems are not unique to Bihar.These issues should serve as easy pickings for any opposition. But the RJD-Congress-led combine has not been able so far to push the government in any substantial manner though campaigning has begun. The RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, considered inexperienced by many, has so far not been able to provide the sort of leadership needed to take on the ruling coalition, which will count on both CM Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help make its case. Neither the Opposition nor the ruling coalition seems to have understood the extent of frustration and anger over job losses, agrarian distress, and spiraling cases of Covid-19. It will be interesting to see whether these issues take precedence over the traditional caste dynamics that have driven election results in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/bihar-election-dates-set-ht-editorial/story-mXN5fQEyZ81ltPqa50HzbJ.html
25-09-2020||Editorials||Ambitious labour reforms | HT Editorial||One came last year, a few months ahead of an unforeseen global health crisis, and the other came in the midst of it, but two significant reforms, almost exactly a year apart, could, in the medium-term, make Indian industry more competitive. The first, announced September 20 last year was a sharp cut in corporate taxes, especially for new manufacturing companies. The second, passed during the monsoon session of Parliament that effectively ended on Wednesday, was a set of labour reforms enshrined in three labour codes (the fourth one has already been cleared). For years, these have been touted as crucial second-generation reforms — the next logical set of policies to improve the competitiveness of Indian industry, and make it easier to do business in the country. Their absence, many experts believed, was one of the issues that afflicted the Indian manufacturing sector, making it difficult for the government to realise its aspiration to “Make in India”. This is understandable. India’s myriad labour laws were sharply focused on the organised sector (which employed a fraction of the overall workforce), and while designed to protect the interests of workers and ensure compliance proved cumbersome and inspection-intensive. They served as an effective disincentive for small companies to aspire to become large ones. And by preventing companies from adjusting their labour needs to suit market demand, they hurt competitiveness, the ability and willingness of industry to create jobs, and even the workers themselves (with many companies, including large car makers, opting to hire contract workers instead of regular ones). No government seemed willing to address the issue — labour reforms were a sticky political issue, after all. Now, they have been passed — consolidated sets of laws (or codes) on wages, social security, industrial relations, and occupational safety. The wage code was passed last year; the other three, during the monsoon session of Parliament. The worst thing that can happen to both sets of reforms (tax as well as labour) is to review their success in the immediate context of the Indian economy’s recovery from the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. They will make it easier to do business in India (as long as the underlying rules don’t play spoilsport). And they will boost industry’s competitiveness. But it will take time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/ambitious-labour-reforms/story-oK2guNCXgRDIKeiE3FlRwO.html
