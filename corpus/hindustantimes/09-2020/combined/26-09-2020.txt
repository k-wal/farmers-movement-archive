In his highly readable Black Death, first published in 1969, the historian Philip Ziegler, described some of the “lifestyle” measures taken by desperate citizens in Europe.“Diet was important. Anything which went quickly bad in hot weather was to be avoided. So was fish from the infected waters of the sea. Meat should be roast rather than boiled. Eggs were authorised if eaten with vinegar but should never be taken hard-boiled. Anyone trying to follow the advice of every expert would have been sadly perplexed. Ibn Khatimah approved of fresh fruit and vegetables but no one else agreed. Gentile of Foligno recommended lettuce, the Faculty of Medicine at Paris forbade it. Ibn Khatimah had faith in egg plant, another expert deplored its use... Gentile believed that it was best to keep steady the heat of the liver by sleeping first on the right side and then on the left. To sleep on one’s back was disastrous since this would cause a stream of superfluities to descend on the palate and nostrils. From thence these would flow back to the brain and submerge the memory.”There was also a view since bad drove out the bad, “to imbibe foul odours was a useful if not infallible protection.” This was more so because it was observed that: “Attendants who take care of latrines and those who serve in hospitals and other malodorous places are nearly all considered to be immune.” Consequently, Zeigler noted that it “was not unknown for apprehensive citizens of a plague-struck city to spend hours each day crouched over a latrine absorbing with relish the foetid smell.”While people were generally advised to stay at home and fumigate the interiors with aromatic scents, for those who had to venture out “a prudent precaution would be to carry an amber or smelling apple” made of paste from “equal portions of black pepper and red and white sandal, two portions of roses and a half portion of camphor.”As for immunity boosters, pills of aloes, myrrh and saffron were popular. One “expert” suggested “ten-year-old treacle blended with some 60 elements, including chopped-up snakes, and mixed with good wine.” On his part, Gentile of Foligno recommended powdered emerald: “A remedy so potent that, if a toad looked at it, its eyes would crack.”It is easy to mock the quackery of the Middle Ages, but today’s Covid-19 has witnessed desperate people attempting whatever promises immunity or even a glimmer of protection against the deadly virus. People are popping vitamin pills, zinc tablets, different forms of homeopathic concoctions and herbal cocktails, not to mention a small group of diehards who have fallen back on gaumutra (cow’s urine). While there is certainly a greater chance of an infected person recovering from Covid-19 today than was the case when the virus first made its appearance six months or more ago, the so-called preventive steps appear to as tenuous as those recommended against the plague 700 years ago. Certainly, the steady rise in the numbers of those infected suggests that this aspect of medical science at least is tantamount to whistling in the dark.Even something as basic and innocuous as the wearing of masks in public places has witnessed strong differences of opinion. Initially, even the medical fraternity believed that masks offered no additional benefits but since then this has changed with the advance of the virus. Instead, the wearing or non-use of the mask has become a point of political discord — with the upholders of individual freedom railing against the right of the State to dictate personal behaviour.Likewise, the administrative strategies to contain the spread of the pandemic have led to the “experts” fighting bitterly among themselves, with all the groups invoking science. This week, for example, two rival groups of “eminent” scientists have suggested different approaches to the United Kingdom government’s attempts to contain a “second wave”. One has suggested that restrictions be limited to the over-65s, while the other is in favour of harsh lockdowns, in anticipation of a magic vaccine. Meanwhile, a third group persists with the Swedish model — it could also be called the Donald Trump model — that is centred on the notion of individual responsibility, economic freedom at all cost and, wherever feasible, acquired herd immunity.Finally, there are eccentric interpretations of medical correctness. In the House, Members of Parliament (MPs) from the ruling party in West Bengal boasted about being guided by a Global Advisory Board headed by a Nobel Prize winner in economics. However, its belief that random — and negotiable — lockdowns for a day or two will confuse the virus seems based on either numerology or fantasy. The whole exercise seems as bizarre as the Spanish government’s attempt to divide urban neighbourhoods into health zones, with different sides of a street expected to observe different norms.The first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic has punctured the 21st century claim of being driven by the imperatives of science. By definition, science is centred on verifiable certitudes which, in the context of the war against the Wuhan virus, is only a half-truth. The notables of the 14th century had no such pretensions and subordinated science to God and experience. Maybe the discovery of the vaccine will tilt the scales back in favour of science. But till then, it seems a case of history repeating itself—with less intensity—700 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/lessons-from-the-black-death-in-the-time-of-covid-19-writes-swapan-dasgupta/story-bRA5T55A1fIOQzpj6JbLJO.html

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government bans sale of loose cigarettes and beedis, traders condemn move||The Maharashtra government has banned the sale of loose cigarette and beedis. The consumers will now have to buy the whole packet of these items. The reason cited is these single stick loose cigarettes or beedis do not have the specific health warning on it which is in the public interest. The State government has issued a notification in this regard, in the public interest. This has been issued under subsection (2) of section 7 of the cigarette and other Tobacco Products (prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and commerce Production, supply and Distribution) Act, 2OO3 (Act No. 34 of 2OO3).However, this has not gone well with both the consumers and the traders.“Not everyone can afford to but the whole packet, our sales will decrease,” said a vendor who has a shop in Parel.Sayed Mehboob who is regular smoker said that such warnings hardly deter him. “Regular smokers will smoke irrespective of any warning,” said Sayed. “The state government’s move may even backfire as those who smoke one daily will be tempted to smoke more if he/she is given the full packet,” he added.Many have called it a gimmick saying that the state does not have the mechanism to check the traders and it was just an eyewash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-bans-sale-of-loose-cigarettes-and-beedis-traders-condemn-move/story-o8FFn595GQOC1LkP3LUeCK.html

A truck with contraband was also seized earlier this month by the police near the border of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, which falls under the jurisdiction of Panjokhra police station.As per the FIR lodged on the complaint of station in-charge Mohan Lal, the raids were conducted after Lal received “secret information” about English and Indian liquor being stored inside a marriage palace on Barnala road.“Liquor to be sold in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh was stored and was being sold from here. It was a joint illegal venture of the owner of the palace, Jaipal, of Sector 7, Ambala City, and liquor contractor Pradeep Mittal. Pradeep didn’t have any documents or licence for the alcohol. Only an immediate raid could have helped recover huge quantities of liquor,” Lal said in the FIR.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Lal said, “There are nearly 1,000 boxes of different brands and quantities of liquor in the godown, but to know the exact details, counting is being done.”Meanwhile, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Ambala-2) Madan Lal said an excise inspector was called at the spot, who told the police that no godown had been let to anyone in the area. “So, this proves that the liquor is illegal and a probe will be carried out,” the DSP said.A case under relevant sections of the IPC and the Punjab Excise Act was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-liquor-third-godown-raided-this-month-in-ambala/story-RSRA9Uh5CvbQEjZn2uon2O.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Teachers in Maharashtra asked to upload data on students attending online, offline classes||As schools in the state continue to operate online for the last six months, teachers have now been asked to submit a weekly report on students getting access to online and offline education. As per a government resolution (GR) released on Friday, teachers now have to upload details of the students attending classes online, those who are reached out offline via phone or other means and those who cannot be reached, despite all attempts. Teachers have also been asked to share data concerning learning outcomes. The data has to be uploaded on a portal created by the state education department. “The data should be uploaded weekly on http://covid19.scertmaha.ac.in. Teachers can create their user IDs and update this from time to time. The data is essential for combining details of education during the current times,” states the GR. The department has also given a list of 44 helpline numbers- one for every district in the state. “Teachers can ask their doubts on these helplines,” it states. Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association said, “It is good that the government wants to combine this data. But asking this through an official GR is like showing mistrust on schools. The same could have been asked by officials of the education department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-teachers-in-maharashtra-asked-to-upload-data-on-students-attending-online-offline-classes/story-coEKScGeHnda2gisGgR97M.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP leaders Vinod Tawde, Pankaja Munde appointed party’s national office-bearers||Two prominent Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, Vinod Tawde and Pankaja Munde have been appointed as secretaries in the new national executive body of the party announced by party chief JP Nadda on Saturday. However, senior party leader Eknath Khadse has not been accommodated in the executive body.All three leaders were involved in a power tussle with then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and were unhappy with the treatment they got in the party. While Tawde and Khadse were denied tickets by the party for the 2019 Assembly election, Munde lost the election though she got party candidature. Saturday’s development is seen as their political rehabilitation, though it could be too early to say if it is a snub to Fadnavis, who still calls the shots in the state BJP, according to party leaders who spoke to HT. Tawde, a prominent Maratha leader, has a base in Konkan and Mumbai. Munde is a prominent Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader in the state. Daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, she hails from Marathwada (Central Maharashtra) region. Both are known for their organisational skills. There were speculations in the party that all three leaders would be rehabilitated as members of the Legislative Council when the elections for the same occurred earlier this year. However, none of them got party tickets for the elections to the upper house. Now, Tawde and Munde have been politically rehabilitated with roles in the party’s organisational body. Both of them are among 13 national secretaries in the national executive body of the party. Sunil Deodhar, who played a significant role in BJP’s victory in Tripura, and Vijaya Rahatkar, a former chairperson of the state women’s rights commission, are the other national secretaries from Maharashtra. However, Khadse who has been publicly criticising Fadnavis did not figure in the list. There have been speculations that Khadse is in touch with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leadership and exploring his options. “Though the post of secretary in the national executive body is as important as that of the general secretary, it is surely a political rehabilitation for Tawde and Munde. It is a signal by the party leadership that they are being given importance in the party,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity. While there were speculations that the move is a signal by party’s top leadership to Fadnavis that it is not happy with his handling of things in Maharashtra, a senior leader and former state minister said: “It is too early to say whether this is a snub to Fadnavis. The decision to deny a ticket to Tawde or not send both of them to the legislative Council was not taken entirely by Fadnavis.”Fadnavis who calls the shots in the state BJP has a clear say in deciding key appointments in the state unit. Following the announcement, Munde tweeted, “Thanking all party Central Leaders Hon PM Shri @narendramodi ji, Home Minister Shri @Amitshaha ji for believing in me and our National President Shri @JPNadda ji for including me in his team. It’s an honour for me..@blsanthosh ji, @v_shrivsatish ji. (Sic).” Among the other Maharashtra BJP leaders, Jamal Siddiqui will head the minority morcha while MP Hina Gavit has been appointed as a national spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-leaders-vinod-tawde-pankaja-munde-appointed-party-s-national-office-bearers/story-BGhbKYmdVzSNS9xnA1By0I.html

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC disapproves of BMC’s stand on deducting salaries of visually-impaired staff||The Bombay high court (HC) on Saturday expressed displeasure over the adamant stand of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on deducting salaries of visually-impaired civic employees, although they were exempted from reporting on work due to Covid-19 pandemic.“It is unfortunate that the municipal corporation has taken this stand (of deducting salary of visually-impaired employees),” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni.“We are fortunate that we can see. We are fortunate that we do not have any deformities or disabilities,” the bench reminded the counsel for the civic body, senior advocate BV Bukhari.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the National Association of Blind, espousing the cause of the 287 visually-impaired BMC staffers, as the civic body started deducting their salaries for the Covid-19 lockdown period.Their counsel, advocate Uday Warunjikar, submitted that BMC has treated their absence as paid leave and the recovery was being made from the salary of the employees for the excess period of absence which is over and above their sanctioned leaves.Warunjikar further submitted that no transportation was available for the employees to reach their respective offices. Besides, he said the state government had issued a circular exempting the employees from attending offices.Representing the civic body, Bukhari conceded that relaxation was given to visually-impaired employees from attending office but maintained that the state government circular was not applicable to civic employees. He said the relaxation did not mean that the employees were to be paid for absent days.With regards to transportation, the senior advocate initially maintained that transportation was provided to civic employees throughout the lockdown period, but later said there was no question of providing transportation as the employees were granted relaxation.The judges were irked by the technical objections raised by the civic body instead of considering the issues of the visually-impaired employees sympathetically.“So you will give relaxation on one hand and take away the benefits on the other (by recovering salary paid for the absent days),” said the judges, commenting upon the civic body’s stand.After hearing both the parties, the court on Saturday reserved its order on the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-disapproves-of-bmc-s-stand-on-deducting-salaries-of-visually-impaired-staff/story-2HfhThV8htXdnoVzhjIPwK.html

While Padukone and Prakash were quizzed at the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) guest house in Colaba, Kapoor and Khan were grilled at the NCB office in Ballard Estate.Padukone, who reached the guest house at 9.50am, was questioned by NCB’s special investigation team (SIT) for around six hours, and Prakash reached at 10.50am and left around 3.45pm. Meanwhile, Kapoor reached the NCB office at 11.50am and left around 6pm, after around six hours of questioning, and Khan reached at 1pm and left around 6pm. “We have not issued any fresh summons to anyone today [Saturday]. Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan were examined in both the cases registered by NCB (case number 15/20 and 16/20) and their statements will be produced before the court. Deepika Padukone’s statement was recorded in the 15/20 case,” Mutha Ashok Jain, deputy director general of NCB, said. “We have questioned many people and recovered evidence. We will review and plan for further investigation and course of action in the case.”The agency also arrested executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad on Saturday. A NCB team had raided Prasad’s residence in Andheri on Thursday and officials claimed they had recovered sufficient evidence to arrest him. They, however, did not disclose details. NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed Prasad’s arrest.On Friday, actor Rakul Preet Singh, too, was questioned for around four hours, while Prakash was interrogated for around seven hours. Prakash, a talent manager at KWAN talent management company, had been called in again on Saturday. Prakash’s name came up during the probe after NCB questioned Rajput’s talent manager Jaya Saha on the basis of chats submitted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which was conducting a parallel probe into Rajput’s death. In a group chat, Saha, Prakash and Padukone had discussed drugs, said NCB officials. Based on Saha’s statement, Prakash was called for an inquiry and Padukone was summoned, said the official. Kapoor and Khan were summoned after their names came up in Rajput’s girlfriend actor Rhea Chakraborty’s statement, said the official.Don’t chase celeb cars: DCP“Today we observed that many mediapersons were chasing the cars of celebrities/people who were called by the NCB. They are endangering the lives of themselves and the people going for inquiry. Action will be taken against drivers and vehicles would be seized if this happens again,” said Sangram Singh Nishandar, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-drug-angle-ncb-questions-deepika-padukone-sara-ali-khan-shraddha-kapoor/story-oW4yUnOKddbf7ToMHynOcK.html

26-09-2020||Mumbai||13 times rise in quantity of sea cucumber seizures from India over five years: Study||Over the last five years, illegal trade involving sea cucumbers in India has witnessed a sharp spike. Over 27,166.5kg of dry, wet, and live sea cucumbers worth around ₹29.4 crore (US$3.9 million) have been seized so far, a recent analysis has revealed.The study by Hong Kong-based non-profit environmental group OceansAsia has identified a 13-times rise in sea cucumber seizures over five years from Lakshadweep, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and the Indian Ocean waters.According to the analysis, in 2015, three cases were registered, five persons were arrested and 980kg sea cucumbers worth ₹1.04 crore (US$141,610) was seized, while in 2019, 15 cases were registered, 41 persons were arrests and over 12,515kg of sea cucumbers worth ₹13.26 crore (US$1.8 million) was seized. Between January and August 2020, 11 cases were reported, 15 persons were arrested, and 9,016kg of sea cucumbers worth ₹9.58 crore (US$1.3 million) was seized. Consignments were a mix of live, processed (dry and wet), and semi-processed sea cucumbers.“There has been a significant increase in sea cucumber poaching and smuggling in the south of India recently, with Lakshadweep and Tamil Nadu now global hot spots,” said Dr Teale Phelps Bondaroff, director of research, OceansAsia.Sea cucumbers are worm-like sea creatures that are single branched marine organisms (invertebrates) high in demand across Southeast Asia, mainly China, for food and traditional medicine. Protected under Schedule I under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, a trade involving sea cucumbers is banned. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) imposed a total ban on harvesting and transporting sea cucumbers in 2001.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general of forests (wildlife), MoEFCC and director WCCB said, “We are fully aware of the rising sea cucumber trade at Lakshadweep. Taking cognisance of the request from the local administration to reinforce protection measures, adequate financing under a species protection plan, including sea cucumbers, has been provided. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB_ is monitoring this illegal trade at ports, airports, and all other dispatch points, and regular follow-ups are in place to address this issue.”In February, WCCB sought the Interpol to issue a Purple Notice (a category to tackle international environmental crime against criminals hunting wild animals).Presently, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) taking over all major sea cucumber poaching offence cases in Lakshadweep.The general modus operandi appears to entail sea cucumbers being poached from Indian waters and then smuggled into Sri Lanka. “This way sea cucumbers are laundered and can be re-exported to Southeast Asian markets,” said Dr Bondaroff adding, “An operation involves a couple of fishers in a small boat or gleaning on the shore, to larger groups using divers and operating several vessels in deeper waters.”The Lakshadweep forest department confirmed OceanAsia’s figures were accurate if not more. “Lakshadweep became the source for this trade over the past year-and-a-half. The trade was at a small-scale earlier with isolated cases but witnessing the demand, local people got involved after being given access to satellite phones and the greed for fast money allowing a substantial rise in trade volume,” said Damodhar AT, secretary environment, forest and chief wildlife warden, Lakshadweep administration. To enhance protection, Lakshadweep declared the world’s first sea cucumber conservation reserve across 239sq km - Dr KK Mohammed Koya Sea Cucumber Conservation Reserve, Cheriyapani in February.In August MoEFCC sanctioned ₹2.72 crore for 2020-21 to enhance security measures to curb wildlife crime. The ministry agreed to form the Lakshadweep Marine Wildlife Protection Force (LMWPF) by engaging 350 personnel and established three anti-poaching camps in uninhabited islands (Veliyapani, Thinnakkara, and Suheli Islands). Damodhar said recruitment of 200 personnel (part of the LMWPF) will be completed next week.Sea cucumbers are typically sold dried, canned or frozen form, though sea cucumber powders and extracts are also available, the analysis read highlighting the spike in demand and prices over recent years. The price of a kg of dried sea cucumber that sold for the equivalent of approximately ₹221 (US$3) in the 1960s and sold for ₹4.400 (US$60) in the 1980s and ₹8,800 (US$120) in the 1990s, skyrocketed to ₹27,200 (US$370) in the 2000s, the study claimed. “The prices are even higher today. What’s worse, we have come across reports of the involvement of organized crime syndicates in the industry, with drug cartels in Mexico and the Yakuza in Japan getting involved in the industry or using the industry as cover to other illicit operations,” said Dr Bondaroff. “Destroying local sea cucumber populations can have a serious impact on marine ecosystems, wildlife, and people’s livelihoods. If poaching and smuggling are not curbed, the sea cucumber population will likely collapse.”CBI INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCING DURING PANDEMICMeanwhile, the CBI has been investigating cases over the past two years via video conferencing during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Damodhar. “Due to travel restrictions and 21-day quarantine rule in Covid-free Lakshadweep, the CBI teams have not managed to reach the islands. However, along with our support and the Enforcement Directorate, all previously arrested accused will be rearrested by CBI to track down the nexus,” he said.SCALE OF THE SEA CUCUMBER TRADEOceanAsia, a marine conservation organisation based out of Hong Kong combating wildlife crime in Asia through investigation, research and awareness, compiled their analysis based on media reports between 2015 and 2020. “There are limitations to our research but we are currently working on a more detailed version looking at the global sea cucumber crime industry, which will be released around December,” said Dr Bondaroff. “It is good to see increased attention and vigilance on the part of Indian authorities. However, international and inter-agency cooperation is also needed, as many sea cucumber smuggling routes out of India appear to go through Sri Lanka.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/13-times-rise-in-quantity-of-sea-cucumber-seizures-from-india-over-five-years-study/story-M6zDWcGtzmlZzxGLk0ZwKJ.html
26-09-2020||Gurugram||HSVP will auction 15 plots to reduce ₹12K crore debt burden||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has identified 15 commercial properties in Gurugram to be auctioned in October.The move follows the authority’s decision to monetise its land assets and reduce its debt which, according to an RTI reply in March, stood at around ₹12,000 crore. The auction is expected to raise ₹1,000 crore.As per the details shared by the authority, Sector 10 has the most number of plots with three for shopping complexes (measuring 6,080 square metres (sqm), 6,096 sqm and 5865 sqm respectively), two sites for shopping (7,820 sqm each) and three sites for commercial office (each 7,820 sqm). In sector 43, two commercial complexes of sizes 2,320 sqm and 3,120 sqm shall be part of the mega auction. Sector 47 has three sites measuring 4,327 sqm, 6,751 sqm and 82,798 sqm. HSVP will also auction a site for a college in sectors 52 A and 53 of 34,340 sqm each.The authority may identify more commercial sites up until auction day, the date of which is yet to be finalised. Apart from large commercial plots, other vacant plots too shall be identified and auctioned in the coming months, HSVP said. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, said, “We will identify plots in other sectors as well to include in the planned auction. We have a strong reason to believe that these plots will be sold at a premium as the auctions held in last few months have been successful.” “There are around 750 vacant plots in estate office one and I have given directions for measuring them for auction. Encroachers will be at the earliest,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer I. As per information shared by the authority in a reply to an RTI filed by city resident Aseem Takyar, the loans taken by it were from a number of private and public sector banks. The loans paid for projects across the state and also to pay compensation and enhancements to farmers whose land had been acquired for development. The figures were a drop from its reply to another RTI in 2019, when the authority said that the loans it took from banks stood at ₹19,611 crore till December, 2018. Chander Shekhar Khare, the then HSVP administrator, had said that authority was facing financial crunch due to the loans and they were looking at monetizing the land assets to repay the debt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-will-auction-15-plots-to-reduce-12k-crore-debt-burden/story-yp7ir6jzLvh0ea9Nrz6saI.html
26-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Test positivity rate dips below 10% for first time in two weeks||The district reported 273 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, along with 455 new recoveries and two deaths due to the illness, as per the data shared by the heath department. With the growth rate of new cases having slowed down over the past three days, the daily test-positivity rate(TPR) in Gurugram district fell to 8.5 percent on Saturday. This is the first time in at least two weeks that the TPR has dipped below the 10 percent-mark. Officials said this indicates that Gurugram might once again be seeing a slowdown in transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.Health department officials also pointed out that the rate of recovery from Covid-19 has seen a significant improvement in the past week, increasing from 81 percent on September 19 to 85.6 percent on September 26. “Over the past three days, the number of daily recoveries has been over 400, but new cases are below 300. This has helped drive up the recovery rate by a good margin,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Gurugram. The daily growth rate of new positives, meanwhile, dipped to 1.4 percent on Saturday, the lowest in at least three weeks. “Throughout September we have seen a growth rate of about 2 percent, which has dipped only in the last week. Our aim is to bring the growth rate down to 1 percent, as was the case in August,” said Dr Ram Prakash Sharma, district epidemiologist, Gurugram. The slowing down of the growth rate is also indicated in Gurugram’s doubling rate, which stood at 61 days on Saturday — up from 41 days a week prior.With the dip in the positivity rate, officials said, they now have more time to increase testing. The district health department had aimed to increase the number of daily tests for Covid-19 to 5,000, but health department data shows that, over the past week, the district conducted anywhere between 3,000 to 3,500 tests per day. Officials explained that this is not worrying. “When positivity rate drops without an increase in tests, it indicates that transmission of the virus has slowed down. We can’t say with certainty as to why this is the case. However, numbers indicate that this is likely to be the case,” said Dr Jai Prakash, adding that testing capacities will be expanded nonetheless in the coming weeks. “Transmission of the virus may pick up as the temperature drops in the coming weeks, so the appropriate response would be to increase testing at this stage,” he added. As of September 26, Gurugram’s total tally of reported infections stands at 19,640. In the past 26 days, Gurugram has recorded 7,499 cases of Covid-19 (more than double the 2,942 cases reported throughout the month of August). The district has also recorded 28 deaths this month so far, up from 16 deaths in August. The number of active cases in the district currently stands at 2,658, down from 2,781 on September 19. Of these, 239 are currently hospitalised, while 2,402 are under home isolation. Another 17 cases are under observation at district Covid care centres. Ventilator and ICU bed occupancy stands at 50 percent each, while only a quarter of general oxygen beds are in use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-test-positivity-rate-dips-below-10-for-first-time-in-two-weeks/story-pEGnirAeez4LmtoZd75AuK.html
26-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Family of motorcyclist killed near Belvedere Towers demands stringent action against juvenile, parents||Family of motorcyclist 48-year-old Alok Gupta, who was killed in an accident on August 23 involving a vehicle driven by a minor near Belvedere Towers in DLF Phase-2, organised a silent march on Saturday morning demanding justice.Armed with placards and banners, around 400 people, including family, friends, and cyclists, took part in the solidarity march that started from DT Mega Mall around 7am till the accident spot near the DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station. They demanded that the tougher section 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) be invoked against the accused.The juvenile in the case had been apprehended and the car owner, his friend’s father, had been arrested. Police had registered an FIR under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304 A (Death by negligence) at DLF Phase 2 police station. These are bailable offences. Later, the police had added sections 184 (driving dangerously) and 185 (for drink driving) of the Motor Vehicles Act to the FIR as the minor was allegedly inebriated.Family members said that the investigation had not progressed since the past month and that the parents of the juvenile had not been made party to the case.Mihika Wahi Gupta, Alok’s wife, said, “We have not been given any update on the investigations and have been running from pillar to post. The sections imposed by them so far are very weak. The parents of the child driving the car haven’t been booked. The co-passenger (another minor) was also not arrested. The owner of the car, who gave the keys despite the children being drunk, was also released on bail within an hour. This is no justice.”Anurag Gupta, Alok’s brother, said, “Drink driving is not a negligent act to be punished under Section 304 A. It is an act done with the knowledge of the consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol, which must ideally attract IPC section 304 (II). In the past, the Supreme Court has also said that parents of minors should be held accountable in such instances and booked.”Gaurav Pant, a family friend, said that the march was aimed at seeking justice for Alok and many others like him. Pant said that drink driving was a menace and needed to be curbed through strong deterrence. “Such accidents take place routinely and due to weak sections, the perpetrators get away easily. Strict laws need to be imposed so that such cases are not reported in future,” said Pant. Inspector Aman, station house officer (SHO), DLF Phase 2, said, “We had taken legal opinion on the matter and invoked IPC section 304A in the FIR as per law and facts of the case. If the car was registered in the name of juvenile driver’s parents, then action would have been taken against them. This is not the case here.” Karan Goyal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), DLF, said, “The juvenile and the owner of the car were booked and arrested under relevant Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act offences. The investigation is still going on in the most legal and fair manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-family-of-motorcyclist-killed-near-belvedere-towers-demands-stringent-action-against-juvenile-parents/story-z3Dg9nbBsjCPfkcD0ofwgI.html
26-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana: New industrial policy to come into effect from November 1||The new industrial policy of Haryana with a focus on attracting investments and reserving private sector jobs for the local youth, will come into effect from November 1, said chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday. November 1 is also observed as Haryana Foundation Day.Khattar, however, reassured that in case private companies fail to find qualified local youth, they will be free to hire people from other states. “The new policy will also improve the ease of doing business in the state. We held a discussion with various industry leaders and sought their suggestions with the aim of incorporating them in the draft policy,” said Khattar after a meeting at the PWD guest house in Gurugram on Saturday.  The CM also said that the government will closely work with industry leaders to ensure that local youth are given preference in the private sector. “We have decided that, if need be, upskilling courses can be designed to impart training of soft skills and behavioural changes to the local youth so that they are absorbed in private sector jobs,” said Khattar. Khattar added that Haryana has consistently improved its ranking in the ease of doing business but due to procedural issues, its ranking fell this year. However, his government will ensure that these issues are resolved at the earliest. The CM also said that as the sizes of landholdings are shrinking, the rate of unemployment among the local youth is rising. This needs to be addressed on a priority basis. “It is because of this reason that efforts are being made to create more jobs, bring in more investment, and upskill the youth,” he said. Earlier this year, the Haryana Cabinet had moved an ordinance, reserving 75% jobs in the private sector in the state for the local people. However, the Governor referred it to the President. The reservation issue was also the poll plank of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which is presently in a coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state.Chautala,who was present at the meeting, said that under the new policy, the government has increased monetary incentive to industry for giving employment to locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-new-industrial-policy-to-come-into-effect-from-november-1/story-lOWy3sYdbLhME5vzZ3YjsO.html
26-09-2020||Noida||Cops raid several places in Ghaziabad’s Khoda colony to trace over 100 suspected criminals||The police from Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi, in a joint operation on Saturday evening, raided several places in Ghaziabad’s Khoda colony to trace the location of over 100 suspected criminals. Named as ‘Prahar,’ the operation was carried out after the police from the three cities compiled a list of criminals living in Khoda, which shares its boundary with Delhi and Noida. According to the police, many criminals commit crime in the neighbouring cities and cross the border and hide themselves in the densely populated colony to evade arrest. “A combined list of 120 alleged criminals was formulated who had residential addresses in Khoda colony. They were mostly known for involvement in street crimes such as robbery, burglary, snatching, and vehicle lifting,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1 (Noida).He said that the two-hour operation was carried out from 4-6 pm. “The idea was to verify the whereabouts of these criminals and to monitor their movement to ensure that they were staying away from any criminal activities,” said Singh.From the Noida police commissionerate, about 60 police personnel were involved in the raids, while 30 from Delhi and 20 from Ghaziabad police were part of the operation.“During the raids, some of the men were found to be missing from their official addresses. A separate list of absconders is being prepared and the action will be taken separately. Some of the men were found to be abiding by laws. But there were 27 suspicious persons. These men have been detained for further questioning. We will prepare a dossier and verify the activities they have been involved in. If they are found innocent, they will be released,” said the additional DCP.The police will continue with this joint operation in coming weeks where different pockets will be chosen and whereabouts of other criminals involved in petty and serious crimes will be verified, said the officials.The Delhi police said that a similar operation was carried out in Khoda colony, along with the Ghaziabad police, a fortnight ago. “The East district (Delhi) police in coordination with Noida and Ghaziabad police carried out the operation on Saturday. This time a larger area was covered,” said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east) .Khord colony houses nearly 42,000 homes with a population of about four lakh. The Ghaziabad police said that a team from the Khoda police station was present during the raids. “It was a joint operation of all three police forces. The idea was to monitor history sheeters and other criminals as well as a sort of confidence building exercise for police personnel to ensure they are active. We will continue such measures at border areas,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cops-raid-several-places-in-ghaziabad-s-khoda-colony-to-trace-over-100-suspected-criminals/story-Sdj9592Dht7KXc0Qh1kT5L.html
26-09-2020||Noida||Noida: District traffic police to use Google Maps to address traffic congestion||Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police said they are going to use online traffic monitoring application to keep tabs on vehicular movement and send personnel to decongest jams. Officials also issued two helpline numbers and urged people to share their complaints and feedback to improve the city’s traffic.Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said the department has set up a help desk and issued two helpline numbers – 7065100100 and 9971009001 – for people to report congestion, malfunctioning traffic lights, or other problems. “The first number is for calls as well as WhatsApp messages while the second number is only for calls. The calls and messages will be swiftly addressed,” he said.He said the department is taking several measures to improve vehicular movement in Noida and Greater Noida. “We have planned to use Google Maps to ease traffic as it is a convenient way of navigating to a destination. Traffic personnel will monitor roads on Google Map. The maps share the traffic situation live in terms of green lines (where movement is smooth) and red lines (where movement is slow). The officials will identify roads and stretches where traffic is slow and rush traffic personnel and marshals to address the problems,” he said. He further said that vehicles found stranded on the road causing congestion will be towed. “If the traffic is slow due to any other problem, the officials will take necessary steps,” Saha added. On Saturday, traffic officials held a meeting with local residents through video conference and discussed various issues to improve the situation.KK Jain, general secretary Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Association (FONRWA) said some traffic signals are not synchronised in the city. “At present, the traffic signals have fixed timings. They should be upgraded to dynamic signalling so that they automatically change the timing as per traffic pressure,” he said. Jain also demanded that roads and metro stations should be free from encroachment as it slows down traffic. There are over 500 personnel – four traffic inspectors, seven sub-inspectors, 103 head constables and 395 constables – in the traffic police department. In 2019, the district traffic police had issued 6,99,708 challans and collected ₹14.76 crore in fines from violators. From January to September 24, 2020, the department has issued fines to 3,39,775 violators. The department issued 55,424 fines in January and 27,245 in February this year. In March, 19,823 penalties and in April, 11,541 fines were issued, as the national lockdown was announced in wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. From May, the violations again started increasing. In May, June, and July, 19,402, 56,434 and 60,180 fines were issued. A total of 48,488 challans were issued in August and 41,238 challans till September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-district-traffic-police-to-use-google-maps-to-address-traffic-congestion/story-gUFcSRwJFTVsWL9JOpMUaP.html
26-09-2020||Noida||Noida to make compost out of STP sludge and horticulture waste||The Noida Authority on Saturday said that it has decided to make biogas and compost out of sludge produced at sewage treatment plants in the city.Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari has given in-principle approval to the project.The authority will use the compost turner to chop the horticulture waste, mix it with sludge and make compost, a process that will take 45 days. Once operational, the plant will produce at least 50 tonnes of compost daily that will be used in the city’s parks and also sold at a rate of ₹3-5 per kg, said officials.According to the Noida authority’s data, the city produces 231 million litres of sewage daily. In the absence of this compost making project, the authority has to use the sludge in earth filling or dump it at vacant plots, which is not only polluting but unhygienic as well.In the first phase, the authority will use sludge from its sector 54 sewage treatment plant (STP). “We are in the process of hiring the agency that will set up the at the sector 54 STP. Later, the compost making project will cover all our STPs located in sectors 50, 123 and 168,” said Rajiv Tyag,i general manager of the Noida authority.The first plant is expected to be made operational in the next six months and is estimated to cost ₹9 crore. It will be built on the lines of a similar project in Delhi’s Nilothi area. The authority is also seeking the details from the Delhi’s plant before it starts work at the ground.This is not the first time that the authority has decided to treat sludge to convert sludge from STPs into compost. A similar project was mooted in 2013-14, but never took off.The authority has total six STPs across the city with capacities of 34 million litres per day (MLD) and 25MLD in sector 50, 33MLD and 54MLD in sector 54, 35MLD in sector 123 and 50MLD in sector 168.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-make-compost-out-of-stp-sludge-and-horticulture-waste/story-SBF4tHuKpmvXe6haLNJh0L.html
26-09-2020||City||Greater Noida authority wants registry office back in Gamma 2||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority has requested the Uttar Pradesh stamp and registration department to shift the property registration office back to the city’s sector Gamma-II. Authority officials said that property buyers are facing inconvenience as the new office is located about 30 km away in densely populated Dadri tehsil.On September 3, the registration department issued an order, starting execution of property registries or tripartite lease-deed in order to transfer properties, including flats, shops or plots, at the respective tehsil offices instead of offices at non-tehsil buildings. The decision came in response to a demand raised by the Dadri tehsil from the UP stamps and registration department located in Lucknow.“We have requested the commissioner (stamp), UP, to shift the registry office back to Greater Noida’s sector Gamma-II because our property buyers are facing inconvenience. We hope that the office will be soon shifted to the old place, where it was operational. The authority staff, along with property buyers, have to be present in the registry office for tripartite sub-lease deed or registry, and reaching the old office was convenient,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.The registration department’s assistant inspector general in Gautam Budh Nagar, SK Tripathi, said, “The department took the decision of shifting the registry office from sector Gamma-II to Dadri Tehsil as per the rules. If the Greater Noida authority wants it back from Dadri tehsil to sector Gamma-II near its office, then it should get the decision done from the state government. We will follow that.”In 1995, the state government had set up a property registry office at sector Gamma-II so that property buyers from newly developed urban areas, including group housings, do not need to travel to Dadri tehsil for the job required to transfer the property title.“The decision to shift the registry office was contrary to the government’s plan to provide the ease to customers or the investors,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association.Developers have also requested the state government to allow registry at the old office in sector Gamma-II. “The government should shift back the registry office in sector Gamma-II because it will be in favour of the homebuyers and the real estate sector. The state government should provide as much comfort to the investors as it can to encourage the growth,” said Abhay Kumar, chairman and managing director, Griha Pravesh Buildteck Pvt Ltd, a realty firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-authority-wants-registry-office-back-in-gamma-2/story-hcieQ0f6PPfJIaWAQAcE0H.html
26-09-2020||City||UP to redefine containment zones; state officials deputed for Covid-19 monitoring in Ghaziabad||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday said that the definition of containment zones will be modified and they are likely to be more compact in the form of ‘micro containment zones.’ According to the district health department, with the new concept, it is likely that the micro containment zones will have a lesser number of houses under the perimeter control.According to the state government, the number of containment zones in the state is about 18,510 which have about 13.5 lakh houses in total. In Ghaziabad, there were 394 containment zones till September 25, as listed by the district administration.“The definition of containment zones will be modified by the government and they will become more compact and will be in the form of ‘micro containment zones’, where perimeter control and monitoring will be stricter, besides which all people in the house will be tested,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The state government is likely to roll out more directions in this regard soon, said officials.In their July 24 directions, in which containment zones were defined, category one zones, which have one Covid-19 case, are created in a radius of 100 metres or a mohalla, whichever is less. Category two zones are those which have more than one case and created in a radius of 200 metres with additional buffer area for monitoring, which is assessed on the basis of local conditions.In a recent video conference held with the Centre, the state government had raised the issue of diversion of more resources to manage containment zones, even though many activities have opened up since the lockdown.“According to present norms, a 200 metres containment zone is estimated to have about 300 houses, and a 100 metres containment zone has about 150 houses. With the new concept of micro containment zones, it is likely that we will have a smaller number of houses under both categories – one and two. We are expecting government directions soon in this regard,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.“In case the number of houses covered under micro containment zones is reduced, it will help us take up 100% testing of all individuals, as directed by the Indian Council for Medical Research,” he added.In Ghaziabad, the state government-appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, on Friday took stock of the existing containment zones and directed the district to strictly monitor and manage them.The state government has also sent four officers to Ghaziabad for monitoring coronavirus-related activities in the district. Ghaziabad is one of the 16 districts in the state which have more than 100 cases daily on an average per week. According to official figures from September 1 to September 24, the district added 4,706 cases to its tally, with an average of about 196 cases per day. During this period, the district also conducted 88,963 sampling/testing with an average of 3,706 per day. The four officials will hold review meetings with district officials and will also take up inspections and submit reports to the chief minister’s office as well as to the state administration. “The four officials have arrived and they will be taking up a review meeting on Saturday night. Once the meeting is over, we will be able to know of their suggestions and what steps will be needed to better tackle the Covid-19 situation,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-to-redefine-containment-zones-state-officials-deputed-for-covid-19-monitoring-in-ghaziabad/story-EOhhzKPxrv4WzAYnTaB9SM.html

We asked them not to rest at the bus stand and advised them to go home. At the same time, the suspect, Ashish Thakur, arrived at the spot on a motorcycle and started capturing our photos,” she said. When confronted, the suspect abused the constables and then fled the spot, she added.The women police personnel informed the control room and informed them about the alleged incident. A police response vehicle (PRV) reached the spot and chased the suspect who had fled towards Sector Delta. The police said that on being apprehended, the suspect allegedly manhandled two constables from the PRV team and threatened them.The suspect, a resident of Brahmpuri mohalla in Dadri, had told the women constables that he was a reporter, but, the police said, an initial probe found the claim false.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Sector Beta 2 police had registered a case against Thakur under Sections 354 C (voyeurism), 506 (criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-man-arrested-for-filming-abusing-two-women-constables-in-greater-noida/story-2HJKt1LstYWUAUxlyKNqJP.html
26-09-2020||City||25 hot spots crucial to curbing air pollution in district to be identified, says state pollution regulatory body||The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) has directed district officials to identify different hotspots in Ghaziabad in areas which face issues of garbage dumping and burning, road dust, industrial emission, heavy volume of traffic and those which have construction activities, among others.The directions have been issued for 16 non-attainment cities of the state, including Ghaziabad, which have high pollution levels and need to take pollution control measures ahead of the approaching winter season. Last year, officials had identified seven hotspot areas in the district while this year, they are planning to increase the number to about 25, with active participation from residents.“The process of identifying hotspots is underway. We have also asked residents to send us a list of such areas, along with photographs, so that such areas can be included in the hotspot list. These will be closely monitored with the help of quick response teams and flying squads. We have already prepared our winter action plan which we have started implementing,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Last year, officials had identified areas such as Sahibabad, Hindon Vihar, Pasonda, NH-9 as hotspots. This year, officials expect that the number of hotspots will be about 25 in number at district level. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on the other hand, had in 2019 identified only Sahibabad as one of the hotspots in Ghaziabad.“This year, we have so far identified several hotspot areas where construction activity is expected. These include Raj Nagar Extension, Siddharth Vihar and Vasundhara. For industrial emissions, we have so far identified the South Side GT Road Industrial Area and Site IV Industrial area. Areas affected by dumping and burning of solid waste include BS Road Industrial Area, Anand Industrial Area and solid waste dumping sites of the municipal corporation,” Sharma added. The identification process will be completed in one week, after which the winter action plan will be implemented.Ghaziabad city, in 2019, has topped the list of the most polluted cities on several occasions during the winter months. According to UPPCB records, the city in 2019 had 31 days when the air quality spiked to ‘severe’ category in range of 401 to 500 on the air quality index (AQI), on a scale of zero to 500. For another 67 days in 2019, the AQI was recorded under the ‘poor’ category which ranges from 301 to 400.“Implementation is the major issue when it comes to regulation and enforcement against polluting factors. Steps such as preparation of action plan and identification of hotspots, etc., should have been done during the first part of the year. By this time, officials should have started with enforcement in order to tackle air pollution,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The district at present has four Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) – at Vasundhara, Indirapuram, Sanjay Nagar and Loni. According to official records, the average PM2.5 levels at Indirapuram were 69.25 micrograms per cubic metres (mpcm) from January to August in 2019. During the same period this year, the average PM2.5 levels were 68 mpcm, both of which are higher than the standard limit of 60 mpcm. Likewise, the average PM2.5 levels during the same period last year at Vasundhara stood at 98.75 mpcm while the average during the same period was 77.29 mpcm in the current year. The average PM10 levels at the four stations were recorded in range of 137.32 mpcm to 168.18 mpcm from January to August in the current year. The standard PM10 limit is 100 mpcm. “We have written to our members to identify areas which are affected by road dust or have instances of garbage burning, etc. The list will be forwarded to UPPCB in the next two-three days. Further, we have suggested that members of civil society should also be allowed to conduct surprise inspection at sites, including industrial units, so that violations can be detected,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of the apartment owners’ federation. On September 19, Bhure Lal – the chairperson of the Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority (EPCA) – had visited the district for an inspection and directed officials to control fugitive dust, roadside parking, burning of solid and plastic waste, besides preparing a parking plan to prevent roadside parking of vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-hot-spots-crucial-to-curbing-air-pollution-in-district-to-be-identified-says-state-pollution-regulatory-body/story-YOAsDFouc2FryMRqPuXuLK.html
26-09-2020||City||Ram Lila, Durga Puja to pale under Covid shadow||As the coronavirus disease pandemic continues to cast its shadow over the country, the festival season in October in Ghaziabad is likely to be curtailed.Durga Puja samitis say they are going to restrict access to the pandals, and Ramlila samitis have almost dropped plans for a grand Ramlila Manchan, Ravan Dahan and the Mela . The city has about 12-15 different Durga Puja samitis that celebrate the festivities in grand style each year and people from all walks of like become part of festivities. “Usually, thousands of people arrived each day to witness the celebrations. But with the pandemic and other restrictions, it will be difficult to manage a huge gathering. So far, we have planned that the puja will be held in morning at the pandal, and only the members will join. Unlike the traditional way when people gathered in pandal to have food, this year we will send them food packets,” said Abhijit Roy, founder member of Prantic Cultural Society, Indirapuram. Cultural programmes, which used to includes artistes from different cities, will be an in-house event and will be aired online. “This year we have also curtailed our budget and have also written to the UP officials, suggesting some protocols which can be followed for Durga Puja celebrations. We are hopeful that the government will soon issue some guidelines,” Roy said. Bongotoru, another Durga Puja organisation which holds celebrations in Shipra Sun City, Indirapuram, will also restrict entry to pandals. “We have adopted the token system that will help us restrict entry to a maximum of 100 people to the pandal. We are also scaling down our celebrations by almost 80%,” said Surajit Dey Purkayastha, vice president of Bongotoru. “Unlike the previous years when we had cultural activities under the Pandal, this year the activities will be pre-recorded or streamed online. At the pandal we will follow all the health protocols and have also planned Covid testing camp.” Ramlila cancelled  “As of now, the Ramlila is not happening this year. This is happening for the first time in our 40 years of Ramlila Manchan,” said Lalid Jaiswal, president of Shri Dharmik Ramlila Samiti, Kavi Nagar. “There will no Ramliala Manchan, no Ravan Dahan. Normally, we start with preparations about two months prior to Ramlila. But no such preparation is taken up this year. Even if the government relaxes guidelines, we will not be able to arrange for vendors, artistes, craftsmen.” The Kavi Nagar Ramlila during past several years had been staging ‘digital Ramlila’ which has become famous across the city. “However, we have asked the artistes to prepare three hours of Ramlila which we can play at an auditorium in case the conditions are relaxed. In such a case, the three hours of Ramlila will be staged for 10 days,” said Jaiswal. The oldest Ramlila organised by the Sullamal Ramlila Samiti at Ghanta Ghar is stated to be around 100 years old Ramlila in the city. “We will not be having the Ramlila Manchan, Ravan Dahan and the Mela this year. We have also not engaged artistes or craftsmen this year. Still, we are waiting for the guidelines from the UP government and will see what we can do,” said Virendra Kumar who is the president of the samiti. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that soon there is a video-conferencing which will be taken up by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “So far, the restrictions are continuing and no large gatherings are allowed. Further, there is lot of stress on Covid protocols in order to curb Covid-19 infection. It is expected that the Durga Puja and Ramlila celebrations will be largely curtailed. We expect that some guidelines will be issued in coming time. Although the festivities also boost local economy and provide gainful employment opportunities to artistes, craftsmen and others, but the situation this year is different due to the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ram-lila-durga-puja-to-pale-under-covid-shadow/story-Qs9UmSYdDiqEvKOzXwYQGK.html
26-09-2020||City||Two minor boys apprehended for celebratory firing||Two minors were apprehended on Saturday for allegedly firing in the air during a birthday celebration in Jewar.The two boys, aged 14 and 15 years, were apprehended after a video of the celebratory firing had surfaced on social media platforms prompting the police to lodge a probe. Umesh Bahadur, station house officer (SHO) Jewar police station, said that on September 24, a video had surfaced in which the two boys, who are class 9 students, were seen holding a country-made gun and firing multiple rounds in the air. “Someone captured the incident on a mobile phone and the video was widely circulated on social media,” he said. The police said that two suspects were identified on Saturday and were then were picked up for questioning. “They told us that Thursday marked the birthday of the younger boy, and to celebrate it they took a country-made gun and fired multiple rounds in the backyard of his house,” the SHO said.The police said that no one was injured in the incident. “We registered a case against the two minors under the Arms Act, 1959. They were produced before the child welfare committee (CWC) and sent to juvenile home. We have seized the illegal weapon used in the crime as well,” he said. One of the suspects told the police that a country-made gun was kept in house for several years.In December 2018, a 14-year-old boy was killed in celebratory firing at an engagement ceremony in Dadri. The victim, a native of Ghodi Bacheda village, was hit by a stray bullet in the neck. He was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-minor-boys-apprehended-for-celebratory-firing/story-s88U5kCvIad9VsSpNIdyRP.html
26-09-2020||City||Plan to upgrade Ludhiana’s fire infra doused by admn neglect||Despite the administration’s claims to upgrade the city’s fire-fighting infrastructure, nothing concrete has been done in years.Due to this apathy, firefighters continue to endanger their lives. In the past, many have sustained injuries while nine had died while dousing the flames in 2017.Earlier in February, a city-level technical committee, a component of the smart city mission, had approved a project worth ₹25 crore to upgrade the fire brigade. Yet seven months later, the plan remains to be on paper only. Due to this, the ill-equipped firefighters are forced to brave the blazes without proper safety.When quizzed, the authorities said the project was still at the tendering stage and the new equipment would take some time to reach.As part of the infrastructure enhancement, the fire department is working to purchase hydraulic platform, water bowser, fire safety suits, life/heat detectors, advanced rescue tender, mini fire tender, multiple gas detectors, hydraulic combi tool, victim location camera with breaching system, quick response vehicle, inflatable lighting tower, portable fire pump and communication system at fire stations.Even as high-rise structures have mushroomed in the city over the years and factory fires take place frequently, the department has functioned without hydraulic ladders, an essential part of the fire-fighting equipment. On top of this, the firefighters have to cover their faces with wet cloth to avoid asphyxiation as they don’t have fire safety suits.“Every time we ask the authorities about the equipment, we are told that the department is working on the same and it would be provided soon. We do not even have fire safety suits to save ourselves. Apart from the equipment, the department also needs to conduct recruitment as the fire brigade is facing acute staff shortage,” said a firefighter.In October last year, a fireman had sustained injuries after the roof of a five-decade-old house collapsed due to a fire outbreak in the building near Neem Chowk in the old city area.Four firefighters had suffered burn injuries while dousing a fire in Vijay Nagar here in 2017, while nine had lost their lives on the job at a plastic factory that collapsed in November 2017. Total 16 people had died in the plastic unit blaze.Previously, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had made tall claims about upgrading the fire services, but to no avail.Municipal commissioner, Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The project to upgrade the fire brigade was part of the agenda tabled in the meeting of the city-level technical committee held last week. While tenders have been floated for procurement of new equipment, there are a few items for which we need approval from the state level committee. The fire brigade would be upgraded soon.”As many as 333 fire incidents were reported in 2019, 394 in 2018, 324 in 2017, 860 in 2016, 281 in 2015 and 580 in 2014. The maximum number of fires (1,098) was reported in the year 2010, as per the data available since 2004. This year, over 135 fire incidents have been reported in the city so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plan-to-upgrade-ludhiana-s-fire-infra-doused-by-admn-neglect/story-enfhTvD0c2zq9dlWRNe6SN.html

26-09-2020||Election:||Bihar elections: Recording studios are abuzz again, thanks to polls||Political parodies, audios and videos for the upcoming Bihar assembly polls may just be publicity material for parties and candidates but they’re a fresh lease of life for thousands of families in the engaged in these activities for decades. People involved in the sector had been struggling for a livelihood for the last six months since Covid-19 pandemic broke out and the lockdown rendered them jobless.This year, they remained idle in times of usual peak in business such as festivals of Holi, Chaiti Chhath and Shravani Mela because of lockdown and Covid-19 restrictions. Even the forthcoming festivals like Dussehra, Chhath and Diwali are expected to be equally dull as the pandemic continues.The announcement of assembly elections, however, have revived their hopes.Recording studios in Patna are abuzz again with Bollywood songs and popular Bhojpuri numbers which provide ready music to these artists to build on.Also read: ‘MSP not most preferred mode for farmers in Uttar Pradesh’ - NITI Aayog studyAmong the favourite numbers this year are “Vijayi Bhava” from Kangana Ranaut’s ‘Manikarnika’, “Bhar de jholi” from Bajrangi Bhaijaan and “Gali Gali Teri Lau Jali” from Baahubali. Parodies based on these songs are being composed and drafted while recording experts are testing the equipment at studios to keep them ready for the final albums.There are over 400 to 500 recording studios in the state, some of them even registered with the registration department of the state government. An estimated 5,000 families are dependent on these activities. The annual transaction of this sector is approximately Rs 7-10 crore.“Unfortunately, half the recording studios have been closed now due to the severe financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, most of these have been running in rented rooms and structures and the studio owners are now in no position to pay rent for the lockdown period,” Shahid Rafi, Patna-based poll parody writer and singer, said.These studios in Patna alone employ hundreds of people as lyricists, singers, composers, accompanists, recording technicians, editors and mixing experts.“Only recently, a folk singer in the city who used to earn high through stage shows of folk and film songs, called me up and requested to give her a chance of recording even in the chorus. This is the situation now,” Rafi said.Rajesh Kumar, who runs Pragati recording studio in Patna, said the elections have provided many much-needed relief in terms of work and payments.Also read: CM Mamata’s former confidante, Mukul Roy, made BJP vice president“Supporters of different political parties and potential candidates have started pouring in for publicity songs and tracks. But things will really look up for us when candidates are declared and file nominations and get symbols. But we have already started preparations,” Kumar stated.According to Rafi, songs like ‘Parda Hai Parda’ from film ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ and ‘Yeh Public Hai Yeh Sab Jaanti Hai’ from film ‘Roti’ have remained the all-time favourites but some new songs are also being preferred.“We keep the tracks ready and even lyrics are drafted. When the candidates get their symbols, we just fit words into this track and get it recorded,” he explained.“Lyrics are the same and only the name of candidates and their symbols change in the poll songs. For instance, there’s a song ‘Charcha Hai Charcha Mahagathbandhan Ka’ on ‘Parda Hai Parda’. Here, the name of any party or candidate can be fitted as per requirement. Similarly, there’s a song ‘Subah Uthkar Booth Per Jaana, Teer-Kamal Chhaap Per Button Dabaana’ based on ‘Bhar Dei Jholi’ from film ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’. Here also the name of the candidate and party can be changed accordingly,” said Rafi.“Things have started looking up, though very slowly. Work is there, but the payment is still a long distance away,” Medha Shree, a folk singer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-elections-2020-recording-studios-are-abuzz-again-thanks-to-polls/story-om66KuZzlV4HputL7cXq1H.html
26-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER doctor awarded Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize||Dr Ritesh Agarwal, a professor at the pulmonary medicine department of PGIMER, Chandigarh, has been awarded the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology in the medical sciences category for his significant contributions in the field of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).The award, instituted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in honour of its founder-director late Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar, is given each year for outstanding contributions in science and technology.Dr Agarwal is the first faculty from PGIMER to be honoured with this award. He has been systematically exploring this perplexing disease over the last 10 years, with over 90 publications describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management and several first-time descriptions to his credit. In the last five years, he has validated and proposed new criteria for the diagnosis and classification of ABPA, which are being used to diagnose the disease worldover. His most significant work is the treatment of ABPA. Before his research, there was no dosing protocol for oral glucocorticoids. His research showed that lower doses of oral steroids were sufficient in the treatment of ABPA. Moreover, two of his studies demonstrating the efficacy of antifungal drugs are practice-changing, as patients can now be spared of the serious adverse effects of glucocorticoids.Dr Agarwal has more than 500 publications in peer-reviewed national and international journals. He had also received the ICMR Kamal Satbir Award in 2009; the NASI-Scopus Young Scientist Award in 2011; and the ICMR Shakuntala Amir Chand Award in 2012, for his dedicated work in the field of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Commending Dr Agarwal’s distinct accomplishment, PGIMER director Jagat Ram said, “It is a matter of great pride, not only for the institute, but also for the region. This rare honour won by Dr Agarwal is hugely motivational and exemplary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-doctor-awarded-shanti-swarup-bhatnagar-prize/story-KZJrL2xgC3Ylq50jJqylEP.html

26-09-2020||Delhi||Three held for abducting man, beating him to death and dumping body in canal||Three men have been arrested on charges of abducting a 35-year-old man, beating him to death, and throwing his body in a canal in Haryana allegedly over ₹4,000 that he owed one his killers, police said Saturday.The arrested were identified as prime accused Valik Kumar alias Bhanu,31, Pintu Kumar,27, and Anil Kumar alias Annu,26. They were arrested by a crime branch team from Bawana area Friday, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj. “A Santro car that the three had used in the crime was also recovered,” the DCP said. The man, identified by his first name as Irshad, was missing since September 2 after he left his home in outer Delhi’s Narela with Bhanu, the prime accused. Police said on September 11, Irshad’s wife filed a missing person complaint at the Narela Industrial Area police station and alleged that he was last seen on September 2 with Bhanu. A kidnapping case was registered. During the probe, the police found out that Bhanu was helping the woman search for Irshad. They collected information about Bhanu and learnt that Irshad had to pay ₹4,000 to him for meat that was supplied to Irshad’s shop. “We suspected Bhanu’s involvement in Irshad’s disappearance, and investigators kept a watch on him through physical and electronic means. Once his role was confirmed, Bhanu was arrested and his interrogation led to the arrest of his two accomplices,” said a police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity. During the interrogation, the officer said, Bhanu told the police that he was into the business of supplying raw meat. and Irshad owed him ₹4,000. On September 2, Bhanu went to Irshad’s home in his Santro and picked him up saying that Irshad should work for him if he was not in the position to repay the amount. “Bhanu took Irshad to a poultry farm in Narela’s Block B where his two associates were already present. Bhanu started beating Irshad with sticks and also punched him. When Irshad fell unconscious, the trio abandoned him and left in the car. Irshad succumbed to injuries at the spot and the trio returned the same night, transported Irshad’s body in the car and threw it into a canal near Halalpur village in Haryana’s Sonepat district,” the officer said. Two days later, on September 4, Irshad’s body was fished out from the canal in Delhi’s KN Katju Marg area . The KN Katju Marg police registered a murder case and cremated the body after 72 hours as the dead man’s identity could not be ascertained. They, however, clicked photographs and preserved the clothes which eventually were shown to Irshad’s family members, who identified the body as that of Irshad’s, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-held-for-abducting-man-beating-him-to-death-and-dumping-body-in-canal/story-QgLBUbBuQukt87LdRAhtYP.html
26-09-2020||City||Focus on RWAs in fourth week of Delhi’s anti-dengue campaign||New Delhi: The fourth week of the Delhi government’s anti-dengue campaign will see the involvement of Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs), the chief minister’s office said on Saturday. The ‘10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute’ anti-dengue campaign was launched on September 6 with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inspecting his residence for stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. This was followed by all MLAs in the first week and then doctors and healthcare workers in the subsequent weeks. Last year, the RWAs played a huge role in this campaign. The Delhi CM had addressed all RWAs at Talkatora Stadium where he launched a five-point action plan for the RWAs to combat dengue. “This week, the key focus of the Delhi government would be on the participation of the RWAs. Last year, through the participation of the RWAs and other organisations, only 2,036 cases and two deaths happened as against 15867 cases and 60 deaths in 2015. The first edition of the anti-dengue campaign was launched in 2019,” the government said in a statement. A special helpline has been launched by the government for the general public if they require assistance with dengue. People can call on 011-22300012 and WhatsApp on 8595920530. During the third week of the anti-dengue campaign, CM Kejriwal had tweeted, “Delhi will defeat dengue again, and for this, today, on the third Sunday of the campaign at 10 am, I checked my house and replaced the stagnant clean water. You must also check your house every Sunday and ask your 10 friends/relatives to do the same. #10Hafte10Baje10Minute Har Ravivar Dengue Par Vaar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/focus-on-rwas-in-fourth-week-of-delhi-s-anti-dengue-campaign/story-QQRIGG45neeJ0iNkTUdNQO.html
26-09-2020||City||Inequitable distribution of colleges, lack of housing among other issues raised at DDA consultation||New Delhi: Lack of educational institutes and its inequitable distribution in the city was one of the primary concerns raised by the youth during a public consultation held by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for the preparation of the Master Plan of Delhi-2041. Nearly 450 people, aged between 18 and 30, participated in the ‘Youth Sabha’ organised by DDA and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been roped in to prepare the MPD-2041. A senior DDA official said a lot of people raised the problem of lack of educational institutes in several parts of the city due to which they have to travel long distances. “The lack of accessible education institutions for some city residents is of grave concern. For some of the youth, there are no colleges for up to 10 kms. This causes a lot of problems for them,” the official said. A young man from Najafgarh mentioned how the nearest college is 25 kms away, requiring a travel time of nearly an hour one way to traverse that distance. Others said most students staying in peripheral areas of Delhi end up travelling 25-40 kms one way to reach their schools/ colleges. “This is not only time consuming, but also unsafe for young women as they don’t always get to travel by appropriate means of commute. It is only recently that Delhi Metro’s grey line is operational, which helps them to commute to other parts of Delhi, but due to Covid-19 that too was stopped for several months. In short, accessibility to these education imparting institutions has become very cumbersome, pushing the youth to drop out well before completing their courses. Most of them then settle for open universities and working side by side to sustain their home/ family,” said the DDA official. Another issue pointed out by people was the problem of housing, especially for those who come from other states to Delhi for educational purposes. DDA is holding these consultations with various stakeholders to get an idea about what residents of the city want, which can be addressed in the next MPD-2041.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inequitable-distribution-of-colleges-lack-of-housing-among-other-issues-raised-at-dda-consultation/story-cmNojdTjQffoxncsyZwxsI.html
26-09-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Tricity artists need support||While the cry against nepotism in Bollywood has been loud and clear in the past few months, this week a group of artists came together to allege that parallels could be drawn in the tricity art scene too. The provocation is rooted in the dire straits that freelance artists, many of them with masters in fine arts degrees, find themselves in during the seven months of the Covid 19 pandemic. Most of them have been without work and are finding it difficult to support themselves and their families. What’s ironic is that some of them have gained recognition for their work and have even won awards. However, their careers as artists have not moved further because of alleged nepotism. Some preferred names, they say, continue to come up in workshops, camps or exhibitions. As an immediate measure, an appeal was issued on social media urging artists with government or private jobs to come to the aid of others of their ilk who were suffering. The response from a section of artists has been encouraging. While the cry against nepotism in Bollywood has been loud and clear in the past few months, this week a group of artists came together to allege that parallels could be drawn in the tricity art scene too. The provocation is rooted in the dire straits that freelance artists, many of them with masters in fine arts degrees, find themselves in during the seven months of the Covid 19 pandemic. Most of them have been without work and find it difficult to support themselves and their families. Their careers, some allege, are at a standstill because of nepotism. Some preferred names, they say, continue to come up in workshops, camps or exhibitions. The roots of the malaise go much deeper. Chandigarh has several art institutions and the Government College of Art has tutored some very talented artists, many earning fame at the national level. Today, it’s felt that art courses have to be updated to keep up with the modern times to prepare students for the competitive art market. They have to be promoted by their institutes, but often are not. Then, strong leaders can make a difference, but the Government College of Art has been without a principal. A bureaucrat is in charge and the UT home secretary does not require an arts degree. The Punjab and Haryana high court had stipulated that the principal should have teaching and administration skills.To change things, senior artists suggest that besides skilling youngsters in the arts, they should also be taught communication skills and marketing. Budding artists too must realise that this is a competitive field where talent wins. Only a handful make it to the top after a concerted struggle. Engaging in a job or business while pursuing their passion for art becomes necessary for survival.PAINT TAINTDoes nepotism exist in the tricity art scene?

26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Raising the levels of our consciousness||Where exactly are our thoughts focused the whole day long? While the answer obviously differs for each individual, scientists believe that each of us thinks about 50,000 to 70,000 thoughts per day. Which means that we virtually think up a distinct thought each second that we are awake.Of course most of these thoughts are repetitive in nature: about work or mundane things or to-do lists. Thoughts about material acquisitions, shopping, fashion, entertainment and leisure are in reality not as manifold as one might have thought. Relationships do occupy a large portion of our thought space, as do sundry other people. But a larger number of thoughts centre around worries and fears. Most of these are needless, worthless, tensions, as we all know.Much of our time is spent in thinking about scenarios which never actually occur. We either fantasise and dream about desirable states of being, or we tend to stress over what could go wrong. Unfortunately, as life passes by, the latter tendency begins to dominate over the former. Thus, we tend to fret and fume about aspects of life which really do not deserve so much fretting and fuming.Very few people are able to concentrate on the present moment. Mind wandering has become quite an ailment these days. Our consciousness does usually not focus on the present. It wanders off into the future or starts dwelling on the past. Even when we are occupied with a pressing task such as studying for an exam or working on a project, our consciousness becomes a philanderer. It gallivants all over the place and beyond all imaginable realms.Not being able to focus on one thing is also the result of our falling prey to the tentacles of social media. There is something rather automatic about the act of picking up one’s phone after every two minutes, to check upon this and that, almost, though not quite, akin to the act of blinking or breathing. We hardly have to think twice about doing so. It has become an involuntary, compulsive, global habit.But the really damaging trend is for human beings to habitually direct their attention towards the muck and filth which the mass media and its social cousins keep raking up. As mentioned in this column a fortnight ago, a section of the media has made it its avowed business to vitiate our minds, and we the gullible of the world have willingly allowed it do go ahead and penetrate our relative purity with its vitriol.Why is our consciousness often permeated with thoughts of scoffing, berating, belittling and destroying others? It is not only the media which disturbs our peace. It could be our own doing, aided and abetted by a family member or friend who constantly criticizes everybody under the sun. The company we keep is stronger than will power, said a saint. But even the company of our own selves, being despondent or negative can be extremely unsettling.Lao Tsu said: “The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness”. It is indeed a fact that our lives and our whole beings tend to catapult themselves into zones beyond the usual and hackneyed when we start thinking of the bigger picture of life. Compassion for others, empathy for the underprivileged, caring for the elderly, being of generally cheerful mien and adding to the happiness quotient of the world, are definitely ways of raising the levels of our existence.Paramahansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi, in his uplifting poem, The Noble New, puts it beautifully:Sing songs that none have sung,Think thoughts that ne’er in brain have rung,Walk in paths that none have trod,Weep tears as none have shed for God,Give peace to all to whom none other gave,Claim him your own who’s everywhere disclaimed.Love all with love that none have felt, and braveThe battle of life with strength unchained.Should we able to enhance the consciousness paradigms that we have been maintaining all our lives to a different league as the years roll by?

26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: For whom the closing bell tolls||As if recession and the Great Indian Deathly Depression was not enough, along came the Great Global September Stock Crash Riding Re-Lockdown.Even as this week’s bear run saw many a stock see the ‘Fall’ faster than the tonne of bricks tumbling in Kangana Ranaut’s office, surprisingly some things have seen their stock rising.Nah, one isn’t talking of the soaring stock of “Schitt’s Creek” and “Succession” post Pandemmy’s, but certain sundry or secret stock piling up courtesy Lockdown.The Sound of MusicIf you too belong to that breed of a Bard born or bestirred in the time of India Quarantining, you may have noticed how with every second person (candid confession: Yours Truly included) parking their poetry on Twitterverse, the global stock of unsung and unsolicited poets has risen for better or verse.Unsung poetry, because this Lockdown verse of Lollitas, Lamba jis & Co is the articulation of deeply embedded unrealised aspirations to poet-hood that could not be sung out, it in the solitariness of the bathroom or beyond.The curious case of ‘How Bard Can It Be’.My Big Fat Grease PuddingAnother thing which is seeing its stock rise rapidly is readymade food, Parottas to Pohas, under whose soaring stockpiles the poor Lockdown refrigerator has been labouring.Nowhere are this ‘Fatten the Curve’ narrative’s side-effects more visible than on the benches or bar stools of Unlock. When Lamba ji or Lally Ji park their pyjama-ed posteriors on the Condo’s concrete benches, they unmask their stock of cellulite accumulated from readymade Parottas dripping Amulite. Or out of their boxers on bar stools at McDonald’s or KFC oozes cellulite like extra cheese spilling out of a Subway sandwich.The curious case of ‘Who Moved My Grease!’For Your Eyes OnlyIf you’re seeing too many moustaches on the Zoom grids, it’s not as if mustachioed machismo is back to give fashion a ‘bear’ hug nor as if Hercule Poirot lookalikes leapt out of the grids to flaunt their groom on Zoom. Rather, it’s to do with the rising stock of forest cover of moustaches and bodily hair, as dense as Brahmaputra Tropical Forests, mushrooming on the follicular soil of not just Lockdown’s uncultivated males but also unwaxed female Zoomers.If, more than a full face, you find a budding Tropical forest peeping from a mustachioed mouth on a Zoom grid, it’s confusing whether it is a Lollita’s unwaxed upper lip or Lamba ji’s unkempt crop.The curious case of Pandemic’s ‘Pammi Aunty’ cross-dressing syndrome.Trading PlacesWith most kabaadi-wallahs migrating to villages – Malda to Muradabad – yet another thing which has had its stock piling is Lockdown’s ‘raddi’ (newspaper junk).If Lollita was wondering when there’s no kabaadi-wallah in sight, where in the world is the raddi stock vanishing, she needn’t look far. Loo and behold, all she needs is to look in the bathroom.The loo is the haven where Lockdown’s Lamba ji & Co pursue prolonged poring over pages – sports supplements to Page Three. It is while performing excretory functions that Lamba jis & Lally jis also perform discreet-ory functions – of casting the glad eye upon cleavages and calves of the Kareenas or Serenas, or the unmasked ‘assets’ of the Rheas. Upon sighting the stock of newsprint stashed away in the bath, Lollita’s inquisition of Lamba ji across the loo door proceeds thus:“Where on earth is that stock pile of raddi?”“It’s crashed?” Lamba ji blabbers from the innards of the loo, suffering selective hearing, immersed as he is partially in matutinal ablutions and partly in the newspaper’s stock update “What changed for the market while you were sleeping”. “Crashed?” Lollita gasps nonplussed like a Cat who when scouting for fish is told they’re to be found up a tree. “Where?”“Wall ...,” Lamba ji’s prattle is paused by pressing bowel action and the levitating lexicon is released post his abdominal release, “… Street!” “The stock pile crashed into the wall?” Lollita by now is beginning to sound as befuddled as a Cat who’s not only being misinformed the fish are up a tree, but also that the fish are swimming aloft in the air.“What did the kabaadi-wallah say about coming back?” Lollita persists.“T...,” by now Lamba ji has progressed from the Shapoorji Pallonji shares’ selloff to goggling at Page Three’s tinsel town tits. Aloud he only dares to deliver a staccato, “T … T ... Tata.”“Tata?” Lollita looks even more flummoxed. “The kabaadi-wallah said ‘Tata’??!!!”The curious case of certain stocks meeting their water loo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-for-whom-the-closing-bell-tolls/story-PFl7QC42HJRzvCjcQyptHM.html
26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Glides on moonbeams||Accomplished wildlife photographers will tell you that the pursuit of a rare, nocturnal species can be the proverbial cast of dice. Such adventurers set out to godforsaken spots at obscure hours, their hearts set on a digital hunt of a target species. They return with quite not an empty bag! It so happened with Rajive Das, a Chandigarh-based Defence Research and Development Organisation scientist, bird photographer and author of the book, Birds of Chandigarh & its Periphery. At 4 am, Das was travelling on the road to Narkanda to get a photo of the Tawny owl, which is believed not to exist outside Kashmir. But Das had earlier photographed a Tawny from the Narkanda forests and he was hoping to hear their calls and secure another photograph. It was not to be because the owls were silent that night. But he got something else, which foxed him. Two mammals were on a roadside cliff 20 km short of Narkanda (altitude 2,400 m). “I guessed they were flying squirrels but it was difficult to establish the precise species,” Das told this writer. Flying squirrels prove difficult to identify because they lead secretive and nocturnal lives, are inadequately researched and surveyed, and fewer photographs exist for comparison.To facilitate identification and put at ease a confounded Das, I sought the guidance of an assistant professor at the Amity Institute of Forestry & Wildlife, Dr. Murali Krishna Chatakonda. He is a distinguished field researcher who has conducted studies on flying squirrels in the north-east and Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP), Kullu. Chatakonda is the first to publish a PhD dissertation on the ecology and diversity of flying squirrels, thus shedding some light on the bypassed lives of Nature’s startling and wondrous manifestations. Unlike familiar garden squirrels, flying squirrels dwell beyond the pale of human imagination. Upon a considered examination of Das’s nighttime pictures, Chatakonda identified them as Kashmir Gliding squirrels (Eoglaucomys fimbriatus).India harbours an estimated 18 species of flying/gliding squirrels, of which two – Red Giant Gliding squirrel & Kashmir Gliding squirrel (KGS) – are found in the western Himalayas. Gliding is an evolutionary mechanism that allows squirrels to evade predators like civets and save energy by “long skipping” between trees rather than climb down and go up another tree. Gliding squirrels are largely nocturnal to avoid competition in foraging with daytime species.“These squirrels do not fly, which is basically achieved by birds who flap their wings for locomotion. These are more accurately squirrels that glide in the air. They have an extended skin flap between their fore and hind legs and another flap between hind legs and a long, flat tail. These skin flaps are like parachutes, the more the squirrel opens them, the greater the distance of glide achieved between trees. The tail lends stability and acts as a rudder to steer and change glide direction. When the squirrel has to glide between two trees, it judges wind speed and direction, elevation differential, height difference between trees. I have observed the KGS glide 10 to 15 m in the GHNP. Some species recorded glides of 180 to 200 m!” Chatakonda told this writer.“Researchers find it difficult to secure funds from government and non-government agencies to study squirrels because preference is to allocate funds for glamorous and popular species such as tigers/rhinos. Researching gliding squirrels in the field is a very tedious exercise as it has to be undertaken at night and by craning the neck towards the canopy (30-40 m) where squirrels dwell. Gliding squirrels are a prey base for raptors and act as seed dispersers as well as seed crushers. They eat fruits and the KGS is known to relish pine needles/seeds,” said Chatakonda. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-glides-on-moonbeams/story-rnHvy3BWBi88upLVopMddO.html
26-09-2020||City||Ban on political gatherings: No action taken against Haryana agri minister for campaigning in Baroda constituency||The Sonepat district administration has failed to take any action against Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal for violating a ban on political gatherings amid the Covid-19 pandemic as he continues to campaign in Baroda constituency of the district.On Saturday, the minister again violated the administrative orders by holding meetings in villages of the constituency. He announced establishment of an industrial model township (IMT), a rice mill, a university and ₹ 65 crore for development project works in the constituency till now. The dates for the Baroda bypolls are yet to be announced by the election commission. The seat has been vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda.Speaking at the event, Dalal said his government has announced many development projects for Baroda before the declaration of the poll dates. “We are committed to develop Baroda constituency and urge people to elect our nominee in this election,” he said.On Friday, the police had booked 90 sacked physical training instructors (PTIs) for allegedly obstructing work of the agriculture minister during his visit to Mundlana village in Baroda.The PTIs were booked after they had shown black flags to Dalal during his visit to a community health centre. The protesters said the minister had claimed that a group of 10 people had tried to stop his cavalcade. The police have, however, booked 90 people for obstructing his work during the visit.Congress Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhary also slammed the district administration and the state government for failing to implement the ban on political gatherings in Baroda. “The government had booked farmers for organising the Pipli rally due to Covid-19 whereas it has failed to register an FIR against its agriculture minister and other leaders, who have been flouting the safety norms amid the pandemic by organising village-level meetings and putting lives at risk,” she said.Sonepat deputy commissioner Shyam Lal Punia and Gohana sub-divisional magistrate Ashish Kumar, who was appointed the nodal officer to implement a ban, could not be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.The DC had announced a ban on political gatherings on Monday after Congress Rajya Sabha MP Deepinder Hooda was found infected with the virus. He had addressed poll rallies in various parts of the constituency. Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, agricultural minister JP Dalal, power and jails minister Ranjit Chautala, Gohana MLA Jagbir Malik and a few others politicians had also addressed village-level gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ban-on-political-gatherings-no-action-taken-against-haryana-agri-minister-for-campaigning-in-baroda-constituency/story-Wh4sSD1xqIgsNpLlEyYKtL.html
26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: How the cookie crumbles yet again in Covid times||The mind plays games all the time but the mind games that happened to the inhabitants of planet earth when a little virus believed to be resting quietly in the ugly little creature called a bat, somehow exploded in the open. Now this was not something the 21st century humans surrounded by gadgets were ready for. Of course, the people of this century loved gadgets more than anything else and in social gatherings one found people glued to their phones even as they sat together in a common parlour once in a while. Also, people had stopped visiting homes of friends, relatives and neighbours in the last quarter of the past century when the television found a place of pride in almost every home. Then came the home theatre and it all settled down to that little phone always in hand and always at one’s command.This is how a young man found himself in November 2019 traversing between heaven and hell: “Location: Celestial Parlour Place: Heaven Time: Immemorial HE is a very fine host with impeccable social etiquette. Both of us are enjoying a rich, full-bodied Chateau Mouton Rothschild, a delightful Bordeaux Red from the Garden of Paradise in the Medoc region of France, in a classy Baccarat Crystal Red Wine stemmed glassware. I tell you, this chap GOD, is a fellow of charming taste and enchanting pedigree. It was a chilled evening in November 2019, dusk was setting in after the sun had played its share of hide-n-seek”. This is how Pratip Majumdar’s story, The Cookie Crumbled Yet Again, began. However, there is no peace for him there as the phone, we will leave out the brand and its merger etcetera, keeps ringing.The caller is none other than Satan, made by God, and addressed in holy books with so many names as Lucifer Leviathan, Apollyon and Devil. Thus between Heaven and hell travels this telling story which is a part of a collection of tales of these times that we are living through, co-edited by city writer and academic Manju Jaidka and Nilak Datta: Covid Metamorphosis. It is indeed an engaging volume which has been lauded by critics as a brilliantly edited world of writing across continents, genres, economic strata as the writers explore the inner and outer worlds.The editors Jaidka and Datta, taking the cue from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, an 8 AD Latin narrative poem by the Roman poet Ovid, bring us the Covid Metamorphosis, capturing vignettes from human life as the world changes almost overnight. They say: “As the global pandemic surges and brings us to our knees, old enmities are forgotten and stale friendships are reforged as we struggle to cope with the changing world of work, life, and leisure. Such a scenario has inspired the present collection of stories.”Call me Rahman by Mahesh Sharma is indeed a gratifying story of a young man, Rohan, pursuing his English Honours in Hyderabad. He has to abruptly leave the city to go home and is trying to make sense of the strange new corona times and with his idiosyncratic young mind plays word games in his mind: “Covid, avoid… Covid, Ovid…; Corona, daro na..., maro na, karo na…” A Hindu Marwari, he is a little uncomfortable in the 3rd Class Sleeper with no reservation and so many Muslims around. He is hesitant to accept a woman’s offer for the top birth as her son Rahman could not come. Compelled by circumstance he takes the berth, only to be told by Fatima Bibi that her son could not travel as Corona snatched him away: And in his head words dance again: “Rahman… Mahmaan… Rohan… Rahman!” When the train reaches his destination, Rohan sees his friend waving out to him and calling him “Rohan…Rohan”! And Rohan replies, “Call me Rahman!” as he starts the game in his mind of associating words: “ Rahman… Insaan… Hindustan.” Enthusiastically he yells, “Main Rahman hoon, Main Insaan hoon, kyuki me bhi Hindustan hoon… Main Rahman hoon.”Jaidka herself pens a poignant story on the worst tragedies that we have witnessed in the exodus of the migrant labour on foot in the Lockdown times. Called How May Miles to Lakhimpur, the story weaves its way with the labourers walking home following the railway line. Little Asha walks exhausted with her parents Parvati and Shankar, holding her rag doll: “The rag doll, limp and sodden with grime and sweat, certainly seemed to give up the ghost. “She’s going to die,” repeated the three-year-old and the words fell on Shankar like the blow of a hammer. There was an ominous ring about them. “Don’t worry, beta, we’ll get you another pretty doll, better than this.” The next day we all saw a blurred picture of the rag doll and a few rotis scattered on the railway line in the newspapers!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-how-the-cookie-crumbles-yet-again-in-covid-times/story-N4dgzWlGyqnvp4diuQCAzI.html
26-09-2020||City||Cops used expired tear gas shells on protesters in Charkhi Dadri: Sacked PTIs||Sacked physical training instructors (PTIs) on Saturday alleged that the Haryana police had used expired tear gas shells to disperse some of them protesting against deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala in Charkhi Dadri district.Police have denied the allegations. However, the protesters had clicked photographs of the tear gas shells used on them on Friday. The police had also resorted to lathicharge and using water cannons to stop protesters from crossing the barricades outside the PWD rest house where the deputy CM was to attend a programme. The PTIs had taken out the protest march along with Khap representatives and other social activists. Sajjan Sanwar, the district president of sacked PTIs, said the police had used tear gas shells which had expired in September 2016. “Used expired tear gas shells are prohibited under the law. Many protesters had faced problems and three of our PTIs were discharged from the hospital on Saturday,” he added. However, superintendent of police Vinod Kumar said that the expired tear gas shells do not work and they were not used on the protesters. “We had used tear gas shells after some protesters tried to cross the barricade outside the PWD rest house. However, they were not expired shells,” he said. Earlier, the SP had said that they had used water cannons and lathicharge to disperse the protesters.Alleging that the government had taken away their employment due to the fault of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC), the physical training instructors (PTIs) have been demanding an Ordinance to reappoint them.The Supreme Court had set aside the recruitment of 1,983 PTIs, made in 2010 by the then Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government, after some irregularities were found in the recruitment process. On August 23 this year, the HSSC had conducted a fresh recruitment exam for about 7,500 candidates, who had applied against the vacancies in 2006. Most PTIs had boycotted the fresh exam that was conducted over a decade after the posts were first advertised.The agitating PTIs have been demanding that the government should not declare the result of the fresh recruitment exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-used-expired-tear-gas-shells-on-protesters-in-charkhi-dadri-sacked-ptis/story-wMrsnUXM8G5JSDXRVqu3XO.html
26-09-2020||City||Paddy procurement to commence in Haryana from Sept 27||The procurement of paddy will start from September 27 in Haryana, officials said on Sunday.The Centre has announced commencement of paddy procurement at the minimum support price (MSP) with immediate effect in Punjab and Haryana in the wake of early arrival of the kharif crop in these two states. Otherwise, paddy procurement for the 2020-21 kharif (summer) marketing season was scheduled to begin from October 1 in all the key growing states, it said.Additional chief secretary, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, PK Das, said the ‘PR-126’ variety of paddy has been harvested by farmers in four districts of Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Kaithal. Farmers of these districts have brought their crops to the mandis. “The procurement has been advanced and the government agencies will procure the paddy from the mandis of these four districts on September 27 and 28. From September 29, procurement will start in all mandis of the state and the schedule will be prepared as per the registration of farmers on Meri Fasal Mera Byora (MFMB) portal,” the ACS said.From this year, the ACS said, the farmers will have to register themselves on the Meri-Fasal Mera Byora portal. Arrangements have also been made for on the spot registration in the mandis. He said arrangements are being made with the rice-millers for procurement of paddy that has already arrived in the mandis of the four districts. The ACS said e-Kharid portal will also start from September 29 and scheduling for the same will also be done. A senior official said the state government has also made arrangements of direct payment to farmers. He said the farmers can choose if they want the payment through arhtiya or directly in their own account.The official said this year the government is expecting to procure 58 lakh Metric Tonnes paddy against 64 lakh MT last year, following a fall in the acreage under paddy. Of the total procurement, 40%, will be done by Hafed and food and supplies department of the Haryana government, 15% by Haryana state warehousing corporation and 5% directly by the food corporation of India. The government has also decided to make its own arrangements for the transportation of the procured paddy from the mandi to the rice mill to bring more transparency. “Earlier, the rice millers used to make transportation arrangements for procured paddy but from this year the government will transport the paddy from mandi to mill to bring transparency in the process,” the official said. He said decision was taken after complaints of fake procurement. Centre approves Price Support Scheme for MoongThe Centre has approved implementation of the Price Support Scheme (PSS) for procurement of about 5,825 MT of Moong in Haryana for this Kharif season. As per the approval the procurement period will be for 90 days which will start with effect from October 1.

26-09-2020||Delhi||World Tourism Day 2020: Delhiites, how about a picnic ’90s style?||Covid-19 has changed our lifestyle, and travelling preferences, too. Delhiites who used to visit hill stations on weekends, in pre-lockdown times, have turned to Dilli darshan, where they can opt for a picnic like old times. Many are visiting popular monuments, parks and other open places in Delhi, and discovering their new found love for them. On the eve of World Tourism Day (September 27) Delhiites share about their recently explored picnic spots in the city.“We can’t travel to places far away from home because of Covid-19. So, we decided to do go around the city. I went with my husband, son and mother-in-law to Humayun’s and Qutub Minar recently, over the weekend,” says Madhu Goyal, a resident of Shahdara. She adds, “These places are usually not much crowded and therefore it’s easy to maintain social distancing here. Plus it was fun to know our heritage. For hygiene concern we kept some chips and fruits, and avoided eating anything from outside. My son loved it, and is already asking where we will go next.” Many Delhiites have taken to visiting monuments, and this in turn is helping boost local tourism as well. Mani Maheshwari, a resident of Lakshmi Nagar, who whom the Capital holds a very special place in her heart, says it’s only now that she’s getting to explore it in a different light. “I’ve been living here for the past 10 years and Delhi is very close to my heart. This city has given me a good career and amazing friends, and I love its beauty and serenity. But never thought that instead of heading to Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand for a weekend outing I would be visiting the monuments, gardens and other popular places here,” says Maheshwari, adding, “I got so used to travelling to hill stations that I even started celebrating birthdays over there. This year, since #WFH due to coronavirus has made us hell bored, we decided to spend some time at Qutub Minar. And when we extended the visit to the dargah in Mehrauli, it was such as beautiful experience. It’s architecture is amazing. It’s a shame that I never of visiting it before! It was a nice picnic.”And when talking about picnics in Delhi, how can the one and only India Gate be missed! Sanjana Tikku, a college student and resident of Kamla Nagar, says, “We made a list of things to keep in bag, and shared it on our family WhatsApp group. When venturing out, it’s important to not forget to take precautions. We even took some games along, and it was such a fun-filled time. My dad loved it, and got reminded of his college days when he used to visit the tombs with his friends to study in peace; he found this as an opportunity to relive old memories. We spent some time at India Gate and then went to Jantar Mantar as well... watta evening!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/world-tourism-day-2020-delhiites-how-about-a-picnic-90s-style/story-5WRgFFlE2wXKtdp72cDv8M.html

26-09-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Grand Alliance’s seat-sharing deal in final stages; RJD decides to contest 150||With the announcement of the three-phase assembly polls in Bihar, the Grand Alliance (GA) - comprising RJD, Congress, Left parties and smaller allies - is now inching closer to finalising a seat-sharing deal with talks now veering on seat-to-seat adjustment among the partners.A formal announcement is likely to be made in the next few days before the nomination process for the first phase of polls begins on October 1. Sources said the RJD leadership is holding talks with the allies including Congress and has broadly reached a consensus on contesting 150 seats alone. The party has decided to offer 60 seats to the Congress.This means, together, the RJD-Congress would contest 210 seats. The RJD is keen to allot around 20-25 seats to Left parties comprising the CPI-ML(liberation), CPI and CPM while the Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP), led by Mukesh Sahni, would be allotted eight to ten seats. Insiders in the GA said the ML, which had threatened of not siding with the GA for being offered only seven seats, is expected to get 12-15 seats while the CPI and the CPM may have to be contented with five seats each.Also read: High stakes for Grand Alliance in Bihar, win could have national implications“The seat-sharing arrangement is almost final. There are certain hitches on a few seats among allies. It will be worked out soon and a formal announcement would be made in the next few days,” said a senior RJD leader. The new formula has been worked out after the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party(RLSP) led by former union minister Upendra Kushwaha indicated of leaving the coalition, a source said.However, top sources in state Congress said a decision on the seat-sharing arrangement with the RJD would be finalised by the party’s high command after the three-member screening committee for Bihar polls, led by AICC general secretary Avinash Pande who came on a two-day visit to the state on Saturday, submits its report on eligible candidates for all 243 seats to Bihar-in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil in the next few days. Pande is also chairman of the Congress screening committee for Bihar polls.“Once the screening committee submits its report, on eligible candidates after holding discussions with state leaders, to the Congress top leadership, a final decision on seat-sharing would be taken by party president Sonia Gandhi,” said a senior Congress leader, wishing not to be quoted.There are reports that leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is likely to hold talks with senior Congress leaders in New Delhi in next few days for wrapping up the seat-sharing deal. However, there is still a question mark on whether the Congress would settle for 60 seats or insist on more seats as the senior party leaders have been insistent on contesting at least 70-80 seats in alliance with the RJD in the coming polls. In the 2015 assembly polls, the Congress had contested 41 seats of which it won 27.Sources in the Congress also said the party is keen on increasing its representation in 17 districts where the grand old party had not fought in the 2015 assembly polls and is negotiating hard with the RJD to get more winnable seats, especially in West Champaran, Darbhanga, Madhubani and Patna.There are reports that the RJD has offered certain seats to the Congress where the party has a negligible base like Sheohar, Chanpatia and Bagaha (West Champaran), Belsand in Sitamarhi, Kalyanpur in Samastipur and four seats in Patna district namely Kumhrar, Digha, Bankipore and Patna Saheb.” All these seats are constituencies where the RJD lost in the last several elections and is offering them to the Congress. This will not be acceptable. We want seats where chances of winning are high,” said a senior Congress leader, wishing not to be quoted.However, state RJD president Jagdanand Singh exuded confidence that the seat-sharing arrangement in the GA would be formalised soon. “ There is no problem in the seat-sharing arrangement in the GA and things are moving in the right direction,” he said. Singh also claimed that the GA was all set to put up a united front in the coming polls against the BJP-JD(U). He wondered why was there so much of delay in the seat-sharing deal in the NDA.“Talks are progressing positively,” said Harku Jha, state Congress spokesperson when reached for comments on hitches in the seat-sharing deal between the RJD and the Congress.Meanwhile, the left parties, especially the ML, the CPI and the CPM, claimed the talks were still on with the RJD on seat adjustment, insisting they were hopeful of getting a respectable share of seats.“There is a forward movement in seat talks,” said ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya. He did not comment on whether his party had been offered 12-15 seats in the latest round of talks.CPM’s state secretary Awadesh Singh said things would be clear in next few days. “Our aim is to defeat the NDA. We want the RJD to respect our party’s base in terms of seat allotment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-grand-alliance-s-seat-sharing-deal-in-final-stages-rjd-decides-to-contest-150/story-210VSAP0mVCtsGOPbbmXJN.html

26-09-2020||City||Faridkot hospital staff took 3 hours to start treatment of Abohar professor, finds inquiry||Faridkot A probe into the death of an Abohar associate professor, Parwinder Singh Kamboj, 46, at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH) in Faridkot on July 23 has found that medical staff were negligent and there was a delay of three hours in starting treatment. Kamboj had been admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital as a suspected covid-19 patient, but his samples tested negative a day after death. His wife Neeta Pandhu Kamboj had alleged negligence.Faridkot regional transport authority (RTA) secretary Paramdeep Singh Khaira conducted the investigation and has submitted an 84-page report to deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia. “It has been found that despite Abohar civil hospital doctors referring Kamboj when his blood oxygen saturation was 88%, which is considered low, he was not put on oxygen support. Medical staff on duty wasted three hours, demanding the patient’s file and a covid test report. They also misbehaved with family members,” the report says.It adds, “If immediate treatment would have been given to Kamboj, after making the file under emergency file management, the outcome could have been different. The patient was not handled properly in the emergency. CCTV footage shows Kamboj reaching the hospital at 5.52pm, but the first entry of the treatment has been recorded at 8.45pm in his file. This shows how poor the GGSMCH was handling the patient.”He added that there is shortage of staff and medicines at GGSMCH, which has been confirmed by statements of medical staff. “Another 45-year-old covid patient was killed after falling into a shaft meant for drainage and water pipes in a new building of the hospital. Authorities should have done a proper safety survey. The incident shows that there is shortage of ward attendants as well, as the patient went to bathroom on his own,” he added. ‘Cleanliness not maintained’“Cleanliness has not been maintained. Even the light in the room in which Kamboj was kept was not working. The medical staff has admitted to this. The lack of cleanliness in covid-19 wards and poor arrangement for biomedical waste disposal shows irresponsible GGSMCH authorities have been,” Khaira adds. Khaira also noted that the GGMCH’s then medical superintendent Dr Rajiv Joshi and then principal Dr Deepak John Bhatti neglected their duties. However, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), under whose command the hospital operates, shunted them out last month.In the report, Khaira recommends that junior doctors, assigned duties in covid wards, should take psychiatric training to improve their behaviour towards patients and their families. “Serious patients should be provided immediate treatment without demanding any file and a special cell for covid should be formed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridkot-hospital-staff-took-3-hours-to-start-treatment-of-abohar-professor-finds-inquiry/story-G3lhFvlVzCW2B0bfW1G71N.html

In Punjab, the other centres have been set up at Amritsar, Mohali, Patiala, Jalandhar and Bathinda. Clearing this exam is a pre-requisite for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology across the country. At the centre in Ludhiana, authorities have put in place several measures to ensure the safety of students amid the pandemic. For starters, the authorities will not be putting up the seating plan on the notice board. This information will be given to students when they get their admit cards scanned before entry. The move has been taken to avoid any sort of crowding. Besides, authorities have already sent details, such as the time when students are expected to reach the centre, through an SMS in advance. In view of the pandemic, authorities have also done away with biometric verification of candidates. Students will undergo thermal scanning at the entrance. If the body temperature is above normal (37.5 °C/99.4 F) or if the candidate displays any Covid-19 symptom, he or she will be seated in an isolation room to take the paper. The exam will be held in two slots—Paper 1 will be from 9am to 12noon while Paper 2 will be from 2.30pm to 5.30pm. Before, the second shift begins, the computers, mouse, desk, chair, keyboard will be sanitised.

The vocal legend, who died of a cardio-respiratory arrest on September 25 at 1.04pm in Chennai, was positive for Covid-19. He was awarded the prestigious the SD Burman International Award for Creative Music and Sound at the Pune film festival. Aditi Akkalkotkar, deputy director, coordination and communication, PIFF, recalls her interaction with the music director, actor, dubbing artist and film producer, who worked in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Hindi, and Malayalam films. “I have the sweetest memory of SP Balasubrahmanyam during 16th PIFF 2018. I was awestruck meeting him in person, but he was one of the most down-to-earth persons. I told him of me being his biggest fan and he surprised me by singing lines from the songs ‘Pushpanjali ‘ and ‘ Saathiya Tune Kya Kiya’. I shall always remember his soulful voice,” Akkalkotkar said. Pune -based music composer and playback singer, Harsshit Abhiraj, collaborated with SPB on his first Marathi album ‘Nishigandha’ in 2009. “We worked on this project for a radio channel in Marathi for which I had composed the music for Dr Balu for his first Marathi album. It was a learning experience, for he is an institution in himself. Producer and director Shantivan Todkar introduced us and all the songs were written by Ilahi Jamadar, the ghazal lyricist. This album was of Marathi bhavgeet in the ghazal format. Dr Balu’s manner with new people was very gentle and kind and he included us as part of his large family. He was also well-read and knew a great deal about Marathi literature. His favourite was GD Madgulkar and Sant Tukaram,” said Harsshit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/spb-s-humility-and-kindness-are-after-tones-that-will-live-forever-in-pune/story-KpxFcqqNods4LK3epPIibP.html

SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “On Thursday, the SPPU’s management council meeting was held, and I tabled a proposal to start an independent centre for research and study of the Maratha kingdom at SPPU. This proposal was supported and sanctioned by all the management council members. Accordingly, financial aid has also been given to start this centre.” According to Karmalkar, there is a need for an extensive study about the Maratha kingdom, the kings who ruled Maharashtra and all other aspects of the kingdom. “There are thousands of documents in ‘Modi lipi’ which are still untouched and not yet read. So, to study and research in-depth about Maratha kingdom this centre has now been started by SPPU,” added Karmalkar. Talking about starting this new centre, city-based senior historian Pandurang Balkawade who is also a selected member on SPPU’s academic council, said, “If we look at the history for more than 200 years, the Maratha kings after Shivaji Maharaj have ruled. There are five crore Modi lipi documents available about this glorious history of Marathas. And so, starting such a centre for its study and research is an important step. I hope that other universities in the state will also start such a centre as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-to-begin-maratha-kingdom-study-and-research-centre-in-pune/story-8MSrEw3CH4EqcLJmZoSYIJ.html

So, the test was conducted later in the day,” said Harshad Bansod, a student.“There was a lot of crowd at the department and it took more than three hours to complete the process. This new system of giving time slots to applicants cannot work as there can be an emergency during this pandemic situation. The RTO should give an appointment and fix a date and allow applicants to come and give the test anytime during the day,” he said.“This decision was taken in good intention but doesn’t seem to be working as the crowd has increased rather than reducing. Especially after lunchtime there is more crowd as people from the day’s first slot also come in the afternoon to give the test,” claimed Satosh Harale, RTO activist.“This slot wise timing system should be cancelled and regular tests should be conducted by maintaining proper social distancing,” he said.Ajit Shinde, officer, Pune regional transport, said, “The reason why we started the learning licence test from 7.30 am was to control the crowd, as after the lockdown there was a lot of rush at the RTO.From today (Thursday) onward, we have started separate waiting area for applicants to sit in after appearing for the test. The licence will be issued in another room. By doing so we will be able to check that people follow all the Covid-19 safety norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/applicants-fail-to-reach-on-time-for-licence-tests-crowd-at-pune-rto-later/story-Fe0nMtB1CdFgMUQJbN48GI.html

The circular lays down the entire examination schedule for colleges, Rodrigues said.Rodrigues submitted the circular was not applicable to final year examinations. Besides, this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the examinations are being held online and will have only multiple-choice questions.He pointed out regular examinations for the last-year students are scheduled from October 1. The examinations for backlog subjects have started from Friday.The petitioners’ lawyer, advocate Sharon Patole, insisted the university should give proper time to the students to prepare. She said this year, not just the mode, but also the format of the examination has changed and even professors have not been given adequate time to prepare question papers.“Future of the students is at stake; they need time to prepare.”The court refused any relief pointing out that in academic matters, the scope of judicial interference is narrow. “Withdraw the petition and make a representation to the vice-chancellor,” the court said. “If you insist decision on merit that will damage your cause.”Patole agreed to make the representation.

The plea is to release a bungalow located in the city in the minor’s name that has been seized in a case registered against DSK, over accusations of duping thousands of investors and home buyers. The house is part of the immovable assets attached by the enforcement directorate (ED) of the central government, as well as by the Maharashtra police. The ED has attached assets of DSK and his related companies, worth Rs 904 crore. According to defence lawyers Pratik Rajopadhye and Ashish Patankar, representing the arrested realtor’s son Shirish Kulkarni, who is also lodged in Yerawada central jail, the bungalow in question is a property that is spread across 2,000 square feet on SB road in Pune. “The property was gifted to the minor boy in 2016, one year before the offence was registered. The land was purchased in 1996, whereas the year of the offence registered is 2017,” said advocate Rajopadhye. “The minor applicant may kindly be permitted to occupy, possess and stay in the said residential bungalow,” reads the application. “This is all a fraudulent transaction. A similar application was made in the past (before lockdown). We have already made an application challenging the plea,” said Shivaji Pawar, assistant commissioner of police, who is investigating the case. The minor boy is currently in the care of his mother. Last month, DSK’s daughter passed away due to Covid-19 and he was granted a 13-day bail to attend the last rites. DSK and his wife were arrested from a hotel in Delhi in February 2018 by the Pune police. Subsequently, his son and employees of various DSK Developers Limited (DSKDL) and related companies were arrested in the case registered at Shivajinagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/plea-to-release-dsk-s-grandson-s-bungalow-moved-in-mpid-court/story-YY5F1p7vlALOtj3hhzNIjL.html

26-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 Unlock: #WFH is now #WFP ie Work From Pub||Bored with #WFH? Fret not, as pubs and bars in Delhi-NCR are offering #WorkFromPub where you can enjoy beers, offers on food, and chill even while you’re working. “Actually one of the guests asked us if he could bring his laptop because he’s just bored at home from the past six months, wants a nice music in the background, and wanted to work here. I said, ‘Why not?’ He was there from 1pm till 10pm, wherein he worked till 7pm, and even watched an IPL match with us. He was so happy after it, and brought more friends along the next day. They work on different tables, and in between work order a mug of beer, and food as well,” says Sandeep Pundir, general manager, Manhattan Bar & Brewery, Gurugram. “We provide guests, who want to work here, with a meal plus beverage deal at a very nominal price during their work hours. Also, to ensure social distancing, we give them separate tables, at a distance. They can bring their laptops and we have a provision of high speed Wi-Fi. They can work for as long as they want to,” says Sahil Sambhi from Molecule. Taking it one step further is restauranteur Priyank Sukhija shares that Dragonfly Experience, Aerocity, Delhi is all set to have special pods. “It’ll have tables which are fully enclosed in a pod. You just go inside and you’re surrounded on all four sides. This one is actually your own cubicle. Each pod can hold about eight to 12 people,” he says.And there are offers, too, to enjoy drinks along work. Priyanshi Dhir, owner, Pablo in Gurugram, says, “We are giving away a one plus one offer on our super delicious coffees from 1pm to 5pm everyday to make sure that you get your daily dose of caffein, just the way you like it. You know what’s the best part? We are also giving y’all free Wi-Fi. So, pack your laptops, put on your masks and get that much needed break with us!” Some like Aman Puri, food director at Duty Free-Vayu Bar in Gurugram, wants corporates to get a change in “vibe” when they visit the place, and have launched a co-working concept for the same. Puri explains, “It’s been six months that people have been locked in their houses and are working from home. So, to break the monotony and bring back some fun along with the usual work, we have launched a co-working concept called ‘Duty Se Free’ wherein we are inviting professionals to come and work from our restaurants for change of scene and vibe. Low music levels, free WiFi, on-the-house stationery, facility to print or xerox, and to top it all, a flat 20% discount (on food) are a few things that we are providing to help professionals cope up with this new normal.”Needless to say, corporates are going gaga over this new trend in town. Shiva Sai, who works for an MNC, is one such who is loving the idea of #WorkFromPub. He recently started working out of a pub, and says, “Lockdown has taken a toll on our mindset; and I wanted a change. These pubs and bars that are offering such deals are decently quiet, play mild music and spacious as well. From the hygiene perspective they are well maintained in all aspects, and have sanitisation at the door, counter, and on demand! I have started taking my laptop and go to one of the bars near my house at around 1.30pm every oterh day, and I get to work peacefully, quietly. And, if I need anything to eat, I have plenty of options to munch on. This way you get a change and see people around you, coming or going, and that rejuvenates you. It has helped me in Covid times. My friends have joined me once or twice, but yes, it will take time for people to change their mindset and be convinced about the hygiene when visiting any such place.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-unlock-wfh-is-now-wfp-ie-work-from-pub/story-9wNOGobCVPYBgO42RqiZAM.html
26-09-2020||City||HC stays elections to state handball association||Jalandhar The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday stayed the elections of Punjab Handball Association scheduled for September 29. Seven district handball associations, including Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur, Rupnagar, Mohali and Amritsar had filed the petition for this through their counsel, Rehmat Grewal. The bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill has fixed the next hearing on November 19.The petitioners told the court that Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu and Amanbir Singh Sidhu, the present president and general secretary of the state handball association, respectively, had unilaterally announced these elections without taking the Punjab sports department and them into confidence.A former IAS officer, Sidhu is son-in-law of Akali veteran and Rajya Sabha MP, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa; Amanbir is a close relative of former state finance minister and MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa. Parminder is son of Sukhdev.The petitioners added that both the state sports department and the Punjab Olympics Association refused to send observers for these elections, in view of the covid-19 pandemic.The petitioners had claimed that scheduling the election on September 29 was arbitrary, illegal, perverse and unconstitutional as on the current voter list, there were many members whose mobile numbers were either incorrect or they had given their defunct landline number. Members could not be informed on time, they added.It was also pleaded there was no hurry for holding elections as the present executive committee elected by the petitioners and others was already performing. The office-bearers are elected for four years.“To the knowledge of petitioners, some members of the association, as well as the department of sports, Punjab, have requested the chief minister to postpone the elections,” says the petition, also making the claim that holding elections, at this stage, would breed nepotism as no effective and transparent mechanism was in place.“When the state sports department and the state olympic association refused to send an observer to conduct elections amid a pandemic, why are the president and the general secretary, hell-bent to conduct these? This raises doubt on the election framework,” added the petitioners.Ludhiana Handball Association secretary Teja Singh Dhaliwal, who is one of the petitioners, said there was no democracy left in the association, which had also resulted in lowering of the state’s performance on the field. “The president and secretary, however, want to continue their monopoly and thus scheduled the elections in these times,” claimed Dhaliwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-stays-elections-to-state-handball-association/story-bHtKnf0MMMIvbwflSYSLLO.html

The railways had already cancelled trains across Punjab from September 24 to 26 after farmers announced their three-day blockade plans. Now that the farmers have extended their rail roko agitation till September 29, the railways will reschedule services. Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee district president Salwinder Singh said that rail tracks have been blocked in Jalandhar cantonment, Tanda and Kartarpur. Women were present in large numbers at the Tanda protest on the Jammu-Pathankot-Jalandhar rail track. Ferozepur divisional railway manager (DRM) Rajesh Agarwal said a decision on resuming train operations will be taken on Saturday evening. “The farmers’ protest is ongoing so it is not possible to assess the loss yet. We will decide on services after assessing the situation later today,” he said. FARMERS DIG IN THEIR HEELS IN AMRITSAR Farmers continued their protest on rail tracks in Amritsar district with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher announcing the extension of the agitation. Pandher, who is leading the farmers on the rail track at Devidas Pura village near Amritsar to block the key Amritsar-Delhi railway route since September 24, similar protests are being held at seven places in Punjab, including Tarn Taran and Fazilka. The agitating farmers, who have been spending nights on the tracks, are being supplied food by villagers. Women participate in the agitation during the day. Criticising the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leadership, Pandher said the SAD leaders did not raise any slogan against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their chakka jam (road blockade) on Friday, showing they still backed the BJP-led government at the Centre. “They are still part of the alliance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-rail-roko-agitation-spreads-to-jalandhar-tanda-in-punjab-s-doaba-region/story-mTheu9mc5X1jkxY3o0zj2J.html

Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said Delhi consumes 930 million gallons (MGD) of water every day, which translates into a consumption of 176 litre per person per day. “This is not a lot, but it is not less either. At present, there is no accountability of this 930 MGD water in the city. A lot of it either gets stolen or is wasted through leakages. We are appointing a consultant who would recommend us steps to not just ensure not a single litre of water is wasted, but it would also suggest us the latest technology available across the globe to put in place a hi-tech, automated and real-time water management system,” he said.Kejriwal also addressed the concerns raised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which alleged that the decision of the Delhi government is a step towards privatising the DJB. The DJB is a state-run organisation in Delhi. Also Read: Delhi court directs Delhi Police to file FIR over morphed video of CM KejriwalHe also said the Delhi government is in talks with “water-rich” states such as Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand to explore the possibility of water-sharing pacts.

Under this policy, the city will be divided into 7-8 zones and a private operator will be appointed to look into the works in each zone.The decision was taken in a board meeting presided over by Delhi water minister and DJB chairman Satyendar Jain.“After extensive discussions and deliberations at various levels to improve the services and bring efficient management in the water supply and sewerage system, it was decided to award the contracts to private operators for operation, maintenance and management of water supply and sewerage networks in various zones of Delhi on the lines of ‘One Zone-One Operator’,” said a statement issued by the DJB on Thursday. “The operators will be appointed for a period of 10 years under the scheme on a contract basis,” it said.Also Read: Delhi govt extends free meal plan till end of wintersAnkit Srivastava, DJB technical advisor, explained that the services are not being privatised and no layoffs will be done within the water utility.

26-09-2020||Bhopal||Farmer attempts to kill himself in Harda, district administration calls him fraudster||Authorities on Friday called a 35-year-old farmer a fraudster and said he was a part of a procurement scam busted in June a day after he attempted suicide in Madhya Pradesh’s Harda district for alleged delay in payment for his gram crop produce.The attempt came as farmers have been protesting across several states against farm reform laws passed in Parliament this week. The farmers are particularly angry over the absence of any mention of a minimum support price in the laws. The opposition Congress has thrown its weight behind the protests against the 35-year-old farmer’s alleged harassment ahead of the crucial by-polls to 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh. The by-polls are crucial to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government survival in the state as it enjoys a wafer-thin majority in the 230-member state assembly. The BJP needs to win nine out of the 28 seats. It currently has 107 seats. The Congress, which lost power in March when its 21 lawmakers resigned and paved the way for BJP’s return to power, has 88 members in the House with an effective strength of 202.Also Read: Farm bills anger spills onto highways, railwaysAdditional police superintendent Gajendra Singh said the farmer allegedly consumed poison outside a co-operative society in Harda on Thursday over the delay in payment for his 141-quintal gram produce a few months ago.The farmer allegedly attempted suicide while a group of farmers was staging a protest in front of the society over delay in payment to them. During the protest, two other farmers also fainted, said police.All three were rushed to a district hospital and later referred to Bhopal.Harda collector Sanjay Gupta cited a cooperative department inquiry in June and said discrepancies were detected in stock and records of bills of purchase related to the society. “More than 5,100 quintals gram crop was found missing from the stock. In a further inquiry, it was found that fraudulently the manager of the society cleared fake bills of 71 farmers, who had not sold any crop to the society. ...[the three farmers] are among them.”He added a fraud case was registered against the manager, who cleared the bills. “I asked the police on Tuesday to book the villagers, who were part of the fraud,” said Gupta. He added revenue department officials also cross-checked the claim of the 35-year-old and found that 141 quintal grams could not have been produced from the piece of land he owns.State agriculture minister Kamal Patel, who is from Harda, has ordered an inquiry into the alleged scam. “To check the claims of farmers, the agriculture department will conduct a separate inquiry.”Congress leader PC Sharma met the farmers at a hospital in Bhopal and accused the BJP government of being unjust to the farmers. “Congress will join the protest of farmers in Harda as BJP-led state government is doing injustice to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/farmer-attempts-to-kill-himself-in-harda-district-administration-calls-him-fraudster/story-2rxjOKFtGhCmwd9NWzy4CM.html

26-09-2020||Environment||Aarey: Final proposal allocates 329 ha forest soon to be part of SGNP||An area twice the size of what was excluded (165 hectare) from Aarey forest within the protected buffer zone of Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in December 2016 will soon be part of the park. A final proposal for reserved forest declaration has been vetted and submitted to the Maharashtra government for the allocation of 328.9 hectare (ha) within Aarey as a reserved forest under the Indian Forest Act. “The process to declare it is underway and should be completed over the next 15 days,” said Milind Mhaiskar, principal secretary (forests).HT has seen an unsigned draft of the final proposal along with a map of the proposed green zone. The reserved forest area encompasses 107 land parcels from Aarey (111.3 ha), Goregaon (71.6 ha), Maroshi (146 ha including area allotted originally for) villages under Andheri and Borivali talukas in Mumbai suburbs.“The idea is first to declare everything that has ecosystem characteristics [biodiversity, tree cover etc] of a forest as reserved forest area,” said Aaditya Thackeray, the state environment minister. “Based on our on-ground survey undertaken two weeks ago, we included green zones having open areas and forest-like cover while leaving out roads, built-up structures, and lands given to state agencies such as the animal husbandry department...”Also Read: MTDC to hand over 500-acre mangrove area in Manori-Gorai to Maharashtra forest departmentFollowing the declaration, a settlement officer would survey the area followed by suggestions and objections pertaining to land rights. Finally, the state would notify the forest.Thackeray said based on public hearings and ensuring rights of Aarey’s local residents are intact, the final area would be plus-minus 20 ha if at all any land rights issues arise.An area of 40.46 ha previously slotted for the zoo will be declared reserved forest first, said Mhaiskar. “To ensure continuity, the overall notification will be issued together. Subsequently, the land will be handed over to SGNP making it a part of the national park.”The total expanse of SGNP would be increased by 3.5 sq km from the existing 103 sq km, said G Mallikarjuna, the park’s conservator. “The move will enhance protection of leopards dispersing from SGNP to Aarey,” he said. Aarey has about six to seven leopards.The Centre in December 2016 excluded 165 ha of 1,287 ha of Aarey from SGNP’s eco-sensitive zone to allow construction, including a Metro car shed following a state government proposal.Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, an NGO, welcomed the state government’s latest move as superb and added it will remove 165 ha from needless destruction. “We await phase two of this protection where the entire Aarey will be preserved for future generations.”Of the 165 ha, projects slotted across 161.6 ha include Metro Bhawan, a zoological park, an encroachment rehabilitation project, a regional transport office among others.With the proposed declaration, only metro related and allied projects would remain along the peripheral areas of the green lung. “Our original proposal was for over 600 acres [242 ha],” said Mhaiskar. He added the additional 81 ha came from the area slotted for the zoo which was not needed. “A zoo is already in Byculla and cannot be established inside a reserved forest. Secondly, we found that the 90-ha area allotted for an encroachment rehabilitation project had rich biodiversity and it was not feasible to shift people there. Thus, almost 200 acres were freed up.”Mhaiskar clarified the area for the encroachment rehabilitation project was shifted towards the periphery of the green lung. “All other infrastructures or projects are outside the proposed reserved forest.’Thackeray said recognising Aarey as a forest was reclamation in a better way. “Mumbai is probably the only city in the world where we have such an area thriving with flora and fauna actively. Some lesser species are endemic. It is not just about passion, but duty and commitment to ensure that we do everything we can to protect such natural heritage we have been blessed with,” he said.Also Read: Q&A: The great green hopes of the new head of the Bombay Natural History SocietyHe thanked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for his commitment, and also dairy development minister Sunil Kedar for taking the lead in protecting Aarey.Tauseef Patel, a resident of Aarey’s Unit-9, said they have been asked to give up their home, where they have been staying for over four generations since the 1950s, and relocate to another in the same unit. “The land is being taken over for the Metro Bhawan construction,” said Patel, a dairy farmer.Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) officials confirmed they would soon commence constructions including of the 32-storey Metro Bhawan across 28.17 acres in Aarey. “We are awaiting the final environment clearance from the Centre following which construction will commence,” said BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA. “The rehabilitation for occupants is being done after an agreement with the Aarey dairy department and MMRDA will bear the construction cost of their new structures as per the agreement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/aarey-final-proposal-allocates-329-ha-forest-soon-to-be-part-of-sgnp/story-lErpezJzOJxHlwCIBZSYqN.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A poem without words||One way to experience a beautiful poem is to find it in some book. Another way is to encounter it in a tangible material form in this three dimensional world. Then, without the medium of words, this is just you and the poem.One place to be enriched by such an experience lies right here in Delhi. The poem is a half-sunken peddle boat in Hauz Khas lake, tucked between Safdarjung Enclave and Hauz Khas Village.The boat has been lying in this position for years. This evening the water is looking dark green, perhaps reflecting the densely leaved trees surrounding the lake. The white boat is lying tilted, the front portion tipped upwards, while the rear end is within the water—as if the great Titanic was just beginning to drown, but noiselessly. The middle portion is missing with the two ends joined by a pair of rusting railing. Nearby, a semi-ravaged tree, half leafy, half bare, is leaning over from the banks of the lake, parts of its branches almost touching the surface of the water—the tree appears discontented, as if wanting to leave this world for whatever exists within the lake.There’s another boat-like object stranded nearby. It is completely sunk except for a tiny part peeping out of the water. Peer carefully and you’ll see small fish vigorously swimming about the boat. Bits of garbage are floating about too, as minute as ashes, and there’s also an upturned sandal. The lake, however, is barred to visitors. The boat must belong to the authorities managing the park and waters, an evening walker says. The only things otherwise floating in the lake are fish, ducks, and reflections of birds flying above.As the evening deepens, and the day light dims, the marooned boat loses its solidity, fast turning as black as the starless sky. And now it looks like a dolphin playfully spread along the water — when suddenly cursed into becoming a stone statue.The boat evokes an indescribably sad poem yet to be transcribed into words, and so heart-touching that you might want to experience it evening after evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-poem-without-words/story-0ixwyQHlK3BlPY4nuqsYpJ.html
26-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government gives point by point reply to Congress on 4 issues||A day after Uttarakhand Congress MLAs called on governor Baby Rani Maurya accusing the government of not allowing them to speak in the assembly session held on Wednesday, the BJP government on Friday blamed the opposition party for creating a ruckus in the House that stopped it from replying to issues raised by the Congress.Urban development minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik, during a press conference at the state secretariat in Dehradun on Friday, said: “The government was willing to give an answer on the four issues -- inflation, Covid-19, unemployment and law & order -- raised by the Congress but it was the Congress that created a ruckus in the House exposing their groupism.”“After that, they went to meet the governor on Thursday accusing us of not allowing them to speak. It was completely wrong as we wanted them to express their opinion on the major issues. Due to the ruckus, we couldn’t put our answers but are doing it today through the media,” said Kaushik.On Covid-19 handling, he said, “At present, the government has over 35,000 beds for Covid-19 infected people, including 31,000 Covid-19 isolation beds of which only 6,000 are occupied as of now. Similarly, out of 2,759 beds with oxygen supply, 1,896 are vacant while out of 636 ICU beds, 449 are available and of the total 605 ventilators, 598 are still unused.”He also said that the state’s testing rate was 53,244 per 10 lakh people which, he claimed was “better than that of states like Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. We are way ahead than the Congress-ruled states in this”.The minister revealed that during the pandemic, the government recruited 709 health staff including doctors and paramedics to boost the health facilities.“The state has 440 Covid-19 treatment facilities at present with 10 dedicated Covid-19 facilities and the number is increasing.”On inflation, Kaushik said the price of fuel in the state was lower than the Congress-ruled states and the government has managed to control the prices of essential commodities like rice, wheat, sugar and other grocery items during this pandemic.Also Read: Uttarakhand farmers protest farm bills, say ‘leaders weren’t consulted’Accusing the Congress of not supporting the government during the pandemic in controlling it, Kaushik said, “Instead of supporting the government in its efforts to control the pandemic, the Congress during the lockdown was busy in agitating.”“Also, they didn’t contribute a single penny in the CM relief fund to help the people but were busy demanding the details of the funds collected which we even disclosed without any hesitation,” said Kaushik.The Congress, however, described the minister’s comments on the debate in the House as “ridiculous”.Also Read: Uttarakhand CM orders probe after minister claims IAS officer ‘missing’Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin said, “We had demanded a debate on Covid-19 issue in the House in which all the members present there could speak. But they didn’t allow it and are now presenting figures before media saying they wanted to do it during the session which is ridiculous “Nizamuddin said the debate, if allowed, would have highlighted a number of “irregularities” in handling of the pandemic by the government.“By holding the debate on the pandemic, we wanted to discuss the numerous irregularities that have come to light during its handling by the government machinery. The government could have themselves invited us to do that but they chose the other way,” said Nizamuddin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-government-gives-point-by-point-reply-to-congress-on-4-issues/story-mdWwzTj1cO5rosVLoJ7diO.html

He said the water body is like a big marsh, with a thick growth of aquatic plants, which made the search challenging.“Her sister said when they went near the water body a crocodile attacked her sister and dragged her into the deep waters. She told her parents, who informed local police and forest officials,” he saidSharma said the forest officials immediately went to the spot with divers and local police and a search was started to trace the girl.“The incident had happened in the afternoon. After many hours of search, we finally found the body of the girl in the evening”, he saidGaurav Aggarwal, range officer (RO) Laksar said there were marks of a crocodile bite on her wrist.“It seems the crocodile dragged her into the water but didn’t eat her.

An ASF case was first reported in May and this week chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal ordered the culling of around 12,000 pigs by October end.Pig farm owners insist the government’s figure is conservative and insist over 100,000 pigs have died of the disease. There is no vaccine for the disease and it has a mortality rate of 90% to 100%.The farm owners have complained there has not been much help from the government in culling nor have they been compensated for the losses.Also Read: Assam reduces quarantine period from 10 days to 24 hours for passengers coming to the state“Our farm got hit by ASF virus and 95% of our stock i.e. 280 animals have died in the past month. Since the lockdown it had been very tough running our farm since we couldn’t sell our animals at an initial stage,” tweeted Diganta Saikia of Dibrugarh’s Pithubar Farms.“The government then banned the sale of pork and transport of animals due to the ASF epidemic that had killed lakhs of pigs across Assam during the lockdown. We had a huge fund crunch and ended up taking more loans from banks on top of our previous loans for operational purpose,”Like Saikia, many in districts like Tinsukia, Lakhimpur and Gohpur have suffered similar losses.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, ASF is a severe viral disease that affects both domestic and wild pigs. The disease does not transmit from animals to humans. Its transmission can also occur via contaminated feed and objects such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, knives. Unlike Classical Swine Fever), there is no vaccine for ASF.Also Read: Assam launches 4 schemes to boost Covid-hit tea industryAnimal husbandry and veterinary department commissioner and secretary Shyam Jagannathan cited their estimates since May and said nearly 18,000 pigs have died. He added Sonowal on Wednesday ordered the culling of 12,000 affected pigs before the Durga Puja festival.As per protocol, once samples of dead pigs are tested positive for ASF in an area, the one km radius around it is declared as disease epicenter. All pigs in that area are stamped and culled.An area of one km radius outside the epicentre is called surveillance zone and a radius of 9 km outside the buffer zone. There are 33 epicentres in 13 districts of the state.Jagannathan said the Centre and state government pay 50% of compensation each as per rules. “Compensation amount is based on the weight of the animal to be culled. We are planning to launch a portal where farmers can list details of affected pigs.”He said the compensation is transferred directly into bank accounts of farmers prior to culling. “Our requirement for culling 12,000 pigs is Rs 13.63 crores. No compensation has been given to farmers yet as the culling process is yet to begin.”Farm owners are unhappy saying the government’s plans are too little too late as there is none to compensate those who have lost their animals before the culling.“As per our estimates over 1 lakh [100,000] pigs have died due to ASF, which is way higher than the government estimate of 18,000 deaths. We also do not know how they came up with the figure of 12,000 pigs to be culled,” said North East Progressive Pig Farmers Association president Manoj Basumatary.He said commercial pig farmers are keeping records of deaths and have kept the government in the loop. “The disease reached our state 4-5 months ago, but till date, not a single culling has been done and not a single rupee given as compensation.”Neighbouring states have also banned the import of pigs from the state and added to the woes of the industry.Assam had the highest pig population--2.1 million--in the country, according to the 2019 livestock census.Assam Livestock Development Agency sectoral officer Jagannath Kalita said nearly one million people are directly or indirectly involved in pig farming in Assam. “On an average, piglets and pork valued at over Rs 500 crore are bought and sold in Assam every year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/african-swine-fever-hits-assam-s-piggery-sector-government-orders-culling-of-pigs/story-V0DhJ4643hblBhyTY7UjFK.html

Buoyed by the response in the state’s Majha and Malwa belts, the rail blockade is being rolled out in the Doaba belt, he said. Activists will sit on rail tracks in Jalandhar, Batala, Tanda and Mukerian junctions to register their protest. Scores of committee supporters are camping at Basti Tanka Wala in Ferozepur under Pannu’s leadership since Thursday. Activists have put up tents at the protest site near Ferozepur cantonment station. The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) also announced to start protests by blocking tracks in Bathinda on Saturday. Union spokesperson Jasveer Singh said the dharna is on at Goniana, Bhai Bakhtaur, Sagat and Rampura Phul in the district.

26-09-2020||City||Farmers’ rage spills on to streets||Scores of farmers took to the streets on Friday to air their anger against the contentious farm legislations, passed by the Parliament earlier this week, and blocked state and national highways for over eight hours as part of a nationwide agitation. The Ladhowal Toll Plaza, on National Highway-44, which was the epicentre of the protest in Ludhiana, was blocked with tractors between 9am to 4pm, leaving the commuters hassled. Police personnel remained on their toes, trying to divert the traffic towards the Sidhwan Bet Area.Besides farmers, others involved directly or indirectly with the agricultural sector, including small businessmen and arhtiyas, joined the protest and shouted slogans against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government.Interestingly, youngsters outnumbered the elderly, and marched through the roads, holding black flags and demanding the roll back of the new farm legislations. Many were even seen chanting “Wahe Guru Ji Khalsa, Wahe Guru Ji Fateh” as they marched on. Some others were seen serving water and tea to the elderly who had come for the protest. A sizeable number was also seen capturing photos and videos of the protest and uploading it on social media platforms.Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s nephew, Prof Jagmohan Singh, who addressing the gathering, said, “Earlier, the farmers’ protest was considered a protest by the elderly, but today, youngsters have outshined the old. If youngsters continue to support the protest, then the government will be compelled to withdraw the bill.”Rail Roko from October 1 Addressing the gathering, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Balbir Singh Rajewal announced that farmers’ unions will lay siege to the railway tracks from October 1 and stop the movement of trains for an indefinite period if the legislations are not rolled back. He said, “If the Centre does not agree to our demands, we will ask Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to call a special assembly session and pass an act in the state to stall the implementation of these draconian laws.” BKU general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said, “The country is being sold to corporate houses, which are taking over the Food Cooperation of India (FCI) also. We had asked the government to provide us a copy of the legislations but it was not shown to us. We are going to translate the legislations in Punjabi so that farmers can understand how the Centre is planning to rob them of their land.” ‘Bollywood drugs issue being raked up to divert agitators’Meanwhile, the agitators rued that the government was trying to divert attention from real issues, such as those of the farm sector, by raking up the Bollywood drug issue. Amarinder Singh of Sadhugarh village in Anandpur Sahib, who returned from United States (US) to join his father in progressive farming, said the concepts of contract farming have failed badly in the US and Europe. “Now, the same concept is being implemented in India which is going to completely ruin the farming sector of our state. As we are protesting, the government is diverting the attention by raking up the silly issue of Bollywood celebs taking drugs,” he said. Mahinder Singh Grewal, a progressive farmer who has been honoured by PAU on several occasions, said the Centre is misguiding people. “Earlier too, farmers could sell their crop anywhere in the county through National Agriculture Market (eNAM) and other methods. And many farmers are still doing contract farming. With the new Act, the corporates have got more power to hoard the crop as the law has also been made favourable for them and there is hardly anything to benefit the farmers,” said Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-rage-spills-on-to-streets/story-vFDaCGxNAOZHXHKPGtvvjI.html

The deceased showroom owner was booked on the complaint of Raju’s brother Suniya. “The owner was using old material and failed to take necessary precautions that led to the collapse of the building, killing my brother. He had come to Dera Bassi for a better life, but now I am taking back his body,” he said. The bodies of the labourers were handed over to their kin after autopsy at the Dera Bassi civil hospital on Friday. MC officials said Hardev had got the building plans approved in March. The showroom was coming up in place of a house owned by a family, hence, he had been working to get the approval to convert the house into a commercial building since 2000. ALSO READ: Beyond FIRs, probes, no action taken in similar cases in the pastA preliminary report by the Dera Bassi MC building inspector had attributed the collapse to old material and faulty sanitary fittings used in construction, while structure stability and load-bearing capacity were also ignored. A magisterial inquiry by the Dera Bassi SDM Kuldeep Bawa has already been ordered by the Mohali deputy commissioner.Notice to adjacent building’s ownerThe municipal council (MC) has issued a notice to the owner of the building coming up adjacent to the collapsed structure to stop construction work till the inquiry is completed. “The owner has also been directed to get a structure stability certificate and other inspections done before resuming work,” said Jagjeet Singh Judge, MC executive officer.Besides, the owner of a house adjacent to the collapse site has also been asked to vacate the premises, as his building had developed a crack. “The owner has been directed not to stay in the house till the repairs are carried out as the structure is now unsafe,” Judge said. Survey of old buildings In the wake of the collapse, MC has decided to undertake a survey of all unsafe buildings in the town. “All buildings older than 50 years will be inspected, and demolished if found unsafe, after notices to their owners,” the EO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-bassi-building-collapse-deceased-owner-booked/story-YEhGritGIbTlCubiYxrDEI.html
26-09-2020||City||Dera Bassi building collapse: Beyond FIRs, probes, no action taken in similar cases in past||The collapse of an under-construction commercial building in Meera Milli Mohalla, Dera Bassi, that killed four persons including the owner on September 24, has once again brought to fore the failure of the authorities to act against those who take safety lightly.Aside from magisterial probes and FIRs against builders or promoters, nothing was done in similar incidents that happened over the years.On April 12, 2018, too, a three-storeyed building under construction had collapsed in which 12 flats were being constructed, with four on each floor. Former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had got an FIR lodged saying the builders did not have a valid licence for construction.ALSO READ: Owner, three labourers die in Dera Bassi building collapseNo casualties were reported. However, the matter was eventually brushed under the carpet with no progress beyond the registration of the FIR. Three employees of the Zirakpur municipal council, who had been suspended, were later reinstated.After the incident, the civic body had started preparing a list of housing projects that had not obtained completion and occupancy certificates, but nothing came of it. The builders had managed to get all requisite clearances and permissions pertaining to the construction of the building later and the construction was completed. The flats were completed at the same site and were sold, and now the owners are living in those flats.Even in the collapse of a three-storeyed building with a basement at Sante Majra village on Kharar-Landran road, in which a JCB operator was crushed to death while digging the basement, no action was taken.The seven-page inquiry report completed by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) had indicted the builder and contractor, equally, for the mishap. The inquiry report had found that the basement had been dug up beyond the permissible limit and sanctioned depth, which had exposed the foundation of the adjacent three-storey building leading to the collapse. The builder had also failed to inform the municipal council before digging up the basement.On October 19, 2019, three labourers were injured after a portion of a commercial building being constructed in violation of norms had collapsed at Peer Muchalla in Zirakpur. The building is owned by Makhan Lal Bansal, who has a shop of tyres in Sector 28, Chandigarh, and is a resident of Sector 7, Panchkula. The preliminary probe had revealed the building was to house showrooms and had permissions for just one floor, but no action was taken beyond the inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-bassi-building-collapse-beyond-firs-probes-no-action-taken-in-similar-cases-in-past/story-kmD8L3Z59LKQjJk2Bea4cP.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government plans facelift for Gateway of India||The Maharashtra government is planning to revamp one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country — the Gateway of India. In its upgradation and renovation plan, the state is looking to give an introduction of the financial capital of the country at the site. The government has roped in conservation architect Abha Lambah, who has prepared three proposals for the revamp. The revamp will include the integration of the monument’s conservation, facilities for tourists, crowd management and security upgradation.Despite being one of the most visited monuments, there is no proper infrastructure for site management or facilities for visitors at Gateway of India. “The design has been made to integrate all the requirements, such as creating right facilities and infrastructure, while ensuring visual access to visitors, so that they can see the Gateway of India, the sea and will get a chance to see the imposing statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, which is currently lost in all the visual clutter. The revamp will give a kind of introduction to the city and to Maharashtra. The plan also incorporated the security and risk assessment. In all, it is an endeavour to look holistically to all the concerns,” Lambah told HT.The maintenance of the site and area around it is divided among various agencies. For instance, the structure and the 100-metre area near it come under the state archaeological department, while the jetty and boating area is under the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT). The area outside it falls under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).To deal with the jurisdiction issues, the state government on Friday constituted a committee of senior officials from the BMC, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), the state archaeological department, MbPT and the police department. The committee will be headed by Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, state tourism department, and finalise the model and help in executing the revamp plan. “We will conduct a proper upgradation and renovation of the whole Gateway of India precinct. The committee has been formed because there are so many agencies involved in it and thus a unified approach was needed. It is more like an executive committee in which everyone has to pool in their resources. It will approve the plan and all the agencies will then execute the part that falls under their jurisdiction,” said Singh. Apart from the proposed make-over plan, the tourism department has also planned to hold a sound and light show at the site. “It will be the most modern sound and light show and will be based on different themes related to the history of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Marathas, the freedom movement and many more and will keep changing every week,” she added.In February, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray had a meeting with deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar, in which the development and conservation of 22 tourist sites, including the Gateway of India, was discussed. The finance minister had also assured requisite funds for the development and maintenance of these sites.The state government on September 7 had approved developing a jetty and passenger terminal near Radio Club in south Mumbai to facilitate boat rides to Elephanta Island, Alibag and Mandwa. The project will help in decongesting the existing jetty and passenger terminal at the Gateway of India which sees 30-35 lakh passengers every year. The MMB has said it will be start the tendering process for the ₹100-crore project soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-plans-facelift-for-gateway-of-india/story-nXE5UWHDhZwZUW2MjRspzK.html

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Ruling partners Congress, NCP say they will not implement farm bills in Maharashtra||Two ruling parties in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi-led government — the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — announced that they will not implement the farm laws in Maharashtra which were passed in Parliament early this week.Deputy chief minister (DyCM) and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said the farm bills, as well as the labour bills, will not be implemented in Maharashtra. State revenue minister and Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said that all ruling parties are against the newly-enacted laws and the decision of not implementing them in the state will be taken collectively after due deliberation.The Congress and NCP supported the nationwide protest by farmers to oppose the three farm bills passed by Parliament early this week. Various farmer organisations including Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Lok Sangharsh Morcha held marches, blocked highways, burnt copies of the bills and formed human chains in at least 21 districts in Maharashtra on Friday in opposition of the bills. The farmer organisations have announced plans to intensify their protests if the bills are not withdrawn by the Central government. The third ruling party in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena is yet to clear its stand on the issue, though it has been criticising the Central government over the bills.While speaking in Pune on Friday, Pawar said that not only the farm bills but even the amendment in labour laws passed in Parliament early this week, will not be implemented in Maharashtra. “These bills were passed in haste. We are studying the legalities of the bills and will take a call to not implement them in the state,” he said. His cabinet colleague and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said that all the ruling parties are against the anti-farmer laws. “We have been opposing them tooth and nail. We will discuss the laws to take steps against their implementation in the state,” he said.Shiv Sena, the prime ally in the MVA government in Maharashtra has not yet clarified its stand on the bills. The party had invited criticism by Maharashtra BJP leaders for its “hypocritical stance” for supporting bills in the Lok Sabha and walking out of the vote in the Rajya Sabha. “The issue will be discussed in the coordination committee of the three parties. Our stand this time was similar to the one taken during the CAA debate in the Parliament early this year. But on farm issues, we would not support the bills and their implementation in Maharashtra. The stand will be clarified in due course,” said a Sena functionary, requesting anonymity. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by former MP Raju Shetti burnt copies of the bills in Kolhapur.“Shetkari Sanghatana has always been against the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and our leader, the late Sharad Joshi used to call these committees ‘abattoirs’ of farmers. However, we do not endorse the way the existing system of farm produce marketing is being thrashed out by the Central government. This is nothing but an attempt to make farmers slaves in the hands of industrialists,” Shetti said. He described it as a step towards privatisation of the Food Corporation of India and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), which purchase about 30% of the farm produce.Ajit Nawale, general secretary, ABKS said that protests were held in 21 districts of the state by farmers. “At least the farmers have some mechanism in place to market their produce at a reasonable price in the form of APMCs today. The bills passed in Parliament are the first step towards handing over farm marketing to a few industrial houses that will decide the prices of the produce. Though the Centre has been claiming these bills are a way to free farmers from the clutches of APMCs, the government has freed itself from the responsibilities of fair and remunerative prices to farmers. In Maharashtra, the Fadnavis government had brought bills to regularise APMCs, but it could not set up an alternative mechanism to the APMCs to give farmers remunerative prices for their produce. It was a failed attempt,” he said.Farmers from Thane, Palghar, Nashik held ‘rasta roko’ protests on national highways including Mumbai-Jaipur-Delhi disrupting the traffic for some time. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Congress announced a programme to be implemented over the next five weeks to oppose the farm bills. The party has announced plans to organise a drive on social media to garner support against the bills, virtual farmer rallies and to gather signatures from 1 crore farmers opposing the bills.Senior Congress leader HK Patil, who was recently appointed as Maharasthra Congress in-charge, said in a press conference in Mumbai, “Under pressure from big industries, the [Narendra] Modi government passed the farm and labour bills which will uproot and destroy farmers and workers in the country. The bills will bring back the feudal zamindari system in the country. The laws should be immediately repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ruling-partners-congress-ncp-say-they-will-not-implement-farm-bills-in-maharashtra/story-RA4Ex3lldUSE2SrLJdQuvJ.html

26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh education department fixes time slots for academic consultation at government schools||After the first week of schools opening for academic consultation for classes above 9, the UT education department has now issued fresh instructions for all government schools to maintain uniformity in the timings.As per the instructions, two sessions will be conducted each day Monday onwards. The first session will be held for board classes 10 and 12 between 9am and 11.30am; the second session will be held for classes 9 and 11 from 12 noon to 2.30pm.This comes after it was observed that while some schools were opening at 9am, some were opening at 10am, and there was no one guideline on how long the session had to be. Many teachers were complaining that they were having to take classes for more hours than those in other schools.All government schools will now be open from 8.30am to 2.30pm, and the principals/heads/in-charge of each school will have to come in daily, sit for the entire duration to make sure all norms are being followed. Also, 50% of the teaching staff will be called for this duration, however, the timetable will be designed in a way that teachers visit on alternative days.Teachers of middle and primary schools, however, will also have to come in even though students below Class 9 haven’t been allowed to come to school, yet. They will provide online classes when present in the school. Teachers who are unwell and take more than three holidays in a row will have to get a medical certificate.DEO asks teachers to encourage studentsAs per sources, 950 students showed up at government schools on Monday, but the number dipped to 500 over the week. Teachers have been asked to motivate more students to come in the coming days by the district education officer (DEO).The rules are meant only for government schools; private schools will remain open as per the standard operating procedures issued by the Union ministry of home affairs. Director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “From Monday onwards, students of classes 9 and 11 will be given a slot for the first time. They will be allowed to come to school with a printed copy of consent from their parents.”Chairman of Vivek High School, Sector 38, and president of the Independent Schools Association, said, “We receive only two to four students in a day, so there is no point having slots like this.” He added that students were coming to the school after 2pm after attending online classes in the morning.Director of Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, Atul Khanna said they had not received even a single student for academic consultation all week, but will wait for students to start coming before any slots are designated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-education-department-fixes-time-slots-for-academic-consultation-at-government-schools/story-YuyKWIq1NfSYkeABtFBXAP.html
26-09-2020||Chandigarh||Centre sanctions 80 electric buses for Chandigarh||In a big push to electric mobility in the city, the central government on Friday sanctioned 80 electric buses for the city under Phase-2 of the FAME India Scheme.Under the scheme, the central government will provide a Rs 50-lakh subsidy for each bus to the seller.“Chandigarh was initially not included in this phase. But, UT administrator VPS Badnore wrote to the Centre with a request to include it. The transport department also followed this up with the government,” said Uma Shankar Gupta, director, transport, UT.The buses will give a major fillip to administration’s plan to replace all ordinary buses with electric buses. The Chandigarh Transport Undertaking has around 400 buses in its fleet, and nearly half of these are nearing the completion of their operational life.Notably, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent revenue loss, the administration last month had stalled the purchase of 40 electric buses even after floating a tender.The transport department had planned to get the buses running by September. UT had decided to purchase the buses in June 2019 after the Union government refused to finance them. “We will have to study the parameters of the scheme after we receive a formal letter from the government. We will see whether we can proceed with the tenders for the 40 buses,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-sanctions-80-electric-buses-for-chandigarh/story-Ktx2DVu6S9xSTtKRWYnarM.html

After the matter came to light, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) authorities have given a notice to the food supply contractor seeking an explanation.Insects were found at the Covid centre set-up at a high-rise in Kalyan. Kamlakar Indulkar, a Kalyan resident and Shakha Pramukh of Shiv Sena was admitted at the centre on September 21 after testing positive for Covid-19.“I was not feeling well for three-four days, so I carried out the test at Rukmani Bai Hospital in Kalyan and was tested positive. The authorities themselves suggested to get admitted in the Covid centre,” Indulkar said.“On Wednesday night after we received dinner, I was shocked to see worms in it. I thought it was only on my plate. But later everyone from more than 20 wards started complaining about the same. We approach the management and complained about the contractor,” added Indulkar.Sanjay Jadhav, secretary, KDMC, said, “We had given notice to the contractor and asked him for an explanation for the bad food quality. We will take action. The dinner was distributed to around 40 patients on a single floor on Wednesday night. As soon as the insects were found, it was returned. Within an hour we re-arranged dinner for the patients. The hospital has around 700 patients and we see that proper food reaches them on time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/worms-found-in-patients-dinner-at-kalyan-centre-contractor-pulled-up/story-g4Z5A3RqesikFWVEnbzYwJ.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana’s office razed: Do you show same swiftness in demolishing other unauthorised structures, HC asks BMC||The Bombay high court (HC), while questioning the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on whether it has acted with the same swiftness in demolishing other unauthorised structures, asked why section 351 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, which stipulates granting sufficient time to the owner to explain about completed unauthorised work, was not invoked. The question was asked to BMC after the court was informed by actor Kangana Ranaut’s counsel that there was no ongoing work on the premise when it was detected and inspected by the BMC’s mukadam and officer on September 5 and 7, respectively, yet section 354 (A) of the Act which pertains to ongoing work was invoked. The court has further asked BMC to produce the phone of the mukadam who detected the unauthorised construction in the bungalow of actor Kangana Ranaut on September 5 to verify whether photographs of the alleged ongoing unauthorised alterations and additions were taken based on which the inspection of the bungalow was prompted on September 7. While arguing that the demolition undertaken by the civic authority was out of malice, senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf submitted that no actual construction work was going on at the time of the inspection by the executive engineer on September 7. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla, while hearing the petition of Ranaut which sought a stay on the demolition undertaken by BMC at her Pali Hill bungalow on September 9 and compensation of ₹2 crore for the damage caused during the demolition, was informed by Dr Saraf that the unauthorised alterations and additions as alleged by BMC in its notice were completed in 2019. Dr Saraf submitted that the same could be proved by photographs of the pooja held by the actor at the bungalow in January 2020. He submitted that as Ranaut was a public personality, and had taken to social media to criticise the government on its handling of various issues, she was targeted by Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut. Dr Saraf added that the demolition was prompted at the behest of Raut as she countered and confronted him on social media. Pointing to various discrepancies in BMC’s September 10 and 17 affidavits filed in response to the actor’s petition on September 9, Dr Saraf submitted that there were a lot of contradictions in BMC’s stand, and hence, it should be asked to provide details of the detection, inspection and stop-work notices issued as well as show evidence of actual work going on. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy who represented BMC along with advocate Joel Carlos, submitted that the contentions being raised by Dr Saraf were not done earlier which showed that the actor was trying to improvise as she had not denied the unauthorized alterations and additions pointed out in the BMC notice. Chinoy further said that while only two demolished toilets were open to the sky the rest of the demolition was internal. After hearing the submissions and going through the evidence submitted by the actor and BMC, the court observed that advocate Pradeep Thorat’s client (Sanjay Raut) had indeed done what he said (Ukhad Diya). The bench then sought to know why demolition was done on the ground floor when there was no ongoing work and asked the BMC to give details of the workmen who were allegedly carrying out the alterations when the premise was inspected. The court then asked both parties to argue their cases in a time-bound manner and keep their written submissions ready so that hearing could be expedited and posted the matter for hearing on Monday, September 28 at 11am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-s-office-razed-do-you-show-same-swiftness-in-demolishing-other-unauthorised-structures-bombay-high-court-asks-mumbai-civic-corporation/story-9wZMUryrfgnRrFc3aK3kpJ.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Rise in toll rate by Maharashtra govt irks commuters in Thane||Commuters and residents from Thane are irked with the state government notification that toll rates will increase at Anandnagar toll plaza along the Eastern Express Highway and LBS Marg, Mulund from October 1.The one-way toll for a passenger car, which is ₹35, will increase to ₹40. In the pandemic situation, when commuters have to rely heavily on the roadways, this increase will bore a major hole in their pockets, claimed Thane residents.The state government has issued a notification revising rates for toll recovery at the entry points to Mumbai on Thursday. Shashikumar Nair, chairman of Yatra Samiti, Thane, said: “During this pandemic, when the local trains are not available for the common man to travel on a regular basis, the government should have avoided the hike in toll. It is always the residents of Thane who have to bear the pinch of the toll. Pressurising the common man seems to be the aim now.”During elections, the main agenda of all political parties was to resolve the toll issue for the residents of Thane. Residents took out various campaigns as well in the past protesting the toll.Kasber Augustine, citizen activist, said, “Thane residents have to bear these unjust tolls for a long time, it is an added burden for citizens during the pandemic. The least that they could do is to consider giving a return pass. Citizens are cooperating with the government during the pandemic. In return, these are small ways in which the government can reduce the burden, and most are travelling during this period as they do not have much option.”Jayant Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director of MEP Infra that manages the toll, said, “The toll rate revision is part of a process that takes place every three years as per ruling of the High Court in 2002. As per the notification, we will be implementing the same. It is not introduced newly but a sacrosanct rate. We have already started the process to implement RFID at Vashi toll naka. The same will be implemented at Mulund-Thane toll naka as well gradually. This will also help ease the traffic congestion caused due to toll collection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rise-in-toll-rate-by-maharashtra-govt-irks-commuters-in-thane/story-Ast2wqleKsOdFTnfzCc66H.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Testing to be increased as Covid-19 cases on the rise in Diva||In the last one week, the number of cases in Diva has been on the rise. However, only a team of 31 people are deployed to trace and track the number of positive cases here, as per the Thane Municipal Corporation data.On the request of the residents, TMC has now agreed to conduct antigen testing within housing societies in Diva as well.“Despite festivities, people were following the social distancing and isolation norms. However, since the Unlock Mission has started, we found huge crowds outside and people were also stepping out frequently. This may have led to the rise in cases this month. Moreover, unlike earlier, there are a few TMC officers visiting Diva nowadays to test or trace despite the rising number of cases,” said Adarsh Munde, 38, resident of Diva.Since the onset of the virus, till last week of June, Diva saw less than 10 cases on a regular basis. A slight spike was noticed post August and containment zones were given special attention. The cases started dipping from August second week till first week of September. A spike is noticed again now. Diva currently has a 1.5 per cent growth rate of positive cases.“We have initiated antigen testing in housing complexes in Diva. This will help us understand if there are any particular pockets that have a rising number of cases. This has been started with the aim to provide timely treatment and to be able to trace those with high risks,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner.In this initiative, the civic body is collaborating with committee members of housing complexes and providing testing facilities at the doorstep. In order to identify pockets with spike in cases or any trend, this initiative has been started by the civic body.“Initially, along with Mumbra, we focused on Diva as well. We created awareness and extensive testing, included fever clinics as well to ensure detection rate was high. As the numbers decreased, our focus remained on the containment zones. With increased movement, there could be a rise in cases. So, we are taking different methods to ensure timely treatment and tracing of high-risk contacts,” said a senior TMC officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/testing-to-be-increased-as-covid-19-cases-on-the-rise-in-diva/story-ejtGdaSjjRUIQ5MiOsLN8L.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Around 2,500 hawkers apply for loan under PM SVANidhi scheme in Navi Mumbai||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has started implementing the Prime Minister’s Street Vendor Atmanirbhar (SVA) Nidhi scheme of the state government.The scheme offers up to ₹10,000 as working capital loan to hawkers. The scheme was introduced by the central government following the loss of livelihood suffered by the hawkers due to the lockdown in Covid pandemic. The scheme will be available for hawkers in the city who worked prior to March 24 when the lockdown was announced.Abhijit Bangar, NMMC commissioner, said, “Hawkers who are facing financial issues have little to spare for purchase of goods and commodities to do their business. We are promoting the scheme to help them get that amount to re-invest in business. Everyone from streets vendors, hawkers, handcart owners can benefit from the scheme. The loan is for purchase of vegetables, fruits, ready food articles, bread, eggs, tea, footwear, clothes, handicrafts, stationery, pan stalls and books among others.”NMMC officials said that around 2,500 applications have been received so far by the civic body, of which 423 have asked for recommendation letters.Hawkers who have been issued identity cards and also those whose survey have been conducted but have not been issued the licence can apply under the scheme. Those who worked as hawkers prior to March 24 but were not covered under the survey will require a recommendation letter from NMMC.As per the scheme, the loan will be given for a period of one year and has to be returned in instalments. Those who repay the loan in time will be eligible for additional loan. A grant of 7 per cent interest will also be deposited in their accounts quarterly. Online payments will attract cash back incentive for the hawkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/around-2-500-hawkers-apply-for-loan-under-pm-svanidhi-scheme-in-navi-mumbai/story-oWo4nHzouE0D9uUdtKUkqN.html

As the automobile industry was shut, none made new purchases and hence there was no registration happening. The licence renewal and issuing new licenses had also taken a back seat due to complete lockdown,” Panvel RTO Gajanan Thombare said.From April 2019 to August 2019, 20,581 new registration of vehicles was done whereas during the same period in the year 2020, only 5,014 registrations were done taking the registration of vehicles down by 75 per cent.Thombare added, “The number of vehicle registrations are slowly increasing and we hope to get more number in coming months. With an economic crisis going on, there are chances that the registrations might not match up to last year’s monthly numbers.”In 2019, the number of two-wheelers that got registered in these five months were 12,055 and 4,261 four wheelers while this year, it came down to 2,726 and 1,860, respectively.The revenue earned by the Panvel, Pen, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg Dy RTO offices under Panvel RTO in 2019 during the five-months-period was Rs200.66 cr while this it came down to Rs70.47 cr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-woes-panvel-rto-suffers-rs130-crore-revenue-loss/story-Kjctqy3c4R3hruRcpLBUlO.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Bhiwandi police arrest AIMIM leader for extortion||The Thane Crime Branch Unit 1 have arrested Bhiwandi AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen) leader, Khalid Guddu, 47, from Bhiwandi, for allegedly extorting a businessman at gun point for ₹1.25 lakh. Three of his accomplices, too, have been arrested in the case.Police laid a trap and nabbed the accused red-handed. Bhiwandi city police have registered an extortion case against Guddu. According to Thane crime branch officials, the Bhiwandi-based builder is a resident of Bhiwandi. Guddu was allegedly demanding ransom to avoid any problems in his new construction projects going on in Bhiwandi.The accused allegedly kidnapped the victim in September 2019 for money for upcoming Assembly elections but he later released the victim. Guddu had allegedly taken more than Rs20 lakh from the victim.Deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2, R Shinde said, “According to a complaint, we laid a trap outside Guddu’s house. We arrested Guddu red-handed while accepting ₹1.25 lakh. A case is being registered at Bhiwandi City Police Station for extortion and abduction among other sections. Further investigation is going on. On Friday, he was produced in the court.” There are a total of 23 cases registered against Guddu under various police stations including cheating, forgery, attempt to murder and kidnapping amongst others. The accused Guddu was earlier a corporator and was contesting the state election from Bhiwandi (W) constituency but lost. AIMIM, general secretary, advocate Amol Kamble said, “This is completely a political trap as 2022 corporator elections are ahead. In CCTV footage, it has clearly shown that complainant himself went to the Budrunisa bunglow in Bhiwandi. He can see speaking to Guddu’s other team members as this complainant had some issue and they wanted to solve it. This is completely fake case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-police-arrest-aimim-leader-for-extortion/story-dyysyyTn3pqxYeKtNzxnHJ.html

26-09-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body begins screening at Thane-Belapur industrial belt||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has started Covid testing in the Thane-Belapur industrial belt. The initiative, taken up for the first time, will enable the testing of the thousands of workers and management personnel working in the MIDC belt. People from all over Mumbai come to work in the industries here. Limited number of employees are allowed based on the Covid norms.Civic chief, Abhijit Bangar, said, “It is very important that those who come to work here in the belt are tested for Covid. Hence, we have initiated a special drive wherein our staff will go to the premises of the industries and test the employees. We have initiated antigen tests in the past two days along with RT-PCR tests of those found symptomatic. Several persons have been found positive in the antigen test and they have been immediately isolated.”Bangar added that those industrial units that want to get their employees tested should register with the office of MIDC Navi Mumbai Regional officer Satish Bagal.“Bagal has been designated as `Incident Commander’. The information of those registered with him will be sent to NMMC health department and a special camp will then be held in the premises of that unit. All units in the industrial belt are requested to register themselves and get their employees tested to enable safer working conditions and to prevent the spread of the virus in the region,” Bangar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-begins-screening-at-thane-belapur-industrial-belt/story-kUO3L6N5qmaomPZAmaUewI.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Test our residents for Covid-19, high-rises tell Thane civic body||With the increasing number of cases in plush residential complexes, many housing societies in Majiwada-Manpada ward are requesting the civic body to conduct antigen testing or RT-PCR tests within their societies.The high rises along Ghodbunder Road, Balkum and Tikujiniwadi among others are seeing increased movement with relaxation of lockdown rule. A constant 1.6 per cent growth rate of positive cases in these areas within Majiwada-Manpada ward has made the residential complexes more aware about the spread of the virus.Madhu Menon, president, Hiranandani Estates Residents Welfare Association, said, “We have around 102 buildings in our society and have detected more than 340 positive cases in 36 buildings till now. Among these, 80 per cent of the cases are in the last two months. We set up a RT-PCR testing unit within the club house for the benefit of the residents; it is a voluntary testing facility that started a month ago.”The Thane Municipal Corporation has deployed a team of 232 people within the Majiwada-Manpada ward to test and trace the rising number of cases.Sagar Malve, chairman, Haware City, said: “Although we have made provisions for a thermal gun and oximeter at all entrance gates of our society, we have requested the civic body to make provisions for antigen testing within our society as well. As many residents step out for job or business purposes and travel through public transport, we have made this request for the good health of our society members.”Since the last fortnight, the daily positive cases are above 90 in this ward. This is the highest in any ward in Thane city as of now. The highest daily number witnessed by Majiwada- Manpada ward was on August 14 at 133. The numbers had started decreasing after that but a spike has been noticed again in the cases this month.Anuradha Babar, Assistant municipal commissioner, TMC, said: “Travelling and exposure have increased among people. With many residential complexes within our ward, we have been conducting medical camps. Besides, there are many societies that come forward requesting for antigen testing. On a daily basis, we conduct around 400 antigen tests and 200 RT-PCR tests. Moreover, residents also individually visit private laboratories to conduct testing.”This ward has four containment zones as of now. “There are no particular factors or trends in these increased positive cases, the details are discreet. However, we are taking continuous efforts to ensure the chain is broken and all high risk contacts are in isolation at the earliest through tracing,” added Babar.Majiwada-Manpada ward consists of high rises and huge residential complexes that were following strict protocol since the lockdown began. It was only after the unlock mission began that people started stepping out. Dr Santosh Kadam, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane Chapter, said, “After Unlock 4 on August 31, people have started stepping out to visit malls, shops, run errands and also getting back to jobs and business. Till then, the high rises or residential complexes were well safe guarded with isolation provisions in flats. It was easier to maintain social distancing. Now, people are fearlessly stepping out and as they come in contact with others the numbers are increasing. We have most hospital beds full.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/test-our-residents-for-covid-19-high-rises-tell-thane-civic-body/story-omwwhAu5fMqqPIfEN6mMLL.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||No new construction within 100 metres of Air Force boundary wall, says Thane civic chief||The Thane civic commissioner, Dr. Vipin Sharma, has issued a notice that henceforth no new construction, developmental work or structure will be allowed 100m from the boundary wall of the Air Force premises in Kolshet. Also, a No Objection Certificate from the Air Force will be required for any civil, beautification or developmental work.The Air Force authorities had drafted a letter to the Thane civic commissioner in February this year requesting him to implement these directions as per the Government of India Gazette notification of 2010. The notice, though, will be applicable to the constructions henceforth in the Air Force area, there is still the question of those constructions that have already come up in the area all these years.The question of constructions mushrooming closer to the Air Force base in Kolshet area of Thane (W) is pending for the last many years. Though there is a rule that constructions should not be allowed 100m from the outer wall of the Air Force permises, the rule was violated in the city.In a letter addressed to the corporation, the Air Force authorities have said, “There is an Air Force base and a helipad for landing of helicopter in the premises due to which the security here needs to be tightened. With respect to this, no construction activity should be allowed in 100m from the boundary wall of the base.”The commissioner has issued a public notification banning construction activity here. Sharma said, “No building or structure shall be constructed, created or erected 100m around outer boundary wall of Air Force base in Kolshet. Activities like digging, road work, drainage work, planting trees or beautification work will also require an NOC from the Air Force.” Sharma said a plan mapping the 100m area is also released.He added, “We do not give permission to any construction activity in this restricted area, only those structures on Gaonthan land are given permission for repairs. Henceforth, the notification will also prevent any new construction in the area.”Thane-based activist Sanjeev Dutta said that the directives are delayed as most constructions have already come up in the area.He said, “I have raised the issue six to seven years ago repeatedly with the corporation. However, no action was taken. There are many constructions in the 100m area at present due to corporation’s unwillingness to implement the rule all these years. They cannot axe these constructions as most people have bought homes from their hard-earned money. This rule might just stay on paper.”Mayor raises questions Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske has drafted a letter to the corporation questioning the fate of those constructions that have already come up inside the 100m radius.He said, “The commissioner should give clarity if the rule is several years old or if it is a recent development. If the prohibitory orders are old, then the corporation needs to take a decision on the existing constructions. How were permissions to all these constructions given if this rule has already been in place for almost a decade?”Mhaske has also asked for a list of constructions that were permitted since the rule came into existence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-new-construction-within-100-metres-of-air-force-boundary-wall-says-thane-civic-chief/story-ivkrvmNfRNEIXxxkgd4DgM.html

In an editorial, Saamana said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several states have used the same film personalities when it suited their needs. It added a “picture” was being painted to show all major film stars are drug addicts and grow ganja in their homes.“Is such an environment being created so that the cinema industry and the personalities working in it leave Mumbai? This speculation is gaining ground. In a systematic fashion, a picture is being painted that the actors, directors, cinematographers, etc have left acting and become drug addicts and leaving art, they have started farming ganja and afeem in the galleries, and balconies of their homes,” the editorial said.The editorial comes as the Narcotics Control Bureau has summoned prominent actors in connection with its probe into the case related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.It said the “mudslinging” is going on to discredit the industry. “Prime Minister Modi and several states have used the artists of this film industry for [enhancing] their political status. In Gujarat, Modi and Salman Khan were flying kites. Amitabh Bachchan was the brand ambassador of Gujarat. Modi had given the responsibility of teaching people how to eat mangoes to Akshay Kumar. Vivek Oberoi has made earnings from the film made on Modi, and Anupam Kher on the film made on Manmohan Singh.”The mouthpiece said attempts were being made to “finish off” the Mumbai industry as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced a film city in his state. It added that the idea of starting a film city is good but running it is hard as several studios in Mumbai are facing tough times.The editorial said Mumbai as a film city will always stay relevant. It said the Centre should have thought of starting a film city in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-s-saamana-hits-out-at-attempt-to-discredit-mumbai-s-film-industry/story-s4Wwgi1zZ7ht8upOKDND8M.html
26-09-2020||City||Maratha reservation: State government taking well-thought-out measures, says Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the Maratha community to remain calm, as the government was taking “well-thought-out” measures on the reservation issue. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has assured support to the government, stating there will be no politics on the issue. The two, Thackeray through video-conferencing and Fadnavis, were speaking at the annual Mathadi meet held to mark the 87th birth anniversary of Annasaheb Patil, the founder of the Mathadi movement. Maharashtra’s cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil, former minister and MLA Ganesh Naik and Mathadi leader Narendra Patil, who is also the chairman of Annasaheb Patil Arthik Vikas Mahamandal, among others, were also present. For the first time in the past 38 years, the meet was held in closed premises of Mathadi Bhavan with limited attendance and telecast online due to pandemic restrictions. Addressing the Mathadis, who primarily belong to the Maratha community, Thackeray said, “We have appealed to the Supreme Court on the Maratha reservation stay and deployed the best of lawyers for it. No stone will be left unturned. We have also taken some decisions in the cabinet to give relief to the community till the stay is vacated. We are taking all measures and decisions within the parameters of the court ruling so that there is no contempt of court. I appeal to the Mathadis and also the rest of the community to stay calm.” Stating that the Shiv Sena and Mathadis can together be a major force, Thackeray said, “Attempts are being made to malign Mumbai. Shiv Sena workers and Marathas fight like men and can together face it all. Balasaheb and Anna Saheb Patil couldn’t come together, but Narendra Patil and I will definitely work together always and show what our strength can do.” Fadnavis said, “The Maratha Reservation Act that we brought in was even approved by the high court, which said that the state government had the right to make the Act. We want the Maratha community to get justice and the state government should do all it can to get the stay vacated. We will fully support the government on it.” On the concerns over the farm bills, Fadnavis said, “Misinformation is being spread on the bills by vested interests. The Acts do not call for the end of APMC. They are just ensuring that it does not have a monopoly and the farmers have options to progress and there are more investments in godowns, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maratha-reservation-state-government-taking-well-thought-out-measures-says-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray/story-yDYrIZr4OyXOfYjkelgkcP.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Andheri, Borivli, Malad are new Covid hot spots in Mumbai||Six months into the Covid-19 pandemic, the city is witnessing new hot spots with Goregaon, Borivli, Mulund, Kandivli, Dahisar and Malabar Hill reporting a growing number of cases. These areas now comprise almost 40% of the total active cases in Mumbai. Till June, G North ward (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim) had the highest number of Covid-19 cases. Now, the hotspots have are in Borivli, Andheri (West), Malad, and Andheri (East), which have more than 11,000 cases at present. Data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows recent spikes in the Covid-19 growth rate in Bandra, Borivli, Andheri and Dahisar. H West ward, which covers Bandra (West), recorded the highest spike of 1.71%, followed by R Central ward (Borivli), with 1.55%; K West ward (Andheri), with 1.41%; and R North ward (Dahisar), with 1.34%. BMC attributes the spike to increased testing. “Cases are directly proportionate to the number of tests. So, as we aim to conduct the highest number of tests, we have ramped up testing,” said additional municipal commissioner, Suresh Kakani. For example, R Central ward is conducting around 1,000 tests daily and has tied up with private labs to collect samples for rapid antigen testing in door-to-door surveys. “Our positivity rate has gone from 21% in July to 18.2% in September, which is a good sign,” said Kakani. However, experts point to relaxation and violation lockdown norms as well as the recent gatherings for Ganeshotsav. Swapnil Tembwalkar, corporator from Goregaon, said, “Industries are opening up, which is attracting a large number of migrants from the neighbouring states. Thus, we are settling up testing facilities in several industrial areas.” BMC has conducted over 1,050,000 tests for Covid-19, including rapid antigen and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Almost 30 lakh people who were among close contacts of infected patients have been traced. Since end-August, BMC has increased its daily testing figures from 5,000 to an average of 12,000. Rapid antigen tests, which deliver results within 30 minutes, comprise almost 50% of the total daily testing in the city. The civic body’s data suggests 60% of the new cases are from high-rise buildings. To reduce the spread of the infection from low-income areas, BMC has advised caution while allowing domestic help to return to work. With the upcoming festival season, BMC expects Mumbai will cross 2.20 lakh cases by October 2. Experts raised concerns about careless behaviour among the public. “People aren’t wearing masks or following social distancing which can cause a surge during Navratri next month,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital and chief coordinator between private hospitals and BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/andheri-borivli-malad-are-new-covid-hot-spots-in-mumbai/story-1kRe2JfPN2iXNlvY9CCjZO.html

26-09-2020||City||Reservation row: Marathas set to take to the streets again in Maharashtra||Four years after the rape and murder of a girl from the community spurred Maratha protests in Maharashtra, leading to a separate quota for the dominant caste, it is yesterday once more in the state. Upset with the apex court’s interim stay on their reservation in education and jobs, the Maratha community has decided to take to the streets once again to protest the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government’s “apathy” in handling the litigation. In phase one, the silent Maratha morchas led by lakhs of members took the previous Fadnavis government by a storm. The Maratha protests 2.0 could similarly spook the Thackeray-led government, which is already battling the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2016 protests had culminated in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government passing a Maratha reservation bill in 2018, promising the community 16% reservation in jobs and education. The Bombay high court had upheld the state law, but sought a reduction in the quota to 12% and 13%, in jobs and education, respectively. Earlier this month, this quota was stayed just as admissions to colleges were being carried out, even as the petition was forwarded to a larger constitutional bench. Maratha community leaders have blamed the Thackeray-led government for not being alert enough to avoid the interim stay. They also suspect and claim the state government versus the Centre tussle has led to this legal face-off. “The community is angry. This government was not alert enough. To add to this, within two days, they announced the recruitment of 12,000 police constabulary. What message does that send to our community? The state education minister did not even wait for the written judgment and stayed the entire admission process following TV announcements,” said Virendra Pawar, a Maratha leader. Pawar also blamed the Central government versus MVA face-off indirectly. “They (the MVA) should take the BJP into confidence and ensure the stay on our reservation is vacated. The other promises made by them post the stay, including granting the community reservation within EWS, are problematic and not legally tenable,” he added. Meanwhile, the Maratha Kranti Morcha, umbrella organisation, which had led the protests earlier, is back in action. So far, decentralised small protests have been held across the state, including in Mumbai. On September 27, a mega protest, ‘Akrosh Andolan’, has been planned in Pune, where the community will protest outside homes of politicians across parties. The community has also threatened a state-wide agitation on October 10, if its various demands, including a stay on all recruitments and completing admissions of students already granted seats, are not fulfilled. Plans to protest have not been called off, despite a plea by Thackeray to avoid demonstrations during the pandemic. State public works minister Ashok Chavan, who also heads a ministerial sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said, “We are going to safeguard the interests of the Maratha community even while we abide by the apex court. We will accommodate them within 10% EWS quota. At the same time, we have moved for revocation of the stay by the apex court. We are also making sure various existing provisions for the community such as scholarships for higher education and seed money for Maratha entrepreneurs are strengthened.” Maratha youngsters are, however, not placated. Pooja Zole, a young Maratha activist with Maratha Kranti Morcha, said youngsters feel the community is being betrayed again. “Our community protests have been going on for 30 years. In 2014, too, we were given reservation, which got stayed. Now, just as admissions are in progress, an interim stay has been imposed. We feel our community is used for politics of vote,” said Zole. She said the community did not care about politics and would target all who made irresponsible statements against Maratha reservation. While the BJP has said it is with the government on the issue of Maratha reservation, the state unit of the party has not held back from blaming the MVA for the current scenario. Chandrakant Patil, state president of BJP, said, “We brought out a reservation bill for the community, which was endorsed by the HC. But this Aghadi failed to represent even that bill properly in the SC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reservation-row-marathas-set-to-take-to-the-streets-again-in-maharashtra/story-2hqFQxKg0aajYMxFdNe7AP.html

It’s time we included people with mental health issues in this list and helped them lead a dignified life even when their families are not around to help them. The provision of a daycare cum home for adults is not a luxury but a necessity and as per the new Mental Health policy 2017 -- a fundamental need. We can start small in one of the under-utilised buildings with the administration. The families of residents could pool in funds, nursing students and medical interns could be employed as a part of their training. Charities, NGOs and sponsors under CSR could help families in need of financial support.Deepika Gandhi, Chandigarh A long time resident of Chandigarh, I am the father (and the only caregiver) of a person with mental illness.

The Chandigarh administration must pay heed to the following: UT adviser Manoj Parida has said, “In Chandigarh, we have no land,” for a home and that “one needs at least six acres of land. That will not be necessary as according to estimates the land requirement for five small group homes for 10– 15 residents each of 1,000 square yards per unit would be just one acre. The city has quite a few vacant plots in different sectors, which are designated for public use as per the Chandigarh Master Plan. These have been lying unused for the last 50 years. The administration needs to move fast. Old parents suffering from several ailments during the Covid pandemic no longer have the time for land allocation, budgetary provisions, policy formulation, building and then starting the group homes. Amitava Das, ChandigarhChandigarh has a large population of retired personnel. Being confined indoors because of the pandemic situation and having no social contact can have a negative effect on the elderly. This results in mental stress and other problems. There are numerous instances of children unable to care for their elders. One, therefore, needs an old age home in the city, with facilities for mental healthcare. HS Puri, ChandigarhI as well as my sister are married and settled in the US. Our parents live in Chandigarh with our 40-year-old sister who has mental health issues. She is stable and can function normally with some help from mental health professionals, community and our parents, who are 79 and 76 years old. Both are cancer survivors. My father has an advanced form of cancer and is currently on heavy medication. My mother also has several old age related issues. The entire family worries about my sister. I feel that the UT administration should understand the situation of families like us. We do not need any financial subsidy from the government and will be happy to pay the full monthly living and treatment expenses. What we do need is a physical setup conducive to good quality living within the city. I will also volunteer to raise money for residents who happen to be poor and can’t afford to pay.Roma Batra, USAThe Chandigarh administration should consider setting up care homes at the earliest as there are a number of families requiring urgent help. Staff for the homes, including psychiatrists, social workers and clinical psychologists can be hired from among students graduating from the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32. Suitable, unused houses in the city should be identified and converted into group homes. Everything depends upon how important the problem is for the authorities. Gurpreet Singh, ChandigarhThere are many elderly persons who suffer from depression and anxiety as their families do not care for them. Living in care homes with others like them and enjoying facilities and entertainment options will definitely bring them happiness. These facilities should be run under government supervision for better maintenance. Youngsters and others from the city can also volunteer to provide services here and help the inmates. Sumindar Kaur Saini, MohaliAddressing the needs of marginalised groups and ensuring their well being reflects a supportive social structure, which addresses everyone’s needs when it comes to providing equity and accessibility. Adults having mental health problems need to be taken care of. The needs of such individuals can be ascertained by the caregivers and the administration. Dr Guneet Singh Assi, ChandigarhAdults with mental disorders need round-the-clock care and support, which can be very taxing for a caregiver such as an elderly parent. Often, people suffering from Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, obsessive compulsive disorders etc go missing from home and keep wandering around as they are not able to recognise the dangers of the outside world. Sadly, in many such cases they are unable to tell their names and addresses to people wanting to help them. Families too often abandon people with mental health issues. To provide care to such people the UT must get medically equipped sheltered homes with trained caregivers to provide a happy and healthy environment to them.Sangita Rai, PanchkulaThe administration should provide spacious, clean, comfortable and assisted living for a collective family (connected by pain) of people with various mental health challenges and ensure they live a dignified life. Every kind of assistance should be provided to the inmates to help them with day to day living, medical treatment, health and wellness programmes and also recreational facilities like sports, indoor games, movies and books. A spacious home with facilities for exercising should be available and trained paramedics, psychiatrists and experts in psychosocial behaviour should be on call. Compassion and empathy without judgement should be available in abundance in such homes.AartiChandigarh is home to more than 13% population above the age of 18 years of age that’s suffering from various mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, OCD and stress. However, the problem is that this percentage is likely to be higher considering the fact that there is no proper system of diagnosing mental health issues, especially among the lower strata of the population. Whatever care homes are available in the UT are already overwhelmed due the recent Covid-19 pandemic as many more people are being gripped by depression and other socio-psychological illnesses. The UT administration should take the help of professional agencies in running the existing care homes and also increase the capacity to accommodate more persons with different types of mental health issues.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhUT adviser Manoj Parida has done well to identify the building of Cheshire Home in Sector 21 for setting up a group care home and DART building in Sector 32 as half-way home for the mentally challenged. These facilities can be looked after, initially, through a public-private partnership with NGOs and subsequently handed over to them. An advisory committee comprising eminent citizens and representatives of the stakeholders should also be constituted to supervise all work. Local citizens can organise a volunteer corps to look after the needs of the inmates. Local businesses can be co-opted to donate money for operations of the homes. People associated with Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and ASHA can go to the homes to teach inmates. Streamlining the provision of health insurance and income for the occupants through government legislation will also lessen the financial burden on such homes.Lt Col GS Bedi (retd)I am the caretaker of an adult woman with mental health issues. I feel the city should have a home where persons with mental illness and intellectual disability can be housed on campus along with all the support staff such as social workers and counsellors. We must take into consideration the different care needs of the residents as also their paying capacity. There should be various categories of assisted living facilities taking into account the variation in socio-economic capacities of families. A team of mental health professionals from prominent hospitals in the city and social workers/ NGOs can be formed to chalk out a management plan. Funds can be raised through individual donations and CSR.Balvir Kaur Grewal, ChandigarhSomething can be done along the lines of the Arche communities, “a worldwide federation of people, with and without learning disabilities, working together for a world where all belong.” It started in 1964 in France, when the founder welcomed in his home two men with disabilities, and has grown into a network of 153 communities, spread over 38 countries and five continents. It’s not a political or religious movement and even less a commercial undertaking. Parents-carers, young volunteers with an ideal, retired nurses or social workers help the sick and weak. Forty to 50 members live together and share everything: Chores, meals, production of objects in workshops. There’s no separation between patients and medical staff; everybody helps according to his capacity and accepts the other as he is, and if love is patience, it must abound in these homes. Eric ArnaudI am the mother of a 50-year-old son with mental health challenges who is totally dependent on me and my husband. We are worried about his future. Last year I was one of the signatories in the list of 70 persons given to the UT administrator for assisted living care homes in the city. We have been requesting the administration to consider accommodating us in Indira Holiday Home. These challenged adults who have suffered so much in life. They need help and succour in their middle and old age.Pammi Lamba, ChandigarhThere is definitely a need for a home for those facing mental and emotional challenges. As humans we express our dharma or creed of belief though opportunities of support for the vulnerable. Many places in Chandigarh are under utilised and face neglect. There are several community centres, some designated as banquet halls, areas demarcated for commercial activity that have not been used, and several places that are open if a new building is to be set up. The administration should look at more options for setting up a home. Kamal Malhi, ChandigarhAs a modern, post-Independence city, Chandigarh is uniquely placed to move beyond individual silos and uphold the spirit of healthy community living. It has been blessed with adequate open spaces and best of civic amenities to accommodate those with special needs. The administration can rope in non-profit organisations such as YMCA and Servants of the People Society which have large premises comprising buildings and lawns. Manu MoudgilThe population of seniors living by themselves is increasing in the city. The hospitals send you home after surgery. For the rehabilitation period a person needs assisted living. In the absence of such facilities (which people are happily willing to pay for), one is left at the mercy of domestic helpers and semi-trained attendants, even give them access to their homes. If we have medium-term rehabilitation facilities for adults, and long-term assisted living for early dementia patients, even daycare, people can enjoy a better quality of life and safety for much longer and their families can get some relief. The administration should focus on recruitment, training, and management of the staff for a network of such facilities across the city, not just one.Unita Vasishta, ChandigarhA state-of-the-art facility should be developed where a lot hands-on work/craft etc should be developed so these adults can enrol in various different vocations as per their choice. Other basic requirements are: Structured schedule, which includes self-care and house maintenance activities at fixed times of the day, leisure time utilisation and money management. A homely atmosphere to make the residents feel comfortable is essential. Residents can also do domestic chores if they want. There should be medication compliance, relapse prevention and crisis management. Emphasis should also be laid on improvement of mental and physical health. Activities such as gardening, reading, writing, nature walks and yoga should be encouraged. Recreational activities such as sports, films, music and group excursions should be organised.Gagan (Liza) Chawla If today a five star hotel is to be built, the administration will have enough space for it even at the cost of green belts, but for care homes the authorities will come up with a hundred and one excuses. Adults with mental problems too have the right to live. If there is no one left to take care of them, then it is the duty of the government to look after them. When officials can spend lakhs of rupees on renovation of their government bungalows then why can’t they spare funds for the welfare of persons with mental problems and other senior citizens?Inderjit Singh Sidhu, MohaliA person with mental challenges could have other co-morbidities too and might get violent or become unmanageable. To rehabilitate such a person is a real need. However, starting the process to remove physically challenged persons to accommodate the mentally challenged (as happening in a home in the city) shows the callous and limited thinking of the administration and social welfare department. And then to label the national and international wheel chair cricketers as “encroachers” – the very same people who have been fending for themselves for years with the help of NGOs and donors is a reflection of the state’s attitude toward special ability.

The family collaborated with Dr Vivek Gautam, whose father was also an officer in the Indian Army, to set up the hospital. Captain Kalia’s father, NK Kalia, said the hospital will cater to the needs of villages within a radius of 10-12 kilometers of the Chamunda Shrine.People in the area have to go to Palampur, Dharmshala, Kangra or Tanda Medical College in case of an emergency. The hospital aims to provide affordable treatment at par with quality standards. The medical team will be headed by Dr Vivek Gautam.“Initially, the out patient department (OPD) and facilities such as general and laparoscopic surgery and urology OPD, along with radiology services, including ultrasound and x-ray, have been made functional. A basic well-equipped medium-level laboratory and 24-hour emergency services are also available,” said NK KaliaTo provide holistic care and promote the traditional and scientific Indian system of medicine, a full-fledged ayurveda and panchkarma unit has also been set up. There are 18 inpatient beds and inclusive special private Rooms for post-operative care.Gradually, more services will be added with focus on orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics, apart from upgrading the diagnostic facilities such as, CT Scan and mammography. The number of in-patient beds will also be increased, he said, adding that they intended to add super-specialty services such as neurosurgery and cardiology at the later stages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kargil-war-hero-s-kin-set-up-hospital-in-his-memory/story-qfStGEhYJKznW9HbmEw9hK.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Is Covid-19 pandemic over, Shiv Sena asks after Bihar poll date announcement||Shiv Sena parliamentarian and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut questioned the Election Commission’s (EC) decision to announce the dates for the Bihar Assembly elections amid the Covid-19 outbreak. On Friday afternoon, EC announced that the Bihar polls will be held in three phases – on October 28, November 3 and November 7 – and the counting of the votes will take place on November 10. He also alleged that the Centre and the Bihar government “directed” and “wrote the script” of politicising the Sushant Singh Rajput death case to use it in Bihar election. “The dates of elections are announced for a state like Bihar. So does it mean that the coronavirus [pandemic] has ended? If the rulers there and the EC think that coronavirus has ended and have thus announced the election dates, then they should tell so to everybody. I think this is the government’s decision; they will say that the EC is an independent body and elections will happen,” Raut told reporters on Friday. The Sena MP said that the country is facing an “unprecedented” situation owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and needs help from the government, not “black [indelible] ink on their fingers.” He added that if the decision to hold election during the Covid-19 outbreak was taken to get a government within a stipulated time, then the President’s Rule should have been imposed, like it was done in Maharashtra in 2019. “I do not think it is a hurried announcement, but they should have thought if the situation is suitable for elections,” said the senior party leader. When he was asked if the Sushant Singh Rajput case will be used by Bihar’s ruling partners, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (United) in their campaign, Raut said that the coalition does not have issues of development to campaign on and therefore they will use the actor’s death. “The manner in which the Centre and the state government dragged the Sushant Singh Rajput case and practiced politics over it, the case will definitely be an election issue. Janata Dal (United) has already printed posters of Sushant Singh Rajput for campaigning. It is important to be seen that this is done because they do not have anything to say on development and good governance. Therefore, forcibly such issues are being used,” he said, adding that there is a sense of “anger” against the Nitish Kumar government. “In Bihar, the main political party is Lalu [Prasad] Yadav’s (Rashtriya Janata Dal). He is serving a sentence and is currently at a hospital for treatment. Congress party does not have a lot of presence in the state. In this scenario, will Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal United and BJP contest one-sided elections? Nitish Kumar has been the CM (chief minister) for 24 years now and there is sense of anger against his government, which we know as anti-incumbency. But these things depend on how effectively the Opposition party stands against them in the election,” he said. Shiv Sena is expected to field a candidate in the Bihar polls and a decision on it will be made by Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray by Saturday, Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-coronavirus-pandemic-over-shiv-sena-asks-after-bihar-poll-date-announcement/story-t6mqwCEnnecg2PikbiP3oM.html

The agency is probing into the drug angle related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14. Singh was questioned for around four hours, while Prakash was at the NCB office for seven hours. Singh’s name cropped up during the interrogation of actor Rhea Chakraborty. Prakash was summoned after her name came up during the questioning of Rajput’s talent manager Jaya Saha, on the basis of chats submitted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which was probing the financial angle in the 34-year-old actor’s death.NCB deputy director KPS Malhotra said, “Singh and Prakash joined the investigation on Friday. NCB has summoned Prakash again for questioning again on Saturday”. Meanwhile, film executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad was taken for questioning to the agency’s office. Till the time of going to press, the agency had not concluded the questioning of Prasad and assistant director Anubhav Chopra. Prasad and Chopra’s name came up during the interrogation of Powai hotelier Ankush Arneja, an alleged drug peddler, who was arrested by NCB on September 13. NCB had recovered 42 grams of hashish and cash ₹1.12 lakh from his Powai home. Arneja is accused of selling drugs to high-profile individuals.One of the chats found by NCB revealed that Saha, Prakash and Padukone had allegedly discussed about procuring drugs, said officers. Padukone has been summoned for investigation on Saturday, added an officer. Actors Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan will also join the investigation on Saturday after their names cropped up in Chakraborty’s statements, the officer added. Meanwhile, WhatsApp has clarified on the “chats” being leaked for investigations and doing the rounds on social media and news channels.“WhatsApp protects your messages with end-to-end encryption so that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between can access it, not even WhatsApp. It’s important to remember that people sign up on WhatsApp using only a phone number, and WhatsApp doesn’t have access to your message content. WhatsApp follows guidance provided by operating system manufacturers for on-device storage and we encourage people to take advantage of all the security features provided by operating systems such as strong passwords or biometric IDs to prevent third parties from accessing content stored on the device,” said a WhatsApp spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ncb-quizzes-rakul-preet-singh-and-deepika-s-manager-in-mumbai/story-jfPISyvPnlffnvUJjenXeI.html

Parents said they were approached by Pride Group, a private company that claimed to have tied up with the state government and promised to pay 50% of the fees on the behalf of parents. “The company said they would give us discounts depending on the fee that our school charged. In return, we were asked to pay ₹2,500 to the personal account of one of their heads,” said the parent of a Vile Parle-based school. Parents were also asked to submit several documents like the Aadhaar card, copies of their child’s school calendar, photographs, etc. Anil Sabale, deputy director of education for the Mumbai region, said the education department would give out a disclaimer on all its websites stating that it had nothing to do with this company. “We will do so after we see the complaints filed by parents. Meanwhile, we urge parents not to fall for such traps,” Sabale said. When HT contacted, Soni Shelar, a representative who had approached a few parents asked the reporter to speak to her office staff. An employee named Nazim, who identified herself as the manager of the company, said, “We do not have any recognition from the Central or state government. We are not an NGO or trust even and are only a private firm.” When asked about their funding model, Nazim said, “We have a mediator who does this work for us and parents are thus charged a processing fee.” She refused to comment when asked about the norms under which the company made such arrangements. As per the company’s website, it claims to be an “education centre in Mumbai” with its office based out of Bhendi Bazaar. As per the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2011, private unaided schools can fix their fees. While the government has set a cap on extent of fee hike, there is no such provision for private companies to tie up with the government and schools to waive off students’ fees. Even scholarships offered by the Central and state government are for students from socially and economically backward classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-based-private-firm-gives-discount-on-school-fees-vigilant-parents-raise-red-flag/story-KBZLiphhGcE6cM0ThL08eO.html

On Thursday, many such employees staged a silent protest in their respective offices.“We have not received our well-deserved salaries despite working throughout the lockdown. Many of us have EMIs to pay and bills to clear, but the government is not considering our situation. Despite making several representations, our file is still pending,” said a DIET employee.Officials from the state education department did not respond to calls and messages. A source from the state government said the delay in payments was owing to the delay in disbursal of funds from the Central government. DIET works with state governments in the area of curriculum development, teacher trainings etc. While 60% of the funding for its functioning comes from the Central government, the remaining 40% is from the state government. “Usually, the state would pool its own funds if there was a delay from the Centre. However, this time due to several decisions of the government with respect to capping of expenditures due to Covid-19 related costs, it has not done so,” said an official from the government.Most employees of DIET who are appointed through the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) said they have not heard from the government since the past two months. “A letter has gone to the government from the education department but there is no response,” added an employee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-800-diet-employees-in-maharashtra-await-salaries-since-may/story-p6BXCFrwTDLjvOXWcifIhI.html

Lamba, who is close to Sood, in his complaint, said that a person received a call from a fraudster who claimed to be Sood’s manager. The accused allegedly said if the person wanted help from Sood, he would have to deposit ₹1,700 into a bank account as processing fees. However, the fraudster stopped receiving calls after the man deposited the money, said Lamba. Sood said, “We are getting several complaints where such frauds are targeting the needy. They are taking anywhere between ₹800 to ₹10,000 in the name of helping them out. I have always been posting on my social media asking people to not believe such calls.” “I have even told these fraudsters, through my social media account, that if they are in need of money they can contact me and I will arrange a good job for them, and asked them not cheat the needy. In one such incident, a woman who was in need of an ambulance for her mother was asked to deposit ₹8,000 to ₹10,000 by someone who said that he was from my team. The woman deposited the money but did not get an ambulance, because of which her mother died. I came to know about it after the incident, and later we helped her,” said Sood. Dayanand Bangar, senior inspector from Oshiwara police station, said, “We have registered a case against the unknown person and started the investigation.” The case has been registered under section 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fraudster-uses-sonu-sood-s-name-to-cheat-actor-appeals-to-not-believe-such-calls/story-npHiymZuFLhfzqJzisPZGM.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Attendance of principals, vice-principals must till results: University of Mumbai||Days after the Maharashtra department of higher and technical education clarified that the 100% attendance rule for teaching and non-teaching staff of colleges is not compulsory, the University of Mumbai (MU) released a circular this week stating that staff involved in the upcoming examination session should be present in college as and when required. The circular dated September 22 also states that the principals and vice-principals shall be present every day from the date of commencement of exams till results of final-year (summer 2020) examination are declared.“During exams until the declaration of results, principals and vice-principals should not take leave, and teachers and other non-teaching staff involved in the exam and result process should be present at their respective institutes,” states the circular. It further reiterates the need for setting up a helpdesk at colleges to help the students solve their problems before and during the exams. “Every college will also upload sample question papers on their websites and conduct mock tests for students in order to ease them into the online examination pattern,” states the MU circular.On September 18, the state government released a government resolution (GR) asking for 100% attendance from all teaching and non-teaching staff of colleges to conduct the upcoming online exams for final-year students and ensure that results are declared in time. Teacher organisations from across the state shared their discontent with this move by the state government in view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. Following complaints by several stakeholders including colleges, the government released a clarification on September 21 stating that 100% attendance is not binding on the entire staff, and that respective colleges or universities can decide how many of the staff, especially from the examination department, need to be present in order to ensure smooth functioning of online exams for final-year students.“The latest circular only reiterates the examination process to the affiliated colleges in case of any doubts. Though colleges have informed us that the examination process is running smoothly at present,” said Vinod Patil, director, board of examinations and evaluation, MU.While online exam for students with backlogs/allowed to keep term (ATKT) start from Friday, final-year exams for fresh candidates will take place between October 1 and 17. The government has stated that results for these exams would be declared by the first week of November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/attendance-of-principals-vice-principals-must-till-results-university-of-mumbai/story-35FzEMIFopz5I5Sbie8wsL.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Final-year ATKT exam begins; some colleges face technical glitches, others postpone exams||The much-awaited online exams for backlogs/allowed to keep term (ATKT) candidates commenced on September 25 in several city colleges. While the process was smooth-sailing for several institutes, a host of institutes experienced teething troubles and technical errors which eventually pushed them to delay the examination process by a few days. A suburban college had to suddenly postpone ATKT exams on Friday after experiencing technical trouble just before the exams began. “The format of the exam on the software was not as we had originally decided, so the papers had to be reformatted. Therefore, we decided to postpone the exams by a couple of days,” said the vice-principal of the college on condition of anonymity. She added that the postponement of exam was also suggested by the institute in order to avoid any form of technical glitches once the exams begin. Some colleges also chose to use more time to train teachers and students on the new format of exams that will be conducted online, and start exams for ATKT students next week. “Online exams is new for teachers as well as students, so we want them to be thoroughly prepared for the same before the exams begin,” said Sobhana Vasudevan, principal, RA Podar College, Matunga. She added that the college is currently busy conducting mock tests in every subject for their students before the exams begin. A circular released by the University of Mumbai (MU) in September specified that colleges would conduct the exams online in multiple-choice questions (MCQ) format. Another circular has also highlighted that all exams should be conducted by October 31 while the results for the same should be announced by the first week of November. All colleges affiliated to MU have been divided under cluster/lead colleges according to their geographical location, but there has been no clarity on part of the university on the software that colleges should use in order to conduct online exams. “This has created more confusion for colleges because under the same cluster, all colleges have been asked to use the same software for their exams. In our case, we are already using a different software which the other colleges don’t want to opt for. We are still trying to work around this before we start final exams,” said a senior professor from a south Mumbai college. “Since this is the first time that an exam of this level is being held online, that too in a new format, some colleges have faced technical glitches. We are in touch with them and have found out that most of them have managed to solve the errors and hope to conduct exams smoothly henceforth,” said Vinod Patil, director, board of examinations and evaluation, MU.Patil added that the university has created 94 groups of faculty-wise colleges in order to ensure smooth functioning of the backlog exams. “Students who cannot sit for the exams due to some unavoidable or technical reasons, will be given another chance to sit for the examination,” added Patil.Members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Friday carried out a protest at MU’s Kalina campus demanding better coordination and communication between the university and all affiliated colleges in order to ensure smooth functioning of online exams.Some colleges, however, managed to conduct ATKT exams as per schedule on Friday. St Xavier’s College at Dhobi Talao conducted the exams using Google Forms and also managed to ensure proctoring during the exam through the application Zoom. “The exam was conducted successfully, and we hope to continue rest of the exams in similar format,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-atkt-exam-begins-some-colleges-face-technical-glitches-others-postpone-exams/story-7lKvmIgN7kw7wIV8YkdJ2L.html

The latest 100,000 cases came in five days, after the state had moved from 1,100,000 to 1,200,000 cases in four days — fastest rise of 100,000 infections so far — on September 20. The state also reported 416 Covid-19 fatalities on Friday, taking its toll to 34,761. According to the state health department, of the 416 deaths, 228 were from the past 48 hours, 106 are from last week and 82 from the period before last week.While the active cases in Maharashtra rose to 272,775, Friday witnessed 19,592 people recovering, taking the total number of recoveries to 992,806. The state’s recovery rate stands at 76.33%.Mumbai, meanwhile, repo-rted 1,876 fresh infections as its case count rose to 194,303, and an addition of 48 fatalities took the city’s toll to 8,706. Mumbai has 28,395 active Covid-19 cases.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who held a review meeting to assess the Covid-19 situation in Pune division and Konkan region, said easing of lockdown restrictions increased the threat of the virus spreading. Thackeray asked people to ensure they wear masks and maintain social distancing to contain the spread of Covid-19.The Konkan region, which comprises of Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, has witnessed a surge in cases and fatalities in the past month. Senior health department officials said the movement of people from hotspots to Konkan region during Ganeshotsav in August was the primary reason for the increase in cases.Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg saw a rise of 78%, 124% and 237% in cases, respectively, between August 25 and September 24. During the same period, fatalities rose by 48% in Raigad, 163% in Ratnagiri and 331% in Sindhudurg. In terms of active cases, Sindhudurg had 463 active cases on August 25, which rose by 186% to 1,324 on September 24. In Ratnagiri, the active cases rose from 1,502 to 2,736, while Raigad saw a rise from 4,872 to 7,920.“We had anticipated a rise in cases after Ganeshotsav, but so far the increase is not so much that the districts would have difficulties in managing its patients. The district administration has been told to carry out rigorous contact tracing. As the region has poor connectivity, if the spike goes out of hand, it would lead to an increase in deaths,” said a bureaucrat, who was present at the CM’s meeting.Pune division, which includes Pune, Satara and Solapur districts, too, has seen a spike in cases during the past month. Pune district witnessed a 77% rise from 155,039 infections on August 25 to 274,421 on September 24. While Satara saw a whopping 213.18% jump in cases and Solapur had a 90.54% rise. “Keeping in mind the unlock process due to which the movement of people has increased and regular activities of people have started, the transmission is expected to increase,” said Thackeray, during the meeting, adding that public campaigns are needed to make people wear masks, sanitise their hands and maintain social distance.Thackeray also directed district officials to take assistance and guidance from the Covid task force members while treating critical patients. He said the state government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign will help create a “health map” of Maharashtra and make its people fit. The campaign, which was kicked-off on September 15, aims to survey and screen households in the state to detect Covid-19 patients as well as those with comorbidities. Volunteers were compiling data of those who had been detected with the infection, those who had recovered and their post-coronavirus situation, Thackeray said. “In Konkan, 10.63 lakh families have been surveyed. In Pune, they have surveyed 182 villages and 13 municipal councils,” the CM said, adding that the campaign was being extended in Pune to include factories, housing societies and civic wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cases-past-1-300-000-in-maharashtra-fatalities-near-35-000/story-rHVoxKanajvsmdcxZSJOYO.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccine trial begins at Mumbai’s KEM Hospital today; three volunteers to be given first dose||The King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital will administer the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by the Oxford University and AstraZeneca on three volunteers on Saturday, while another 10 volunteers have been selected for the clinical trial. The other city hospital, BYL Nair, to conduct the clinical trial will begin the process from Monday.All three volunteers have been screened to rule out any underlying health issues, said KEM Hospital officials, adding that they have also undergone RT-PCR and antibody testing. “The three participants have been screened after their consent and they don’t have any comorbidity. As per randomisation, out of every four participants, one will receive placebo (false drug),” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, Dean, KEM Hospital. As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, each of the volunteers has been covered with ₹1-crore life insurance if they die owing to any side effect during the trial. Also, they have ₹50lakh for medical insurance if they develop any adverse effect from the vaccine. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said the ethics committee on Tuesday gave its nod to the hospital to start the screening of registered volunteers. After which, till Friday, 13 volunteers have been screened, of which three volunteers have been found completely fit for the clinical trials. “We will administer the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to the three volunteers on Saturday, following which they have to stay at the hospital for two hours to check if they are having any complications,” he said. Kakani said the volunteers given the vaccine dose will be checked regularly and within 29 days a second dose will be given to them. Meanwhile, 10 more people will be screened on September 26, taking the number of volunteers to 23. “We will check how they respond after the inoculation and test them for antibodies,” said Kakani.The vaccine induces a strong immune response. It provokes a T cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the coronavirus) response within 14 days of the dose, and an antibody response within 28 days. “We are screening volunteers at present. By Monday, we will start the trial and provide the first dosage at our hospital,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital. In the second week of September, both KEM and Nair Hospitals had to halt the trial process after a participant developed an adverse event in the United Kingdom (UK). Later, Drug Control General of India (DCGI) gave its nod to conduct the second and third phase of the trial. However, both civic hospitals had to get the final approval from their ethics committees before starting with the screening of volunteers.Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume, and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca partnered together to manufacture the vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-vaccine-trial-begins-at-mumbai-s-kem-hospital-today-three-volunteers-to-be-given-first-dose/story-NozpqBGBkeglJMfGVHNKgO.html
26-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s share in Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases drops to 14% from 60% in April||Even though the city has seen a surge in reported Covid-19 cases in September, Mumbai’s share in Maharashtra’s overall Covid tally is down to 14%. In terms of the state’s active cases, Mumbai constitutes only 10%. In March and April, the city’s Covid count made up the majority of the state’s active cases. As of Thursday, Mumbai has a total of 192,427 Covid-positive cases, of which 27,741 are active. The city’s recovery rate is 81%. The total number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra is 12,82,963, of which 2,74,993 are active. In September, the city has seen a surge, with 1,500 to 2,300 new cases daily. However, the city’s share in the total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in Maharashtra has dipped to 25.2%. In March and April, Mumbai contributed to over 60% of Maharashtra’s total deaths due to Covid-19. However, urban Mumbai still has a high case fatality rate due to a larger population of senior citizens and the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. While Mumbai’s share has decreased, there has been sharp rise in the number of cases reported from satellite cities like Thane, Navi Mumbai, Bhiwandi, Kalyan, and Mira Bhayander, as well as tier-two and tier-three cities in Maharashtra. Pune city, which has 11% of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases, recorded 147,634 cases as of Thursday. Thane has 34,698 total Covid-19 cases and Navi Mumbai has 37,569 cases. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation has recorded 44,094 cases, while Mira Bhayander has 18,028 cases. A senior officer with the government of Maharashtra said, “The virus came into Mumbai due to international travellers. Then strict lockdown protected other parts of the state for a bit, but with unlock plans, all transportation services have begun. In the rest of Maharashtra we are also testing more now.” Pune district has surpassed Mumbai and now comprises 21% of Maharashtra’s Covid total in terms of both active and asymptomatic cases. As of Thursday, Pune district has 274,492 cases of Covid-19, of which 60,146 are active. Nashik district has 69,099 cases in total, of which 14,748 are active. Nagpur district has 70,414 cases, of which 18,762. “The larger contributor to Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases in the month of April, May, and June was only Mumbai. Mumbai drastically crashed in September in terms of its contribution to the state. There has been a lot of localised transmission in Mumbai and Maharashtra. This is also because other cities, such as Pune beat Mumbai. Mumbai peaked earlier, and other cities are peaking now. As unlock happened, positivity rate went up, and cities like Pune took over. Once transportation is opened up, this is expected,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. According to Dr Joshi, the increased number of cases is reflective of Maharashtra rapidly scaling up testing facilities. “Though, looking at the population, we should be testing 5 lakh to 7 lakh a day, at least we have made a commitment to testing 1.5 lakh a day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-share-in-maharashtra-s-covid-19-cases-drops-to-14-from-60-in-april/story-bFyDSZVPi7fPAYYVFfvisN.html
26-09-2020||Pune||Don’t take Covid lightly, be responsible, says Ajit Pawar||Deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday cautioned people about taking the pandemic lightly and requested every resident to be responsible and use masks while stepping out of the house and follow all safety precautions amid the spike in Covid-19 cases.Pawar took a review meeting about the Covid-19 situation in the city at Council Hall.Pawar said, “Even as the virus cases are on a rise in the city and Pune district, many people are taking it lightly. The government and administration are making all efforts to increase the health care facility and it is observed that people are not following safety norms.”“It is my sincere request to all to take responsibility for themselves and their family. We are executing the programme ‘My family, My responsibility’ under which government machinery plans to cover each home in the state. Residents should co-operate with the government agencies and provide proper information,” he said.”This initiative will help in early detection of the virus and provide necessary medical aid,” he said.Pawar said that though there are fewer complaints now about patients being overcharged at private hospitals, district administration must keep a check on private hospitals charging patients.“The administration must ensure that there is no black market of medicines in the city,” he said.Pawar also instructed the administration to guide people who have been cured of the virus to take necessary measures to stay safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-take-covid-lightly-be-responsible-says-ajit-pawar/story-ZMipweVAPnOtxx6AeblRVI.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||As DDA focus shifts, private firms to gain||With the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) gradually shifting towards the role of a planner and regulator from that of a developer, the land-owning agency is likely to go slow on construction of housing projects and allow private developers to do it instead. The recent organisational restructuring proposed by DDA is an indication towards a change in its profile.While urban planners say it is a good move, they say the agency shouldn’t completely give up on developing housing, especially for the economically weaker sections, in the Capital.Though policies such as land pooling, auctioning of residential plots for group housing, etc., are a step towards encouraging private developers, senior DDA officials say it will continue to develop housing, though on a smaller scale.A senior DDA official aware of the development said, “No decision regarding not developing housing at all has been taken so far. DDA will continue to develop as per requirement. But it will definitely be less as compared to what we used to. DDA is moving towards the role of a regulator and planner.”Since its inception in 1957, DDA has been the main player to meet Delhi’s growing housing requirements. It constructed 4.25 lakh flats till last year, and another 40,000-45,000 are ready or in various stages of construction. DDA has also provided housing to lakhs of people by selling plots to individuals and group housing societies.Several residential colonies such as Alaknanda, Vasant Kunj, Dwarka Vikaspuri, Mayur Vihar, etc., came up over the years where DDA constructed flats and developed the neighbourhoods. “But we might not see DDA developing more areas such as Vasant Kunj, etc,” said Balvinder Kumar, former DDA vice-chairman and Uttar Pradesh RERA member. It was during Kumar’s tenure the land pooling policy was approved and the exercise to restructure DDA was undertaken.Kumar added, “It is important for DDA to move on from its role as a developer to regulator and planner. The land is limited and its acquisition is difficult under the present land acquisition Act. Therefore, it is important to allow private firms to develop and DDA should regulate and ensure planned development in the Capital. There was also a conflict of interest as DDA is both the developer and the regulator.”The agency has also registered a decline in demand for its flats, as the last three housing schemes received a tepid response. “This wasn’t the case before 2014. All our schemes have been a huge success. But the past few schemes have not done well. One of the main reasons is the location of these flats. A majority of flats are in Narela and in the absence of a proper transport system, there is little demand for these flats,” said a senior DDA official, requesting anonymity. DDA had received one million applications for its housing scheme in 2014 in which 25,000-odd houses were put on sale. The agency has over 10,000 flats lying vacant and another 30,000-odd flats in various stages of construction.Amit Aggarwal, who had bought a DDA flat in sector A, pocket B and C in Vasant Kunj in 1988, said the planning and quality of construction of old DDA flats is very good. “These areas are well developed and the houses are very good. But over the years, the demand has gone down as one can find a bigger flat in the NCR region at the same cost. The cost of the middle income group flats is very high. Earlier, people were keen on a DDA flat because it used to be cheaper than the market rate,” said Agarwal, a member of URJA.Experts say DDA should continue to construct housing. AK Jain, former planning commissioner, said, “DDA shouldn’t completely give up on constructing housing. They should come up with a policy to ensure private players will provide adequate EWS housing. DDA should continue to construct EWS housing.”Private developers say DDA’s monopoly was one of the reasons for the shortage of housing in Delhi. Pankaj Bajaj, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI)- National Capital Region and CMD Eldeco group, said, “DDA is making the long overdue transition from a developer to a planner. DDA’s monopoly over development in Delhi was the single biggest factor for the housing shortage and the mushrooming of unauthorised colonies in the last five decades. It led to the rise of Gurugram and Noida, as in the absence of supply in Delhi, development moved to these suburbs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-dda-focus-shifts-private-firms-to-gain/story-Kr2QywVB8ZIq0iYguyK34I.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||30% patients in Delhi hospitals in ICUs, says govt data||One of every three Covid-19 patients admitted in a Delhi hospital was in intensive care unit (ICU), data provided by the Delhi government, which HT has seen, said.The data, which was submitted by the health department to minister Satyendar Jain’s office on Tuesday (September 22), said 7,242 Covid patients were admitted in hospitals across the city as on that date, of which 2,173 (30.02%) were in ICUs and 278 on ventilator support.Currently, Delhi has around 15,800 Covid beds and around 2,980 ICU beds – of which 1,319 have ventilator facilities, the government’s hospital beds database showed. As on Friday, 6,935 of the total beds and 2,115 of ICU beds were occupied.On Friday, 3,827 new Covid cases were recorded in Delhi.The data submitted to Jain’s office further said that one out of every four general as well as ICU beds in the city was occupied by a patient who was not from Delhi.Of the 7,242 beds occupied as on September 22, at least 1,756 were booked by people from other states. Similarly, 556 of the 2,173 occupied ICU beds and 99 of the 278 occupied ventilator beds as on September 22 accommodated people from other states, the data showed.Delhi government spokespersons refused to comment on the matter.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital said, “ICU beds in Delhi have higher occupancy rates because hospitals are largely catering to patients with severe symptoms. However, people from other states coming to Delhi for better treatment is a routine affair. The government should rather look at the present pandemic as a wake-up call and increase ICU beds and ventilator support facilities in hospitals.” In June, the Delhi government had issued directions suggesting that covid-19 beds in Delhi government hospitals and those in private hospitals in the Capital should be reserved for patients who reside in Delhi. The order, however, was later struck down by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.Delhi has witnessed a second spike in Covid cases since mid-August, which subsequently also triggered an increase in the rate of occupancy of hospital beds.Before the resurgence of cases, the seven-day average of daily cases in the Capital peaked at 3,446 on June 26 before falling to 983 on August 4. In the last seven days, Delhi has seen an average of more than 3,700 new cases surfacing every day.As on August 4, the city had 13,578 total hospital beds, of which 21.76% (2,954) beds were occupied as against the current occupancy rate of 43.89% (6,935 out of 15,800 as on Friday), government data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/30-patients-in-delhi-hospitals-in-icus-says-govt-data/story-A8RIYnam1l1QpgCHkOk3JI.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||Kasturba Gandhi nursing staff protest for 12th day||The agitation by the nursing staff of North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Kasturba Hospital — to demand pending salaries — entered into its 12th day on Friday, with over 100 staffers sitting under shade within the hospital premises to register a silent protest.The nursing staff have been abstaining from work for two hours daily since September 14 to demand pending salaries, which they claim have been due since June this year. Earlier this week, the nursing staff were joined by paramedics and sanitation staff in their agitation. “We last got paid in May. Many people have taken loans from moneylenders to pay the education fees of their children or to clear their EMIs. In so many months, we haven’t got a single assurance from either the administration or the political wing. How long can we survive like this?” said BL Sharma, president, Nursing Staff Union, Kasturba Hospital. Saroj Bala, a senior nursing staff, working at the hospital for the last 15 years said that this is the first time — and that too in the middle of a raging pandemic — that the staff has not been paid for so long. “Many people have gone into depression, as they are finding it difficult to make ends meet. We sit in protest for just two hours so that patients do not have to suffer,s,” said Bala. Earlier in July, the hospital staff had called a strike over delay in payment of salaries and later called it off after the civic body assured that their dues will be cleared soon. In May, the doctors too had protested the non-payment of salaries and had approached the Delhi High Court on the same after which their salaries were paid till June. Salaries of the sanitation workers too were last paid in June. The 450-bed Kasturba Hospital is a maternity and child specialty hospital of the North corporation located near Jama Masjid.Contacted, North corporation mayor Jai Prakash admitted that there was a delay in payment of dues and he had called a meeting with the agitating staff on Monday.“I will ask them for some more time to resolve the problem. I have already approached the Central government to help us with this situation. Also we have requested Delhi government for disbursal of funds to pay the salary of staff . We will find a solution to this problem soon,” said Prakash.He added that the Delhi government has to release funds to the tune of Rs 1200 crore taht is due to the civic body, which has been pending for long. “At present, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the finances of the corporation have been drastically hit and in absence of funds being released by the Delhi government, it has become difficult to pay off the salaries of employees,” he said, adding, that the corporation needs at least Rs 350 crore to pay its 58,000 employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kasturba-gandhi-nursing-staff-protest-for-12th-day/story-IWEUoDdpD4kEgawwo4qTWJ.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||Hundreds rendered homeless as DDA demolishes slum near Dhobi Ghat in Delhi||Hundreds of people living in Jamia Nagar’s Dhobi Ghat slum cluster lost their homes to a demolition drive by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Thursday.Residents said around 50 to 70 huts were demolished. Senior DDA officials said there are around 200 temporary structures on DDA land and Thursday’s drive helped free up 2.5 acres. Nazmi Begum, 26, a widow and mother of two young boys, Friday said the demolition drive was carried out without giving residents time to even remove their money and documents from the tenements.“I pleaded with officials to at least let me take my documents and my savings of around ₹2,000. They did not heed our pleas. Women police officers hit us when we tried to raise our voice. At least four of us were detained as well,” Begum, who has a bruise at the corner of her right eye, said.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said the demolition was an incident-free process.“Everyone was informed in advance and the drive went smoothly. There was no detention or any manhandling as reported by some slum residents,” Meena said.“When we went back to take stock of our belongings, I realised that my money had been stolen and now I don’t even have money to buy food or go back to our village in Bihar. I have no idea how I’ll feed my children because I can’t leave them in the open while I go to work during this pandemic,” she said.Sitting atop the rubble of her house with her five-month-old son, Sajda Parween, 22, questioned the decision to raze the houses during the pandemic. “The government asked us not to step out of our home to restrict the spread of Covid-19 and then they demolished our houses. Where do we go? All our savings are exhausted after the lockdown and we don’t have money to even return to our village or rent a place,” she said, adding that they slept in the open on Thursday night and had no idea how long they would be able to continue like this. On Friday, residents managed to repair some of the broken cots and arranged makeshift structures near their razed homes to make do till they found a place they could go to.Rehan Khan, 38, a daily wage earner, said, “There was no work for the past five months and we had just started earning a little. How can we rent homes when we don’t have the money?”Other residents also alleged that they were not given time to collect their belongings. Fifty-year-old Iqrar Hussain was inside his house when it was demolished. “My wife and daughters kept saying that I was inside and they should stop till I came out. But they continued anyway. The almirah and a mirror in our room fell on me injuring me,” he said, pointing towards his bandaged hand and foot.DDA said the demolition drive was necessary to remove encroachments from the Yamuna floodplains and that it was done on the directions of the National Green Tribunal. “The DDA has carried out the demolition to remove encroachments in the form of jhuggis on the Yamuna floodplain at Dhobi Ghat. Approximately, 2.5 acres were freed up after the drive. This land is owned by the DDA. The encroachers made jhuggis on government land over the past few months in spite of instructions displayed at the site, prohibiting them from doing so,” a DDA official, on condition of anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hundreds-rendered-homeless-as-dda-demolishes-slum-near-dhobi-ghat/story-MOxD1WgCBU98cMZLv2sBQP.html

CITCO operated a similar guest house in Chandigarh on behalf of the administration, where an agreement for defraying the expenses was available,” observed the CAG.“In view of financial constraints and declining profitability faced by CITCO, it took up the matter with UT administration for reimbursement of the expenditure only in February 2014, but to no avail, in the absence of any agreement or even an understanding,” reads the report.The audit further noted that the administration had agreed (February 1995) for a grant of ₹50,000 per month to CITCO for subsidising the eatables served in the canteen.However, the administration has neither released the subsidy of Rs 50,000 per month to CITCO nor did CITCO made a formal claim for the same, which amounted to Rs 1.38 crore as on March 2018.“In the absence of any agreement with the UT administration, expenditure incurred by CITCO on these two establishments, to the tune of Rs 9.79 crore till March 2018 is irregular,” notes CAG report.The management replied (August 2018) to CAG objections that these activities were taken up as ‘a social function on non-commercial basis’. It added that the issue of reimbursement of expenses with the administration has also been followed up periodically.The administration replied (August 2019) that a meeting was held on July 29, 2019, to discuss the issue of reimbursement of expenses in running the canteen and it was decided that CITCO and the hospitality department will send a proposal to the finance department, which is still awaited from CITCO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/citco-incurred-8-27-crore-loss-for-running-canteen-at-ut-secretariat-reveals-cag-report/story-wAdJhY7ve3bh6WdwQFtP2J.html
26-09-2020||Delhi||Partially clothed body of woman found stuffed in bed box in Delhi’s Chhawla||The semi-naked body of a 26-year-old woman, an employee of a multinational company in Gurugram, was found stuffed in a bed box at a house in Chhawla on Friday morning. Police said the house where the body was found is rented out to a 27-year-old man from Jind, Haryana, who is currently on the run. A search is on for the man, who is the prime suspect in the case, senior officers said.The possibility of the woman being sexual assaulted before the murder has not been ruled out and, hence, her identity has been withheld, police said.Police said the woman hailed from Jharkhand and worked in Gurugram. The murder came to fore on Friday morning when neighbours noticed a foul smell from the house and reported the matter to the police around 9.30am. A police team arrived at the house, broke open the main door and found the semi-decomposed body stuffed inside a bed box in one of the rooms.“A crime and forensics team was called to the spot. It seems that she was killed two days ago. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the house was rented to a 27-year-old man, who also works with a private company in Gurugram. When we tried to reach out to the man, he couldn’t be located. It looks like he is on the run and he is our prime suspect as of now,” an officer, who wished not to be named, said. Police said the woman’s family has been informed and her body has been sent for a post-mortem examination. Clothes on the upper part of the body were missing. The autopsy report will be able to ascertain whether she was sexually assaulted before being killed. Since the body was decomposed, no visible injury mark could be spotted on the body, police said.Locals and neighbours told police that the woman used to often visit the man who lived there. “It was, however, not clear if they were friends or relatives. The woman also lived nearby at a rented accommodation. Her family members have been contacted to find out more details,” the officer quoted above said.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said multiple teams have been formed to track the man. “Call detail records of the woman are being checked to see whom was she in contact with until two days ago. A case of murder has been registered and raids are on to nab the suspect,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/partially-clothed-body-of-woman-found-stuffed-in-bed-box-in-delhi-s-chhawla/story-4cbqvzCjefAF0awjKd5r6L.html
26-09-2020||City||Ludhiana shopkeepers down shutters in solidarity with farmers||The bandh call by farmers protesting the Centre’s three contentious legislations earned a mixed response in the major retail markets here as quite a few shops opened on Friday.Even so, it was far from business as usual with patrons staying indoors while the agitated farmers claimed the city streets.Towards the afternoon, as farm unions marched past Chaura Bazaar, Model Town, Dugri and Ghumar Mandi,where most shops were open early in the day, these markets started to look more deserted. Traders stated that slight tension was witnessed at these markets when protesters asked them to down their shutters, but they opened their shops again in the evening.While wholesale garment stores, including those in Akalgarh and AC markets, were closed the whole day, majority of the shops on Gill Road too remained shut in support of the farmers.Other shopkeepers who had to close down said they did it on the request of the farmers and no scuffle was reported over the same.One of the shopkeepers in Ghumar mandi market, Taranjit Singh, said, “Retailers followed the normal routine and opened their shops in the morning. But they had to close down around 2pm after protesting farm union members came by and asked to keep the market shut to avoid any untoward incidents. Later in the evening, however, a section of the traders again opened their stores.”Similar scenes were witnessed in the Model Town area.Amarjit Singh, the president of Model Town market body, said, “Traders had to shut shops after the members of farmers’ bodies came to the market and requested to do so. We support the farmers, but shopkeepers too need to earn a living in these tough financial times.”However, shopkeepers at AC and Akalgarh markets showed solidarity with the ongoing farm bills protest by keeping their shutters down for the day. Gurcharan Singh and Manpreet Singh Bunti, the heads of respective market associations, said shops remained closed in their trading domain as a mark of support to the farmers.As per Model Town SHO Amritpal Singh and Division 8 SHO Jarnail Singh, no police complaints were reported from shopkeepers who were asked to close their stores by farm unions.Low footfall adds to traders’ woes The markets which opened on Friday wore a deserted look with city residents staying indoors amid the farmers’ protest on Friday. Shopkeepers rued that they were already reeling under losses and the protests further decreased the customer footfall.President of Chaura Bazar shopkeepers’ association, Parampal Singh, said, “The markets are already witnessing low footfall due to the ongoing pandemic and shopkeepers on Friday received only 5-10 percent response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mixed-response-to-bandh-call-in-ludhiana-markets-as-some-shops-open/story-AkTLEg5fdVXMWGS5rMR8jP.html

He reviewed the underground and elevated corridor works before taking a trial metro ride. The Pune guardian minister began the metro review work by arriving at the site near Pune railway station at 6 am. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maharashtra Metro Rail Metro Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) was present along with Pawar to brief the progress of the project. Pawar assured officials that the metro plan would get enough funding. “As finance minister, I would ensure that the metro project gets adequate funds to complete it as early as possible. The work will speed up as labourers from other states will join the project with easing of lockdown restrictions.” The minister visited the metro tunnel work at Shivajinagar College campus. The metro underground line runs from Shivajinagar to Swargate or about 8.2 kilometres and includes 5 stations. About 1.4 kilometre of the stretch is complete. Dixit said, “About 43 per cent work of Pune metro has been completed. Underground work is in progress. Pawar visited the tunnel work site and was updated about the plan’s progress carried out with the help of gigantic tunnel boring machine. He also reviewed the progress of multi-modal hub project at Swargate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pawar-inspects-underground-metro-work-in-pune/story-Nk5JcNntgDrs1WeaEz8ixM.html
26-09-2020||Pune||Pune doc tests +ve again, 3 months after first infection; samples at NIV for virus genome sequencing||A resident doctor at the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital has tested positive for Covid-19 “a second time” in a three-month period, according to the hospital administration. The practising doctor had tested negative for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, twice, after his first infection, the hospital said. The doctor’s samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for a genome sequencing and antibodies test. Dr Parikshit Prayag, the consulting doctor for Covid-19 at Deenanath Mangeshkar, said, “The doctor had tested positive in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, on June 12 through the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. During discharge on June 22, he was tested again and he was negative. The test was repeated 24 hours later, and he tested negative again. All these tests were RT-PCR. After that, the doctor continued his work. However, a few days ago, the doctor felt uneasy and complained of body ache. We tested him through an antigen test on Friday and he tested positive for the infection.” Dr Prayag added: “We have had patients complain about Covid-19 like symptoms even after recovery and they do test positive again, even weeks later, but these have never tested negative for the infection. In this case, however, the patient tested negative twice through RT-PCR, which is the highest standard of testing and is known for its accuracy.”Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman of the state technical committee on communicable diseases, said, “If the doctor has tested negative twice in an RT-PCR and then tests positive again, it seems like a possible case of Covid-19 reinfection. There have been a few cases wherein the patient has tested positive twice, however, it is yet to be known if it is truly a reinfection, or a relapse, or just the shredding of the dead virus. Since this virus is completely new there is very limited information available. We do not even know how long the antibodies stay in the person’s system once they have recovered from the virus. In this case, the person tested negative twice in an RT-PCR which is considered the gold standard for testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-doc-tests-ve-again-3-months-after-first-infection-samples-at-niv-for-virus-genome-sequencing/story-tG4KjB4bkXnMYJydSrZLJN.html

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is executing the project even as it falls within PMC limits.NHAI project director SD Chitnis, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, defence officials and other officers were present at the meeting.According to officials, work on the flyover project is getting delayed due to land acquisition issues.Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The Maharashtra government had decided to provide a funding of ₹184 crore for the project giving it the status of a special plan. PMC was to take up the flyover plan, but union minister Nitin Gadkari approved funds for the project.”Mohol said of the ₹184 crore allocated by the state, PMC has received ₹134 crore. “I have appealed to Ajit Pawar to release the remaining ₹50 crore as it will help in the completion of the project,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pawar-directs-officials-to-put-chandani-chowk-flyover-work-on-top-gear/story-dsJFwESamilH2tRPSjmt8L.html
26-09-2020||World||Trump to name Amy Coney Barrett to US Supreme Court: Report||US President Donald Trump is set to unveil his Supreme Court nominee on Saturday, barely five weeks out from the November 3 presidential election, with US media reporting that he has chosen conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett for the job.If the 48-year-old law professor is indeed nominated and confirmed, her lifetime appointment would consolidate a conservative majority in the country’s top court, possibly for decades to come.Citing sources close to the process, media outlets including The New York Times and CNN said Trump would put forward the judge, who is considered hostile to abortion rights, to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a progressive icon who died on September 18.“We are going to be announcing somebody great,” the US president said in Virginia on a whirlwind three-state campaign tour Friday.Trump did not name his nominee, but he has previously called Barrett “outstanding.”An official announcement is expected at 5 pm (2100 GMT) Saturday.The subject is certain to feature prominently on Tuesday, when Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden hold their first of three presidential debates.‘Nothing short of outrageous’Democrats including Biden have demanded that Republicans delay replacing Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights, until after the election.“Considering the fact that this Supreme Court nominee may serve on the court for 30 years, it is nothing short of outrageous that they want to approve her in fewer than 30 days,” Senator Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip, told CNN on Saturday.Barrett would be the youngest justice on the court. A majority of Americans -- by 57 to 38 percent -- oppose the push for confirmation before the election, according to a new Washington Post/ABC poll.But leaders of the Republican majority in the Senate, which is tasked with confirming Supreme Court nominees, said they expect a vote either before the election or, at latest, during the ensuing “lame duck” session before the inauguration of the next president in January.“We will certainly do that this year,” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has said.Liberal groups push backIf Barrett is confirmed, the Supreme Court would have a 6-3 conservative majority as it faces issues as divisive as abortion, gun rights and healthcare. Barrett was first named to the bench in 2017. A deeply conservative Catholic and mother of seven -- she would be the high court’s sixth Catholic -- Barrett is considered antagonistic to abortion rights, a key issue for many Republicans.Liberal groups strongly oppose Trump’s push to rush through a conservative appointment.“We know whoever this president puts forward will be an offense to Justice Ginsburg’s legacy and her fight to ensure that women are treated fairly,” Planned Parenthood president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement, adding that a Trump appointee would likely target both abortion rights and the healthcare program known as Obamacare. “We will fight with everything we have to stop any Supreme Court confirmation before the inauguration,” she said.The American Civil Liberties Union also urged the Senate to postpone action until after the election.Democratic leaders have vowed to do everything possible to prevent a confirmation vote before the election, but the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate leaves them with few options.A full benchFor Trump, nominating a conservative justice at this point is a way to fire up his base heading into November’s election.Biden has strongly criticized the Republicans’ plans for a quick vote and appealed to senators not to act before the election. On Friday, the former vice president traveled from his home in Delaware to Washington for a solemn ceremony in the US Capitol paying tribute to Ginsburg.In a sign of the raw political feelings, Trump was booed by a crowd when he visited the Supreme Court on Thursday to pay respects to Ginsburg.Trump has twice refused this week to clearly guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, evoking outrage from Democrats and seemingly increasing odds of a tense legal standoff.Republican leaders have said that if the fate of a disputed election rests with the Supreme Court -- and Trump has warned without evidence that illegal mail-in ballots could “rig” the outcome -- a full bench of judges will be needed to prevent a deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-name-amy-coney-barrett-to-us-supreme-court-report/story-ssEzM3yg8UrUTLUQgjE6ML.html
26-09-2020||World||US elections 2020: How Donald Trump, Joe Biden are preparing for first presidential debate||Ahead of the first debate-stage matchup between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, each campaign is promising a stark contrast in policy, personality and preparation.Trump has decided to skip any formal preparation. And while Biden’s team believes the significance of the debate may be exaggerated, the Democratic nominee has been aggressively preparing to take on the president.Biden’s campaign has been holding mock debate sessions featuring Bob Bauer, a senior Biden adviser and former White House general counsel, playing the role of Trump, according to a person with direct knowledge of the preparations granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Bauer has not actually donned a Trump costume in line with Trump stand-ins from previous years, but he is representing his style and expected strategy.“I’m sure the president will throw everything he can at (Biden). My guess is that they’re preparing for that -- bombarding him with insults and weird digressions,” said Jay Carney, a former aide to Biden and President Barack Obama.“I think it’s an important moment — I think it’s really important for President Trump, because the direction of this election has been pretty stable for a long time now, and he needs to shake it up as any candidate would who’s behind,” Carney added. “The question is, can that work?”Trump and Biden are scheduled to meet on the debate stage for the first time Tuesday night at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. The 90-minute event moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace is the first of three scheduled presidential debates. Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, will also debate in October.For some, the debates represent the most important moments in the 2020 campaign’s closing days, a rare opportunity for millions of voters to compare the candidates’ policies and personalities side-by-side on prime-time television. Trump has been trailing Biden in the polls for the entire year, a reality that gives the president an urgent incentive to change the direction of the contest on national television if he can.Others, including those close to Biden’s campaign, do not expect the debates to fundamentally change the race no matter what happens, given voters’ daily struggles with the pandemic and the economy. They also point to high-profile debates in past elections thought to be game-changing moments at the time but that ultimately had little lasting effect.Those with knowledge of Biden’s preparations suggest he will not take the fight to Trump if he can avoid it. But on Saturday, at least, he was on the attack when he discussed his strategy on MSNBC.“I’m prepared to go out and make my case as to why I think he’s failed and why I think the answers I have to proceed will help the American people, the American economy and make us safer internationally,” Biden said, arguing that Trump won’t persuade voters with broadsides because “the people know the president is a liar.”He said he doesn’t expect Trump to articulate a detailed vision for a second term.“He doesn’t know how to debate the facts, because he’s not that smart,” Biden continued. “He doesn’t know that many facts. He doesn’t know much about foreign policy. He doesn’t know much about domestic policy. He doesn’t know much about the detail.”While Biden has said he will try to be a fact checker of sorts on stage, the Democrat is being advised to avoid direct confrontations and instead redirect the conversation to more familiar campaign themes of unity and issues that matter most to voters: the economy, health care and the pandemic.“Arguing over facts, litigating whether what he’s saying is accurate, that is not winning to Biden,” said Jen Psaki, a former Obama aide who is close to Biden’s team. “This is an opportunity to speak directly to the American people. His objective should be to speak directly to them, but not be pulled in by Trump. That is hard.”Trump has not been doing any formal preparation, according to aides and allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.No set has been constructed and aides refused to say whether anyone is playing Biden. Trump, instead, has maintained that the best preparation is doing his day job — particularly his frequent and often contentious interactions with reporters. White House aides also scheduled an ABC town hall earlier this month to expose Trump to real voter questions for the first time in months in preparation for the second debate.Privately some aides and allies are worried that Trump’s lack of formal preparation will lead him to fall into the same hubris trap as other incumbents in their first general election debate. Obama, for example, famously struggled in his first matchup against Mitt Romney in 2012.But other Trump backers are confident that the president is ready to handle any tough questions or pushback from Biden.“The debates matter,” said Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president’s daughter-in-law. “Donald Trump certainly did a great job on the debates (in 2016) and I think this will be no different.”Lara Trump also seemed to simultaneously raise and lower expectations for Biden.“Joe Biden spent a lot of time in his basement to study up. He’s been in this game for 47 years. I assume he’ll do okay,” she said. “Quite frankly, the bar has been lowered so much for Joe Biden that if he stays awake for the whole thing it’s like maybe he won.”The mixed messages were in line with those of Trump’s allies who spent much of the year raising questions about Biden’s physical and mental strength, while in recent days trying to cast him as a strong and experienced debater facing a relative neophyte in Trump.A former reality show star, the president is keenly aware of the power and pitfalls of live television. Aides say he is acutely mindful of the power of “moments” to define how a debate is perceived and that he intends to make his share of them happen.It remains to be seen how aggressively Trump attacks Biden. He has warned apocalyptically about the consequences of a Biden victory and is never one to shy away from a fight. He is also an avowed “counterpuncher” and will surely respond to any attacks by Biden in kind.Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and onetime national Democratic chairman, said Biden must fashion a succinct, debate-stage version of his message since the spring: draw a straight line from Trump’s personal deficiencies to his handling of the pandemic, its economic fallout, the national reckoning on race and then explain why a Biden presidency would be different.“Trump’s just looking for a Hail Mary here,” McAuliffe said. “He knows he’s in trouble.”___Peoples reported from New York.

26-09-2020||World||Uptick: New York logs more than 1,000 daily Covid-19 cases||More than 1,000 New Yorkers tested positive for Covid-19 in a single day Friday, marking the first time since June 5 the state has seen a daily number that high.The number of positive tests reported daily in the state has been steadily inching up in recent weeks, a trend possibly related to increasing numbers of businesses reopening, college campuses reopening and children returning to school. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday there were 1,005 positive cases tallied on the previous day out of 99,953 tests, for a 1% positive rate.From late July through the start of September the state was seeing an average of around 660 people test positive per day. In the seven-day period that ended Friday, the state had averaged 817 positive tests per day.Cuomo didn’t comment on the 1,000-case threshold in his daily Covid-19 update, but reiterated his call for vigilance.“It’s vital that New Yorkers continue to practice the basic behaviors that drive our ability to fight Covid-19 as we move into the fall and flu season,” Cuomo said in a prepared release. “Wearing masks, socially distancing and washing hands make a critical difference, as does the deliberate enforcement of state guidance by local governments.”That number of daily positive tests in a state of more than 19 million people still puts New York in a much better position than many other states. And it is worlds better than the situation in the state in April, when the number of positive tests per day routinely topped 9,000, even though tests then were hard to get and people were being encouraged not to seek one unless they were gravely ill.The higher number of positive tests lately could be related to more people seeking tests — or being required to take them — with the start of the academic year.Still, the uptick has been a cause for concern. In New York City, health officials have sounded alarms about a rising number of cases in certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens where many private religious schools opened for in-person instruction in early September, warning that those communities could see severe restrictions on public gatherings reinstated if current trends continue.Public school students in New York City’s elementary, middle and high schools are set to resume in-person instruction next week Sept. 29 and Oct. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uptick-new-york-logs-more-than-1-000-daily-covid-19-cases/story-Z2vL9z5T1Fm0yCEH7JUt3L.html
26-09-2020||World||Paris cleaver attack suspect says wanted to target Charlie Hebdo||A Pakistan-born teenager has admitted to stabbing two people with a meat cleaver outside the former Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine, investigators said Saturday, with nine people now detained over what the government condemned as “Islamist terror”.The 18-year-old said he wanted to avenge the republication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed by the satirical weekly, which in January 2015 was targeted in a massacre carried out by Islamist gunmen.The attack on Friday came three weeks into a trial in Paris of suspected accomplices in the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman and a Jewish supermarket that left 17 people dead.While the man is believed to have carried out the stabbings alone, eight other people are now also under arrest following two more detentions Saturday.The two new individuals arrested were the suspect’s younger brother and another acquaintance, a judicial source said. The man, who said he was born in Pakistan and is 18, “takes responsibility for his action,” a source close to the investigation said.The man said during questioning he places his actions “in the context of the republication of cartoons” of the Prophet Mohammed in Charlie Hebdo on the eve of the trial opening.- Charlie Hebdo targeted -The people wounded were employees of prize-winning TV production agency Premieres Lignes, whose offices are in the same block in central Paris that used to house Charlie Hebdo.However it is not believed that the two, who had stepped out onto the street for a cigarette break, were specifically targeted.The man mistakenly believed Charlie Hebdo’s offices were still in that building and wanted to attack journalists from the magazine, a source close to the inquiry told AFP, confirming information first published in the Le Parisien newspaper.Charlie Hebdo moved offices after the 2015 attack and its current address is kept secret for security reasons.The two victims were badly wounded but their lives are not in danger.French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday the attack was “clearly an act of Islamist terrorism”. Anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation.Five of the individuals detained were in an apartment in Pantin in the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, the last presumed address of the suspected attacker.Police also late Friday released another man who was close to the scene of the attack but who was confirmed to have been a witness who had “chased the assailant”, a judicial source said.The young man, who arrived from Pakistan three years ago, was believed to have last lived in a small flat in a four-storey building in the district.“He was very polite. I often saw him sitting on the landing with his telephone. He helped me carry my groceries,” said one neighbour, who identified herself as Josiane.- ‘Could have done better’ -Prime Minister Jean Castex on Saturday hailed the “efficiency” of the security forces following the attack during a visit to police headquarters, and said the “enemies of the Republic will never win”.Twelve people, including some of France’s most celebrated cartoonists, were killed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo’s offices by Islamist gunmen on January 7, 2015.Charlie Hebdo angered many Muslims around the world by publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2006, and in a defiant gesture reprinted some of the caricatures ahead of the trial.In court are 14 alleged accomplices of brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, the perpetrators of the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo that was claimed by a branch of Al-Qaeda.A female police officer was killed a day later, followed the next day by the killing of four men in a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket by gunman Amedy Coulibaly.The trial has reopened one of the most painful chapters in France’s modern history, with harrowing testimony from survivors and relatives of those who died.The magazine received fresh threats from Al-Qaeda this month after it republished the controversial cartoons.More than 100 French news outlets on Wednesday called for continuing support for Charlie Hebdo against what they described as the “enemies of freedom”.President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government has in recent weeks begun using increasingly tough rhetoric on domestic security issues in what analysts see as a shift to the right.Darmanin admitted that the risk of an attack around the former offices had been “underestimated” and said he had asked for an explanation from the police.“There was an attack, when there was an attack, it is obvious that we could have done better”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-cleaver-attack-suspect-says-wanted-to-target-charlie-hebdo/story-YeonPJkvkB3cXPgCj6oFRI.html
26-09-2020||World||‘Common foe’: Boris Johnson urges world leaders to unite against Covid-19||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Saturday that the coronavirus pandemic has frayed the bonds between nations, and urged world leaders to unite against the “common foe” of Covid-19.Johnson, who made the remarks in a prerecorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said that, nine months into the pandemic, “the very notion of the international community looks tattered.”“Never again must we wage 193 separate campaigns against the same enemy,” he said.Johnson set out a plan for preventing another global pandemic, including a network of zoonotic research labs around the world to identify dangerous pathogens before they leap from animals to humans.Johnson — who contracted Covid-19 in the spring and spent three nights in intensive care -- also called for countries to share data to create a global early-warning system for disease outbreaks, and urged countries to stop slapping export controls on essential goods, as many have done during the pandemic.Johnson also committed 500 million pounds ($636 million) through the global COVAX vaccine-procurement pool to help 92 of the world’s poorest countries obtain a coronavirus vaccine, should one become available.He announced that the U.K. is boosting its funding for the World Health Organization by 30%, to 340 million pounds ($432 million) over the next four years.Johnson is seeking to counter the impression that Britain is retreating from the world stage or becoming more protectionist in the wake of its departure from the European Union. The UK left the bloc’s political institutions in January and will make an economic break when a transition period ends on Dec. 31.He has also struck a more measured tone than in last year’s speech to the UN gathering, a rambling address about the perils and promise of technology that mentioned “terrifying limbless chickens,” “pink-eyed Terminators from the future” and fridges that beep for more cheese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/common-foe-boris-johnson-urges-world-leaders-to-unite-against-covid-19/story-so6wJa6cEtyGOfKQLCxdVP.html
26-09-2020||World||US imposes curbs on exports to China’s top chipmaker SMIC||The United States government has imposed restrictions on exports to China’s biggest silicon chip maker after concluding there is an “unacceptable risk” that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.Suppliers of certain equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) will now have to apply for individual export licenses, according to a letter from the Commerce Department dated Friday and seen by Reuters.SMIC becomes the second leading Chinese technology company to face US trade curbs after telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, whose access to high-end chips has been curtailed by its addition to a so-called entity list.The Pentagon said earlier this month that it was weighing blacklisting SMIC, which the US authorities have identified as a threat due to an alleged “fusion” of civilian and military technologies.Asked for comment, SMIC said it had not received any official notice of the restrictions and said it has no ties with the Chinese military.“SMIC reiterates that it manufactures semiconductors and provides services solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses,” SMIC said. “The Company has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for any military end-users or end-uses.”The Commerce Department declined on Saturday to comment specifically on SMIC, but said its Bureau of Industry and Security was “constantly monitoring and assessing any potential threats to US national security and foreign policy interests”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-curbs-on-exports-to-china-s-top-chipmaker-smic/story-owx6NBLJEVPd43tk3WHHKM.html
26-09-2020||World||Where is the UN in joint fight against Covid-19 pandemic?: PM Modi at UNGA||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday fervently pressed the UN general assembly to speed up reforms of its processes and organs to reflect contemporary realities and reiterated India’s case for a permanent membership of the Security Council demanding to know how long it would be “kept out of the decision-making structures” of the world body.“The people of India have been waiting for a long time for the process for the reforms of the United Nations to get completed,” the Prime Minister said. “Today, people of India are concerned whether this reform-process will ever reach its logical conclusion,” he added.“For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations?” he asked, a rhetorical question that conveyed India’s increasing frustration with the process, which does not even have a negotiating document to show for progress for the years of discussion.ALSO READ | For how long will India be kept out of UN’s decision-making structure?: PM Modi at UNGATo underscore the disconnect between the world body and contemporary realties, PM Modi pointed to the lack of UN leadership on the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst health crisis facing the world in more than 100 years. “Over the last 8 to 9 months, the whole world has been battling the pandemic of the Coronavirus,” he said.“Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?” the Prime Minister asked.The UN was criticized for “missing in action” in the early days of the pandemic and the Security Council, the world body’s top decision-making body, was seen to have finally taken cognizance of the pandemic only in July adopting a resolution calling for cessation of all hostilities, months after the deadly pathogen had infected people all over the world. “Reform in the responses, in the processes, and in the very character of the United Nations is the need of the hour,” PM Modi said.This was the second time in a week that the Prime Minister had expressed India’s frustration on UN reforms. He had slammed it as “crisis of confidence” in a speech at a one-day meeting of the world body on Monday to commemorate 75 years of its founding.Manjeev Puri, a former top Indian diplomat to the UN, said the Prime Minister’s message to the UN was very clear on Saturday: “If you don’t remain relevant, you will not be around to solve the problems you were created to solve.”While making the case for India, the Prime Minister underlined the responsible role it has played historically through contributions to UN’s peacekeeping efforts right down to the present time in helping the world combat the pandemic.“Even during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries,” he said.He added: “As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-the-un-in-joint-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic-pm-modi-at-unga/story-H3MdURufOiemeCZzMm2OAN.html

'I cannot remain indifferent to this disgraceful sentence for humanity.' pic.twitter.com/EzVBjCzgcYCywinski said that as the director of the site that preserves the remains of the German Nazi extermination camp, “where children were imprisoned and murdered, I cannot remain indifferent to this disgraceful sentence for humanity.”Cywinski said that if the president couldn’t give clemency, he would suggests that 120 adult volunteers from all over the world — “myself personally among them” — each serve a month in a Nigerian prison.“Regardless of what he said, he cannot be treated as fully aware and responsible, given his age,” Cywinski wrote. “He should not be subjected to the loss of the entirety of his youth, be deprived of opportunities, and stigmatized physically, emotionally, and educationally for the rest of his life.”The Auschwitz memorial site is located in southern Poland, which during World War II was under German occupation. The German forces killed 1.1 million people there. Most of the victims were Jewish, but others, including ethnic Poles, Soviet POWs and Roma, also lost their lives in large numbers there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-blasphemy-row-auschwitz-memorial-head-volunteers-to-serve-sentence/story-gwXMPUW8WSui1V9lQCW7OM.html

26-09-2020||World||China’s carbon target moves big economies into radical climate consensus||After a week of far-reaching climate promises measured over decades, four of the world’s six largest economies have now proposed ending dates for their carbon emissions.President Xi Jinping’s surprise announcement at the annual United Nations climate meeting this week committed China to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. That brings the third-biggest economy by nominal GDP into a loose but vitally important consensus with the second largest (EU), fourth largest (Japan), and fifth largest (California). The end of emissions has been set even if the target dates remain varied—and at least a generation into the future.Every new country that joins this carbon-neutral group puts more pressure on holdouts to align their policies with global goals. Two of the biggest economies remain outside of the consensus: India, at No. 6, and the national US economy that remains the largest by size and historical contribution to warming.“We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,” Xi declared by video conference on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly, without providing details on what neutrality will mean in practice. But the mere fact of the pledge by China keeps alive the chance that the world may be able to hit the most ambitious target set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement: holding warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels. Current global average is around 1°C of warming.“If China’s emissions didn’t go to zero, then 1.5 would not have been an option,” said Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research. The fact remains that China, as the world’s biggest emitter and energy consumer currently, exerts enormous pull on the prospects for limiting future warming. And falling short of the 1.5°C target by just half a degree would cost the world $20 trillion by 2100, according to an analysis published in the journal Nature.For all of the economies now linked in aspirations to end emissions, reaching net zero will mean a fundamental rewiring that accelerates clean-energy investments and dials back fossil fuels. In China’s case, sweeping reforms will have to be carried out across dozens of regions run by local governments that may not share the zeal for reaching the 2060 goal. Beijing has long struggled with implementing grand plans from the center in a continent-sized country of 1.4 billion people. Local officials often have more to gain by appeasing interest groups than listening to the national leaders, especially when those policies could affect local industries such as coal mining.“Announcing a carbon neutrality target is just the first step on a long road,” wrote analysts from BloombergNEF, in a note detailing the “arduous” and “challenging” route ahead. To reach this goal, China requires new technologies such as carbon-free hydrogen, BNEF concluded, “and it will need to make its economy much more efficient.”Implementation of long-range goals is going to be a challenge everywhere. California became one of the earliest large economies to set a carbon neutrality goal, resolving two years ago to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Recent wildfires that have devastated much of the Western US injected a new level of urgency, and this week California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order banning the sale of new gasoline-fueled cars after 2035.That decision makes California the first US state to join the UK, France, Canada and several other nations in putting an end date on the sale of internal combustion engine cars. It also marks a big global shift since California consumes about 1% of global oil production—roughly 1 million barrels per day. Even after years of policy incentives to encourage the sale of zero-emission vehicles, however, less than 8% of cars registered in the state are electric.Just how California will bring about this 15-year shift away from gasoline cars and what opposition it might face from the federal government remains unspecified, but the state is large enough to be a significant trendsetter for the US as a whole.There are questions, too, for how the EU will fulfill its proposal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in March, then set out an even more ambitious goal earlier this month to cut its emissions 55% by 2030. The bloc is already behind on an earlier goal to cut emissions 40% compared to 1990 levels by the same end date, so this new benchmark represents a renewed commitment to making deep, drastic changes quickly.Over the summer, meanwhile, EU heads of state approved the world’s greenest stimulus plan to date, promising to pour more than 500 billion euros ($580 billion) into measures that will help fight global warming. The money will go toward everything from scaling up green hydrogen to making agriculture more sustainable.The scale of China’s undertaking will be immense, since the nation alone accounted for 28% of the global greenhouse gas total in 2019. Simply reducing the share of fossil fuels in its energy mix from 85% today to less than 25% would require $180 billion of investment each year through 2050, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Similar investments will be required in everything from electric vehicle production and infrastructure to cleaning up industrial processes such as cement- and steel-making, which require enormous amounts of energy that can only be supplied reliably by fossil fuels right now.The impact from China’s decisions will be huge. Even if the rest of the world’s nations proceed with their current climate policies, China going carbon neutral by 2060 will lower global-warming projections by as much as 0.3°C. That’s the biggest single reduction ever estimated as the result of a policy change, according to Climate Action Tracker.The possibility of monumental policy swings looms over the climate debate. While the U.S. has retrenched significantly on climate policy under President Donald Trump, cheap natural gas and cheaper renewable energy have largely kept the country’s emissions in check. Should Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden defeat Trump in November’s election, the global picture would again change dramatically.Yet even without federal engagement on climate, at the state level leaders like California’s Newsom have moved in the opposite direction to Trump. In states such as Washington and New York there are now net-zero goals, and major U.S.-based companies have also made commitments to zero-out emissions. Even America’s utility behemoths are pledging to go carbon neutral, most recently New Orleans-based Entergy Corp., which did so on Thursday.“It’s like personal actions but on steroids,” said Noah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “It’s very directionally helpful, but it’ll never be enough if you don’t have the policies to back it up.”Biden has vowed to restore a national level of policy action, proposing a carbon-free electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions no later than 2050. If Biden rejoins the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. is set to leave on Nov. 4, pressure will grow on other major emitters—most significantly India, the largest besides the U.S. with no stated net-zero target—to make similar commitments.The UN framework allows developing countries to lower their emissions much later than developed countries, which bear much more of the blame for current atmospheric carbon levels. Though India isn’t ready to set a net-zero emissions goal, it’s shown a willingness to participate in the global conversation on emissions.India “sees climate change as an area where, to put it simply, it can win points geopolitically,” said Thomas Spencer at the Energy and Resources Institute, a think tank in India. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has been setting records for low-cost solar installations and become a role model in deploying energy efficiency measures, although it still doesn’t have strong policies in place to electrify transport.The next major UN climate meeting, set to be held in Glasgow, has already been postponed until 2021. Global leaders have tried to maintain momentum, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Thursday for a virtual meeting this December to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. It would be the next big moment for countries to strengthen their commitments to reduce emissions.This week also saw European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen call for the creation of a “high ambition coalition” that would include the EU and China, similar to a group assembled in 2015 to help reach a deal in Paris.Most of these climate goals are audacious—and entirely voluntary. There’s no guarantee that the promised reductions will come to pass. Still, the non-binding resolution created by the Paris climate agreement has fundamentally changed the conversation on climate action.“That’s the beauty of the Paris Agreement,” said Spencer. “Part of its strength is its weakness as well. It appeals to so many different sectors, so many different levers of action and just sets the direction. It doesn’t actually say you have to do it.”Once that direction is set, it often means ratcheting ambition up, not down. The British government is behind on its short-term emissions targets, for instance, and it is now considering bringing forward its ban on the sale of gasoline and diesel cars to 2030.That means those who assume China’s 2060 target is too late to keep the hope for 1.5°C alive may be in for a surprise. Peters of the Center for International Climate Research suggested it might be only the start: “I don’t think this is the final offer from China, and then they walk away and don’t budge for 40 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-carbon-target-moves-big-economies-into-radical-climate-consensus/story-aVXvQCPNTQT6YNSIge5DSO.html
26-09-2020||World||France: 7 in custody after stabbing linked to Charlie Hebdo||Seven people were in custody Saturday after a stabbing outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, including the suspected assailant, authorities said.Counterterrorism authorities are investigating what authorities called an Islamic extremist attack linked to Charlie Hebdo, which lost 12 employees in an al-Qaida attack in 2015. The weekly, which routinely mocks religious and other prominent figures, recently republished caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that outraged many Muslims.The suspected assailant in Friday’s stabbing had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalisation, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.The suspect arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified, the minister said.Seven others were detained in the aftermath of Friday’s attack, but one has been released, according to judicial officials. Five of those in custody were detained in the Paris suburb of Pantin in a residence where the suspect is believed to have lived, a police official said.Two people were wounded in Friday’s attack, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered, and ordered special protection for all “symbolic sites,” noting in particular Jewish sites around the Yom Kippur holiday this weekend. A Jewish grocery store was targeted days after the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre, in what authorities say were coordinated attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-7-in-custody-after-stabbing-linked-to-charlie-hebdo/story-Q6M6pthGuFmTTUHJuEJc2H.html

India is currently discussing Sri Lanka’s request for the $1.1 billion bilateral currency swap. India is also discussing the issue of deferring the debt repayments by Sri Lanka.During the summit, Modi and Rajapaksa also discussed trade ties between the two countries. PM Modi conveyed to his Sri Lankan counterpart that he hopes Colombo relaxes temporary restrictions on import of a few Indian products. India also proposed launching a bilateral air bubble with Sri Lanka for travel between both countries.Both nations also agreed to extend MoU on certain high impact community development projects over the course of the next five years.In his address, PM Narendra Modi highlighted that under India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, India prioritises its relationship with Sri Lanka. “The relations between India and Sri Lanka are thousands of years old. According to my government’s neighbourhood first policy and SAGAR doctrine, we give special priority to relations between the two countries,” he said.PM Modi also requested Rajapaksa to look into the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils and as a part of reconciliation efforts ensure the government works towards realising their expectations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-rajapaksa-meet-india-extends-15mn-to-promote-buddhist-ties-discusses-bilateral-currency-swap-and-trade/story-Krgl01ZucKQOSRSqjmqI2H.html
26-09-2020||World||Progress against coronavirus brings complacency in parts of Africa||With Zimbabwe’s coronavirus infections on the decline, schools are reopening, along with churches, bars, restaurants, airports and tourist attractions. Strict lockdowns designed to curb the disease are being replaced by a return to relatively normal life.The threat has eased so much that many people see no need to be cautious. With his face mask stuffed into his pocket, Omega Chibanda said he’s not worried about Covid-19.“We used to fear coronavirus, not anymore,” the 16-year-old said in the crowded Chitungwiza town on the outskirts of the capital, Harare. “That’s why I’m not even wearing a mask.”As the global death toll from Covid-19 approaches 1 million, Zimbabwe and several other African countries have not experienced the widespread surges and many deaths that were predicted. That has invited complacency.“It’s all relaxed now,” Chibanda said.Earlier this month, Zimbabwe went a week without recording any deaths from coronavirus, and new infections and deaths have declined, as in South Africa and Kenya.Africa’s surge has been leveling off, with its 1.4 million confirmed cases increasing relatively slowly. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 35,000 deaths have been confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.But the improving figures and the start of the searing heat of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer could undermine efforts to beat back the virus even further, said community health worker Rosemary Rambire.She leaves home early in the morning and returns in the evening after going door to door calling “the gospel is here” and gathering families for quick awareness sessions.“Our job is now harder to do because people are no longer afraid,” Rambire said. “Some even tell us that it has not killed anyone they know. Most of them say the sun kills Covid-19 so they have no reason to worry.”Some think they are immune once they eat garlic, ginger and onions, she said.In her 14 years on the job and through multiple disease outbreaks, Covid-19 has been the most difficult to get people to take preventive measures, she said.“It’s different from before, when we did campaigns on cholera (and) HIV. We could tell that people were afraid. They tried to follow preventive measures,” she said. “With Covid-19, they are not afraid.”Many people look at the infection and death figures in Zimbabwe, compare them with other countries “and conclude that it only affects other countries and not Zimbabwe,” Rambire added.In Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class center on the southern edge of Harare, people no longer wear masks at markets, funerals or other public events. Masks are now the exception in many of Harare’s poor residential areas.“We have lost both the initial Covid-19 fear factor and the motivation to comply with national guidelines,” said Aaron Sundsmo, of the charitable organization Mercy Corps. The group has now enlisted local soccer, music and film celebrities to renew awareness.The government will “not hesitate to do something really strict” to curb any creeping complacency, said Dr. Agnes Mahomva, the chief Covid-19 response coordinator in Zimbabwe.“The dire projections that ‘Africa, you are going to be toast,’ perhaps actually helped us. We tightened up,” she said.Continued vigilance should accompany Africa’s apparent success story, said Mervyn Joullie, deputy regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, which operates in 16 of Africa’s 54 countries.Limited testing in many African countries makes it difficult to assess “the reality of Covid-19 situation,” Joullie said.In West Africa’s Sahel region, for example, positive cases of Covid-19 have declined over the past several weeks amid low testing capacity, which could suggest “a significant presence of undetected cases,” Joullie said.Health experts point to Africa’s youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 has not taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.Many African countries have eased the lockdowns and curfews in recent weeks to boost economies battered by the virus outbreak and, in some cases, ease local political pressure.Balancing concerns about unemployment, security and access to food, as well as the complacency and the need to keep infections low could be Africa’s next big challenge, experts said.“We are at a crossroads as we relax some of the restrictions,” said Dr. Mahomva, Zimbabwe’s Covid-19 response coordinator. “It’s not over until it’s over.”But for Chibanda, the teenager in Chitungwiza, there is no such dilemma.“Coronavirus is not an issue anymore here,” he said, pointing to people walking on the street without masks. “Just look around.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progress-against-coronavirus-brings-complacency-in-parts-of-africa/story-StJcfwcpnbJC4jAwgaXjzM.html
26-09-2020||World||Lebanese prime minister-designate resigns amid impasse||Lebanon’s prime minister-designate resigned Saturday amid a political impasse over government formation, dealing a blow to French President Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to break a dangerous stalemate in the crisis-hit country.The announcement by Moustapha Adib nearly a month after he was appointed to the job came following a meeting with President Michel Aoun, after which he told reporters he was stepping down.The French leader has been pressing Lebanese politicians to form a Cabinet made up of independent specialists that can work on enacting urgent reforms to extract Lebanon from a devastating economic and financial crisis worsened by the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut port.But efforts by the French-supported Adib, have hit multiple snags, after the country’s main Shiite groups, Hezbollah and Amal, insisted on retaining hold of the key Finance Ministry. Their insistence emerged after the US administration slapped sanctions on two senior politicians close to Hezbollah, including the ex-finance minister.The two groups also insisted on naming the Shiite ministers in the new Cabinet and objected to the manner in which Adib was forming the government, without consulting with them.After a short meeting with Aoun on Saturday, Adib said he was stepping down because the kind of Cabinet that he wanted to form “was bound to fail” and he was keen on protecting national unity.Lebanon, a former French protectorate, is mired in the country’s worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history. It defaulted on paying back its debt for the first time ever in March, and the local currency has collapsed, leading to hyperinflation and soaring poverty and unemployment.The crisis has been worsened by the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut’s port caused by the detonation of thousands of tons of ammonium nitrates. It killed nearly 200 people, injured thousands and caused losses worth billions of dollars.The country is in desperate need of financial assistance but France and other international powers have refused to provide aid before serious reforms are made. The crisis is largely blamed on decades of systematic corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s ruling class.The French leader has described his initiative, which includes a road map and a timetable for reforms, as “the last chance for this system.”Adib’s resignation comes a few days after Aoun himself bluntly told reporters that Lebanon would be going to “hell” if a new government was not formed soon.In a televised address, he criticized his political allies, the Shiite groups Hezbollah and Amal, for insisting on holding on to the Finance Ministry portfolio in any new government, but also criticized Adib for attempting to form a government and impose names for Cabinet positions without consulting with the parliamentary blocs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-prime-minister-designate-resigns-amid-impasse/story-Wr3iKOIzMQHIKPv1U8HJdI.html
26-09-2020||World||Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine produces strong immune response in early trial||A single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, according to interim results published on Friday.The vaccine, called Ad26.COV2.S, was equally well-tolerated at two different doses, the results showed. A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, could simplify distribution of the vaccine. However, it is unclear whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk from the virus, will be protected to the same degree as younger people with the J&J vaccine.The trial in close to 1,000 healthy adults, which is backed by the U.S. government, began after the J&J vaccine was found in July to offer strong protection in a single dose to monkeys.Based on the current results, J&J on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial, which could pave the way for an application for regulatory approval. The company said it expects results of that so-called Phase 3 trial by the end of the year or early next year.The results, released on the medical website medRxiv, have not been peer-reviewed.Researchers, including those from J&J’s unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said 98% of participants with data available for the interim analysis had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination. However, immune response results were available from only a small number of people - 15 participants - over 65 years old, limiting the interpretation.In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong. The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed. For now, the results justify why more studies are needed in larger numbers to look for serious adverse effects, Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the J&J trial, told Reuters. “Overall, the vaccine is doing what you would expect it to do if you were to move it to Phase 3 trials,” Bloom said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-produces-strong-immune-response-in-early-trial/story-Uu7C21l4onORsRkQjCDpoO.html
26-09-2020||World||Paris stabbing suspect apparently from Pakistan, says minister||A young man stabbed two people Friday outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people were killed in 2015, and a terrorism investigation has been opened into the new attack, authorities said.The suspected assailant had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalization, France’s interior minister said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.Two people were wounded in Friday’s attack, and two suspects were arrested, although the links between the two suspects weren’t immediately clear. The main suspect, a young man with speckles of blood on his forehead and wearing orange gym shoes, was arrested on the steps of the Bastille Opera in eastern Paris, authorities said. The site is not far from where Friday’s attack took place, outside the building where the weekly Charlie Hebdo was located before the 2015 attack.The interior minister said the assailant arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified.“Manifestly it’s an act of Islamist terrorism,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in an interview with public broadcaster France-2. “Obviously, there is little doubt. It’s a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists, against this society.” France’s counterterrorism prosecutor said earlier that authorities suspect a terrorist motive because of the place and timing of the stabbings: in front of the building where Charlie Hebdo was based until the Islamic extremist attack on its cartoonists, and at a time when suspects in the 2015 attack are on trial across town.Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said that the chief suspect in Friday’s stabbings was arrested, along with another person. Ricard said the assailant did not know the people stabbed, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.An investigation was opened into “attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise,” according to the terrorism prosecutor’s office.French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the lives of the two wounded workers lives were not in danger. He offered the government’s solidarity with their families and colleagues.The prime minister noted the “symbolic site” of the attack, “at the very moment where the trial into the atrocious acts against Charlie Hebdo is under way.” He promised the government’s “unfailing attachment to freedom of the press, and its determination to fight terrorism.” People in the neighbourhood were stunned, saying on French TV that they were reliving the nightmare of the newsroom massacre.In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo strongly condemned the stabbings.“This tragic episode shows us once again that fanaticism, intolerance, the origins of which will be revealed by the investigation, are still present in French society....There is no question of ceding anything,” the newspaper said.The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told France’s BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company’s staff members were evacuated.Moreira said a man in the street “attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn’t enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left.” He said the company had not received any threats.His colleague, Luc Hermann, describing witnesses’ version of the attack, said the assailant first struck the woman in her face, then the man, before returning to attack the woman again.“The whole team ... took refuge on the roof of the building like our team did five years ago during the attack of Charlie Hebdo,” he said on France-2.He said it was “incomprehensible” that authorities had not taken special security precautions particularly at this time.A wrenching, two-month trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently unfolding at the main Paris courthouse. Murmurs broke at the terrorism trial of 14 people, including 3 fugitives, accused of helping the attackers in the January 2015 killings, as the news filtered through.The widows of the two brothers who forced their way into the newspaper’s offices and opened fire at a morning editorial meeting testified Friday.Caty Richard, a lawyer for the Charlie Hebdo journalists, heard about the knife attack in the midst of the trial.“My first thought was this will never end,” she said. “I am devastated, angry.” The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered. He said that 775 police protect its new location.But “there was an attack so we could have done better,” he said. The minister said he has ordered special protection for all “symbolic sites,” noting in particular Jewish sites ahead of the Yom Kippur holiday this weekend. A Jewish grocery store was targeted days after the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre in what authorities say were coordinated attacks.Charlie Hebdo recently reproduced caricatures of the Muslim prophet that stoked the ire of some Muslims when first produced.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-stabbing-suspect-apparently-from-pakistan-says-minister/story-M4K3klkE1gjihCIDWW3BFP.html
26-09-2020||World||Can Covid-19 affect the heart? Likely, says study||Nigerian-American basketball player Michael Ojo, who had recovered from Covid-19, collapsed during training and died of heart attack. Ojo was 27 years old and did not have any heart ailment earlier. Instances like these raise questions whether Covid-19 can affect the heart. Shedding some light on this topic, a paper by American cardiologist Eric Topol, published on sciencemag.org, claimed cardiac complications have occurred even in cases where Covid-19 symptoms were minimum or not present at all. "These complications, which at times are the only features of #COVID19 clinical presentation, have occurred even in cases with mild symptoms and in people who did not experience any symptoms" https://t.co/q42cY3ujV4a 🧵to explain 1/“The most recent coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has marked tropism for the heart and can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), necrosis of its cells, mimicking of a heart attack, arrhythmias, and acute or protracted heart failure (muscle dysfunction),” the paper said.“These complications, which at times are the only features of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) clinical presentation, have occurred even in cases with mild symptoms and in people who did not experience any symptoms. Recent findings of heart involvement in young athletes, including sudden death, have raised concerns about the current limits of our knowledge and potentially high risk and occult prevalence of Covid-19 heart manifestations,” it said.  The paper said in contrast to people without symptoms, there is a substantial proportion of people who suffer a longstanding, often debilitating illness, called long-Covid. Typical symptoms include fatigue, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythm. . “Once recognised a few months into the pandemic, the expectation was that cardiac involvement would chiefly occur in patients with severe Covid-19. Clearly, it is more common than anticipated, but the true incidence is unknown. It is vital to determine what drives this pathogenesis. Whether it represents an individual’s inflammatory response, an autoimmune phenomenon, or some other explanation needs to be clarified,” the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-covid-19-affect-the-heart-likely-says-study/story-A8FHB5NJPd0r0L8CPmhZrN.html
26-09-2020||World||China pushes emergency use of Covid-19 vaccine despite concerns||After the first shot, he had no reaction. But Kan Chai felt woozy following the second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in China.“When I was driving on the road, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy, as if I was driving drunk,” the popular writer and columnist recounted on a webinar earlier this month. “So I specially found a place to stop the car, rest a bit and then I felt better.” His is a rare account from the hundreds of thousands of people who have been given Chinese vaccines, before final regulatory approval for general use. It’s an unusual move that raises ethical and safety questions, as companies and governments worldwide race to develop a vaccine that will stop the spread of the new coronavirus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageChinese companies earlier drew attention for giving the vaccine to their top executives and leading researchers before human trials to test their safety and efficacy had even begun. In recent months, they have injected a far larger number under an emergency use designation approved in June, and that number appears poised to rise.A Chinese health official said Friday that China, which has largely eradicated the disease, needs to take steps to prevent it from coming back. But one outside expert questioned the need for emergency use when the virus is no longer spreading in the country where it was first detected.It’s unclear exactly who and how many people have been injected so far, but Chinese vaccine makes have offered some clues. State-owned Sinopharm subsidiary CNBG has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, which have about 40,000 people enrolled, a top CNBG executive said recently.Another company, SinoVac, has injected 90 per cent of its employees and family members, or about 3,000 people, most under the emergency-use provision, CEO Yin Weidong said. It has also provided tens of thousands of rounds of its CoronaVac to the Beijing city government.Another candidate being jointly developed by the military and Cansino, a biopharmaceutical company, has been approved for emergency use in military personnel.“The first people to have priority in emergency use are the vaccine researchers and the vaccine manufacturers because when the pandemic comes, if these people are infected then there’s no way to produce the vaccine,” Yin said.Now, large Chinese firms including telecom giant Huawei and broadcaster Phoenix TV have announced they’re working with Sinopharm to get the vaccine for their employees.Several people who say they work in “front-line” organisations have said on social media that their workplaces have offered vaccinations for about 1,000 yuan (USD 150). They declined to comment, saying they would need permission from their organisation.In an established but limited practice, experimental medications have been approved historically for use when they are still in the third and last phase of human trials. Chinese companies have four vaccines in phase 3 - two from Sinopharm and one each from SinoVac and Cansino.The Chinese government referenced the World Health Organisation’s emergency-use principles to create its own through a strict process, National Health Commission official Zheng Zhongwei said at a news conference Friday.He said there have been no serious side effects in the clinical trials.“We’ve made it very clear that the Covid-19 vaccine we put into emergency use are safe,” Zheng said. “Their safety can be ensured but their efficacy is yet to be determined.” Under the emergency rule, high-risk personnel such as medical and customs workers and those who have to work overseas are given priority access, he said. He declined to provide exact numbers.“In China’s case, the pressure in preventing imported infections and domestic resurgence is still huge,” Zheng said.But Diego Silva, a lecturer in Bioethics at the University of Sydneym, said that giving vaccines to hundreds of thousands outside of clinical trials doesn’t have “scientific merit” in China, where there are currently very few locally transmitted cases, and incoming arrivals are quarantined centrally.“If it’s in the US Where the virus is still raging that’s a bit different, but in a country like China it doesn’t seem to make sense to me,” he said. “Because there’s not enough of the virus in China locally to deduce anything, you’re introducing a whole host of others factors” by injecting people outside of trials.Zheng said that all those injected under emergency use are being closely tracked for any adverse health effects.Kan Chai, the columnist, wrote in an article posted online in September that despite initial hesitation, he decided to sign up after he heard a state-owned company was looking for volunteers.He didn’t say whether his was an emergency-use case, but the timing of his vaccination suggests it was. He took the first dose in late July, when the emergency inoculations were getting started and the trials were all but over.“I’m willing to be a little white mouse, and the biggest reason is because I have trust in our country’s vaccination technology,” he said.His real name is Li Yong, but his 1.65 million followers on the Twitter-like social platform Weibo know him better by his pen name, which means “10 years of chopping wood.” He declined an interview request.He described taking the vaccine in a public webinar hosted by 8am HealthInsight, a popular health media outlet. It’s unclear why he qualified to receive it.Scant information is publicly available about the program’s scope, size, and scientific merit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-despite-concerns/story-XjgYrmwBRvxR1o4qMkq5PL.html
26-09-2020||World||‘Fitting’ mask controversy: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau criticises police for discriminating against Sikh personnel||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticised the country’s premier law enforcement agency for a policy on wearing medical-grade respirator masks that appears to discriminate against Sikh personnel, who have been pulled off the frontlines amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) instituted a policy that mandates frontline officers wear “fitting” respirators that has apparently resulted in many Sikhs in the force being assigned desk jobs as their beards prevent wearing such masks. Hitting out at the policy during a media interaction, PM Trudeau said, “It is something that I certainly hope the RCMP rectifies quickly and it shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”He said he was “very disappointed” over the issue as “many other police forces and other organisations have figured out ways of upholding health and safety standards without needing to create discrimination against certain individuals because of their religion”.In March, the RCMP issued a directive regarding these masks, and, according to the agency Canadian Press, it noted that “one of the most common causes of a breached seal is facial hair”.The issue was flagged by the World Sikh Organisation (WSO), which said that due to this policy, nearly 30 Sikhs officers had been reassigned since March 31. It said it was contacted by some officers in April and they “reported that they had been re-assigned to administrative duties, which many find less than meaningful”.The RCMP has argued that it has to operate under federal regulations unlike police forces in cities like Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal, where similar norms have not been implemented. It said it doesn’t have the authority to change the rules regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), as per a CBC News report.In a statement, WSO president Tejinder Singh Sidhu said, “The RCMP are the only police force in Canada that refuse to accommodate bearded Sikh officers. Sikh RCMP officers have patiently waited for almost six months to be returned to active duty. However, there has been no desire on the RCMP’s part to address this situation. There is no reason that the RCMP should require a higher standard of PPE protection than any other police force in Canada or even medical frontline workers. Sikh officers continue to serve in every other police force in Canada.”The stand appears to also have the support of Bill Blair, Canada’s public safety and emergency preparedness minister. CBC News quoted an emailed response from his office, which stated it is “essential for the RCMP to provide necessary PPE in a timely manner for Sikh officers. We have raised this matter with the RCMP, and expect that this be rectified as quickly as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fitting-mask-controversy-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-criticises-police-for-discriminating-against-sikh-personnel/story-WtIloraNnBo6lLEjpLbNHI.html
26-09-2020||World||Canadian man charged with faking his past as Islamic State terrorist||A Pakistani-origin man, who gained international notoriety on the basis of his claims of having been a hardened fighter for the Islamic State terror group, may have fabricated his entire account. Shehroze Chaudhry, a 25-year-old from the town of Burlington in the Canadian province of Ontario, has been charged by law enforcement “in connection with a hoax regarding terrorist activity”.Chaudhry gained prominence under the pseudonym Abu Huzayfah and was featured on The New York Times podcast Caliphate and in a documentary from Canada’s national broadcaster CBC.In a statement issued on Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) O Division Integrated National Security Enforcement Team or OINSET said he had been arrested and charged after a “lengthy investigation”. The charge, it said, stemmed from “numerous media interviews where the accused” claimed to have “travelled to Syria in 2016 to join the terrorist group ISIS and committed acts of terrorism”. His interviews were widely published on various media platforms “raising public safety concerns amongst Canadians”. He has been charged with “hoax terrorist activity”, and is scheduled to make a court appearance on November 16 in Brampton, Ontario.In a statement, Superintendent Christopher deGale, the officer in charge of the RCMP’s OINSET, said, “Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise. As a result, the RCMP takes these allegations very seriously, particularly when individuals, by their actions, cause the police to enter into investigations in which human and financial resources are invested and diverted from other ongoing priorities.”OINSET is committed to investigating cases of “foreign travellers”, individuals who either leave Canada to participate in terrorism abroad or return to the country after having done so.According to the outlet Global News, Chaudhry’s social media profiles indicate he had left Canada for Pakistan in 2013 and studied at the University of Lahore’s Department of Environmental Science throughout 2014. It also reported that in August 2017, he told the outlet he had used his Pakistani passport instead of the Canadian one to travel to Syria and join IS, and then returned to Pakistan via Turkey after getting “disillusioned”. Thereafter he moved back to Canada.It also quoted the Caliphate podcast, in which he is alleged to have “described conducting public executions”. In one segment, he is alleged to have said, “I had to stab him multiple times. And then we put him up on a cross. And I had to leave the dagger in his heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-man-charged-with-faking-his-past-as-islamic-state-terrorist/story-WBAkmivIYHlZrEnShhLVeM.html
26-09-2020||World||UNGA: India questions Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s claim to be protector of Muslims||India on Friday slammed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s verbal attack on India at the UN General Assembly as a “new low” for the world body on its 75th anniversary, and questioned his claim to be a champion of Muslims when he is unable to protect them in his own country.An Indian diplomat, who delivered India’s response to the Pakistan PM’s diatribe, also sought to remind Khan of the “genocide” perpetrated by his country on Muslims of erstwhile East Pakistan before it became Bangladesh, without naming them.India sought to target the Pakistan PM’s attempt to position himself as a champion of Muslims to align himself with leading Islamic countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.“This august forum witnessed today a new low on its 75th anniversary,” said Mijito Vinito, a diplomat at the Indian permanent mission to the UN, reading a statement under the UNGA debates’ “right of reply” rule, which gives member countries an opportunity to respond if criticised.“For someone who professes to be a champion of Islam, this is also a country that has encouraged the killing of fellow Muslims merely because they belonged to a different sect, or to a different region in Pakistan, and through sponsoring terrorist attacks against its neighbours,” the India diplomat said.Vinito was referring to the killing of Muslims of the Shia and Sufi sects in Pakistan by terrorists sheltered and supported by the state, the large number of people killed and missing in Balochistan, a restive province of Pakistan, and those killed in cross-border attacks in Kashmir.The Indian diplomat went on to cite the most glaring instance yet of a Muslim-majority country turning upon its own people. “This is the country that brought genocide to South Asia 39 years back when it killed its own people,” Vinito said, addressing Khan’s use of the word “genocide” in his speech as he had attacked India without apparent evidence.He added, “This is also the country that is shameless enough not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetrated even after so many years.”The “genocide” the Indian diplomat referred to was the killing of between 300,000 and 3,000,000 people in current-day Bangladesh, mostly Muslims, by the Pakistan Army in 1971 to quell an independence movement that succeeded eventually with the help of the Indian Army.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the UNGA at 6.30pm India time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unga-india-questions-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-s-claim-to-be-protector-of-muslims/story-oABRr4VrGmA0VGhM39IaVL.html

The leader of Pakistan today called for those who incite hate and violence to be outlawed. But as he went on, we were left wondering, was he referring to himself?” First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Mijito Vinito said, making India’s Right of Reply.Also read: ‘Lies, misinformation, warmongering’: India responds to Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s UN addressThe strong rebuttal came after Khan spoke about India’s internal affairs, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, during his pre-recorded video statement at the high-level General Debate. Vinito, who was sitting at India’s seat in the UN General Assembly hall for the General Debate, walked out when Khan started his usual “diatribe” about India.“This hall heard the incessant rant of someone who had nothing to show for himself, who had no achievements to speak of and no reasonable suggestion to offer to the world. Instead, we saw lies, misinformation, war mongering and malice spread through this Assembly,” the young Indian diplomat said.Slamming Pakistan for its record as a nation, Vinito said, “The only crowning glory that this country has to show to the world for the last 70 years is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade.” Alluding to the “stellar record” of Pakistan, he said this is the country that has the “dubious distinction” of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations, a reference to terror masterminds such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) head Masood Azhar.“This is the same country that provides pensions for dreaded and listed terrorists out of State funds. The leader whom we heard today is the same person who referred to terrorist Osama Bin Laden as a ‘martyr’“ in the Pakistani Parliament in July, Vinito said.He added that it is Pakistan that brought genocide to South Asia 39 years ago when it killed its own people and it is also the country that is “shameless enough” not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetrated even after so many years.Also read: Indian diplomat walks out after Imran Khan raises Kashmir issue at UNIndia asserted in its Right of Reply that Khan, “who spewed venom today”, admitted in 2019 in public in the US that his country still has about 30,000-40,000 terrorists, who have been trained by Pakistan and have fought in Afghanistan and in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.“This is the country that has systematically cleansed its minorities, including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and others, through the abuse of its blasphemy laws and through forced religious conversions,” Vinito said, adding that “for someone who professes to be a champion of Islam, this is also a country that has encouraged killing of fellow Muslims merely because they belonged to a different sect or to a different region in Pakistan and through sponsoring terrorist attacks against its neighbours”.Pakistan has consistently used UN platforms, including the high-level General Assembly sessions, to rake up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, but has repeatedly found no resonance with the international community for its “diatribe”.India strongly asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is its “integral and inalienable part” and the rules and legislations brought in the Union Territory are strictly its internal affairs.“The only dispute left in Kashmir relates to that part of Kashmir that is still under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all those areas that it is in illegal occupation of,” Vinito said, adding that what should instead be on the agenda of the UN is Pakistan’s “deep state and its unrelenting political and financial support to terrorist organisations and mercenaries, which are a threat to global peace and security”.“The only way for Pakistan to become a normal country is to abjure its moral, financial and material support to terrorism, turn its attention to the problems faced by its own population, including its minorities, and stop misusing UN platforms to further its nefarious agenda,” India said.The words used in the General Assembly by Khan “demean” the very essence of the United Nations, Vinito said, adding that “for a nation that is deeply buried in medievalism, it is understandable that the tenets of a modern civilised society such as peace, dialogue and diplomacy are farfetched”.Pakistan’s delegate then made a response to India’s Right of Reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorism-clandestine-nuclear-trade-pakistan-s-only-crowning-glory-for-70-years-india-at-un/story-GjXtmu2tqlR91V8LPM3lGL.html

The plan had triggered protests even within Japan’s governing party because of China’s tightening of controls over Hong Kong and its assertive actions in regional seas.“We did not discuss (Xi’s) possible visit to Japan,” Suga said.However, the leaders agreed to hold summits and other high-level meetings to cooperate in bilateral, regional and international issues, he said.Relations between the two Asian rivals have improved recently as China faces heightened tensions with the United States.But Japan sees China’s military development and increasingly assertive stance in the East and South China Seas as a major security threat. Chinese coast guard vessels routinely violate territorial waters around the Japanese-controlled southern islands of Senkaku, which China calls Diaoyu and also claims.China’s official Xinhua News Agency said that Xi noted the improvement in relations and said that China stands ready to work with the Suga government to deepen cooperation in mutually beneficial areas such as trade and to handle sensitive issues, including historical ones.Japan’s military invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s remains a sore spot between the two.Earlier Friday, Suga also held talks by phone with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed his intention to work together to achieve a “free and open Indo-Pacific” aimed at checking China’s maritime assertiveness.On Thursday, Suga held talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and urged him to take actions to mend bilateral relations badly damaged by war compensation issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-new-pm-yoshihide-suga-says-stable-japan-china-ties-key-to-region/story-Rijjebg5f5ugWb5dhhKIZN.html
26-09-2020||World||40 years after Oktoberfest attack, survivor’s wounds still healing||That evening on September 26, 1980, Robert Platzer, then 12, was having a great night out. He had been on fairground rides, eaten bags of sweets and even bought a helium balloon -- all that a child dreams of at the Munich Oktoberfest.He was just at the exit of the popular beer festival with his parents and four siblings when he saw a man with his arms in the rubbish bin, towards which his family was headed. But at that moment, the bomb went off.“There was a huge flame, I was thrown back several metres,” Robert Hoeckmayr, who has since taken his wife’s family name, told AFP in an interview.A bomb in the trashcan had exploded just steps away from the merry-go-round and the beer tents.Thirteen people -- including the bomber Gundolf Koehler -- were killed and more than 200 injured. Four decades on, prosecutors in July finally classed it a political attack -- the deadliest far-right assault in post-war Germany.Investigators initially assumed the 21-year-old Koehler was a depressed geology student, who had acted because of relationship problems and exam stress, downplaying his known links to the extremist scene.But further revelations about the extent of Koehler’s involvement with the far-right and speculation he may not have acted alone prompted prosecutors to reopen the investigation in 2014.After interviewing over a thousand witnesses and combing through 300,000 documents, investigators believe Koehler aimed for the attack to be blamed on the far left. His goal had been to influence that year’s general election and usher in a conservative candidate as chancellor.- Survivors need help -The 40th anniversary of the attack on Saturday comes as far-right violence is once again on the rise in Germany, with a deadly attack targeting a synagogue in Halle in 2019 and another that left nine people of migrant origin dead in Hanau in February.Hoeckmayr did not want to be drawn into discussing the political extremism that has sparked the violence. For him, more must be done to help survivors.“I don’t care from which side the attack comes from, the survivors need to be better taken care of,” he said.Hoeckmayr’s experience underlines how the devastation wrought goes on far beyond that fateful day.His eight-year-old sister Ilona was killed on the spot. His little brother, six, died on the way to the hospital in the ambulance. His parents were severely wounded.His sister Elisabeth survived but died of a drug overdose at 24. His brother threw himself under a train in 2008, at age 42.“They could not stand the pain. I am the sole survivor in this family,” said Hoeckmayr, now 52 and a Munich city official.He has had 41 operations to remove metal shards lodged all over his body.“They didn’t manage to remove all of them,” said the tall man with greying hair.But what was even more difficult to heal was the feeling of being “abandoned” by the German state after the attack. “We were never offered psychological help. Several months after the attack, the doctors declared that I was healthy, just because I could walk,” he said. It was thanks to his wife and three children that he was able to pick up the pieces.“They gave me the energy to live.”Beyond the lack of psychological support, he is also angry about the low level of financial aid provided to people wounded in the attack.But that may soon change, with the city of Munich, the Bavarian state and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to stump up 1.2 million euros ($1.4 million) for victims of the attack.For Hoeckmayr, “40 years later is too late”.“It’s not just about money but about helping people who have experienced terrible things to return to society,” said Hoeckmayr, who refuses to be labelled a victim, saying he is a survivor.He will participate in a ceremony on Saturday when Munich inaugurates a new information site that tells the story of the attack.Underlining its importance, he said: “Here too, many people know that something happened on September 26, 1980, but they don’t know what it is.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-years-after-oktoberfest-attack-survivor-s-wounds-still-healing/story-RckloMUL9VjlcHr6R4o6XP.html

China hasn’t reported any local symptomatic infections since August 15 either.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The new cases will intensify concern in China over whether imported products are infectious. Traces of the virus have been found on frozen, imported seafood and meat, as well as in the containers in which they were shipped.Also, China said it plans to produce 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine per year by 2021, and claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) had backed its emergency use of experimental vaccines on high-risk groups in late June. The National Health commission (NHC) said China’s annual production capacity of vaccines is expected to reach 610 million doses by the end of this year.China had informed the WHO about inoculating high-risk groups on June 29, Zheng Zhongwei, director-general of the NHC’s development centre for medical science and technology, told reporters on Friday.China approved the plan on June 24 and authorised emergency use of the vaccines on July 22. “After the approval, on June 29, we made a communication with representatives of the WHO Office in China, and obtained support and understanding from WHO,” Zheng said.‘London at tipping point’Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday said London is at a “very worrying tipping point” as officials revealed that the capital city is being placed on the UK-wide “watch list”. Khan said, “London is at a very worrying tipping point right now. We’re seeing a sharp rise in 111 calls (for medical care), hospital admissions and patients in ICU. The near-collapse of test and trace and the resurgence of the virus means new measures to slow its spread were absolutely necessary.”Meanwhile, Novavax has begun a late-stage trial of its potential vaccine in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-after-35-days/story-dQ9wl2RD4aCjASNJaeztlM.html

26-09-2020||World||New York City to let restaurants keep sidewalk dining all year||New York City’s “Open Restaurants” program, which allows outdoor dining for restaurants, will be extended to year round, the mayor’s office announced.The program, which started in June and had been set to expire Oct. 31, will now let restaurants expand seating to adjacent properties with consent. It also allows restaurants to use propane and natural gas heaters on sidewalks with a permit. Electrical heaters can be used in dining areas on both sidewalks and roads.New York City currently prohibits all indoor dining, but will allow restaurants to open indoor dining rooms at 25% capacity, beginning September 30.The program is a bid to help restaurants that have suffered amid social distancing during the outbreak of Covid-19. The industry has struggled to adapt as diners stay home and lower capacity rules put a limit on sales. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday enacted a more sweeping measure, allowing all restaurants and other businesses to reopen.Across the country, local leaders are grappling with the issue of reopening restaurants, and it has at times proven divisive. States are balancing the need to protect an industry, which generates nearly $900 billion annually in the U.S., with the need for social distancing in order to prevent the pandemic’s spread.“We already have well over 10,000 restaurants participating, well over 100,000 jobs have been saved,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an interview on WNYC announcing the decision. “We hope it’s going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive.”One New York restaurateur dismissed the initiative as too little, too late, and coming at no small cost.“You have to figure a tank of propane a night per table. A tank costs about $40; it only heats smaller areas. That’s around $3,000 a week in propane right there,” said Jeff Katz, owner of Crown Shy restaurant in New York’s Financial District. “Good luck getting a heater now if you haven’t gotten one. Everything online is like, we’ll ship in February.

The Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level with a meeting on the margin of the UN General Assembly last year.The upcoming ministerial meeting will be held at a time when all four members of the Quad have serious differences with China – India is engaged in a border standoff in Ladakh, the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war.During Friday’s video conference, the senior officials exchanged views on ongoing and proposed practical cooperation in connectivity and infrastructure development and security matters, including counter-terrorism, cyber and maritime security, to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.“The four democracies discussed ways to work together to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, promote transparency and counter disinformation, and protect the rules-based order the region has long enjoyed,” said a readout from the US state department.In an apparent reference to American efforts against Chinese telecom major Huawei, the US readout said the officials noted the importance of digital connectivity and secure networks and discussed ways to “promote the use of trusted vendors, particularly for fifth generation (5G) networks”. The officials also explored ways to enhance coordination on counter-terrorism, maritime and cyber security, regional connectivity, and quality infrastructure based upon international best practices, such as the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. They also highlighted the need to improve supply chains in sectors such as critical minerals, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, the US readout added.Both the Indian statement and the US readout reiterated the Quad’s firm support to the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Asean-led mechanisms in the regional architecture for the Indo-Pacific. The members of the Quad expressed their readiness to work with ASEAN and other countries to realise a common vision for the Indo-Pacific. The officials also explored ways to work together in the Mekong sub-region, in the South China Sea, and across the Indo-Pacific to support international law, pluralism, regional stability, and post-pandemic recovery efforts, the US readout said.China’s growing aggression and assertiveness has prompted the members of the Quad to step up efforts, both among themselves and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, to forge new supply chains and to enhance maritime security cooperation.The foreign secretaries of India, Australia and France co-chaired the first senior officials’ trilateral dialogue on September 9 to enhance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen multilateralism. On September 1, India, Australia and Japan agreed to launch an initiative to ensure the resilience of supply chains in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-senior-officials-discuss-efforts-to-ensure-open-inclusive-indo-pacific/story-xizzagQbljI7bOUOEhNsCK.html
26-09-2020||India||‘No morality, just political compulsion’: Punjab CM on SAD’s exit from NDA||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has termed the Shiromani Akali Dal’s decision to quit the NDA as nothing more than a desperate case of political compulsion for the Badals, who were effectively left with no other option after the BJP’s public criticism of the SAD over the farm bills.Referring to his earlier statement, in which he had pointed out that the NDA would throw the Akalis out if the latter did not leave gracefully, Captain Amarinder said there was no moral high ground involved in this decision of the SAD. He said the Akalis had no choice before them since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had already made it clear that it held SAD responsible for failing to convince the farmers about the goodness of the agriculture bills.“The SAD decision to quit NDA was just the culmination of their saga of lies and deception, which eventually led to them being cornered on the issue of the bills,” the chief minister said in a statement, adding that Sukhbir Singh Badal was virtually caught between the devil and the deep sea after his initial unprincipled stand on the farm ordinances, followed by the sudden U-turn in the face of farmer protests.Also read: Snapping over two-decades-long ties, SAD pulls out of NDA over farm bills The chief minister said with the BJP-led ruling coalition at the Centre exposing the SAD’s web of lies, fabrications and double-speaking, the Akalis could not have done anything except leave the NDA. But far from helping them save face, which they probably hoped to do, the Akalis will now find themselves in a bigger political mess, having been left with no place either in Punjab or at the Centre, he added.Captain Amarinder said if Sukhbir Badal, Harsimrat Badal and other SAD leaders had any shame left, they should admit to their deceitful actions as part of the Union government and should beg the farmers for forgiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-morality-just-political-compulsion-punjab-cm-on-sad-s-exits-from-nda/story-iZzDdBugNor0AXnmhJJMwI.html

They are shifted to hospitals if needed. We are allowing asymptomatic patients to remain under home quarantine, but they are moving out and infecting others,” Thackeray said.Thackeray said that there is a fear of a second wave as more people are now outdoors travelling for work and that additionally, there is a danger of senior citizens getting infected at homes by asymptomatic patients.The chief minister of the worst-hit state in the country also added that the state’s strategy should focus on mass awareness, tracing and testing.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally rose to 13,21,176 on Saturday with a single-day addition of 20,419 cases, the state health department said.With 430 more patients succumbing to the infection, the death toll in the state went up to 35,191, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-covid-19-second-wave-in-maharashtra-says-uddhav-thackeray/story-3v6SVckKlBlAKTQeZ0iYgM.html

Three days earlier, the Congress had alleged at a press conference that the family members of chief minister BS Yediyurappa were involved in graft, citing a sting operation by a private television channel.Leader of opposition Siddaramaiah led the charge in the assembly and alleged that the government had failed on all fronts including maintaining probity in public life. An angry Yediyurappa responding to Siddaramaiah and KPCC President D K Shivakumar’s charges and said that he would retire from public life if it was proved that either he or any member of his family were involved in corruption. “It is you who have levelled the charges. It is for you to prove the same. I will quit public life if it is proved that any member of my family was involved (in corruption).”The Congress had alleged that members of Yediyurappa’s family including his son Vijayendra who is a VP of the state unit of BJP, son-in-law Virupakashappa Maradi and grandson Shasidhar Maradi had collected Rs 17 crore as a bribe in a tender related to a Rs 666.22 crore Bangalore Development Authority construction project citing an alleged sting done by a local television channel.

Trouble began for Kodiyeri after Bengaluru drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad gave a statement to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in which he mentioned his name. He said Bineesh Kodiyeri, second son of Balakrishnan, had helped him a lot in his “business venture”. Later his name also figured prominently in the call list of Mohammad. Kodiyeri later admitted that he knew Mohammad and helped him in opening a hotel in Bengaluru but he was not aware of his alleged drug dealings. However, later the ED found that two shell companies floated by Kodiyeri, B Capital Solutions and B Capital Forex, were allegedly involved in many shoddy deals. Floated in 2015, both firms had failed to file tax returns and other formalities and the ED suspects these firms were floated for alleged money laundering and hawala transactions. The ED had questioned him for over 11 hours in Kochi on September 9. The notice sent by the ED deputy director in Kochi stated that no transaction of immovable assets should be carried out without prior permission of the investigating agency. The ED has also asked the state registration department to file details of all his properties. It is also probing his source of income and investments. Besides ED, there are reports that that he may be summoned to Bengaluru by the NCB. During investigation into the gold smuggling case, the ED has found that there is a close link between the smuggling and psychedelic drug cases. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment that came in the name of the United Arab Emirates consular office in Thiruvananthapuram. And the drug surfaced on August 28 after the arrest of Anoop Mohammad and two others in Bengaluru. There are also allegations that Kodiyeri helped Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the gold smuggling case, to flee from the state after the seizure of the gold. Later customs also found that one of those arrested in the gold smuggling case K T Ramees was in touch with drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad. The alleged involvement of the party secretary’s son has invited enough embarrassment for the ruling party and the secretary distanced himself saying, “Parents can’t be held responsible for grown up children’s doings.” Soon after the gold smuggling surfaced, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a detailed central agency probe. Now at least five central agencies are probing the smuggling and related cases-- the letter has put the CM in a tricky situation as most of those interrogated are close to the government-- former IAS officer M Sivsanakar, CM’s former IT fellow Arun Balachandran, state higher education minister KT Jaleel and party secretary’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri are among them. The party’s youth wing Democratic Youth Federation of India said the BJP government at the Centre was using central agencies to weaken a democratically-elected government. But the opposition Congress and BJP say central agencies came only after the CM’s letter. Having taken a big bite, the ruling party is in a position to either swallow or vomit it out, say political observers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-sends-notice-to-bineesh-kodiyeri-on-money-laundering-freezes-transaction-of-assets/story-lew5gfN6jgBupPhyEXPa8I.html

The BJP dismissed any political motive to this meeting.The meeting assumes significance as the Sena-led Maharashtra government is facing a lot of heat over Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case and frosty relationship between the ruling party allies as right-wing trolls have targeted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aaditya Thackeray.Also read: SAD quits NDA over farm bills, says party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal“Sanjay Raut wanted to meet Devendra Fadnavis to take his interview for party editorial Saamana, hence it was decided to meet once before the interview.

The interview will take place after Fadnavis returns from Bihar campaigning,” said BJP leader Pravin Darekar.Raut, a strong critic of the BJP, did not react to the media reports on the meeting.Political analysts point that the meeting meets more than an eye. “No one will just meet to discuss an interview. This seems more of a message by the Shiv Sena to its allies, the Congress and the NCP, that it still has good relations with the BJP,” said political commentator Hemant Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meeting-between-fadnavis-and-sanjay-raut-sparks-speculations-sets-tongues-wagging/story-4WYhTq3PV23li64Wj0YKpJ.html

26-09-2020||India||Reform in UN need of the hour, says PM Modi; questions global body’s response to Covid-19||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday expressed frustration at the pace of reform of the United Nations and its response to challenges such as terrorism and the Covid-19 pandemic, and questioned how long India would be kept away from a seat at the high table of the world body. In a pre-recorded video address to the UN General Assembly, Modi listed the reasons why India deserves to be part of the world body’s decision-making structures, including its contributions to peacekeeping missions, its history as a non-colonising power, its green initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, and its actions to ensure development and security in regions such as the Indo-Pacific. Both Pakistan and China, with which India is currently engaged in a months-long border standoff, found no direct mention in Modi’s 20-minute speech. There was only an indirect reference to China when he noted India’s partnerships aren’t directed against someone, and that its development partnerships come without the malafide intent of “making the partner country dependent or hapless”. ALSO READ | Where is the UN in joint fight against Covid-19 pandemic?: PM Modi at UNGAModi focused largely on the need to reform the UN, saying today’s world and contemporary challenges are significantly different from those of the era when the body was created in 1945. “Therefore, the international community today is faced with a very important question: Whether the character of the institution, constituted in the prevailing circumstances of 1945, is relevant even today?” he asked. “Reform in the responses, in the processes, in the character of the UN is the need of the hour...the people of India have been waiting for a long time for the completion of the reforms...Today, people of India are concerned whether this reform process will ever reach its logical conclusion,” he said. He questioned “how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the UN”, noting it is the world’s largest democracy with more than 18% of the global population. ALSO READ | For how long will India be kept out of UN’s decision-making structure?: PM Modi at UNGAWhile the UN has had several achievements in the past 75 years, there are several instances pointing to a “serious need for introspection”, such as wars, terror attacks and bloodshed. “Were the efforts of the UN sufficient during those times or are these efforts adequate even today?” he said. Turning to the global pandemic, Modi questioned whether the UN’s response had been effective. “Where is the UN in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?” he said. Modi cited historical and contemporary reasons to argue for a bigger role for India at the UN. He pointed to the country’s growing economic and strategic clout and the responsible role it has played in areas ranging from peacekeeping missions to helping other nations during the pandemic. “When we were strong, we did not trouble the world, when we were weak, we did not become a burden on the world,” he said. India’s philosophy of working for the interests of humankind, and not its own interests, has been the driving force of its policies such as “Neighbourhood First”, “Act East”, and “Security and Growth for All in the Region” (SAGAR), and its approach to the Indo-Pacific, he said. Amid the pandemic, India’s pharmaceutical industry sent medicines to more than 150 countries. “As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis,” Modi said. India is moving ahead with phase III clinical trials within the country and its neighbourhood, it will help all countries improve their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines, and its initiative for self-reliance in the post-pandemic era will be a force multiplier for the global economy, he added. Modi also highlighted his government’s domestic initiatives such as promoting women entrepreneurs, paid maternity leave, ensuring rights of trans-gender people, connecting 400 million people to the banking system, freeing 600 million people from open defecation, and providing access to free healthcare services to more than 500 million people. Looking to India’s future role as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Modi said the experience of the world’s largest democracy will be used for the benefit of the world. “India will always speak in support of peace, security and prosperity. India will not hesitate in raising its voice against the enemies of humanity, human race and human values – terrorism, smuggling of illegal weapons, drugs and money-laundering,” he said. India’s candidature for permanent membership of an expanded and reformed Security Council has been backed by all the current permanent members of the council barring China. India recently called for text-based negotiations within a fixed timeframe for UN reforms that would also ensure proper representation for African nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reform-in-un-need-of-the-hour-says-pm-modi-questions-global-body-s-response-to-covid-19/story-LxEPkUmm6AXNE1zh4qhjQI.html
26-09-2020||India||‘MSP not most preferred mode for farmers in Uttar Pradesh’: NITI Aayog study||Only a fraction of farmers in Uttar Pradesh sells their produce to government agencies taking the Minimum Support Price (MSP) route while the rest prefer to trade in the open market or deal with private agents, sometimes even below MSP for different reasons. MSP is the primary and immediate concern of farmers who are protesting the three agriculture reform bills passed by Parliament recently. They fear that after the enactment of new laws, the Centre may withdraw the safety net (MSP).“We cannot trust verbal commitment on MSP. The government must make a provision in the law itself guaranteeing that MSP will continue,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union state president Rajveer Singh Jadaun.Based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, the Central government declares MSP for around two dozen crops before their sowing seasons. The idea behind MSP is to give a guaranteed price and assured market to farmers and protect them from price fluctuations and market imperfections.Also read: Congress steps up attack on govt on labour codes, says it has removed security net for workersAlthough the MSP system is considered an important tool that protects farmers’ interests by assuring a threshold price to them, studies show that only a fraction of crops under MSP are sold to the government in UP where wheat and paddy are two major crops. “It is observed that 28 percent of farmers in Uttar Pradesh sold their grains under MSP, 63 percent sold their grains in the open market and the remaining 8 percent kept for their self-consumption. It has also been observed during the course of study that 82 percent of the farmers reported to have faced various limitations in selling their food grains/crops at MSP,” the NITI Aayog found in its ‘Evaluation Study of Efficacy of Minimum Support Price on Farmers’.The sample study was published in 2016 with a reference period between 2007-08 and 2010-11, covering farmers of 36 districts (six in UP) across 14 states.Ajit Kumar Singh, economist and former director of Giri Institute of Developmental Studies, said it was true that only a fraction of farmers sold their food grains to government agencies, the role of which was very limited.“Our survey revealed that farmers sold more than half of their produce to traders, 28.3 percent to the wholesalers, 25.8 percent to the village traders and only 14 percent to government agencies,” he said, quoting a study commissioned to him by UP’s planning department in 2010.Also read: Former Bihar DGP meets Nitish Kumar, may join JD(U) in run-up to pollsThese figures, according to him, indicated that agricultural marketing in the state was dominated by the traders and the role of government agencies was quite limited.“As a result, the farmers do not get a fair value of their produce,” he said.According to former additional director (food and civil supplies) AK Singh, sometimes farmers prefer to sell their food grain in the open market also because they get price above MSP.“In that sense, MSP is a useful system as sometimes forces private agencies to offer a better price to farmers,” he said.The NITI Aayog study also found that due to the unavailability of instant cash at MSP, small and marginal farmers preferred to sell to traders who made on the spot payments.“It was also found that sometimes, small and marginal farmers resorted to distress sales due to urgent need for money or to repay the loan taken before the sowing season. Some also pointed out that MSP was too low as it did not cover the rising farming costs,” the report said.Singh also found in his study that farmers faced a lot of problems in selling their produce in regulated markets. Nearly three-fourths of the farmers surveyed complained of undue deductions. Often, the produce was declared of lower quality and hence lower price is offered.“More than two-thirds of the farmers surveyed complained about the long distance from the market and lack of transport facilities. Delayed payment and false weighing were the other common problems faced by the farmers. About 20 percent farmers opined that they face problems in marketing as they have small surplus to sell,” he said.According to the NITI Aayog study, the respondents selected in UP villages were in favour of the continuation of MSP which indicated that in spite of all the lacunae in the process of implementation, people, on the whole, had benefitted from the MSP policy.Singh also said that MSP was an important mechanism that insulated farmers against market price fluctuations as well as for the government to buy wheat and paddy for the Public Distribution System (PDS) pool.“I, therefore, feel that farmers’ fears that the government may do away with the PDS system are a little exaggerated,” Singh stressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-not-most-preferred-mode-for-farmers-in-uttar-pradesh-niti-aayog-study/story-e3ZIGZ1yPTdu1rHoaVPoZJ.html
26-09-2020||India||Mukul Roy, CM Mamata’s former confidante made BJP vice president ahead of crucial Bengal polls||In a major rejig, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday elevated Mukul Roy, a former confidante of Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee to the post of vice president. Political experts see this as a move that could have a far reaching impact on the coming assembly polls in Bengal. BJP president JP Nadda announced the new team of the party’s national office-bearers on Saturday. Later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the new team members on Twitter. “The West Bengal elections are due in March-April next year and along with state president Dilip Ghosh and others, I will try to ensure a BJP victory in Bengal,” Roy said while thanking the party’s top leadership for reposing their trust in him. Roy who had joined the party in 2017, served as the convenor of the Bengal unit of the BJP’s election management committee for the 2018 panchayat polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was the party’s national executive before being appointed as the vice president. This move not only puts to rest the uncertainty that had cropped up over Roy’s role and position in the party but also completes a full circle. His elevation to the post of a national office bearer would come as a breather for a section of the TMC leaders who are inclined to shift to BJP. He also said that if he is made the convenor of the poll management committee during the 2021 elections, he would have a greater say and be in a more comfortable position in choosing candidates and deciding poll strategies. Another former TMC lawmaker Anupam Hazra has also been promoted to the rank of a national secretary. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with a BJP ticket from the prestigious Jadavpur seat in south Kolkata but lost to TMC’s Mimi Chakraborty. Hazra was the TMC MP from Bolpur before joining the BJP. BJP MP from Darjeeling Raju Bista was appointed the national spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-cm-mamata-s-former-confidante-made-bjp-vice-president-ahead-of-crucial-bengal-polls/story-xCNQeSFjMxj1kgAW5ftTvN.html
26-09-2020||India||Kangana Ranaut must be booked over anti-farmer tweet: Lawyer files complaint in Karnataka court||A lawyer has filed a complaint against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut in a local court in Karnataka’s Tumkur seeking the registration of a first information report (FIR) for her tweet on farmers opposing the farm bills, reports said on Saturday.According to LiveLaw, advocate Ramesh Naik filed the complaint over Ranaut’s September 21 message on her Twitter account. Naik in his plea, according to Live Law, alleges that Ranaut’s tweet has a clear intention to injure the people who are opposing the farm bills, “wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riots and promote the culture of non-violence in the young minds of society.”“....this posting on twitter account of the accused posted by her may lead to collision between the people of different group believe in different ideology. It seems that the government authorities have turned a blind eye to the same and does not have any established measures or rules and guidelines to control and regulate the same.

Mukul Roy, a former confidante of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, was given the post of a vice president. Another former TMC lawmaker Anupam Hazra was also promoted as a national secretary.Sinha posted two videos on Twitter in English and Hindi citing his disapproval over defectors from Trinamool Congress being assigned central leadership in the BJP.

26-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand BJP to go among farmers to explain ‘benefits’ of agri bills||Amid the ongoing protests by farmers and Opposition parties against the agriculture bills recently passed by the Parliament, Uttarakhand BJP will go among the farmers of the state through its Kisan Morcha to “explain its benefits”. The party also accused Congress of misleading the farmers.The decision was shared by party state president Bansidhar Bhagat in a virtual press conference at party headquarters in Dehradun on Saturday.“We will go among the farmers through our Kisan Morcha to explain them the three bills and make them aware of their benefits. The NDA government, under PM Narendra Modi, is the first to think about the welfare of the farmers and these bills are in regard to that only,” said Bhagat. He added that the party is likely to start the Kisan Morcha campaign from October first week.Describing the bills as “extremely beneficial” for the country’s farmers, Bhagat lashed out at the Congress for misleading the farmers.Also read: Five factors which could shape the Bihar poll results“Congress has never thought of the farmers’ welfare. Now when PM Modi and our Union agricultural minister has thought to empower them, it is spreading misconceptions and rumours about the three bills among the farmers,” he said.Bhagat, while assuring the farmers added, “The farmers need not worry and should be assured that PM Modi has worked in their favour only and not against them as claimed by the Opposition.”“It is ridiculous! The Congress had included the promises on the same in the 2019 elections manifesto and when our government has passed bills on them they are protesting. It is just a political gimmick,” he said.Meanwhile, the Congress said, “The NDA government has passed the anti-farmers bills by killing the democracy.”Pritam Singh, Congress state president said, “The NDA government passed the three bills under the uncontrolled addiction of power without thinking about the farmers. The manner in which it was passed in Rajya Sabha, it was the strangling of all Parliamentary procedures.”Singh said, “If Bhagat is accusing us of misleading the farmers then they should first explain why a minister from their ally Akali Dal resigned against those bills? He is saying that the party will explain the bills to farmers when they failed to do the same to their allies only.”Also read: Former Bihar DGP meets Nitish Kumar, may join JD(U) in run-up to pollsSingh lashed out at the BJP accusing it of working against the small farmers of the country.“The bills talk of opening the market for farmers but is it possible that a small farmer from the hills of Uttarakhand will sell his produce in Tamil Nadu or Maharashtra? Also, if it’s so beneficial for the farmers then why didn’t they add the provision of continuing the MSP in the bills?” he said.“Congress will march towards the Governor house against these agriculture bills on September 28 and continue to protest against them,” Singh stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-bjp-to-go-among-farmers-on-agri-bills-to-explain-benefits/story-yLc7svplCtY4iQMkBonYPI.html
26-09-2020||India||Political activities gain momentum ahead of bypolls in Uttar Pradesh||With the Election Commission of India set to take a call on the programme for by-elections in different states on September 29, political activities have gathered momentum in Uttar Pradesh.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday sounded the BJP’s poll bugle and visited two of the eight assembly seats where the by-polls are due.As this will be like a mini-assembly election in the state, the stakes are high for both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Opposition. The BJP had earlier bagged six of eight assembly seats that are now likely to go to polls. The remaining two seats were with the Samajwadi Party. The Bahujan Samaj Party’s decision to contest the by-elections will make the fight interesting on all the seats.“As a political party, we are consistently in touch with the people. We have the government’s achievements to take to the people. We are sure to perform well in the by-poll,” said UP BJP general secretary Vijay Pathak.Also read: Congress steps up attack on govt on labour codes, says it has removed security net for workersPathak’s assertions are, however, strongly countered by the SP and the Congress. While Yogi reached Malhani assembly constituency of Jaunpur and addressed BJP workers there at a meeting in a local school and reviewed preparations for the by-polls, the Samajwadi Party accused him of making attempts to mislead the people by misusing his office.“The chief minister may be only trying to mislead the people by misuse of power. The Samajwadi Party has been preparing for the by-poll for some time and SP national president Akhilesh Yadav will soon announce the party’s candidates for the by-polls,” said SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.“The BJP government’s announcements have no meaning. The party has failed on the promise of giving jobs to the youth and the dues of sugarcane growers are yet to be cleared. If the chief minister is serious about the cause of farmers, he should start the Betalpur sugar mill of Deoria that has been lying closed,” Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said.For his part, Yogi Adityanath called upon the party workers to focus on the booth level.“Focus on strengthening each and every booth. If we win the booth, we will win the election,” he said.“Jaunpur has been the karmbhoomi of Pt Deendayal Upadhyay. The previous governments ignored this district and the desired development did not take place here. The BJP government is committed to ensuring development. This is the government of all. Our aim is to develop and respect all,” he said in Jaunpur before proceeding to Deoria on Saturday.On Friday, the chief minister had laid foundation stones of a number of development projects in a video conference from Lucknow.Out of the eight seats likely to go for by-polls, five fell vacant following the death of the assembly’s sitting members, including two ministers Kamal Rani Varun (Ghatampur in Kanpur Nagar district) and Chetan Chauhan (Naugawan Sadat in Amroha district), BJP’s Janmejaya Singh (Deoria Sadar), Veerendra Singh Sirohi (Bulandshahar) and Samajwadi Party’s Paras Nath Yadav (Malhani in Jaunpur). The other seats include the one held by BJP member Kuldeep Singh Sengar (Bangarmau in Unnao). Sengar was disqualified after he was sentenced to a life imprisonment in a rape case.The Swar seat was declared vacant after the Allahabad High Court declared the election of SP’s Mohammad Abdullah Azam invalid. The Tundla assembly seat of Firozabad was declared vacant on June 4, 2019, following the resignation of UP minister SP Singh Baghel when he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Agra seat. The by-election to the Tundla seat could not be held so far because of a pending petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-activities-gain-momentum-ahead-of-bypolls-in-uttar-pradesh/story-GtUfX7VNFTs63v6wUezk0L.html
26-09-2020||India||Full text of PM Modi’s address at 75th UNGA session 2020||From asking pointed questions on reforms by the United Nations to hailing India’s Covid-19 vaccine production, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday covered domestic and international issues during his speech at the United Nations.PM Modi, in his 22-minute long address in Hindi during the general debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, made a stringent case for reforms at the global body and also sought for a larger share of India’s representation in decision-making at the United Nations.“For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations? How long would a country have to wait particularly when the transformational changes happening in that country affect a large part of the world?” he asked in his pre-recorded video statement.Also read | For how long will India be kept out of UN’s decision-making structure?: PM Modi at UNGA Here is the full text of PM Modi’s address:Respected President of the General Assembly. On behalf of over 1.3 billion people of India. I would like to congratulate every member country. on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. India is proud of the fact that it is one of the founding members of the United Nations. On this historic occasion, I have come to this global platform to share the sentiments of 1.3 billion people of India.Your ExcellencyThe world of 1945 was significantly different from today’s world. The global situation, sources-resources, problems-solutions; all were quite different. And as a result the form and the composition of the institution, established with the aim of global welfare, were in accordance with the prevailing situation of those times. Today we are in a completely different era. In 21st century, The requirements and challenges of our present as well as our future are vastly different from those of the past. Therefore, the international community today is faced with a very important question: Whether the character of the institution, constituted in the prevailing circumstances of 1945, is relevant even today? If century changes and we don’t, then strength to bring changes becomes weak. If we assess the last 75 years of the United Nations, we see several achievementsBut at the same time, there are also several instances that point to a serious need for introspection for the United Nations. One could say that we have successfully avoided a third world war, but we cannot deny that there have been several wars and many civil wars. Several terrorist attacks shook the world and there have been bloodsheds. The people who lost their lives in these wars and attacks were human beings, like you and me. Thousands of children, who would have otherwise enriched this world, left us prematurely. So many people lost their life savings and became homeless refugees. Were the efforts of the United Nations sufficient during those times or are these efforts adequate even today? The whole world is fighting the global pandemic of Corona for the last 8-9 months. Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?Your ExcellencyReform in the responses, in the processes, in the character of the United Nations is the need of the hour. It is a fact that the faith and respect that the United Nations enjoys in India are unparalleled. But it is also true that the people of India have been waiting for a long time for the completion of the reforms of the United Nations. Today, people of India are concerned whether this reform-process will ever reach its logical conclusion?For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations? A country, which is the largest democracy of the world, A country with more than 18% of the world population, A country, which has hundreds of languages, hundreds of dialects, many sects, many ideologies, A country, which was a leading global economy for centuries and also one which has seen hundreds of years of foreign rule.Your ExcellencyWhen we were strong, we did not trouble the world; when we were weak, we did not become a burden on the world.Your ExcellencyHow long would a country have to wait particularly when the changes happening in that country affect a large part of the world?Your ExcellencyThe ideals on which the United Nations was founded are quite similar to that of India and not different from its own fundamental philosophy. The words Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam, the whole world is a family, have often reverberated in this hall of the United Nations. We treat the whole world as one family. It is part of our culture, character and thinking. In the United Nations too, India has always given priority to the welfare of the whole world. India is the country, which sent its brave soldiers to about 50 peacekeeping missions. India is the country that has lost the maximum number of its brave soldiers in the course of establishing peace. Today every Indian, while seeing the contribution of India in the United Nations, aspires for India’s expanded role in the United Nations.Respected ChairmanIt was India that initiated the ‘International Day of Non-Violence’ on 02 October and ‘International Day of Yoga’ on 21 June. Similarly, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the International Solar Alliance are realities today due to efforts of India. India has always thought about the interests of the whole humankind and not about its own vested interests. This philosophy has always been the driving force of India’s policies. One can see the glimpses of this philosophy in India’s Neighbourhood First Policy to our Act East Policy, in the thought of Security and Growth for All in the Region, and in our approach towards the Indo Pacific region. India’s partnerships are also guided by this very principle. Any gesture of friendship by India towards one country is not against someone else. When India strengthens its development partnership, it is not with any malafide intent of making the partner country dependent or hapless. We have never hesitated from sharing experiences of our development.Your ExcellencyEven during these very difficult times of a raging pandemic, the pharma industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries. As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today, India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis. We are moving ahead with phase 3 clinical trials in India and in our neighbourhood. India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of Vaccines.Your ExcellencyFrom January next year, India will also fulfil its responsibility as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. I express my gratitude to all our fellow countries who have bestowed this trust upon India. We will use the prestige and experience of the largest democracy for the benefit of the whole world. Our path goes from human welfare to the welfare of the World. India will always speak in support of peace, security and prosperity. India will not hesitate in raising its voice against the enemies of humanity, human race and human values – terrorism, smuggling of illegal weapons, drugs and money-laundering. India’s cultural heritage, tradition, thousands of years of experience will always stand in good stead for the developing countries. India’s experiences, India’s developmental journey with its ups and downs will strengthen the way towards world welfare.Your ExcellencyIn the past few years, following the mantra of Reform-Perform-Transform, India has made great efforts to bring about transformation in the lives of millions of its citizens. These experiences are as useful for many countries of the world as they are for us. Connecting 400 million people to banking system in just 4-5 years was not an easy task. But India proved that it can be done. It was not easy to free 600 million people from Open Defecation in 4-5 years. But India achieved it. It was not easy to provide access to free health care services, within 2-3 years, to more than 500 million people. But India was able to do this. Today, India is one of the leaders in Digital Transactions. Today, India is ensuring empowerment and transparency by providing Digital Access to its millions of citizens. Today, India is implementing a huge campaign for tuberculosis-free India by 2025. Today, India is implementing a programme for providing piped drinking water to 150 million rural households. Recently, India has initiated a huge project for connecting its 6 Lakh villages with broadband optical fibre.Your ExcellencyWe are moving forward with the vision of “Self-reliant India” in the changed circumstances of the post Pandemic era. A Self-reliant India will also be a Force Multiplier for the Global Economy. Today, it is also being ensured that there is no discrimination in extending the benefits of all the schemes to every citizen of the country. Large scale efforts are being made in India to promote Women Enterprise and Leadership. Indian women, today, are the biggest beneficiaries of the largest Micro Financing Scheme of the world. India is one of those countries where women are provided Paid Maternity Leave of 26 weeks. The rights of Transgenders are also being secured through necessary Legal reforms.Your ExcellencyIn its journey towards progress, India wants to learn from the world as well as share its own experiences with the world. I am confident that on the occasion of its 75th anniversary, the United Nations and its member countries will endeavour with a strong commitment to maintain the relevance of this great institution. Stability in the United nations and empowerment of the United Nations are essential for the welfare of the world. On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, let us once again pledge to dedicate ourselves for the welfare of the world.Thank you||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-text-of-pm-modi-s-address-at-75th-unga-session-2020/story-8sOpyLIDesleUtIhRYdIWJ.html

26-09-2020||India||Congress steps up attack on govt on labour codes, says it has removed security net for workers||The Congress on Saturday upped the ante against the government over the three labour codes passed by Parliament on Wednesday, alleging that the legislations have weakened trade unions and removed the security net for workers. Senior Congress leader and former Union labour minister Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that the government’s claim that the laws will increase ease of doing business is false. “They have weakened trade unions and finished the security and safety for workers. Powers of states have been usurped by the Central government. These codes are anti-worker, anti-labourer and it is important to agitate against them,” he said, addressing a virtual press conference. Parliament on Wednesday approved the three labour codes that will remove impediments to winding up of companies and allow firing of staff without government permission in firms with up to 300 workers from the existing 100. “All parties must oppose these laws. The Modi government only listens to corporates and after these laws it will not listen to trade unions,” Kharge said. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged that this government is “betraying the interests” of different sections one after another. As the issue of injustice to farmers was ongoing, this government betrayed workers, just like farmers, he claimed. “The government made the excuse while bringing in the new labour laws there will be ease of doing business and it will be beneficial for all. But there is no protection and relief for workers in these laws,” Khera said. He said there is no provision for migrant workers in these legislations despite the country witnessing the hardships they faced during the lockdown. “It is in the DNA of the government to set aside democratic principles and force its decisions on the people,” Khera alleged. Addressing the reporters, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) president G Sanjeeva Reddy said they will protest and struggle against these “unjust, anti-labour and anti-trade union” laws. “These laws have been brought for strengthening and helping the capitalists and corporate not the workers. Under the new provisions, the workers will not be able to go on strike or raise their voice against unjust practices,” he said. Reddy said there was protection for workers earlier as permission was needed to lay off more than 100 workers, but now that “security net” is gone with the increase in threshold to 300. “About 2-3 crore small scale industries have been excluded from this protection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-steps-up-attack-on-govt-on-labour-codes-says-it-has-removed-security-net-for-workers/story-LtMsa9gm6ZpJymyGfgGxEM.html

His address in Hindi was a pre-recorded video statement which was broadcast at the UNGA hall in New York as it is being conducted mostly virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic.WATCH | PM Modi’s veiled terror jibe at Pak, China at UNGA; seeks UNSC seat: Full speech “Today, the people of India are concerned whether this reform process will ever reach its logical conclusion. For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations?” PM Modi asked at UNGA.It is a fact that the faith and respect that the UN enjoys among the 1.3 billion people in India is unparalleled, he pointed out.“When we were strong, we were never a threat to the world.

India will focus on the “5 S approach” of samman (respect), samvad (dialogue), sahyog (cooperation), shanti (peace) and samriddhi (prosperity) during its stint as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.Need for changeHe also said that the United Nations need to change its reactions, arrangements and appearance to stay relevant. “Today we are in a different era all together... There is a big question in front of the whole world community that whether the institution that was formed under the circumstances of that time is still relevant today,” PM Modi said during his address.“If we evaluate the achievements of the United Nations in the last 75 years, many achievements are seen. There are also many examples, which raise the need for serious introspection in front of the United Nations,” Modi said. “Reform in the responses, processes and in the very character of the UN is the need of the hour,” he added.He also said India is proud to be one of the founding members of the global body.Pakistan’s responsePM Modi’s speech came after his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan’s reference to Kashmir and criticism of the Indian government in his address to the UN General Assembly. Khan had on Friday made repeated references to India and the Kashmir issue in a pre-recorded video statement. The Pakistani leader had called on the world community to prosecute Indian personnel allegedly involved in “state terrorism” and “crimes against humanity” in Jammu and Kashmir.India had dismissed Khan’s reference, saying the neighbouring country’s unrelenting support to terrorism poses a threat to global security. The Indian delegate present in the General Assembly, Mijito Vinito, first secretary at the Indian mission to the UN, had walked out as Khan’s video statement was being played.India subsequently exercised its “right of reply” to respond to Khan’s speech. “Let me assert here loud and clear: The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. The rules and legislation brought in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir are strictly internal affairs of India,” Vinito, said.“The only dispute left in Kashmir relates to that part of Kashmir that is still under illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all those areas that it is in illegal occupation of,” Vinito, a diplomat from the 2010 batch of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), said. Vinito said Khan’s address marked a “new low” on the 75th anniversary of the UN.The theme of the debate for 2020 is - ‘The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-addresses-the-united-nations-general-assembly/story-ih3AjqRVqJabeEOXzYGUbJ.html

Because that is what the Ministry of Health needs to buy and distribute the vaccine to everyone in India. This is the next concerning challenge we need to tackle,” Poonawalla tweeted. Quick question; will the government of India have 80,000 crores available, over the next one year? Because that's what @MoHFW_INDIA needs, to buy and distribute the vaccine to everyone in India. This is the next concerning challenge we need to tackle. @PMOIndia“I ask this question, because we need to plan and guide, vaccine manufacturers both in India and overseas to service the needs of our country in terms of procurement and distribution,” he said.I ask this question, because we need to plan and guide, vaccine manufacturers both in India and overseas to service the needs of our country in terms of procurement and distribution.Serum Institute, the world’s largest vaccine maker by the number of doses produced, is working on several vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease - including potentially mass-producing the one from AstraZeneca-Oxford University that has garnered global headlines - as well as developing its own.US biotech firm Codagenix Inc said on Tuesday that Serum Institute of India has started manufacturing its potential Covid-19 vaccine and it expects to begin the early-stage human trial of the vaccine by the end of 2020 in the UK. Serum Institute will develop Codagenix’s CDX-005, which is delivered intranasally rather than via injection.Three more India-made Covid-19 vaccines are set to enter human trials, according to an official of the Center’s department of biotechnology that is supporting the development of several experimental coronavirus vaccines in the country.The new vaccine candidates are from Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, Biological E and Bharat Biotech, which has developed one of the two already in clinical trials. The fifth Indian vaccine candidate to clear preclinical phases is by Zydus Cadila.More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally, with 38 in human trials, and candidates from Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are already in late-stage trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-the-govt-have-rs-80-000-crore-for-covid-19-vaccines-sii-s-adar-poonawalla-asks/story-1q2ryAX6W9hDMq4YXNSGAM.html

This development comes at a time when the state government is going tough on Ansari and his gang members.The suspect sent multiple messages on the WhatsApp number of the state police integrated emergency service UP 112 three days ago, police officials said.The officials said the sender threatened to ‘remove’ the state government if Ansari was not released from jail within 24 hours. They said the messages were received on UP 112’s WhatsApp number between 9.56 and 10.11 am on Wednesday.The Lucknow police media cell said the accused was identified as Etah resident Amarpal, a truck driver by profession, and the threat messages were sent by him as a mischievous act.

26-09-2020||India||UP, Bihar top two beneficiaries of PMGK scheme announced in March||Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar have been the two biggest beneficiaries of the free ration – cereals and pulses -- distributed under Rs 1.7 lakh crore Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) announced in March to provide immediate relief to the poor in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.While UP distributed about 34.98 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of food-grains among over 150 million from April 1 to September 7, Bihar gave 17.28 lakh MT to over 80 million, according to data compiled by the Union finance ministry.Maharashtra is the third on the list in terms of offering free food-grains to the poor during the pandemic followed by West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh (MP).The relief package announced on March 26 aimed to ease the economic distress of the poor by providing them free food and cash security. Among other things, the government promised free distribution of 5 kg wheat or rice to about 800 million individuals every month and 1 kg of pulses per month to every family till June this year. Later, the scheme was extended till November.Also Read: Vigilance panel formed to ensure fair distribution of subsidised food grains in ChandigarhUnder the scheme, Maharashtra has distributed 15.35 lakh MT of grains among 70 million as of September 7, West Bengal over 12.19 lakh MT of grains among over 60 million poor, and MP 10.62 lakh MT grains among over 50 million people.When it comes to the number of people getting pulses for free, UP tops the list with over 30 million beneficiaries availing 1.39 lakh MT pulses, followed by Bihar over 10 million people getting 54.23 thousand MT pulses.“So far 178.85 lakh MT of foodgrains and 6.82 lakh MT of pulses have been distributed free of cost to approx 75 crores [750 million] beneficiaries under NFSA [National Food Security Act] and this scheme will continue till November 2020,” minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur told the Lok Sabha last week.Besides distributing foodgrains for free, the Union government has so far provided cash assistance of Rs 68,820 crore to 420 million poor under PMGKP till September 7, he said. The package is a part of Rs 20.97 lakh crore comprehensive stimuli the government had announced between March and May this year.“UP and Bihar have been given the maximum advantage in this distribution. Perhaps it is because of how larger groups of beneficiaries were identified in these states,” said Vasundhara Sirnate Drennan, co-founder and director of research at The Polis Project Inc, a New York City headquartered non-profit think-tank.“However, it could also point to the distribution of patronage to states for political reasons which are something we should always keep in mind. India has long been identified as a patronage democracy where public goods are seen as tradable commodities for political gain.”Many state and national governments have practised this in India over time, she said. “So, this isn’t new. However, as always distributional biases of this nature are to be viewed as a part of emergent populist politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-bihar-top-two-beneficiaries-of-pmgk-scheme-announced-in-march/story-ga0LNR6cG3iwKWM7xfzW2H.html

26-09-2020||India||Union government temporarily retained Rs 47,272 crore GST cess||The Union government had temporarily retained Rs 47,272 crore excess Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) pending reconciliation, which cannot be construed as a diversion as the money was fully utilised in providing compensation to states, two officials said.The amount collected as GST compensation cess has not been used for any other purpose, the officials working in the finance ministry said requesting anonymity.They were commenting on observations of a recent report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that pointed out “short crediting” of Rs 47,272 crore cess in the non-lapsable GST Compensation Cess Fund. The amount was collected for 2017-18 and 2018-19.Also Read: Farmers have lost all faith in PM Modi-led govt: Rahul Gandhi“The short-crediting was a violation of the GST Compensation Cess Act, 2017. The amount by which the cess was short credited was also retained in the CFI and became available for use for purposes other than what was provided in the act,” said the CAG report on ‘Accounts of the Union Government’, which was tabled in the Parliament on September 23.The finance ministry “accepted the audit observation” and told CAG in February this year that the proceeds of cess collected and not transferred to the Public Account would be transferred in the subsequent year, the report said.Explaining the technical nuances of short crediting, the report said: “Short crediting of cess collected during the year led to overstatement of revenue receipts and understatement of fiscal deficit for the year. Further, any transfer in the subsequent year would become an appropriation from the resources of that year and would require Parliamentary authorisation.”One of the officials mentioned above said, “In all earnest, there has been no diversion of funds, whatsoever as to the compensation due to the states for the year 2017-18 and 2018-19 were fully paid and the time taken in the reconciliation of compensation receipts can’t be termed as diversion of GST Cess Fund when the dues to states were fully released by the Centre.”Also Read: Most states choose Rs 97k crore borrowing to plug GST deficitThe CAG, in its report, has not said that the cess was diverted, he said. “The amount collected under-compensation cess fund has been regularly and fully distributed to states as per their dues and budgetary provisions and by the end of July 2020 everything has been accounted for and released,” he added.The Union government had released the entire Rs 1,65,302 crore as GST compensation for 2019-20 to states by July this year even as the actual collection in the fiscal year was only Rs 95,444 crore.“To release the compensation for 2019-20, the balance cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 was also utilised. In addition, the Centre had transferred some amount from CFI to meet the requirement,” a second official said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco commodities.The officials said the government makes all efforts to transfer all amounts collected by the end of every financial year into designated funds by making necessary budget provisions.“The amount of cess collected first gets collected in CGI since Article 266 requires that all amounts collected by the Centre should get credited to the CGI. It is further transferred to the Compensation Cess Fund through a budget head. However, since the final accounts of amounts collected are known only after the end of the financial year, normally by the end of June next year after necessary reconciliation, any amount collected over and above the estimate, will remain in CFI temporarily,” the first official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-government-temporarily-retained-rs-47-272-crore-gst-cess/story-EiBMV7pyfN8CFJWvl90z4N.html
26-09-2020||India||PM Modi holds virtual bilateral summit with Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa||India on Saturday asked Sri Lanka to fully implement constitutional provisions aimed at giving more powers to Tamil-inhabited areas of the island nation even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a grant of $15 million for promoting Buddhist ties between the two sides. Sri Lanka’s peace and reconciliation process figured in the first virtual bilateral summit between Modi and his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, which also focused on maritime security, countering the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the development of the strategic Colombo East container terminal. Modi called on Rajapaksa’s new government to work “towards realising the expectations of Tamils for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka by achieving reconciliation nurtured by implementation of the constitutional provisions”, according to a readout from the external affairs ministry. He also emphasised that implementing the “13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution is essential for carrying forward the process of peace and reconciliation”, the readout said. At a media briefing after the hour-long summit, joint secretary (Indian Ocean region) Amit Narang said India has always stood for peace and reconciliation, “including through the full implementation of the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution” and this point was highlighted by the Indian prime minister. The 13th amendment, an outcome of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka peace accord, is aimed at devolving more powers to the Tamil minority. Rajapaksa and his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, have shied away from committing to full implementation of the amendment. They have also hinted they won’t go against the wishes of the Sinhala majority while working on any resolution in Tamil-inhabited areas. Modi announced a grant of $15 million for promoting Buddhist ties between the two sides. The grant will be used for construction and renovations of Buddhist monasteries, archaeological cooperation, reciprocal exhibitions of Lord Buddha’s relics, and supporting the Buddhist clergy. India will facilitate the visit of a delegation of Sri Lankan Buddhist pilgrims in the first inaugural flight to the sacred city of Kushinagar, which now has an international airport. The contentious issue of the development of the Colombo East container terminal under a trilateral agreement signed by Sri Lanka, Japan and India in 2019 also figured in the talks, with Modi expressing confidence that the Sri Lankan government will take “early and decisive steps” for the early implementation of infrastructure and connectivity projects in line with existing understandings. Narang described the discussions on this issue as “positive and constructive”, and said: “Both sides remain committed to these ventures and are working towards ensuring their implementation for mutual benefit.” Last month, workers at Colombo port stopped work to protest what they described as the privatisation of the container terminal. They also sought a written pledge from the Sri Lankan president that the facility wouldn’t be handed over to India. The agreement on the container terminal was signed by the previous government and the current administration has put it on hold. This was Modi’s first virtual summit with the leader of a neighbouring country, and the Indian delegation included external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. This was the Sri Lankan premier’s first bilateral engagement with a foreign leader after the victory of his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party in parliamentary elections in August, and he was assisted by foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena, fisheries minister Douglas Devananda and other ministers and senior officials. The two sides agreed to extend an MoU on high impact community development projects by India for five years from 2020, and to continue the Indian housing project. The two leaders instructed officials to fast-track the construction of 10,000 houses in Sri Lanka’s plantation sector. While discussing the economic impact of the pandemic, Modi and Rajapaksa underlined the need for close coordination on trade and investment and deepening the integration of supply chains. Modi expressed hope that Sri Lanka’s temporary restrictions on imports of some products will be relaxed soon. India recently provided a $400-million currency swap facility to Sri Lanka’s Central Bank to tackle Covid-19-related disruptions, and an additional request for a bilateral currency swap of around $1 billion and the deferring of debt repayments were being discussed, Narang said. The Indian side also proposed a bilateral air travel bubble, he said, adding: “We feel that early resumption of travel will assist in their economic recovery.” The two leaders also discussed security and defence cooperation and agreed to further strengthen cooperation on personnel exchanges and training, maritime security cooperation and India’s support to Sri Lanka in defence and security. The recent coordination by the armed forces of both sides in controlling the fire on the merchant vessel MT New Diamond, which was carrying a crude oil cargo of 270,000 MT, was acknowledged as an example of practical collaboration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-holds-virtual-bilateral-summit-with-sri-lankan-counterpart-mahinda-rajapaksa/story-RqdQDFOFLCw1s5NAJhXcWP.html

The men died in hospital.The charge sheet names former SHO of Sathankulam police station S Sridhar, two sub-inspectors K Balakrishnan and P Raghuganesh, two head constables S Murugan and A Samadurai, and four constables M Muthuraja, S Chelladurai, X Thomas Francis and Veyil Muthu for criminal conspiracy, murder, wrongful confinement, destruction of evidence and levelling false charges. All nine are currently lodged in jail. Sub-inspector Pauldurai, whom the agency arrested in July and who died in jail due to Covid-19, has not been accused in the charge sheet but his role has been mentioned in the alleged conspiracy, officials said.P Jayaraj (59) and his son J Bennicks (31) were arrested on June 19 and lodged in Kovilpatti sub-jail for keeping their mobile phone shop in the main market of Sathankulam town open during a curfew imposed during the Covid-19-induced lockdown.The father and son were allegedly tortured during the police custody after which they were admitted to the Kovilpatti government hospital on June 22. While Bennicks died the same night, Jayaraj breathed his last on the morning of June 23.The incident had led to massive public outrage across the country with demand of action against the accused police officers. The Tamil Nadu government ordered a CBI probe in the first week of July, after which a special team was sent to investigate the custodial death.CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said, “A CBI team camped at Madurai and worked untiringly through Covid-19 pandemic.”In fact, nine CBI officers were infected with Covid-19 while investigating the case.Sharing details of charge sheet, Gaur said, “The investigation revealed that the father-son duo were arrested on June 19, 2020 and tortured at the Sathankulam police station by the accused in the evening as well as in the intervening night, consequent to which both of them succumbed to the injuries and died in the intervening night of June 22 and 23”.Officials who didn’t wish to be named added that Sathankulam police station officials, “to cover up their misdeeds, not only destroyed the evidence of torture but also registered false cases against both the deceased on the allegations that father and son had not closed their mobile shop even after the permitted time and thereby violated general prohibitory orders.”This officer added that role of others in the deaths as well as subsequent cover-up is being further investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thoothukudi-custodial-deaths-cbi-files-charge-sheet-naming-9-police-personnel-for-torturing-father-son/story-g2KgTLkPzRCCv1yRa17VzK.html

Singh, on Friday, also wondered why the Central Bureau of Investigation was delaying registering a murder case despite the tell tale signs.Maneshinde responded by demanding that the CBI constitutes a new medical board to keep the investigation “impartial and free from any inference”.“The disclosure of a 200% conclusion by an AIIMS Doctor in the team headed by Dr Gupta in the SSR case, on the basis of photographs, is a dangerous trend. To keep the investigations impartial and free from inference, the CBI must constitute a new medical board,” said Maneshinde.He went on to suggest that the sensational claims made by Singh could be linked to Bihar elections.“The agencies are being pressurised to reach a predetermined result for obvious reasons on the eve of Bihar Elections. We have seen the VRS of DG (Gupteshwar) Pandey unfolding a few days back. There should not be a repetition of such steps,” said Maneshinde. Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s family feels probe is going into different direction: LawyerThe latest round of war of words between the two sides started with Vikas Singh’s tweet on Thursday morning, stating: “Getting frustrated by the delay in CBI taking a decision to convert abetment to suicide to Murder of SSR. The Doctor who is part of AIIMS team had told me long back that the photos sent by me indicated 200% that it’s death by strangulation and not suicide.” Later in a press conference on Thursday, according to ANI, Singh had said that Rajput’s family is disappointed that the investigation in the case has been derailed and what had begun as a probe into the circumstances leading up to Sushant’s death on June 14, had transformed into an investigation into an alleged drugs subculture in the film industry. “The family feels that the investigation is going in such a way that the truth is not coming out. The NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau) case has become like the Mumbai Police investigation, all stars are now being called. It is just a Mumbai Police type of investigation. Sushant’s case has taken a back seat,” the lawyer said, according to news agency ANI. Also Read: Mukul Dev on the Bollywood drug nexus case: Look at it as a cleaning drive, not slandering of the film industryVikas Singh also demanded that the forensic response of the AIIMS team involved in the probe should be made public and questioned why the investigative agency had not held a press conference till date.“Why is CBI not converting this to murder from abetment? The investigation is not on track. I will not say I am not happy with CBI, but it’s the lack of importance that the case is getting is what I am worried about. The forensics response of the AIIMS should be made public that is what will satisfy the family,” he said. Dr Sudhir Gupta, the chief of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences forensic team conducting an examination of Sushant’s death case, has rejected these claims. “No conclusion or conclusion opinion of homicide or suicide could be made by seeing ligature marks and scene of occurrence. It’s difficult for doctors and next to impossible for general people...,” he was quoted as telling Times Now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-says-agencies-pressured-in-sushant-case-before-bihar-polls/story-s8mgUh5Q7HtyTaz5QYNkcI.html

He also claimed that the agencies were being pressurised to reach “pre-determined results” in view of the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.“The disclosure of a 200% conclusion by an All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) doctor on the forensic team headed by Dr Sudhir Gupta in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, on the basis of photographs, is a dangerous trend. To keep the investigations impartial and free from inference, the CBI must constitute a new medical board. The agencies are being pressurised to reach a pre-determined result for obvious reasons in view of upcoming Bihar elections. We have seen the VRS of DG (Gupteshwar) Pandey unfolding a few days back. There should not be a repetition of such steps,” said Maneshinde. Maneshinde was responding to a tweet by Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh. “Getting frustrated by the delay in CBI taking a decision to convert abetment to suicide to murder of SSR. The doctor who is part of AIIMS team had told me long back that the photos sent by me indicated 200% that it’s death by strangulation and not suicide,” he claimed in a tweet.In a press conference held on Thursday, Singh had said that the family of late actor Rajput was disappointed that the investigation had derailed. “The family feels that the investigation is going in such a way that the truth is not coming out. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) case has become like the Mumbai Police investigation, all stars are now being called. The people called in and not are a part of a syndicate and not distributors. It is just a Mumbai Police type of investigation. Sushant’s case has taken a back seat,” Singh said, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-should-set-up-new-medical-board-to-look-into-rajput-s-death-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer/story-K5NhlmIPYgRL3glmE1ElCO.html
26-09-2020||India||UN General Assembly: India dismisses Pakistan PM’s criticism on Kashmir issue||India has dismissed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s reference to Kashmir and criticism of the Indian government in his address to the UN General Assembly, saying the neighbouring country’s unrelenting support to terrorism poses a threat to global security. In his pre-recorded video statement to the UN General Assembly on Friday, Khan made repeated references to India and the Kashmir issue and called on the world community to prosecute Indian personnel allegedly involved in “state terrorism” and “crimes against humanity” in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian delegate present in the General Assembly, Mijito Vinito, first secretary at the Indian mission to the UN, had walked out as Khan’s video statement was being played on a large overhead screen. India subsequently exercised its “right of reply” to respond to Khan’s speech, and the response was delivered by Vinito, who said: “Let me assert here loud and clear: The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. The rules and legislations brought in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir are strictly internal affairs of India. Also Read: PM Modi to address UNGA today, expected to urge global action against terrorism“The only dispute left in Kashmir relates to that part of Kashmir that is still under illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all those areas that it is in illegal occupation of.” Vinito, a diplomat from the 2010 batch of the Indian Foreign Service who hails from Nagaland, also referred to Pakistan’s track record in failing to effectively counter terrorism. “What should rather be on the agenda of the UN is Pakistan’s deep state and its unrelenting political and financial support to terrorist organisations and mercenaries, which are a threat to global peace and security,” he said. “The only way for Pakistan to become a normal country is to abjure its moral, financial and material support to terrorism, turn its attention to the problems faced by its own population, including its minorities, and stop misusing UN platforms to further its nefarious agenda.” Khan’s address, Vinito said, marked a “new low” on the 75th anniversary of the UN. “The leader of Pakistan today called for those who incite hate and violence to be outlawed. But, as he went on, we were left wondering, was he referring to himself?” he added. The General Assembly had “heard the incessant rant of someone who had nothing to show for himself, who had no achievements to speak of, and no reasonable suggestion to offer to the world”, and instead Khan offered “lies, misinformation, war mongering and malice”, the Indian delegate said. Also Read: Indian diplomat walks out after Imran Khan raises Kashmir issue at UN“For a nation that is deeply buried in medievalism, it is understandable that the tenets of a modern civilised society such as peace, dialogue and diplomacy are farfetched,” Vinito said. The Indian response pointed out that Pakistan had “brought genocide to South Asia 39 years back when it killed its own people”, and the country is “shameless enough not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetrated even after so many years”. Vinito added, “This is the same country that provides pensions for dreaded and listed terrorists out of state funds. This is the same country that has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN.” He noted that Khan had once referred to slain al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden as a “martyr” in Pakistan’s Parliament, and admitted in the US in 2019 that Pakistan still has 30,000 to 40,000 trained terrorists who have fought in Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir. “This is the country that has systematically cleansed its minorities including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and others, through the abuse of its blasphemy laws and through forced religious conversions. For someone who professes to be a champion of Islam, this is also a country that has encouraged killing of fellow Muslims merely because they belonged to a different sect, or to a different region in Pakistan, and through sponsoring terrorist attacks against its neighbours,” Vinito said. “The only crowning glory that this country has to show to the world for the last 70 years is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism, and clandestine nuclear trade,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address the UN General Assembly through a video statement on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-general-assembly-india-dismisses-pakistan-pm-s-criticism-on-kashmir-issue/story-iHmPmEZ8AKaTSTh450OViP.html

His jibe came in the backdrop of allegations that the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who hailed from Bihar, is being used as an election issue in Bihar.“Elections in Bihar should be fought on the issues of development, law and order, and good governance, but if these issues have exhausted, then issues from Mumbai can be sent as parcel,” the Shiv Sena leader said. The state police departments of Bihar and Maharashtra locked horns over the investigation into the death of Rajput who was found dead on June 14 at his Mumbai residence. Former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey accused Maharashtra Police of not co-operating with them. It is also being speculated that Pandey may join politics after he took a VRS. The Shiv Sena may contest in the Bihar polls, Raut hinted. “Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a call on Shiv Sena contesting the Bihar elections in coming 2-3 days. The election in Bihar is held on caste and other things. Labour laws or farmers bills will not be an issue in Bihar elections,” Raut said on Friday. The Shiv Sena leader has been made a party in the case pertaining to the demolition of Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut’s office.The MP has recently criticised the questioning of several Bollywood personalities by the Narcotics Control of Bureau in a drug case related to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-elections-2020-issues-from-mumbai-can-be-sent-as-parcel-to-bihar-says-sanjay-raut/story-mFKYlmvU3LU6mkjVoqYTNL.html
26-09-2020||India||Centre analyses police response during lockdown, says they showcased humane side||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has analysed the response of Indian police during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly during the 68-day lockdown, saying the personnel showcased their humane side and went beyond the call of duty. The ministry, however, has failed to mention anything about police excesses on the migrant labourers, who walked hundreds of kilometres from urban centres to their villages. In a special compendium titled The Indian Police Response to Covid-19 Crisis, published last week, MHA’s think-tank Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has stated that police forces in states/Union territories, as well as central paramilitary forces, not only ensured a strict lockdown and meticulously tracked Covid-19 patients, but also played a key role in the distribution of goods and supply of essential services to migrant labourers and donated plasma for patients. Also Read: Study links worsening of Covid-19 with shorter time span from symptom onset to hospitalisationIn the report, BPRD said that when the lockdown, announced from March 25, and its multiple extensions impacted the livelihood of unskilled migrant workers, and lakhs of workers walking home posed a serious threat to themselves as well as others in their hometowns, police counselled them about exercising restraint and provided them with food, shelter medicines, footwear and arranged transport for their return. They were all thermally screens and tested for Covid-19.It added that police officers went beyond the call of duty and even performed last rites of Covid-19 patients. “Some police officers even transported pregnant ladies to hospitals in police vans. WhatsApp groups were formed to communicate with expecting mothers and providing them assistance in case of discomfort during the pandemic. In some instances, police personnel even purchased birthday cakes and celebrated birthdays at the house of kids/senior citizens etc.,” the document states. The police forces, the compendium states, extensively used state-of-the-art technology, including drones, to identify vulnerable access points across porous borders, containment zones and to enforce lockdowns. “CCTV systems were used at important and sensitive locations for keeping a close watch at quarantine centres and violation of laid down procedures including social distancing norms. Geo-mapping coupled with Geo-tagging corresponding to the area of interest was used by law enforcement agencies for effective tracking of those in quarantine and for zeroing in on location of their contacts,” BPRD analysis stated. It cited the example of Bengaluru, wherein the whole city was geo-mapped for grocery, vegetable, medical outlets, community kitchen, donors, NGOs, etc. The police across the country also extensively used social media like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter to disseminate government orders/guidelines as well as to dispel fake news and rumours. “Digital media platforms comprising websites, blogs, portals and customised mobile apps targeting specific segment of population were launched as well,” the document states. Almost all police departments across the country also used public awareness programmes to educate people about social distancing and the use of masks and sanitiser, according to BPRD. To publish the document, BPRD took into account comments from all states and paramilitary forces detailing the various schemes and ways they devised to deal with the situation. It added that around 400 police personnel across the country had lost their lives due to Covid-19 while 76,000 were infected with the virus till August. Maharashtra topped the list with 12,760 cases so far. Prakash Singh, a retired IPS officer, said, “I agree with the BPRD analysis because police definitely did an excellent job during the lockdown, particularly while dealing with the migrant crisis. Even PM Narendra Modi has acknowledged their contribution. Police were on the frontline during the lockdown.” Former Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar agreed as well. He said, “Undoubtedly, police personnel went beyond the call of duty during the lockdown. First of all, managing such a huge lockdown is a challenge in itself. Then the cops provided every possible help they could.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-analyses-police-response-during-lockdown-says-they-showcased-humane-side/story-AQPyWIPy2vrxBeWsgxCx6K.html
26-09-2020||India||‘Humble persona is SP Balasubrahmanyam’s true legacy’, says Oscar-winning sound engineer||My last text to SP Balasubrahmanyam was on August 8, wishing him well. He replied, “We will meet soon”. I didn’t know that it would be the last response from him. I am just so shocked and devastated by his loss that it’s hard for me to describe what he meant to me, and what his impact has been on me, as a musician and as a human being. I remember listening to the song Ek Duje Ke Liye (1981) on a cassette my brother-in-law brought from the Gulf. I remember listening to it and being in awe of the man with such uniquely melodious voice. I still play the same tape, and the song in my house. I believe that someone, who has mastered the art of saat sur (seven notes) which go from nabhi to uchi, has seen Lord Brahma. And I believe SP Balasubrahmanyam saw Lord Brahma. I said the same thing on the stage in February this year, when I saw people gathering in huge numbers just to touch his feet at an event in Thrissur, Kerala. I believe, only when you have seen Brahma, can you have such an impact on the masses. And his impact was across generations. I remember him believing in my work, and whatever I wanted to do. I always wanted to work with him, but we kept missing each other. There was just so much that I wanted to learn from him about music. I also remember, during one of his concerts, a guitar player’s instrument was not tuned correctly. SP Balasubrahmanyam apologised to the crowd on stage, asked them for some time, went to the guitarist, told him that it is okay and he can take his own time to tune it back. Imagine the nervousness the guitarist must be going through when he was playing the mistuned guitar, and how he was immediately put at ease by the very man he was getting nervous for! This is one of the qualities of a person who is a higher being. I mean, apart from his legacy in music, which is unparalleled, his unassuming, humble and calm persona is what I think is his true legacy. I remember in 1995, as a kid, we were going to music studios, as a part of the curriculum. And I remember visiting his studio. That was the first time I saw him, live. His first concern was not even related to music. It was if all of us had food. That, I think, says everything about him. He was always so kind, so humble, had no airs about what he had achieved, and was always such a positive personality. I regret not working with him. I regret not getting the chance to work with him. I think he left us too soon. There was so much left that he could have taught us, not just through his music, but through his personality. I know, wherever he goes, he will continue to leave an impact, and mesmerise everyone with his uniquely melodious voice.

26-09-2020||India||Legendary SP Balasubrahmanyam dies aged 74||Legendary playback singer SP Balasubrahmanyam, who blurred boundaries of language by recording 40,000 songs in 16 languages in a career spanning five decades, died in a Chennai hospital on Friday. He was 74. The singer was admitted to hospital last month after he contracted Covid-19, tested negative on September 4 but suffered a cardio- respiratory arrest on Friday. He died at 1.04 pm, announced his son SP Charan. “SPB belongs to everyone. He will live on in his songs,” Charan added. Born Sripati Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam at Nellore in coastal Andhra Pradesh on June 4, 1946, SPB (as he was popularly known) wanted to become an engineer but dropped out to pursue his dream. He made his professional debut in 1966 in a Telugu film. Accolades quickly followed, bringing him six national awards for songs performed in four languages -- Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. His 54-year-long career included stints as a musician, composer, producer and voice-over artist, even actor but it was his distinctly melodious voice that won him millions of fans across India. “Where did you go Balu? I asked you to get up and come. You didn’t listen to me. Have you gone to sing for angels? For me world is empty now,” music maestro Illaiyaraja said. SPB and Illaiyaraja, one of India’s best music composers, were bandmates in the 1970s in a Chennai band. The singer will be cremated at 11 am on Saturday with state honours at his farm house in Red Hills on the outskirts of Chennai. The Tamil Nadu government said a memorial will be erected for the singer.In Chennai, a pall of gloom descended as news of his death spread. Fans crowded the hospital and people were seen crying on the streets humming “Paadun Nila“ (singing moon) as he was known as after one of his hit songs in Tamil.He won the Padma Shri in 2001 and the Padma Bhushan, the nation’s third-highest civilian award, in 2011. For legions of fans, SPB was the voice of actor Kamal Haasan, not only dubbing for his films in Telugu but singing songs for him, most notably in the 1981 blockbuster “Ek Duje Ke Liye”. “Like everyone else, he has been a part of my romance, melancholy, part of my happiness, first love and marriage as well,” Haasan said, referring to SPB as his brother. In Bollywood, he was known as the voice of actor Salman Khan – a partnership that began with the 1989 hit Maine Pyar Kiya and peaked in the 1994 blockbuster Hum Aapke Hain Koun! “Heartbroken to hear about #SPBalasubrahmanyam sir... you will forever live on in your undisputed legacy of music!” Khan tweeted. The versatile performer collaborated with cinema’s top composers, including MS Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman, who said that he was “devastated” by the news.He was also known for his generosity, with former chess world champion Viswanathan Anand paying tribute to him for being “my first sponsor” at a 1983 tournament. “Really sad to hear about the passing away of such a great yet simple person,” Anand tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legendary-sp-balasubrahmanyam-dies-aged-74/story-Vagsw0l3vt0ulqfCX2VGaL.html

Vande Bharat Mission (VBM), which started in May, facilitated repatriation and outbound travel of nearly 18 lakh citizens, according to aviation ministry data. “Moving towards Pre-COVID figures. Congratulations to all stakeholders on achieving this milestone!

The seventh phase of VBM will begin in October.Frequency, capacity Domestic passenger flights are now operating at their 60 per cent of pre-Covid capacity. When domestic services resumed on May 25, after a gap of two months, they were not allowed to operate more that 33 per cent of their capacity, which in June was increased to 60 per cent. Several cities initially put a cap on the number of flights arriving. In a staggered manner, these restrictions have been relaxed leading to an increase in domestic traffic.Internation air traffic got a leg-up after India started signing air bubbles with specific countries allowing both-way traffic. At present, India has air bubbles with 14 countries.Baggage rulesAirlines are now allowed to implement their own check-in baggage policies instead of one check-in bag of up to 20 kg per passenger — a rule that was put in place when domestic flights commenced on May 25.

To this end, India must rescind the measures it has instituted since August 5 in 2019, end its military siege and other gross human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.” During his virtual address, Khan raised the Kashmir issue and criticised the Indian government, which the prime minister has done in several of his recent speeches. “The Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India.

Our struggle will continue till recently passed farm bills are not withdrawn,” Pandher said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-roko-farmers-agitation-in-punjab-enters-third-day-extended-till-september-29/story-uzbaBrLn6GTbrZOhL8PFML.html

26-09-2020||India||BJP treads cautiously with SAD: Partnership could be in question||The fissures that have emerged in the ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) are all set to deepen with the latter intensifying its attack against the BJP government over the recently passed farm bills. The bitterness and the war of words that erupted after the BJP and the Shiv Sena, also an old ally, failed to reach an agreement over power-sharing in Maharashtra, has been noticeably missing after cracks emerged in the ties between the BJP and the SAD. But while the BJP is still treading with caution, referring to the SAD’s tirade against it as “political compulsion”, the SAD has taken its criticism of the bills a notch higher. On Friday, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said at a rally in Punjab, “During World War 2, the US shook Japan up with an atomic bomb. Akali Dal’s one bomb (resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal) has shaken up the Modi government. For the past two months, there was no word on farmers, but now as many as five ministers are speaking on the issue.” Also Read: Farm bills anger spills onto highways, railwaysThe SAD pulled out its only minister from the Narendra Modi cabinet in protest against the government pushing through the new legislations in Parliament. Though the BJP said it is ready to address all SAD’s concerns about the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance the Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the SAD is pulling no punches in its disapproval. The BJP, on its part, has decided to focus attention on creating awareness about the new legislation’s benefit to farmers. “They have nothing to lose and the statements they are making stem from political compulsions. It is not right for the BJP to join issue with their ally,” said a senior party functionary. Exiting the coalition: Will they, won’t they?The question, however, is if the disagreement would pave the way for the exit of another BJP ally from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). According to SAD’s Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral, though there is pressure from the cadre to pull out, the party will not take a hasty decision. “We are mindful that we are a border state and we cannot destabilise the situation. Our cadre is pushing us to break away from the NDA, but we will not rush into it. We will take a decision, which is in the interest of the people of Punjab and our country,” he said. Also Read: ‘Will challenge farm bills in Supreme Court’: Punjab finance ministerThe SAD leader also explained that the party voiced its concerns to protect the interests of the farmers. “In any coalition, all partners’ ideology cannot be the same. Whenever we have disagreed on issues that were contrary to our thinking, such as the attack on minorities or the Delhi riots, we spoke up. But we have never made stipulations. We spoke up so that we could stick to the core of our ideology. The farm bills affect us, our workers and leaders are farmers, how could we not speak up?” Gujral said. Communication issues While the government claims that the bills were adequately discussed, and has rolled out a massive outreach led by Union ministers to dispel concerns about the bills, allies claim there has been little by way of communication. “The NDA this time is unlike the NDA of the [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee era. There is no consultative process, we never meet and there are no coordination meetings. We found out about the ordinance only when it was put before the Cabinet where our minister protested. We said the bills are not in the interest of farmers, not in the least in Punjab. And because our concerns were not addressed, it was not feasible for us to stay in the government,” Gujral said. Shiv Sena’s Lok Sabha MP Vinayak Raut echoed the SAD’s view that the BJP does not take its allies into confidence. “When we were part of the NDA, there were no meetings of the allies. To have a meeting of the leaders at the Business Advisory Committee is not the same as keeping allies informed and taking their views into consideration,” Raut said. Ahead of the upcoming Bihar elections in October, the Lok Jan Shakti Party, another ally, has been stoking a controversy by criticising a third ally, the JDU in the state, indicating that all is not well within the NDA in the election-bound state. The BJP has had to step in to settle squabbles between two allies, which has given fodder to the Opposition in the state. The BJP functionary quoted above said the allegations of BJP not being amenable to allies have been made to score a point. “We have always treated allies with respect and kept them informed,” the functionary said. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also instructed party workers to reach out to farmers across the country to dispel the “misleading” accusations made by the Opposition. All BJP Karyakartas should reach out to the farmers on the ground and inform them in very simplified language about the importance and intricacies of the new farm reforms, how these will empower them. Our ground connect will bust the propaganda being spread in the virtual world. pic.twitter.com/LuofRKzL5dHunt for new allies Before the BJP snapped ties with the Shiv Sena in 2019, with which its equations saw many ups and downs over the years, it parted ways with the Telegu Desam Party. In March 2018, Chandrababu Naidu’s party decided to break its ties with the BJP and pulled out two of its ministers—Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chaudhary—from the Modi cabinet. The TDP, which had been an ally of the BJP in the southern state for nearly four years, broke away following the Centre’s decision to not grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh. At that time, there was speculation that the BJP could warm up to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), which won the 2019 assembly polls in the state. Rakesh Reddy, BJP’s spokesperson in Telangana, said the party has never had friendly ties with the TRS before or after the carving out of Telangana state. He said the BJP has been fighting the TRS on the ground for the last six years and is equally distant from both the TRS and the TDP. “We are a strong contender in the state and have already begun preparations for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections scheduled early next year. When we allied with the TDP, a party that was opposed to the carving out of Telangana, we suffered in the elections,” he said. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) is counted as a friendly party in Parliament, the BJP asserts that the bonhomie is limited to support for “issues” and does not indicate forging an alliance. “There has been talk of BJP tying up with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Odisha, but these parties have contested against the BJP in their respective states. They have supported some bills in Parliament, because those were issues they agreed on. If every instance of support is indicative of an alliance, then what about the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which supported the BJP on Jammu and Kashmir reorganisation, but differs on other issues?” said a second BJP functionary. A changed NDA What the allies called a changed complexion of the NDA, Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) called the new working style. “They have numbers on their side, but this is the government’s new style of functioning. They want to be seen as decisive and not given to negotiations or talks once they have made up their mind about an issue,” he said. The complaint from allies of being left out, he said does not “create a good impression” but has not “adversely affected” the BJP so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-treads-cautiously-with-sad-partnership-could-be-in-question/story-zfZXwj7y9KTArYeL1OJk7L.html
26-09-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput probe: No drugs consumed at July 2019 party, says Karan Johar, clarifies no ‘aides’ probed by NCB||Filmmaker Karan Johar on Saturday issued a statement saying he neither consumes any narcotics substance nor does he promote or encourage its use. He also rubbished reports that claim two persons being questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with the drug link in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death are his “close aides.”Johar’s name sprang up in Bollywood’s alleged drug links with politician Manjinder Singh Sirsa renewing his claims that a ‘drug party’ was hosted at the director’s residence in July last year. The director-producer, however, dismissed the allegations as baseless and fake. “In view of the current malicious campaign. I am reiterating that the allegations are completely, baseless and false. No narcotics substance was consumed in the party. I WOULD LIKE TO UNEQUIVOCALLY ONCE AGAIN STATE THAT I DO NOT CONSUME NARCOTICS AND I DO NOT PROMOTE OR ENCOURAGE CONSUMPTION OF ANY SUCH SUBSTANCE,” he said in a statement on Instagram. Johar also stated, “several media / news channels have been airing news reports that Kshitij Prasad and Anubhav Chopra are my aides/close aides. I would like to place on record that I do not know these individuals and neither of these two individuals are “aides” or “close aides” NEITHER I, NOR DHARMA PRODUCTIONS CAN BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. THESE ALLEGATIONS DO NOT PERTAIN TO DHARMA PRODUCTIONS.” His clarification comes in the backdrop of film executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad and assistant director Anubhav Chopra being quizzed by NCB in connection with the drug link in Rajput’s death on June 14. Johar wrote that Chopra wasn’t an employee at Dharma Productions and was only briefly associated with them for two months as a second assistant director for a film between November 2011 and January 2012 and then as an assistant director for a short film in January 2013. Prasad, Johar said, joined Dharma Productions’ sister concern Dharmatic Entertainment in November 2019 as one of the contract basis for a project which eventually did not materialise. Prasad and Chopra’s name came up during the interrogation of Powai hotelier Ankush Arneja, an alleged drug peddler, who was arrested by NCB on September 13. NCB had recovered 42 grams of hashish and cash Rs1.12 lakh from his Powai home. Arneja is accused of selling drugs to high-profile individuals.With several Bollywood celebrities under NCB’s scanner, the central agency has so far questioned actor Rakul Preet Singh, celebrity manager Shruti Modi, Rajput’s former talent manager Jaya Saha, Deepika Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash and film producer Madhu Mantena among others. Summons have also been issued to Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, and fashion designer Simone Khambatta.Actors Rhea Chakaborty, her brother Showik are among the 18 people who have been arrested by NCB in connection with the drug-related angle in Rajput’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-probe-no-drugs-consumed-at-july-2019-party-says-karan-johar-clarifies-no-aides-probed-by-ncb/story-cOVeHEvloxeHdaKkRjvcaK.html

26-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Over the past week (till September 24), the seven-day average of daily new cases of Covid-19 has fallen by around 7,000 in India. By itself, this is important for two reasons.One, it has never happened before in India, although it has in other countries. The US (the closest comparison to India by size, geographical area, and number of Covid-19 cases) has seen two peaks (and two troughs), with cases on the rise again (the seven-day average is the highest in that country since early September). The Indian numbers are from HT’s database and the US ones from The New York Times’s. In contrast to the US, India’s numbers have never fallen – until now, that is.Two, 7,000 is a significant number, whichever way you look at it, and already there have been a few seemingly analytical pieces celebrating the slowing of cases in India. The tone of some of these suggests that we can stop worrying — and start living.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn early September, it looked like it would only be a matter of days before India saw at least 100,000 daily new cases of Covid-19, but that hasn’t happened (which is definitely cause for some cheer). But it isn’t easy to translate these numbers into some intelligence on which way the pandemic’s curve is headed. There’s a reason why.Over the two weeks to September 24, India’s Covid-19 numbers have not stuck to script , and show no discernible pattern. Until then, it was easy to predict what the number would be even a month down the line. Indeed, HT’s Covid-19 data specialist Jamie Mullick correctly predicted the dates when India would cross 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 million cases. India ended September 24 with a total of 85,909 cases, and September 25 with 85,506. And most people have got their 6-million date prediction horribly wrong. That’s because, over the past two weeks, India’s daily new case numbers have fluctuated, from a low of 74,693 on September 21 to a high of 97,932 on September 16. In the same period, the number of tests has fluctuated even more wildly, from a low of 731,534 tests on September 20 to a high of 1,492,409 (almost 1.5 million) tests on September 24. Not surprisingly, the positivity rate (the number of people testing positive expressed as a proportion of the tests conducted) has been volatile too – from a low of 5.7% on September 24 to a high of 11.9% on September 20. As the chart accompanying this column shows, even the movement within this range has been jagged, not unidirectional.There has been no change in testing protocol or anything else that can explain this behaviour (or rather misbehaviour) of the numbers.Sure, several states and Union Territories continue to rely on unreliable rapid antigen tests, which they continue to use in contexts where the use of these makes little sense, but they were doing this even in July and August. Regular readers of this column will know that this is one of my pet peeves — but my objection is based on science and math. Rapid antigen tests have a high proportion of false negatives — the identification of infected individuals as uninfected, and any state or UT using a lot of them is artificially (and disingenuously) pushing down the positivity rate, apart from allowing a lot of infected people to walk around (infecting others). Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar continue to depend on these for the bulk of their testing.My fear is that the home ministry, which is expected to issue new guidelines for what is called Unlock 5.0 over the weekend or sometime next week, may use this data as the basis. Sure, the pandemic may be slowing in India, but we have no way of arriving at this conclusion based on the numbers of the past two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-oQp0Yx56Kq7JquZgblaruO.html
26-09-2020||India||Covid-19: How nasal, one-shot and passive vaccines work||In the ongoing race for an effective Covid-19 vaccine, several pharma companies are exploring off the beaten path. Johnson & Johnson is conducting a trial of a single-shot vaccine, while traditional vaccine candidates require two shots. Bharat Biotech has announced manufacturing of intranasal vaccine, which will set it apart from the intramuscular ones.Here is all you need to know about these non-traditional vaccinesNasal vaccinesMost Covid-19 vaccine candidates are intramuscular where the shots are injected into the muscles. This process requires medical professionals, equipment etc. Intranasal vaccines can do away with this. It can be self-administered thereby reducing cost. Bharat Biotech has inked a licencing agreement with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, the US, for such vaccines.“We are proud to collaborate on this innovative vaccine. We envision that we will scale this vaccine to one billion doses. Individuals can be vaccinated by a single dose regimen. An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but also reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc, significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director (MD), Bharat Biotech.Also Read: China aims to make 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses a yearOne-shot vaccinesThe vaccines being developed by Moderna, Pfizer, and Astrazeneca are all double shots which are being administered to participants in a gap of several weeks. Johnson & Johnson and the intranasal vaccine Bharat Biotech is collaborating will be single shots. Like intranasal vaccines, these are also aimed at making the process easy. “The benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,” Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, told Reuters.A single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, Johnson & Johnson’s interim results published on Friday claimed.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine: When will US get its first vaccine?Passive vaccinesDevelopment of passive vaccines for Covid-19 is a possibility as scientists have identified highly effective antibodies against the novel coronavirus.Unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time.The scientists at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin isolated almost 600 different antibodies from the blood of individuals who had overcome COVID-19, reported PTIThis is the mechanism in which plasma therapy works, but scientists are now exploring whether this can be used for the immunisation of people who are not yet infected by Covid-19.

26-09-2020||India||Manmohan Singh birthday: Former prime minister turns 88||Dr Manmohan Singh, veteran Congress leader and former prime minister who ran a coalition government between 2004-2014, turns 88 today.Before he became the prime minister, his brightest moment was ushering in the 1991 economic reforms under the Narasimha Rao government. He was Rao’s finance minister.The 1991 Budget is feted by many as one that laid the foundations of a modern India and the roadmap for pushing economic reforms in the country. However, Singh never stopped to share the credit with his boss PV Narasimha Rao.“It was a hard choice and a bold decision and it was possible because Prime Minister Narasimha Rao gave me the freedom to roll out things, after he fully understood what was ailing India’s economy at that time,” Singh, who has also been held the post of the RBI Governor during his celebrated career, was quoted as saying by the PTI at Rao’ centenary celebrations.Here’s everything you need to know about one of Congress’ greatest stalwarts-- Singh was born on September 26, 1932 in the Punjab province of Pakistan before the partition of India.--He studied at the Panjab University, University of Cambridge and obtained his doctorate in economics from the University of Oxford. He later taught at the Panjab University as well as Delhi School of Economics, and the University of Delhi.--Dr. Manmohan Singh served as the 13th Prime Minister of India between 2004 and 2014 after the UPA defeated the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. The economist served as the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha from 1998 to 2004.--The Indian economist also served as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 1982 to 1985.-- Singh has held several key posts including the chief economic advisor between 1972 and 1976 while was the head of the Planning Commission from 1985 to 1987.-- Dr. Singh also worked with the United Nations twice, once from 1966 - 1969, as economic affairs officer for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). His second stint in the UN from 1987 to 1990 was as the secretary general of the South Commission, which is an intergovernmental organisation of developing economies.--He is currently a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manmohan-singh-birthday-former-prime-minister-turns-88/story-pyDk16kFshKsyuaKgxUA5M.html
26-09-2020||India||J&K police set up SIT to probe killing of advocate Babar Qadri in Srinagar||Jammu and Kashmir Police on Friday formed a five-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the killing of advocate Babar Qadri in Srinagar a day earlier, officials familiar with the matter said.Police said that Qadri was at his home when two persons, wearing masks, came as clients. “They called the lawyer saying that they have an accident case and wanted some suggestions. As the lawyer came down they fired upon him . He died on the way to hospital,” said Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar in a press conference.Doctors said Qadri had sustained bullet wounds on his neck, near the eye, under his arm and on his arm. The militants also fired in the air while fleeing. “We are analysing CCTV footage from the lane and are trying to ascertain which outfit is responsible for the attack. The SIT will be headed by SP Hazratbal,” he said.The SIT has been asked to find which militant outfit is involved. “We will attempt to arrest them, if they are not caught, we will try to neutralise them in an encounter. This case is our top priority,” the IGP said.Just hours before his death, Qadri in a Facebook live had said he had been receiving intimidating messages after he had written against the High Court Bar Association president over bar elections. He said he feared for his life and had urged the police to register an FIR against a social media user who had accused Qadri of being ‘projected by agencies’ on Twitter. The IGP said that Qadri had ‘unfortunately’ tagged the Jammu police handle instead of Kashmir police handle. “If he had called ….or shared his threat perception with us, we would have taken some action,” he said.The IGP said Qadri was not a protected person but in 2018, his car was fired upon. “His relative, who works with the police, and local police officers had requested him to not live in Hawal, which is a congested area and difficult to patrol. He was not ready to leave his home,” he said.JeM hand suspected in CRPF officer’s killing Kumar said officer said the attack on CRPF personnel in Budgam district on Thursday morning was suspected to be the handiwork of a Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit.“On Thursday morning, a CRPF patrol was carrying out routine work in Budgam when it was fired upon. One of our ASIs was killed in the attack. We suspect JeM involvement in the case. An M4 was used to fire on the officers. The weapon is usually used by JeM,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-set-up-sit-to-probe-killing-of-advocate-babar-qadri-in-srinagar/story-9EnwBdS32ankiIyYEx3kIJ.html

She later told the NIA that Rs one crore was the commission she got for clinching a deal with an international aid agency ‘Red Crescent’ which funded the project in Vadakancherry in Thrissur district. She said gold was gifted to her during her marriage.Also read: PM Modi’s speech at UNGA to focus on global push to counter terrorLater a news channel controlled by the CPI(M) came out with more revelations claiming Rs 4 crore was paid as commission in the Rs 20 crore project. Later it came to light that no permission was taken from the Union government for accepting the foreign contribution. The anti-corruption unit of the CBI has registered a case under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). When the issue snowballed into a controversy, the state government maintained that it will not come under the purview of the FCRA.Though the issue came to light almost two months back, the state government had announced a vigilance probe into it only two days ago. State opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had also written several letters to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking a copy of the agreement but he got it only a couple of days back.The Congress and the BJP have sought a CBI probe into alleged irregularities into the project but chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said they were plotting to sabotage the project intended to help the poor.“It is time for the CM to quit before the CBI comes knocking at his doors,” said Chennithala. But the ruling CPI(M) maintained it was least bothered over the latest probe. The CM also said the government will go ahead with the project.

State higher education minister KT Jaleel later claimed that these packets contained only religious books and he took them to his constituency for distribution. But the Opposition alleged that some consignments also carried gold and Jaleel was using holy books to cover up his illegal act. The minister was questioned twice by the probe agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-faces-more-heat-as-cbi-to-probe-housing-project-scheme/story-xwGb7indkQztkL1a6wmauJ.html
26-09-2020||India||EC sets stage for India’s 1st Covid-era elections in Bihar||Seventy-two million people will vote in three phases over 11 days in late October and early November to choose a new government in Bihar, the Election Commission of India announced on Friday, setting the stage for India’s first mass poll after the Covid-19 pandemic struck the country.Voting in one of the world’s largest electoral exercises in the Covid-19 era will be conducted on October 28, November 3, and November 7. Results for the 243-member assembly will be announced on November 10. “The elections are a leap of faith, not a leap in the dark,” said chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, announcing unprecedented guidelines and arrangements to regulate the processes of nomination, campaigning, voting and counting — to keep the raging pandemic that has claimed around 900 lives in the state at bay.  In the first phase, 71 constituencies will go to the polls with 31,000 polling stations set up. In the second phase, 94 constituencies will vote with 42,000 polling stations dedicated for it. In the third phase, 78 constituencies will have 33,500 polling stations. Arora said 700,000 units of hand sanitisers, 4.6 million masks, 600,000 personal protective equipment suits, 760,000 face shields and 2.3 million gloves would be given to the polling staff. The commission has also acquired 72 million single-use hand gloves for voters.The previous election, held over five phases in 2015, saw 58% of the electorate exercising their franchise. Arora said the commission reduced the number of phases because of large-scale of deployment of security forces and sweeping Covid-19 protocols.“As a commission, we don’t regard it as a misadventure... it is a very, very meticulously worked exercise from our side,” the CEC said, citing the example of the recently-held JEE and NEET and saying thousands of candidates from various district across India attended the examinations. He also referred to a recent Supreme Court observation, saying life had to go on.The Bihar assembly was slated to lapse on November 29. The election will see chief minister Nitish Kumar seek a fourth consecutive term. His Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Lok Janshakti Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and smaller parties form the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which will square off against a fractured Grand Alliance led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and comprising the Congress, Left parties and others. In the previous election, when Kumar’s JD(U) was an ally of the RJD, the Grand Alliance won a thumping victory against the BJP — securing 178 seats against the latter’s 58. But in 2017, Kumar broke away from the alliance and joined hands with the NDA.One of India’s more impoverished states, Bihar is currently battling the aftermath of devastating floods that displaced 8 million people. The return of thousands of migrant workers during the pandemic is also set to change the electoral map in large parts of the state. Arora said 230,000 migrant workers were added to the voter rolls. Polling time was also increased by an hour, from 7am to 6pm. “As the pandemic spreads across the world, the first reaction was to postpone elections hoping that the pandemic would lose grip and they can conduct the elections in more conducive environment,” Arora said. “More than 70 countries initially postponed their elections.” He added: “However, as days and months passed and the pandemic showed no signs of abating, it became evident that some way will have to be found to balance democratic rights of citizens to choose representatives, while making a systematic effort to protect the health and safety of the electors.”Also read| Bihar polls: CEC warns social media firmsThe CEC said he wanted to dispel doubts that there would only be virtual campaigning and that district election officers had already identified places where gatherings could take place following social distancing norms. “The propaganda that only virtual meets will take place during campaigning is way off the mark,” he said.The announcement of poll dates was welcomed by all political parties — including those that earlier demanded that the election be postponed until the pandemic is over. Senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav said the NDA will repeat its Lok Sabha performance of winning 39 of the 40 seats from the state. “The NDA is going to win this election with a three-fourth majority,” he added.RJD MP Manoj Jha welcomed the commission’s decision but raised a few concerns. Congress MP and Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil said the Grand Alliance will form the government. “The people of Bihar want freedom from the BJP and JD(U) and today the EC has announced the day on which they will obtain their freedom,” Gohil said.With announcement of the election dates, the model code of conduct stands enforced. The EC will stringently enforce the code, especially the declaration of the criminal antecedents for which it has already announced a detailed schedule.The EC has already announced a slew of changes in the processes of nomination, campaigning, voting and counting to ensure distancing to contain the spread of the virus.Candidates can fill nomination forms and pay money online and only two people are allowed to accompany during the process. Door-to-door campaigning is limited to five persons, convoys are restricted to five vehicles and grounds for public meetings need to be have earmarked circles for audience, along with masks, sanitisers and thermal scanning. Nodal officers will be appointed to ensure no overcrowding.On voting day, a maximum of 1,000 electors will be allowed in a polling station, which will need to be sanitised a day before. If during thermal checking, a voter is seen running a high temperature, she will be asked to come back during the last hour of polling. Quarantined voters, disabled, essential workers and those above 80 will be given postal ballots. All, except the latter, will be also be allowed to cast their vote in the last hour of polling day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-sets-stage-for-india-s-1st-covid-era-elections-in-bihar/story-48vK8OgLctnFIgoOkyItdO.html
26-09-2020||India||Three more India-made Covid-19 vaccines to enter trials||Three more India-made Covid-19 vaccines are set to enter human trials, according to an official of the Union government’s department of biotechnology that is supporting the development of several experimental coronavirus vaccines in the country.The new vaccine candidates are from Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, Biological E and Bharat Biotech, which has developed one of the two already in clinical trials. The fifth Indian vaccine candidate to clear preclinical phases is by Zydus Cadila. “There are several vaccine candidates in different stages of development, some are at a very early stage. But three vaccine candidates are finishing up their pre-clinical study and will soon enter human trials,” said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology (DBT), which is the nodal agency coordinating the vaccine development initiatives in the country.Swarup added that government-level talks are also underway on the Russian vaccine, which is among five to have been given early approval for use in people. Globally, there are 38 vaccine candidates in human trials, in addition to around 150 more that are undergoing testing in animal subjects.Russia is the only country to have approved a Covid-19 vaccine, although experts have questioned the scientific wisdom of doing so without large scale safety and efficacy tests in large groups of people. In addition, emergency approval has been granted to four vaccines, two each by China and the UAE, for limited use among some people. In addition to Bharat Biotech’s first vaccine candidate and the one by Zydus Cadila, a phase III trial of the vaccine candidate developed by Oxford university and British pharma company AstraZeneca is underway in India as part of a production- and testing deal with Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). The three vaccines Swarup referred to follow separate mechanisms to elicit and immune system response. Gennova’s shot uses the mRNA platform, which works by inserting a genetic code to prompt the body into making copies of what is known as the antigen protein. The antigen protein is a portion of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (the pathogen that causes Covid-19), which trains the body into recognising and fighting the pathogen. So far, no mRNA vaccines have been approved across the world but one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates, from Moderna, uses the same platform. The Biological E vaccine uses a protein subunit — which involves injecting an isolated protein of the virus to prime the immune system. The second Bharat Biotech candidate uses an inactivated rabies virus to deliver a viral protein of Sars-CoV-2 to achieve the same effect. Bharat Biotech’s first candidate uses an inactivated version of Sars-Cov-2, a strategy that is one of the oldest to develop vaccines. Zydus Cadila’s vaccine uses a DNA plasmid to replicate portions of Sars-Cov-2 to teach the body to recognise it. According to a submission in Lok Sabha in the monsoon session, DBT has allocated ₹75 crore to support at least eight vaccine candidates in the country.For testing whether a vaccine candidate works, pre-clinical studies are done in animals to see whether it is safe and can produce immune response. This is followed by a small phase I trial to study safety in humans, a phase II trial to see whether it produces an immune response, and large phase III trial to see whether the vaccine can actually prevent the disease. Both phase II and phase III trials also focus on safety. Swarup said that data from clinical trials of a plant-based pharmaceutical product and whether the anti-tubercular BCG vaccine protects against Covid-19 will start coming in too. “The initial study of the phytopharmaceutical should start coming in soon, the data is being analysed. As for the study to see whether BCG is protective against Covid-19, the vaccines have already been administered and the follow-up has started. The initial data should start coming in from this study as well,” said Dr Swarup.Several studies, including one by scientists from JNU, has shown that the BCG vaccine does increase protection against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-more-india-made-vaccines-to-enter-trials/story-SL6NJ73n3vOpnIeR8Z0JFL.html
26-09-2020||India||PM Modi’s speech at UNGA to focus on global push to counter terror||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the UN General Assembly on September 26 is expected to focus on India’s priorities as a member of the Security Council during 2021-22 and the promotion of global action against terrorism, people familiar with developments said on Friday. Modi’s address will be in the form of a video statement broadcast at the General Assembly hall in New York since most events are being held virtually against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. He is listed as the first speaker for the general debate in the forenoon of Saturday. Among India’s priorities during the 75th session of General Assembly are promoting the strengthening of global action to counter terrorism, and this is expected to be reflected in the prime minister’s speech, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “India will push for more transparency in the process of listing and delisting of entities and individuals by the UN sanction committees,” said one of the people. The prime minister is also expected to focus on the issues India will focus on during its stint as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for two years beginning January 1, 2021. This includes the “5-S approach” of samman (respect), samvad (dialogue), sahyog (cooperation), shanti (peace) and samriddhi (prosperity), the people said. India will also focus on inclusive and responsible solutions for global peace and security, an effective response to international terrorism, “NORMS” or the New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System, technology for all and streamlining of UN peacekeeping operations, the people added. “Being one of the largest troop contributing countries, India will seek to engage intensively in finalising the mandates of UN peacekeeping missions,” the person cited above said. The theme of the 75th UN General Assembly is “The future we want, the United Nations we need, reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting Covid-19 through effective multilateral action”. The people further said India will continue its engagement on issues related to sustainable development and climate change, promote the country’s role as a health service provider, and highlight its contribution to global cooperation against Covid-19 in the form of aid to more than 150 countries. India will also focus on its role as a South-South development partner, especially in the context of the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, and reiterate its commitment to the global partnership under SDG 17, including on climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-speech-at-unga-to-focus-on-global-push-to-counter-terror/story-KBRC7QicTWEQtdgSaRQ9WO.html
26-09-2020||India||Farm bills anger spills onto highways, railways||New Delhi/Chandigarh/Meerut Farmers across several states protested over key farm reform laws passed by Parliament this week, leading to disruption of life in Punjab, Haryana and parts of western Uttar Pradesh, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the opposition parties of spreading “lies” and misleading the farmers for their own political benefit in a video message, the third time he has had to defend the legislations.In the truncated session, Parliament approved the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, leading to a protest by farmer bodies and opposition political parties. The primary points of contention are the absence of any mention of a minimum support price (the government-decided floor) and the freedom given to private players and others to operate in areas beyond the physical boundaries of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Also read: Farmers have lost all faith in PM Modi-led govt, says Rahul GandhiClose to 250 farmer bodies came together under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee on Friday for a national strike between 10am and 4pm, terming the laws as “anti-farmers” and asked the government either to withdraw these legislations or at least provide minimum support price (MSP) protection in them. The government has maintained that MSPs will stay and there was no reason for farmers to worry. It has already announced MSPs for some winter-sown crops to reassure farmers who continue to insist that the support price protection be written into the law. Farmers blocked road traffic at several places in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, only allowing movement of emergency services such as ambulances. Road blockades in several places forced people to walk long distances to reach their destinations. The protest called by 185 farmer bodies was more or less peaceful with no major untoward incident reported from anywhere.According to Punjab government officials, a complete bandh was observed in all 22 districts, except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stronghold of Pathankot, with business establishments and public transport not functioning. Railways had already suspended about two dozen trains originating from or passing through the state in view of the three-day rail blockade observed by farmer groups from September 24 to 26. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said he will not allow implementation of the laws in Punjab and directed the police not to book farmers for violation of Section 144 of CrPC imposed across the state for Covid management.Also read: Congress, NCP say no to farm bills in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena to decideIn Haryana, a near complete bandh was observed in farmer dominated districts of western and central parts of the state with not much impact seen in the northern parts. Traffic was blocked on the Rohtak-Chandigarh, Rohtak-Delhi, Jind-Chandigarh and Ambala-Hisar highways. Additional police force was deployed at Ambala and Panipat railway stations, officials said.In western UP, farmer organisations blocked major highways including the Yamuna Expressway in the national capital region and Agra-Lucknow expressway. Road blocks were also reported from Ayodhya and some parts of eastern UP. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (KMS) and Rashtriya Kisan Sabha members demonstrated at various places.Political parties such as the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Trinamool Congress and the Left parties supported the strike and their workers participated in the bandh.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters in Jaipur that the Modi government has launched a brutal attack on the livelihood of 620 million people linked with farming at the time the country has been attacked by the Corona virus and China . Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav said the laws would enslave farmers to corporates and claimed that farm incomes have fallen in recent years instead of increasing as promised by the Prime Minister.PM Modi asked the BJP workers to reach out to farmers on the ground and inform them about details and benefits of the new agriculture reforms and how these will empower them.“They (Opposition) are spreading rumours. Saving farmers from such rumours and explaining the importance of the agriculture reforms is the responsibility and duty of all BJP workers because we have to make the future of farmers bright,” Modi said at a function organised to celebrate the birth anniversary of party’s ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay.The PM said small and marginal farmers, who constitute 85% of the peasant community, will benefit the most from these reforms as they would get better price for their produce. BJP leaders also held press conferences at various states capitals saying that farmers were being misled by the Opposition. “The Rabi crop has not been harvested yet and they are saying farmers will not get the minimum support price,” said BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra in Kolkata. “This kind of smear campaign will not work. The BJP government is committed to protecting the interest of farmers.” Outside the food bowl of northern India, protests were also reported from West Bengal and Bihar. The ruling Trinamool Congress and the Left partied led the protests in West Bengal. Traffic was blocked in Hooghly, North 24 Parganas, Nadia, South 24 Parganas, Burdwan, East Midnapore and other districts where farming is the main source of income for the rural population. In Bihar, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav led a protest in Patna. Roads were blocked at Ara, Purnia, Samastipur, Bhagalpur, Begusarai and Hajipur districts, officials said.However, there was not much impact of the bandh in states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, from where only sporadic protests were reported. Farmer bodies burnt copies of the laws at several locations and in Karnataka, entry of traffic into Bengaluru was blocked.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-anger-spills-onto-highways-railways/story-Xf0dSzakpvQfrIwvlsGWPL.html
26-09-2020||India||Bihar polls: CEC warns social media firms||Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora on Friday said that social media companies will be held responsible if they fail to make adequate arrangements to counter misuse and don’t take prompt action against adverse posts ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. “Adverse use of social media platforms has emerged as a new challenge in recent times,” Arora said. “If adequate arrangements aren’t made to counter the misuse of the social media, then they (social media companies) will not be allowed to take pretext of being only a platform and shall be held responsible if necessary action is not taken promptly and adequately.” Also read: EC sets stage for India’s 1st Covid-era elections in BiharHis reference is to the immunity social media companies claim by saying they do not control the content on their websites. The Commission has also asked political parties and candidates to sensitise their representatives not to indulge in ”malpractices, malicious propaganda and instances of hate-speech” on these platforms , and warned that those doing so will be dealt with “sternly” and “harshly”. “The commission would like to make it emphatically clear that anyone who misuses any such platform, such as for fomenting communal tensions, etc for electoral purposes, shall have to face consequences under the law of the land,” Arora said. Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Commission and social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter, along with Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) signed a voluntary code of ethics. According to the code, while the participants ‘”ecognise they are neither the author, nor the publisher of such content”, they are “committed to helping support democratic processes by improving the integrity and transparency of electoral processes”. Hindustan Times reached out to Facebook and Facebook-controlled Whatsapp for a comment but did not receive any response until press time. Twitter declined comment. The immunity provided to social media companies allows them to enjoy the upside of the media business (advertising, the main source of revenue for such firms) without having to exercise the responsibility or meet the statutory obligations of a media company. Recent reports have also shown that most of these companies are selective in their moderation. The Wall Street Journal reported in August that Facebook had selectively exercised its hate-speech policy to favour the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The government was quick to react with Information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad writing to the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that the platform allowed people to make posts against prime minister Narendra Modi. According to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named, the Commission draws its reservoir of power from Article 324 of the constitution. “Elections are conducted under Constitution and the Supreme Court in its judgment has held on a number of occasions that Article 324 gives vast powers to the Commission subject to certain restrictions such as fairness and transparency,” said one of them. Article 324 allows the Election Commission the “superintendence, direction and control of elections”. The EC invoked this provision in West Bengal in May last year, curtailing campaigning in the state ahead of Parliamentary elections after clashes between cadres of the BJP and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Kolkata. Experts, however, say ECI’s powers to regulate social media companies are limited. “Their authority to regulate platforms is not clearly provided,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima , global cybersecurity lead and Asia Pacific Policy Director at Access Now . “They are stretching the authority they have to regulate electronic media and threatening companies by proposing to further regulate or prosecute them.” “It’s commendable that the CEC is speaking about this; however, ECI has failed to advance any reforms to protect electoral democracy in the digital age in India. Prior to the 2019 general elections, many groups working on electoral reforms, democracy and fundamental rights issues wrote to the ECI and went public with their suggestion on how ECI can take steps in this area. They also recommended they engage all stakeholders on this important issue, not just political parties in Delhi , internet companies, and their industry lobby group. This has not yet occurred, which is deeply disturbing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-polls-cec-warns-social-media-firms/story-xuDybEVjHeP11e40y1QbYL.html
26-09-2020||India||Covid to flood: Tracing issues that may impact Bihar polls||The first state to go to the polls after the Covid-19 pandemic struck India, Bihar is struggling to manage not only the disease but also the return of millions of migrant workers. Moreover, floods have inundated 18 of the state’s 38 districts, killing 27 people and displacing over 7 million . The election – which will be held in three phases beginning October 28 --- coincides with the festival season when social distancing norms is difficult to enforce and which might see the return of even more migrant workers to their ancestral villages.A look at the key issues in these elections:Covid-19 management The state has come under some criticism for low testing, though the number has improved in recent weeks to 53670 per million, as compared to the national average of 51713. The positivity rate – a ratio of positive cases compared to total tests – has also fallen from 8.8% in mid-July to 2.7% by mid-September. As the state with the largest chunk of population living in rural areas, Bihar has always ranked low in availability of doctors and hospital beds. The government claims it has ramped up facilities, even in rural areas while the Opposition alleges that hospital beds and emergency services are inadequate.Migration The Opposition is trying to play up the distress of nearly 2.5 million migrants who returned to Bihar, pointing to their impoverished condition and alleging that the state government has done little to provide them jobs. The government has launched a slew of projects from fisheries to agriculture and said lakhs of migrants have been provided employment under MGNREGA and other schemes. Migration from Bihar is not a new phenomena but this is the first election where migration and the votes of migrant workers is set to be a decisive factor.Digital reachThe first big election in the Covid era is happening in a state with relatively low internet and telephone penetration. This will affect campaigning as big rallies and public meetings will not be possible. That will mean a paradigm shift in electioneering and greater dependence on technology. Teledensity — the number of telephone connections per hundred people in a given area — is the lowest in Bihar. Internet penetration in Bihar is 32 subscribers per 100 people, compared to the national average of 54. Mass media exposure, too, is poor. Flood havocFloods are cause of perennial sorrow in Bihar, where 28 of the 38 districts are marked flood-prone. This year, though, the floods were more severe than usual and affected the state at a time when people were already struggling to deal with the pandemic and lockdown. At least 8.3 million people in 16 districts were displaced, and many are living in relief camps still. The Opposition has claimed politicization of relief, while the government has blamed earlier regimes for weak embankments and corruption.Law & order This is an issue very close to the heart of chief minister Nitish Kumar, who first came to power in 2005 with the pledge to improve the law and order in the state after 15 years of Rashtritya Janata Dal (RJD) rule. But a spate of petty crimes and murder cases has emboldened the RJD-led Opposition. A war of words between government and Opposition leaders has ensued.Jobs Job creation was another central election plank of the Kumar administration. His government claims to have provided jobs to lakhs of migrants through MGNREGA and various other development schemes, but the Opposition says the youngsters and poor continue to suffer due to joblessness.Dalit and minority votesScheduled castes form 16% of the state, and they are set to play a decisive role in the state elections. The changing political dynamics are also underlined by leaders such as Jitan Ram Manjhi and Shyam Razak, who have moved from the Opposition alliance to the NDA, as well as the Lok Janshakti Party, which is driving a hard bargain with the BJP. In 2015, the Grand Alliance’s victory was attributed, in part, to the solid backing it received from the Muslim community that forms 16.87% of the state’s population. This time – in the absence of emotive issues such as Ram temple or Citizenship (Amendment) Act – and a fractured Opposition, how minorities vote – especially in the Seemanchal region – is difficult to predict. Farm bills This will be the first election after the contentious farm bills were passed in Parliament, triggering protests across India. Bihar had dissolved all agriculture marketing committees and marketing boards in the state in 2006 after repealing the state APMC Act. Kumar has already said it improved procurement, while the Opposition is on the streets in protest. Education Education has always been a big issue in Bihar. The ruling dispensation takes pride in a chain of national and state-level institutions, including medical colleges, engineering colleges and polytechnics, that were created during the NDA regime, the Opposition is focusing on the poor quality of school teaching.Sushant Singh Rajput caseOver the past three months, the debate over the controversial death of the 34-year-old actor has roiled Bihar and captured the imagination of people. With the actor’s family filing an FIR, prominent politicians supporting the demand for prosecuting actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family and the possible entry of former top cop Gupteshwar Pandey into politics, the fractious issue may have an impact on campaigning and polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-to-flood-tracing-issues-that-may-impact-bihar-polls/story-iLMMRQkSn0OPq1cCKaC6YN.html
26-09-2020||India||DDA in for a major overhaul, to downsize sanctioned workforce by half||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the Capital’s biggest landowning agency, is likely to undergo a major organisational re-haul that will reduce its sanctioned workforce by nearly 48% as its role changes from that of a developer to a planner and a regulator, officials familiar with the developments said.These changes, once approved, will mean that DDA does less of construction and more of planning and management of government land. The authority has had trouble selling several housing projects over the past six years, and has an inventory of about 10,000 vacant flats and 30,000 flats in various stages of construction.The restructuring was first planned in 2014, when DDA engaged the National Productivity Council (NPC) to look at the body’s future and optimal utilisation of staff going forward.According to the proposed phase-wise restructuring -- which has been shared with DDA employees on its website -- it plans to cut the total sanctioned strength from 13,383 to 6,860 by reducing its staff strength in the Group B and Group C categories by 1,974 (from 4,123) and 5,292 (from 8,611) respectively. Group A, which has a staff of 649, will be increased to 1,392.Group A employees are commissioners, directors, and deputy director-level officials; Group B are junior and assistant engineers; and Group C are support staff such as gardeners and security guards who manage DDA’s parks, housing projects and offices.“We are looking at a change in our role and moving towards being a planner, regulator and managing government land. This requires changes in the profile of departments. We will not require so many people in the future as our aim to make the organisation dynamic and ensure optimal utilisation of staff,” DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said.Once approved, this restructuring, however, will not require any layoffs, according to senior officials, since DDA already functions with only about 6,000 employees working at the moment. The rest of the posts have been lying vacant for years.A second DDA official, who asked not be named, explained the proposed changes in greater detail: “The reason why Group A employees will be increased is because, under DDA’s new role, it will focus more on urban planning and regulation with policies like land-pooling being implemented. At the same time, the sanctioned strength in Group B and C will go down because construction will reduce, as will management of facilities, and technology has enabled us to provide a lot of services online.”Despite DDA saying that existing staff will not be sacked, the proposal has not gone down well with the employees, especially in the engineering department, who are planning to start a protest. “DDA has arbitrarily decided on the numbers. The proposal will impact our promotions. We will stage a protest in October. We want the proposal withdrawn,” Param Yadav, president of All DDA Engineers Association and All DDA Employees Association, said.DDA was constituted in 1957 for planned developed of the city, including preparation of master plans, management of government land, and providing affordable housing.But over time, and particularly over the past decade, its role as a builder diminished with the rise of private firms in and around Delhi at competitive prices with higher quality. The role appeared to change further with the approval in 2015 of the land-pooling policy, which aims at the development in the outskirts to meet Delhi’s housing requirement. Under this, landowners will form consortiums to carry out development, and DDA’s role will be restricted to preparing the plan and facilitating the development. NPC submitted a report on a restructuring plan for DDA in January 2017. According to a third DDA official, the landowning agency then prepared a final proposal after consulting all departments heads, before sending the report earlier this year to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry. “On the ministry’s direction this month, we have put it in public domain for our employees to give their suggestions/objections. With a lot of services being taken online, the need for manpower in several departments has gone down,” the official said.The proposal will be sent back to the ministry for a final nod.Urban planners called the changes a step in the right direction. “It is a step in the right direction. With the scope of work changing and DDA becoming more of a planner and regulator, the requirement for staff will also go down. This exercise has been under process for a long time,” said Balvinder Kumar, former DDA vice-chairman and member of Uttar Pradesh RERA.But they also said that the body should not stop construction activities altogether.“Preparing the development plan for the city is a huge task. While DDA should focus on the preparation of the MPD and its strict implementation, it should continue to develop housing, especially for the economically weaker sections,” said R Srinivas from the Town and Country Planning Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dda-in-for-a-major-overhaul-to-downsize-sanctioned-workforce-by-half/story-uFiQsadLyd6FypiB4KH8iL.html

The findings were published in the journal Science and suggest genetics could in some part play a role. The researchers said some patients with life-threatening Covid-19 mount a warped immune response because the action of a key molecular messenger called type 1 interferon has been neutralised by either a genetic mutation or by its destruction by an autoimmune attack. Type 1 interferon leads the battle against infection, mounting an immediate and intense localised response the moment a virus invades a cell. They trigger cells to produce proteins to attack the virus and signal uninfected surrounding cells to strengthen immune defence. Severely-ill Covid-19 patients without interferon have to rely solely on virus-specific adaptive antibodies that develop over days, which gives the virus time to replicate and cause a full-blown infection. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage In one of the two new studies, an analysis of blood samples from 987 patients with life-threatening Covid-19 revealed 10.2% had rogue antibodies that attacked and neutralised the patients’ own type 1 interferon, which was undetectable in a subgroup of the patients. Lab studies confirmed the antibodies destroyed the interferon and cells exposed to the patients’ plasma failed to stop infection by Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Asymptomatic and mild patients did not have these antibodies, which were found in 0.33% of healthy people, the study found. Another significant finding was that 94% of the patients with interferon-attacking antibodies were male, which partly explains why men with Covid-19 face higher risk of severe disease. “Autoimmune disorders are more common in women, but here women may be protected because of the X-chromosome recessive trait, since they have XX chromosomes, and men have XY. This needs to be investigated further,” said immunologist Dr NK Mehra, former dean, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi, and emeritus professor, Indian Council of Medical Research. The second paper found severely ill patients were more likely to carry a type of mutation leaving them unable to make adequate type 1 interferon to fight Sars-CoV-2. Researchers examined 13 genes because flaws in them impair the body’s production or use of type 1 interferon, and because mutations in them underlie life-threatening influenza or other viral illnesses. Though each such mutation is rare, 3.5% of the critically ill patients collectively harboured rare mutations in eight of those genes. The analysis, done by the Covid Human Genetic Effort, which is an international consortium working to decipher the molecular, cellular, and immunological mechanisms by which causative monogenic variations cause resistance to viral infection or predisposition to severe disease, did not find the mutation in asymptomatic people and those with mild disease. Since the known risk factors of Covid-19 severity, which include increasing age after the age of 50, being male and various underlying medical conditions, alone cannot predict disease severity, human genetics are increasing helping demystify the wide variations in Covid-19 disease progression, and many genes, including ones not related to interferon, could affect a person’s response to the virus. “Our findings suggest that there may be mutations in other type 1 interferon-related genes in other patients with life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia. They also suggest that the administration of type 1 interferon may be of therapeutic benefit in selected patients, at least early in the course of Sars-CoV-2 infection,” said the study titled, Inborn errors of type I interferon immunity in patients with life-threatening Covid-19, which is the first paper to establish disease-causing mutations as factors for severe Covid-19. Since the auto-antibodies spare one particular form of interferon – the beta form – these patients might also benefit from the experimental treatment with inhaled interferon beta. “These studies are very significant and help explain why innate immunity is on an overdrive and adaptive immunity remains low in Covid-19, while it is the other way around in other viral infections. Innate immunity also mediates the development of a cytokine storm associated with rapid disease progression and death of Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Mehra. “None of the study participants with mutations or the so-called rogue antibodies had a history of severe viral illnesses, which suggest that we are more reliant on type 1 interferon to protect against Sars-CoV-2 versus other viral infections. Trials on synthetic interferon and therapies that boost interferon action are ongoing, but these won’t work on patients with mutations or those with rogue antibodies that attack them,” said Dr Mehra. These studies also red flag convalescent plasma therapy since donated plasma may harbour interferon-neutralizing antibodies, which can worsen disease in susceptible people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/genetic-defects-may-affect-ability-to-fight-covid/story-WzJfpOXHEZzY3Al8K6B3AJ.html
26-09-2020||India||Delhi court directs Delhi Police to file FIR over morphed video of CM Kejriwal||A Delhi court has directed the city police to lodge an FIR over a morphed video that attempts to show chief minister Arvind Kejriwal singing an obscene song, after a complainant contended that the tone and tenor of the video was an attempt to tarnish the CM’s image and reputation.Metropolitan Magistrate Kishor Kumar on Friday told the Station House Officer (SHO) of Paschim Vihar police station to take action within a week.“In the video in question, the tone and manner of the song is not only lowering the reputation of the constitutionally elected chief minister but the same is also addressing public/voters in abusive manner who have exercised their constitutional/ electoral rights while voting for Aam Aadmi Party for the purpose of electing Arvind Kejriwal as the chief minister of Delhi,” the court said in its order.Lawyer and social activist Amit Sahni had moved the petition on March 3 in which he said that after the video was uploaded on YouTube soon after the results of Delhi assembly elections on February 12, 2020.In its action taken report (ATR), the police said that they had not found anything obscene in the videos and no cognisable offence was made out to register an FIR.In its order of September 24, however, the court disagreed with the police’s assessment. “I find there is prima facie cognisable case having been disclosed by the complainant on the basis of the CD in question in which Arvind Kejriwal as the chief minister of Delhi is shown singing ....under Section 294 (obscene acts and songs) of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) read with 67 (lascivious content) of the Information Technology Act,” the judge said while directing the police to file the compliance report by December 2.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.Sahni said that the abusive content was being circulated to public at large, which would create a negative impact on kids who were unable to understand the manner in which the video was morphed.“The video was uploaded on February 12, 2020, and the result of Delhi Vidhan Sabha Election was announced on January 11, 2020, with the sole object of degrading the constitutionally elected chief minister,” the complaint read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-directs-delhi-police-to-file-fir-over-morphed-video-of-kejriwal/story-QgLa4c8vVbAEq1bUf7eCnM.html

The delegate, a junior diplomat named Mijito Vinito from the 2010 batch of the Indian Foreign Service, picked up his papers and left the hall as Khan’s speech was played on a large overhead screen. Khan raised the Kashmir issue, as he has done in recent speeches to multilateral bodies, and criticised the Indian government on several issues. After Khan’s speech, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, tweeted that the country would use the “right of reply” facility to respond to the Pakistani premier’s address. “PM of Pakistan statement a new diplomatic low – at 75th UN General Assembly. Another litany of vicious falsehood, personal attacks, war mongering and obfuscation of Pakistan’s persecution of its own minorities & of its cross-border terrorism. Befitting Right of Reply awaits,” Tirumurti said in his tweet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address the UN General Assembly through a video statement on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-delegate-walks-out-during-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-s-speech-at-un/story-GlQiOjgqFNJzCBNOgmj9FO.html
26-09-2020||India||Need 4th law to make buying farm produce below MSP an offence: Bhupinder Singh Hooda||The Centre’s recent legislations to usher in reforms in the farm sector have met with a blowback in several states. Haryana’s former chief minister and current leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda spoke to Vinod Sharma about why farmers are angry, the concerns about the laws, and corrective steps needed for an equitable balance in an expanded market.  Edited excerpts: Why is the farming community restive in your state and neighbouring Punjab? What is causing them concern about the framework laid down by the three legislations on the farm sector? It is inappropriate to say the community is ‘restive’. It’s actually ‘voicing out’ the corrective measures that must be in place to ensure protection for their produce. Farmers should get minimum support price (MSP) based on the Swaminathan Commission’s C2 formula calculated 50% above cost of cultivation (covering labour cost, operational capital, storage, transport, rent of land and incidental expenses). Farmers don’t have the capacity to store their produce for a long time. The idea eventually is to ensure that the farmers should not be facing any logistical pressure.The freedom to sell agriculture produce outside the notified agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) would expand the marketplace for farm produce with scope for better prices. What then makes the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government so indispensable to the farmer?A correction in the framing and interpretation [of the law] is a must. Here I wish to re-clarify that the Congress manifesto always spoke about rationalising the APMC Act, not removing it. The contract farming rules we made in 2007 were all pro-farmer. Our focus was on basic protection. The rules we devised for contract farming were: one, registration of contract with the district marketing enforcement officer; two, agreed rate/contract will not be less than the MSP of the previous year; three, the buyer shall deposit an amount up to 15% of the price of produce as per MSP or a bank guarantee for the sum (as security) with the committee in which the land is situated ;and four, the security shall be released within 30 days after the satisfactory execution of the agreement between the farmer and private player. Only such measures can eliminate distress sales by farmers outside APMCs where I have seen tomatoes sold for Re 1 per kg and potatoes for nine paise per kg a few years ago. Such a regime will protect the farmers from exploitation by big business that has deep pockets. But many agriculture experts see in the new previsions the potential of ushering in a paradigm shift to make farming remunerative rather than it being relief/subsidy oriented.The positive and negative aspects have to be fairly weighed. It is correct to say that the market for farmers will expand. Yet the expansion may lead to either better prices for farm products or may cause exceptional highs and lows of demand. The equilibrium and security given to farmers through a fixed MSP as part of a rationalised policy is the right idea. It’s the best (option) for the government and the farming community. What kind of assurances or amendments should be made for a broad consensus on the laws?Our demand is that the government should bring the fourth Bill stating that the contract agreement (with private buyers) should not be less than the MSP. Purchase of farm produce at a price less than the MSP should be punishable by law. I am above party politics on the issue as I am the son of a farmer. If they bring the Bill, I will welcome it as it will be for the betterment of farmers. I want them to bring the fourth Bill to safeguard MSP. If they are saying they will give the benefits then where is the glitch in bringing the Bill?The government made an announcement of increased MSP for six Rabi crops including wheat. Does that not disprove claims that it intends disbanding APMCs and the MSP mechanism?MSP assurance for some Rabi crops and wheat is not the only thing required. We are talking about India where Kharif crops (bajra, jowar) and rice play an important role in demand and consumption. The MSP mechanism and the Mandi Act as a whole have to be fair and just. The agriculture sector is subsidised even in developed countries the world over. That makes one doubt your worries. Why would the government fall on its own sword by disbanding MSP or resorting to mechanisms that hurt farmers?The reality we all are running away from is that the government has been experimenting with delicate areas of concern over the last few years. It they fail, like they have in many other sectors, they will blame destiny, the coronavirus or the Opposition. Let us get real and accept that we are a developing nation where the poor people need essential commodities at extremely low or subsidised prices. Implementing free flow without MSP might raise prices -- and the poor will literally starve. Similarly, the farmer needs to earn in a secure way. The game plan of having corporates enter this sector will harm every state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-govt-to-bring-fourth-bill-to-safeguard-msp-bhupinder-singh-hooda/story-Q4J53SQFg2JXpaEUIu0mBM.html
26-09-2020||India||India, Japan ‘non-contact’ naval drills in Arabian Sea begin today||India and Japan will kick off three-day maritime drills in the northern Arabia Sea from Saturday, an Indian Navy spokesperson said on Friday, days after India conducted an exercise with Australia in the Indian Ocean.The India-Japan maritime bilateral exercise (JIMEX) is conducted biennially. Its last edition was conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam in October 2018. “JIMEX-20 will showcase a high degree of inter-operability and joint operational skills through conduct of a multitude of advanced exercises, across the spectrum of maritime operations. Multi-faceted tactical exercises involving weapon firing, cross-deck helicopter operations and complex surface, anti-submarine and air warfare drills will consolidate the coordination developed by the two navies,” the navy said in a statement. The drills come after Indian and Australian navies conducted a passage exercise in the eastern Indian Ocean Region (IOR) from September 23-24. A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills.Just like the Indo-Australian drills, JIMEX-20 is being conducted in a “non-contact at-sea-only format”, in view of Covid-19 restrictions.Indian warships Chennai, Teg, Tarkash and fleet tanker Deepak will represent the Indian Navy at JIMEX-20, while Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force is sending its warships Kaga and Ikazuchi for the drills, the statement said, adding that P8-I long range maritime patrol aircraft, integral helicopters and fighter jets will also take part in the exercise.“JIMEX-20 will further enhance the cooperation and mutual confidence between the two navies and fortify the long-standing bond of friendship between the two countries,” it added. The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row with China in the Ladakh sector. India has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-to-kick-off-naval-drills-in-arabian-sea-tomorrow/story-eVIxuU0r20ZVdkauQqZDQO.html

26-09-2020||India||‘Social media platforms will be held liable for failure to counter misuse’: CEC||Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora on Friday said that social media platforms will be held responsible if they fail to make adequate arrangements to counter misuse and don’t take prompt action against adverse posts ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. “Adverse use of social media platforms has emerged as a new challenge in recent times,” Arora said. “If adequate arrangements aren’t made to counter the misuse of the social media then they will not be allowed to take pretext of being only a provider and shall be held responsible if necessary action is not taken promptly and adequately.” The Commission has also asked political parties and candidates to sensitise their representative not to indulge in ‘malpractices, malicious propaganda and instances of hate speech’, as such actions will be dealt with ‘sternly’ and ‘harshly’.“The commission would like to make it emphatically clear that anyone who misuses any such platform, such as for fomenting communal tensions, etc for electoral purposes, shall have to face consequences under the law of the land,” Arora said. Also read: India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism recordAhead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Commission and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp along with IAMAI had signed a voluntary code of ethics. According to the code, while the participants ‘recognise they are neither the author nor the publisher of such content’, they are ‘committed to helping support democratic processes by improving the integrity and transparency of electoral processes’. Hindustan Times reached out to Facebook and Whatsapp for a comment but did not receive one until press time. Twitter declined to comment.Arora’s statement also comes in the wake of the Wall Street Journal reports in August which alleged Facebook had selectively exercised its hate-speech policy to favour the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that the platform allowed people to make posts against prime minister Narendra Modi, with BJP alleging that there was nexus between the Congress and Facebook. According to Twitter’s recently updated civic integrity policy, a person may not use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. The microblogging site’s hate conduct policy also bars promotion of violence, direct attacks, threats on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Also read: Is BMC always this swift to demolish, asks HC judge in Kangana Ranaut caseAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Commission draws its reservoir of power from Article 324 of the constitution. “Elections are conducted under Constitution and the Supreme Court in its judgment has held on a number of occasions that Article 324 gives vast powers to the Commission subject of certain restrictions such as fairness and transparency,” said such a person on the condition of anonymity. The person added that a call would have to be taken on a case-to-case basis.Article 324 allows the Election Commission the “superintendence, direction and control of elections”. The EC had invoked this provision in West Bengal in May last year, curtailing campaigning in the state ahead of Parliamentary elections after clashes between cadres of the BJP and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Kolkata.Experts, however, say the ECI’s powers to regulate the social media platforms are limited. “Their authority to regulate platforms is not clearly provided,” global cybersecurity lead and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now Raman Jit Singh Chima said. “They are stretching authority they have to regulate electronic media and threatening companies by proposing to further regulate or prosecute them.”“It’s commendable that the CEC is speaking about this, however, the ECI has failed to advance any reforms to protect electoral democracy in the digital age in India. Prior to the 2019 general elections, many groups working on electoral reforms, democracy and fundamental rights issues wrote to the ECI and went public with their suggestion on how the ECI can take steps in this area. They also recommended they engage all stakeholders on this important issue and should not only consult political parties in Delhi, web companies and their industry lobby group. This has not yet occurred, which is deeply disturbing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-platforms-will-be-held-liable-for-failure-to-counter-misuse-cec-sunil-arora/story-0YCzYZnT1Yr676wpojVmaO.html
26-09-2020||India||Karnataka speaker admits Congress’s no-confidence motion against BJP govt||Karnataka assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri on Thursday admitted a no-confidence motion moved by the Congress against the BS Yediyurappa government. A day before, the Congress had alleged that the CM and his family was involved in corruption. It is not sure if the JDS will support the motion.Earlier in the day, leader of opposition Siddaramiah speaking after a meeting of Congress legislature party said that the state government had failed on all fronts and that is why the party has decided to move the no-confidence motion.“There has been corruption in procurement of equipment for Covid treatment, government officials are making money by indulging in transfer business and allocation of posts. Yediyurappa and his family are interested in only making money. Governance has collapsed,” he claimed.In the assembly, when Congress members stood up to insist on the motion being taken up for discussion immediately, ruling party members objected to it. The Speaker continued with the listed business of some bills to be moved and refused to take up the motion immediately, saying it was under his consideration and he would decide when time should be allocated for the same. The assembly is scheduled to wrap up the monsoon session by Saturday.Even as revenue minister R Ashoka termed the no-confidence motion a ‘political gimmick’ as the opposition did not have the numbers, Siddaramiah claimed that there would be cross-voting from the treasury benches in favour of the motion, a claim which was pooh-poohed by the ruling party.Former speaker and current BJP MLA KG Bopiah claimed that a no-confidence motion can be taken up anytime within three days. The JDS has also not clarified whether it would support the Congress party’s no-confidence motion.In the 224-member Karnataka assembly, the BJP has 117 members, Congress 67, JDS 33, three independents and four vacant seats. On Thursday,Congress MLA dies of Covid-19In another development, Congress’s Basvakalyan MLA B Narayan Rao died due to Covid-19 at a private hospital in Bengaluru after being admitted with a severe infection on September 1. He was 65.A first time legislator, Rao was considered a loyalist of Siddaramiah. CM Yediyurappa, KPCC Congress leaders DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy, among others, have condoled the death of Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-confidence-motion-moved-by-congress-against-karnataka-govt-accepted/story-qZJQXtCv7s8OtVYzcddiJP.html
