The authority has asked the contractor to ensure seamless barricading, covering the construction area, up to one-third of the height of the structure. It has also recommended the deployment of more security guards and traffic marshals. NHAI officials said that despite directions being issued last week, adequate measures have not been taken. The work on Sohna elevated road project was temporarily suspended by the authority last Tuesday, following the collapse of a span between pier 10 and pier 11 on August 22. The authority has also formed a high-level technical committee, which is probing the incident. Ashok Sharma, NHAI project director, on Tuesday said that work will continue to remain suspended till seamless barricading is put up at the entire project site and other safety measures are taken. Further, the contractor, Oriental Engineering, will continue to face a penalty of ₹50,000 per day. “The seamless barricading has not happened and the height of barricading in areas where construction work is being carried out has not been raised to one-third of the structure’s height,” said Sharma. He further said that number of traffic marshals deployed at the site need to be increased to ensure safe movement of vehicles along the road. “The measures taken by the contractor are not satisfactory. Therefore, till an independent engineer doesn’t submit his report and verifies that requisite measures have been taken, the work will not be allowed to restart,” he said. Members of the technical team that visited the site last Thursday also said that the contractor will not get any additional time on account of the delay caused by the accident. The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project has two parts — an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk to a point beyond Badshahpur. The second part comprises the expansion of 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and will involve the construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch.The deadline for both these projects is July, 2021. A senior official of Oriental Engineering said that they have taken all measures for barricading and improving safety and security of commuters and workers at the site.”Additional measures as per NHAI directions have been taken and more are in the offing. We hope that in next couple of days we will get permission to resume work,” he said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/work-on-sohna-elevated-road-to-remain-suspended-till-safety-measures-are-adopted-nhai/story-EJVAhvlaAkLhA6Ac9RAKbM.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||₹2 crore licence fee collected as Chandigarh bars reopen||The UT excise and taxation department collected around ₹2 crore on Tuesday in liquor licence fee after the administration allowed bars to open for the first time in the city since the Covid-19 lockdown on March 24.Many hotels, restaurants and bars could not serve customers as payment for licences and assessment fees (excise levy) on liquor cases, which is mandatory before sales.“On Tuesday, 50 establishments paid the fee with more than Rs 2 crore deposited with the department. In the next few days, we expect most license holders to pay up,” said RK Chaudhary, assistant commissioner, excise and taxation.“It will take some time before most of the establishments start serving liquor to patrons. They have to first deposit licence and assessment fee and buy fresh stock,” said Arvinder Pal Singh, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Chandigarh.The liquor licence has to be renewed every year with fees ranging from ₹4 lakh to ₹15 lakh per annum depending on the scale of the establishment.The assessment fee is charged on cases of alcohol, ranging from around ₹300 for beer to ₹3,000 for whiskey.“After depositing the assessment fee with the excise department, an establishment gets the permit to sell liquor. The fee is submitted online, but on Tuesday we could not pay up because of the glitches in the department’s e-permit site. We were told it would take some days for the site to be restored,” said a restaurant owner requesting anonymity.FEE FOR SEVEN MONTHS BEING CHARGEDNotably, the administration has decided to charge the licence fee or a shorter term. “The excise policy 2020-2021 mentions fee rates for nine months. But the administration has decided that the department will consider the day on which the bars open, that is September 1. So we are charging money only for seven months now,” said Chaudhary.The excise department has set up a special desk for a smoother process to deposit the fees. “We have deputed special staff and are ensuring that the process is completed quickly,” said Chaudhary.Seeking more relief from the administration, industry representatives want relaxations in payments. “We have requested the administration to allow deposition of license fee on instalments. The sector is going through tough times and the hospitality sector has been hit hard because of the pandemic,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-crore-licence-fee-collected-as-chandigarh-bars-reopen/story-WXUR6bprow5IhW7H8yHUgO.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Five-year law entrance: HC asks PU to rethink scrapping exam, restrains admissions on 10+2 basis||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday asked the Panjab University (PU) to reconsider its decision on scrapping the entrance exam for the five-year law course run by University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS).The high court bench of justice S Muralidhar also restrained the varsity from admitting students on the basis of Class 12 marks for now. PU has been asked to take a decision by September 15 and upload it on its website.The decision to scrap the exam was taken on August 11 in view of Covid-19 outbreak, and was challenged by two law course aspirants Navya Raj and Saurav Rao arguing that the premise not to hold the entrance is not valid when PU is taking such exams for other courses. Class 12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course would be neither reasonable nor reliable, it was argued.During the hearing, one of the counsels, Deepak Vashishth, also pointed out that while the said entrance has been scrapped, varsity would hold the same for its three-year law course.The bench while asking PU to reconsider the decision observed that there is generally little scope of inclusion of law-based subjects in the syllabus for 10+2 classes and it is not possible to make a comparative assessment of suitability of candidates for admission to the 5-year law course solely on the basis of marks obtained in the Class 12 exam.“It would not be safe or reliable to either give equal weightage to the performance of students in the science, arts, commerce streams in the 10+2 level or give preference to one over the other in adjudging the suitability for the 5-year law course,” the bench observed adding that Common Law Admission Test for admission to the national law schools too has not been scrapped so far and the UGC is going ahead with many other such exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/five-year-law-entrance-hc-asks-pu-to-rethink-scrapping-exam-restrains-admissions-on-10-2-basis/story-yDto5Cb6N87NfvksZAS9nL.html

His upper lip was torn and his cheeks slashed leading to severe blood loss. Now, two weeks later, he has recovered after a successful surgery that restored the shape, alignment and functions of the lips. Arjun, a student of diploma in interior designing and fitness freak, said he was cycling from Delhi to Ghaziabad at 5.30 pm on August 15. “I normally cycle around 90-100 km a day. I thought that since it was Independence Day, there would only be light traffic. I left East Delhi for Ghaziabad on my cycle. As I was crossing the Raj Nagar area, a kite with Chinese manjha crossed my path and cut my upper lip,” he said. Arjun said he stopped the cycle and found his lips bleeding profusely. “I was in need of medical help. A car driver stopped there but he refused to take me to hospital saying his car will get dirty. After some time, another car stopped there and the man took me to Max Super Speciality Hospital, Vaishali. The thread was stuck in my mouth and it was painful,” he said. Meanwhile, someone lifted his cycle and drove away. Dr. Manoj K Johar, Director & Head, Department of Plastic Surgery, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Vaishali said, “With severe blood loss, the patient was in a very serious condition and his lip was badly injured. It required immediate surgery in order to restore function and for aesthetic outcome. Following all the safety precautions related to Covid-19, plastic surgery was successfully performed to restore the shape, alignment and functions of the lips.” Maninder Singh was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cricketer-s-son-recovers-from-chinese-manjha-injury/story-b8P2wOJurSLrRW4R01gQzM.html

A Faridabad-based contractor won the project for Rs 2 crore in September 2019. It was supposed to be completed by March 2020.“Just a few weeks before the enforcement of the Covid-19 induced national lockdown on March 22, he took Rs 50 lakh from the MCG in the form of running costs for the work he claimed he had done,” said Singh. “But only the earth has been dug up and nothing since then. Initially, under the pretext of national lockdown and coronavirus, the contractor kept asking for an extension. When things started to reopen, he stopped responding to our calls. We later came to know that after collecting his payment from the MCG, he had sold his residence in Faridabad and has left Haryana altogether.”He said MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh had told the engineering wing to probe the matter.MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma said a show-cause notice had been sent to the contractor to explain his version of events and specify the reason for not completing the work.“We have levied a 10% penalty on the contractor for leaving the work mid-way and also blacklisted him. A report has been sought from the concerned executive engineer regarding the payment made to the contractor,” he said. “The contract has been cancelled and we have initiated the formalities to issue a new tender and allocating it to a new contractor for finishing the work.”Sharma said that the MCG is in the process of “digitising” its operations and with online process of conducting work there will be greater transparency in the day-to-day operations and will result in discrepancies being highlighted immediately.Over the last 10 months, there have been several instances where MCG has allegedly payments to the contractor despite little work.In February, a vigilance wing probe was initiated after Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla informed the MCG that its engineering wing had paid Rs 1.67 crore, the total project cost, to a contractor for building a two-kilometre road in ward 1 even before the construction had started. In this case, the MCG recovered the total cost from the contractor and a show-cause notice was sent to an engineering wing official.In December 2019, ward 34 councillor RS Rathee had complained that the engineering wing had paid Rs 35 lakh to a contractor for constructing 1.7-kilometre track between Khusbhoo Chowk and Bristol Chowk, along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, even though only 600 metres of work, worth Rs 11 lakh had been completed.MCG had marked vigilance wing probe in both the matters. Here, the MCG blacklisted the contractor, suspended a junior engineer, and served show-cause notices to three engineering wing officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-contractor-gets-paid-for-only-completing-10-mcg-work-third-such-matter-in-10-months/story-6y083UbCipZPr0BH4GOBAK.html

In the last six months, seven IAS officers have either been relieved or retired. While Sinha and Nayar’s tenures ended on Tuesday, Arjun Sharma and Saurabh Mishra, were relieved last year. They were both posted as sub-divisional magistrates besides additional charges as land acquisition officer and information technology director, respectively. Former education secretary BL Sharma and transport secretary Ajay Singla retired last year. In contrast, only one IAS officer, Sarpreet Singh Gill, joined the administration last month.Sinha was holding charge of 16 departments, most of which have been given to Arun Gupta, principal secretary, home. In addition to his existing departments, Gupta will head finance, excise and taxation, planning, estate and housing departments. He has also been designated as the chief electoral officer and chief administrator. With this, he now holds 24 charges in all.UT adviser Manoj Parida will now chair the Chandigarh Housing Board, a charge earlier with Sinha.Deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar has also been given charge of the transport department.Sarpreet Singh Gill, who joined the administration last month, has been appointed as education and technical education secretary and special secretary for finance, house allotment and vigilance.Meanwhile, for Sinha’s replacement, the administration has sent a panel of three Punjab cadre IAS officers to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The administration is expecting the MHA’s response within a month.Criticising the slow replacements for officers, RTI activist RK Garg said, “It is pertinent to mention that retirements and completion of deputations are known well in advance, but no timely action is taken for replacement. It is not for the first time that the UT has seen such sorry state of affairs; there is almost a complete history.”A senior UT official said, “We are pursuing the issue of replacement of officers with the MHA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-rejigs-departments-as-top-ias-officers-tenures-end/story-KlGFavhhYwM7FlKFaX4UMJ.html

The police said ₹1.35 lakh and gambling chips worth ₹7.35 lakh were seized from the casino. A case under the gambling act was registered at Kotwali police station on Tuesday against the 12 arrested suspects. The suspects were identified as Nitin Kumar, Ankit Singh, Anil Kumar, Anurag Singh, Firoze Khan, Sandeep Kumar, Amit (single name), Jatin (single name), Niket Azad and Harnek and two-Delhi based women, said police. Dharna Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime against women), said that Niket Azad, a resident of Faridabad, was the main organiser and he has been setting up casinos in the city since the beginning of the lockdown. “Azad used to set up casinos in different establishments such as hotels, farmhouses, and guest houses etc. He is into illegal gambling for the past many years and is a history-sheeter,” Yadav said. OP Singh, commissioner of police, said the police had received a tip that a casino was operating out of a hotel room and the organisers had rented the entire hotel on Monday to set up everything and invited people in the evening for gambling. The police said their team raided the hotel premises and unearthed a full-fledged dice joint being run from the dinning room of the hotel . “The casino was designed by Azad with the help of two women who have worked in different casinos and were associated with the kingpin since March,” Singh said.

01-09-2020||Gurugram||Buyers face difficulties in booking appointments online for property registration in Gurugram||Registration of properties, which was banned by the Haryana government on July 22, resumed across the state, including Gurugram, on Tuesday. However, officials said that it would still take some time for the new online system to function normally. On Tuesday, only a handful of people had booked online appointments for property registration, said revenue officials. Property buyers and brokers also said that they faced difficulties in generating appointments and expected things to improve in a few days. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that they have initiated the process of property registration under the new system as per the directions received from the government. “How the new online system fares will be clear in the coming days. It will take a week or so for people to get used to the new system,” said Khatri.As per the revenue officials, under the new property registration system, the applicants can book an online appointment anywhere in the state. However, they will be required to upload documents online. Earlier, applicants had to visit the revenue office or the tehsil office physically to get an appointment. While the new process has made online application easier, many people are not conversant with scanning and uploading documents online, said officials. Basti Ram, district revenue officer (DRO), Gurugram said that they have initiated the registration process and in the coming days, all the issues would be sorted out. “The advantage of the new system is that they need to come to the tehsil office only once for registration,” he said. Another aspect of the new system is that appointment for properties that fall under the controlled areas under the Haryana Urban Development and Management Act, 1975, the applicant must obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the department of town and country planning (DTCP). Otherwise, the new system will not generate appointment.Basti Ram said that if an applicant’s property falls under controlled area and under Section 7A, then a message would be generated by the system and sent to concerned district town planner. If an NOC has been issued then the number of the same will be sent to the applicant and get automatically updated in the system. In case, the NOC is not issued, the system will not generate an appointment for registration, he added. The third major change under the new system is that all government lands with its Khasra numbers have been updated online. Any one who tries to get land owned by government registered in his name would not be able to do the same as the updated software system will not generate registration appointment for such an application, said revenue officials. In case, an applicant is registering for a land falling in the Aravallis, under the forest areas covered by sections 4 and 5, the new system will allow registration of private land but will notify the buyers about prohibited activities on protected lands. “Many buyers from outside the state are not aware about the regulations imposed in Aravallis and forest areas under the new registration process. They will be made aware of these conditions,” a forest official said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, home buyer and property dealers, who tried to generate online appointments, however, said that they could not generate approval as the new system is too complicated. “We have been trying to book an appointment for sometime but the process is too slow and complicated,” said Subash Sharma, a real-estate broker. Property dealers also said that their business had already suffered due to pandemic and this ban on registrations had further undermined it. “In order to revive the property market, government must support and expedite the process,” said Rakesh Malik, a real-estate broker. Haryana government had imposed a ban on property registrations from July 22 following a large-scale irregularities in registration of property deeds in the state, including Gurugram during the lockdown. The state government had also suspended six revenue department officials for registration of property in violation of rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/buyers-face-difficulties-in-booking-appointments-online-for-property-registration-in-gurugram/story-srU8ZBcXgMxdO5t94bwLLN.html

He said that there will be a drop box near the help desk where people can drop their suggestions. Besides, written public complaints can also be lodged at the help desk. The e-challan window had been closed in May after a few personnel at the traffic police office were found positive for Covid-19. “We are now taking all precautions to ensure that such a situation doesn’t occur. All measures are being taken. While one person is busy with the formalities, arrangements have been made for others to safely sit at a distance. Also, sanitization of the office is also carried out regularly,” said the DCP. Noida residents have welcomed the initiative. “There are sometimes issues with e-challans.

01-09-2020||City||HT Explainer: Why Punjab social welfare minister finds himself in a spot in SC scholarship scam||Chandigarh Punjab social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot is in the eye of the storm for alleged involvement in the ₹64-crore post-matric scholarship scam. After a report indicted Dharamsot and five officials last week, chief minister Amarinder Singh asked the chief secretary to probe the matter amid demands from the opposition parties and some Congress leaders for the minister’s sacking and a CBI probe. On Monday, the Centre also ordered a departmental inquiry by two joint secretary-level officers. Navneet Sharma dissects the anatomy of the scam and its aftermath: What is the scheme PMS-SC is a centrally-funded scheme to provide financial assistance to Scheduled Castes students to complete their education. Scholarships, including maintenance allowance and reimbursement of fee and other charges, are given to eligible students pursuing degree and diploma courses. The Centre had stopped funding the scheme in Punjab in 2017-18, but scholarship payments were pending for the previous years. The Union social justice and empowerment ministry, therefore, released ₹303.92 crore in three instalments in February and March 2019. What are the irregularities Of this, ₹248.11 crore were withdrawn by the state’s social justice department and the irregularities in distribution of this money to private institutions are behind the controversy. The funds were disbursed in an “arbitrary” manner with some authorities misusing their official positions, according to a 33-page report submitted by additional chief secretary Kripa Shankar Saroj to chief secretary Vini Mahajan on August 24. The report put the embezzlement at ₹64 crore, including ₹39 crore paid to “ghost institutions” and release of ₹16.91 crore to private institutions against which the audit team of the finance department had recommended a recovery of ₹8 crore after getting a re-audit done. “Despite making lots of efforts, no files/papers pertaining to the payment of ₹39 crore have been found so far,” reads the report, concluding that the funds were paid to ghost institutions. Show-cause notices were also served on five officers, including deputy director Parminder Singh Gill, for clearing the payments. Where does Dharamsot figure in this Kripa Shankar’s report has raised serious questions about the role of the minister in fund release, pointing out the patronage to his “handpicked” officer Gill, who handled the scheme. “On the basis of available files, it is clear that minister, director, deputy director and other officials had distributed ₹248.11 crore from time to time through split files and in a completely arbitrary manner,” it said, indicting Dharamsot. Also, the minister was distributing work to the department officers, a power vested in the director, and had assigned the work of PMS-SC to Gill under his own signature. However, Dharamsot has denied any wrongdoing, saying: “I am willing to face action if an iota of truth is found in these unsubstantiated allegations.” Taint on official machinery Coming down hard on the then PS/ACS, who “abdicated their responsibilities”, the report said either they were reluctant to deal with the subject or they unwillingly allowed the nexus between the deputy director and the minister’s office. The then director Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal (IAS) was having an agenda to enter politics and Gill was reporting directly to the minister. Dhaliwal got elected as an MLA from Phagwara (reserved) seat on a Congress ticket in the by-election in October last year. How did the irregularities come to notice Kripa Shankar, who was posted in the department in August 2019, found that the entire focus was on PMS-SC and almost all the other schemes “lay dead”. The department officials were reluctant to share information on paper. A few weeks later, a new director took charge and redistributed the work. Thereafter, the ACS started getting information and found a lot amiss. Fallout of the scam The minister’s indictment has not just left the Congress government red-faced, but also given ammunition to opposition parties in the state which has the highest percentage of SC population among all the states. The AAP and SAD have gone after the government and Capt’s detractors in the Congress are also demanding the minister’s removal. The issue later rocked the assembly. The govt response The state government has announced another probe. Amarinder on Saturday asked chief secretary Vini Mahajan to probe the irregularities, but the opposition parties have rejected the move, calling it an exercise to give a clean chit to the minister. They are demanding a CBI probe. What next After Union social justice minister Thavar Chand Gehlot on Monday ordered a departmental inquiry by two joint secretary-level officers of his ministry, Amarinder termed it as yet another attack on the federal structure. However, it is not unusual for the central ministries to depute teams to look into misuse of funds given under the centrally sponsored scheme, often for initiating “recovery”. But this is just the first step.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ht-explainer-why-punjab-social-welfare-minister-finds-himself-in-a-spot-in-sc-scholarship-scam/story-oMUU9VARctSb41KYzjtbbL.html

01-09-2020||City||Gautam Budh Nagar admin asks banks not to finance projects without verifying their legality||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Tuesday asked the banks in the district not to finance the realty projects without complete verification of their legality. The administration has also decided to take stern legal actions against the sanctioning authorities, who approve the finance to any illegal project. Taking serious notes of complaints received against some builders, who carry out advertisements through different mediums that they have approval of some banks to lure buyers, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that it needs to be monitored by banks and ensure that nobody uses their names and credibility in an illegal manner. “The banks must be stricter against the builders, who give false sense of financial security to the prospective buyers. Legal activity should be supported within framework of law, and illegal activities should be dealt with in the strictest possible manner,” he said. Citing the RBI circular dated July 1, 2015, the DM said that it is mandatory for the banks to verify beforehand, regarding legality of the documents before financing projects brought before them. “Sanctioning authorities will now be held accountable for all such financial disbursements made in such cases. As per law, builders/colonizers are obligated to take permission from Noida/Greater Noida/Yamuna authority in notified area. Those projects, which do not have necessary permission or are being sold on false promises, should not qualify for banks’ approval for financing,” Suhas said. The issue was raised in district level consultative committee (DLCC) meeting of the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21, held on Monday. The lead district manager (LDM), Vedratna Kumar, said that DM had also directed all the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the district to follow these guidelines. “They have been told by the DM that in case of any violation, it will be reported to RBI and accountability will be fixed thereof. The DM also instructed to all the banks, to be actively involve themselves in all the government-sponsored schemes and achieve the allotted targets so that more and more employment opportunities could be created,” Kumar said. The LDM, who is a nodal agent between the administration and the banks in the district, further said that at present credit-debit (CD) ratio of GB Nagar district is 58.44%. “The annual credit plan target allotted for 2020-21 is ₹10,600.69 crore, of which 27.43% disbursement (₹2,907.80 crore) has been achieved so far,” he said.When asked about the issue, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) said that after the implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, no illegal project can be financed by the banks. Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai (western UP), said that these rules can only be implemented with the projects approved by gram panchayats. “Banks can’t finance any project not registered under RERA. So, the administration or banks have no role in rejecting the loan applications of RERA-approved projects as they have all the rights to have the financing from the banks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gautam-budh-nagar-admin-asks-banks-not-to-finance-projects-without-verifying-their-legality/story-pJE3IW1ABRDUf7YJi28YXN.html

Weekend restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease will now only be limited to Sundays.On July 9, the Uttar Pradesh government had announced statewide weekend restrictions mandating markets to remain shut on Saturdays and Sundays during which extensive sanitisation drives were to be taken up to break the chain of Covid-19 infection. With the new instructions, markets need to be cleaned every Sunday and shops can remain open from 9am to 9pm on the rest of the days of the week.“The chief minister has directed that markets can now open from 9am to 9pm can remain open on Saturdays. Markets will be cleaned and sanitised on Sundays. The restrictions will commence from Saturday/Sunday midnight and will continue till the midnight of Sunday/Monday,” UP’s additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Awasthi said in a press briefing at Lucknow on Tuesday.Till now, under the weekend restrictions, all markets were completely shut from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday.“The sanitisation drives have been taken up regularly during the weekend restrictions. We have come to know that opening of markets has been allowed on Saturdays, however, we are waiting for the written orders from the state government before implementing them,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate. “It will now be up to the traders’ community and people to observe Covid-19 protocols and ensure social distancing,” he added.UP chief secretary RK Tiwari issued an order late Tuesday night directing markets to be shut only on Sundays. The state government’s step to partially relax the weekend restrictions has been welcomed by the traders who said that the move will give a boost to market sentiments.“We have been writing regularly to the chief minister to allow the opening of markets on weekends. With the new directions that allow shops to open on Saturdays, traders have expressed satisfaction. Opening on Saturdays will help bring in more customers which will positively impact our sales. We will also ensure that social distancing and other health protocols are followed diligently,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram (a traders’ group).“In wake of the upcoming festival season, we would also like the Sunday restrictions to be done away with as most people shop on weekends. The market can be shut down on Tuesdays as was done earlier. We will send our request to the chief minister again,” he added.The move has also been received well by traders in Gautam Budh Nagar.“The decision will benefit both the customers and the business owners. The general public will have at least one day of the weekend to get their outdoor chores done The business owners will also get a chance to earn more revenue. We hope that soon we could open shops on Sundays as well,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president of sector 18 Noida market association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekend-restrictions-relaxed-up-allow-markets-to-open-on-saturdays/story-TqOpsKeN1NJcoVO6AvcK4J.html

The underpass will provide an alternate route connecting the railway station with the city’s Manav Chowk, bypassing crowded areas such as the Old Cloth Market.However, its completion anytime soon does not seem likely as a visit to the site reveals stagnant pools of rainwater with wild overgrowth. People have also started dumping garbage here. “Work on the project started initially for a few months and then stopped due to some water issues. Things are continuing at a slow pace,” said Ram Prasad Jangid, a retired professor. To enable pedestrian movement from across the rail line, a narrow lane running along the site along has been built, but shopkeepers say they have informed local leaders that they want it to be tiled.Till date, however, no one has responded, they say.Complaining that business had been affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Kamal Singh, a dhaba owner said. Customers rarely came to the shop due to the poor connectivity. “We have spoken to the administration a number of times, but there has been no response,” he said. Goel, who is isolating at home at the moment after testing positive for Covid-19, could not be reached for comments.GM Singh, divisional railway manager, Ambala division, said the project has been stalled earlier due to heavy railway traffic and needed to be “blocked” for nearly eight hours. It would be resumed again after September 15 by the railway’s construction department in Chandigarh. Surinder Pal, chief project manager of the department, said he was not aware of the total construction cost but the first phase of the project had been started by the railways around August 2019. Due to certain “complexities,” he said, some part of the work had been delayed till December and the whole project would be finished, tentatively, by the end of March.Daljit Bhatia, ex-MC from ward no 7, where the site is located, said the bhoomi poojan (ceremony to launch the project) took place on September 21, 2018, and work was being undertaken jointly by the PWD and the railways, but things were going slow. The state government had done its share of the work to lay out the roads leading to the underpass, and the railways would be covering the stretch over the underpass, Bhatia said, adding that as part of the construction had not been completed, finalising the work by March did not seem likely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rail-underpass-project-in-ambala-on-slow-track/story-b2YaZj19lAwHeeOmTQ74wM.html

01-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad to look for non-operational institutes for quarantine centres as colleges ready to open||A few educational institutions in Ghaziabad have approached the district health department, urging them to vacate the premises that were taken over by authorities and converted into quarantine centres and L1 category hospitals for Covid-19 patients. The district officials had taken over nine private colleges and converted them into quarantine centres. A few were turned into L1 hospitals to treat non-critical Covid patients. The officials of the district health department said the management of such colleges have approached them seeking the premises back as they will be reopening soon.Under the unlock 4 guidelines, issued by the UP government, the government had said that all educational institutions, coaching centres and schools etc will remain closed till September 30. The guidelines also said that from September 21, up to 50% teaching and non-teaching staff may be permitted to be called to schools at a time for online teaching/tele-guidance/counselling and related work. “Currently, we have only two quarantine centres running which have admission of 70 suspected patients. We also have one L1 hospital operational at SRM College, Modinagar, where we have 66 patients admitted. We had earlier vacated the Divyajyoti Hospital in Niwari and the number of Covid-19 cases admitted there were fewer. Now, one more college has approached us and asked us to vacate,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said. The CMO added that they have also shut one testing/sampling booth which was set up at IMS College, Dasna, and are in the process of shifting it elsewhere. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) for functioning of educational institutions will be issued by the Union health ministry separately, the guidelines said. The officials said that due to expected operations from September 21, the colleges have demanded vacating the premises. “Some of the colleges have approached us asking us to vacate their premises. In such a case, we will now be focussing on finding non-operational institutions to set up quarantine centres and L1 hospitals. We can also choose banquet halls where these arrangements can be made. As of now, we have fewer number of L1 category patients as well as suspected cases in quarantine centres,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The officials said a majority of L1 hospitals were vacated after the state government allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients on July 21. Since then, about 1,200 patients were allowed home isolation and this considerably reduced the burden on L1 hospitals. According to health department officials, of the total cases, about 75% patients are asymptomatic while 15% are those who have moderate symptoms and need to be referred to L2 category hospitals. The rest are admitted to L3 hospitals, which are meant for treatment of patients with severe symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-to-look-for-non-operational-institutes-for-quarantine-centres-as-colleges-ready-to-open/story-UTq2vZ896i0XKMYfo8FMuM.html
01-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 10 residential segments accounted for about 66% Covid-19 cases in last six months||Out of the 25 residential segments in Ghaziabad, 10 of them accounts for over 66% of total Covid-19 cases in the district, according to limited six-month figures available with the health department till August 30. Till Tuesday, according to the state control room, Ghaziabad accounted for 8465 cases, figuring in the top-10 districts in terms of case count in Uttar Pradesh.According to August 30 limited data, Ghaziabad had 8212 cases, with 6756 discharges and 68 deaths.The resdiential segments under Karhera-2 (comprising Indirapuram, Makanpur and Kanawani), with 805 cases, shared 10.56% of the total Covid-19 case load in the district, while the Carte segment (comprising localities like Kavi Nagar, Avantika, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar, Daulatpura, Maliwara, Mahindra Enclave, Ashok Nagar, and Nasirpur) shared of about 8.63% of the case load. Similarly, Raj Nagar had 7.99% of cases, Sahibabad-II 7.35%, Dasna 7.03%, Vaishali 5.56%, Vasundhara 5.54%, Sadik Nagar 4.85%, Ghookhna 4.64% and Vijay Nagar-1 4.03%. “The areas have high population density and after opening of lockdown, interaction among the population and their mobility has also increased. This has led high number of cases in these areas. The incidence is however low in rural pockets. Although the share of these areas is high, we have been able to achieve discharge rate of about 82.26% (till August 30) and our patients are recovering fast,” said Dr. NK Gupta, Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer (CMO).Earlier in June, the segments of Karhera-2, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Sahibabad-2 and Khoda among others were ranked in the top 10 high incidence areas, which are in trans-Hindon (city) areas of the city, in the district. Thereafter, with curbs being relaxed, the trend changed with more activities opening up and cis-Hindon (old city) segments of Carte, Raj Nagar and Vijay Nagar-1 etc started reporting more cases. SEVEN CONSTANTSWhile the top-10 segments with high incidence of cases is subject to change every month, seven resdiential segments -- Karhera-2, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Sahibabad-2, Carte, Raj Nagar and Dasna -- have consistently ranked under the top-10 high incidence, in terms of case numbers, area from June. Dasna was a high incidence area even in May when the district had only 305 cases. Ghookhna joined the top-10 list from July. In June alone, the top-10 high incidence areas accounted for 65.5% of total Covid cases, while in July they had a share of about 67.27%. In August alone, the top 10 segments have a total share of about 73.10%.In August, segments of Carte, Dasna and Raj Nagar, all parts of cis-Hindon areas, remained as the three high incidence areas while the segments of Karhera-2, Sahibabad-2, Vasundhara and Vaishali lagged in number of fresh Covid-19 cases. “The incidence of cases is spreading in different areas but we are tackling them with increased surveillance and testing. Since there are no more restrictions at the borders, people are travelling to other cities,” said district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey. “We can only bank on surveillance to find cases and followed immediately by testing and referral so that their treatment can start. The Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad, said that the top-10 segments had a higher working population that had to move out of the city often. “Initially the infection was high in areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and Khoda etc where majority people go to Delhi for work. When the lockdown was opened, the infection spread in city areas also. Covid-19 is more prevalent in areas where population density is high and people move regularly. However, in rural areas the incidence is less,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of IMA, Ghaziabad. “Although the incidence is high in these areas but the discharge rate of patients recovering is also high at about 83% and the severity of infection has also come down. Now, since activities have opened up, the onus is also on residents to strictly follow health protocols with use of masks and adhere to social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-10-residential-segments-accounted-for-about-66-covid-19-cases-in-last-six-months/story-oPTMKPSUWJqU6cazfDvqLP.html

After the incident, the suspect fled with his accomplices who were waiting in a car parked nearby, the police said. The security guard, Shivranjit Singh, a resident of Jewar, said that the management of IDBI Bank has enforced a social distancing norm and only four persons are allowed inside at a time. “On Monday around 10.30 am, I was standing at the door when the suspect visited the bank and tried to go inside the branch. He said that he wanted to deposit money. I stopped him and asked him to wait for his turn. The suspect lost his cool and manhandled me. I somehow managed the situation and ousted him,” Singh said. The complainant said that the suspect came back again at 6.15pm and beat him up. The bank’s branch manager, Dr Sarvesh Gupta, said that the business hours were over by that time. “The bank’s shutters were half down and the unarmed security guard was standing at the door. The suspect approached the security guard and started slapping him without a provocation. The man also tried to push him inside the parked car,” Gupta said. The branch manager further said that the suspect and his accomplices may have come with criminal intent. The security guard put up resistance and banged the shutter to alert the bank officials, after which the officials reached the spot and sounded an emergency alarm and informed the police, Gupta said.The suspect soon fled the spot in the car parked outside. The security guard filed a complaint at Sector Beta 2 police station. Sujeet Upadhyaya, station house officer, Sector Beta 2 police station, said that the police have received the complaint. “We are investigating the CCTV footage to identify and arrest the suspect. A case has been registered against the suspect under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of Indian Penal Code,” he said.

The police said they have registered an FIR but are yet to ascertain the amount of cash stolen, but sources estimate that it could be about ₹2-3 lakh.The incident took place between 4am and 4.30am Tuesday at the Sector 11 branch of a prominent bank, which has an ATM kiosk at its main entrance. The police said no guard was posted outside the kiosk during the night hours.The thieves blinded the CCTV cameras by spraying some liquid on them. “They were about four men and two of them, with their faces masked, entered the kiosk. As soon as they entered, they sprayed some liquid on the CCTV cameras after which nothing could be seen. The others stood guard outside. The bank’s security guard was not on duty at night. Our police control room van reached the spot within seven minutes after being alerted y the centralised control room of the bank in Mumbai,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). “They used a gas cutter to cut the machine and flee with the cash. The bank officials are yet to confirm the amount of cash in the ATM. However, they have given a complaint based on which we have registered an FIR,” he added. Police have registered an FIR under IPC sections 380 (theft) and 427 (mischief causing damages) at the Indirapuram police station. There was a similar incident in Gautam Budh Nagar -- robbers had attempted to flee with the machine itself. Since both these incidents took place the same night, police suspect the role of the same gang in both crimes.“There was an attempt to take away an ATM from a kiosk in Harola village around 3.05am Tuesday. They had just started cutting through the machine with a gas cutter when a PCR van, making rounds of the area, came that way and seeing it, the robbers fled. The Ghaziabad incident occurred a few of hours later. There is a strong possibility that it might be the same gang behind both incidents. No formal complaint was filed in the GB Nagar incident as yet,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Noida police. On August 13, robbers had decamped with an ATM machine from the Gijhore village which had Rs 4 lakh in it. The same night they had also attempted to take another machine in Mamura village but were unable to do so after alarms were activated. “We will beef up patrolling and investigation is on to trace the gang. We are also scanning CCTV footage from the area to get clues,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gang-of-four-men-cuts-through-atm-in-ghaziabad-flee-with-2-3-cash/story-TUnnklzGUfD6GeqnpEVV5K.html

01-09-2020||Delhi||Man murders roommates after tiff over paying rent in west Delhi||Two men were stabbed to death by their third roommate in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar on Monday evening after an altercation over payment of rent.Police said the third man, who shared the room with the duo, had refused to pay rent because he had gone to his hometown in Amora, Uttar Pradesh, for four months during the lockdown. Police said the suspect was arrested from his hometown early on Tuesday.According to the police, a call was received at Khyala police station around 7.30pm stating that two men had been stabbed and were lying in their room on the first floor of a building in D block. The duo was identified as Mohammad Ajam, 45 and Amir Hasan, 46, both vegetable vendors. “A police team reached the spot found the two men lying in a pool of blood. They were shifted to a hospital where they were pronounced dead and the bodies sent for post-mortem examination. The duo had been stabbed multiple times. A case of murder was registered and a forensics team was called to inspect the scene of crime ,” said a senior police officer. The officer said that the incident came to light after one of Amir’s friend called him but the call went unanswered. When he couldn’t reach Aamir despite multiple calls, he visited his room and found the door unlocked. When he entered inside, he found both Aamir and Aazam lying on the floor in blood and alerted the neighbours, who in turn informed the police, the officer said.“Locals told us that Ajam and Amir shared their room with one Saakir, 23, who is also a roadside vendor and a native of Amroha, UP. They said Sakir had left for his hometown four months ago and had returned a fortnight ago. After his return, Amir and Ajam asked him to pay rent for four months, to which Sakir refused. This led to an altercation. The police also realised that Saakir was missing since the time of murder” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said teams were then sent to Saakir’s hometown and he was nabbed from there, before he could flee.“Saakir confessed to having killed the two men. He said they were pressurising him to pay the rent for the time period which he spent in his village. He said they had had many arguments and the two men had used foul language against him, which enraged him. On Monday night, he said, when the two men were asleep, he murdered them using a knife and a chopper. He hid the murder weapon and left for his village to collect some money and then flee to an undisclosed location,” Purohit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-murders-roommates-after-tiff-over-paying-rent-in-west-delhi/story-EtPYT56ogplQeKOmn6YqHK.html

01-09-2020||City||Man bludgeoned to death in front of wife over financial dispute||New Delhi: A 45-year-old man was bludgeoned to death with bricks, allegedly by his relatives, in front of his wife over a financial dispute at their home in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala on Sunday evening, police said. His wife was also injured and her clothes were torn when she tried to save his life, the police said. The victim’s wife and son alleged that the man was murdered over a financial dispute – demanding R45 lakh that his brother, who died in July due to some ailment, had given to their relatives as a loan a few months ago. The woman accused her in-laws of allegedly “instigating their relatives to kill them,” deputy commissioner of police (Rohni) Pramod Kumar Mishra said. A first information report has been registered under Sections 302 (murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code. “We registered a case on the woman’s complaint. Nobody has been arrested yet as the suspects are absconding,” DCP Mishra said. The names of all the people in the case -- the victims and the alleged accused -- have been withheld since disrobing and assault charges have been mentioned. The couple’s 17-year-old son said that on Sunday, a condolence meeting was organised at his home to mark his uncle’s death. It was attended by his father’s maternal uncle, his wife, and cousins. “During the gathering, my father asked his maternal uncle and cousin to return R45 lakh that they had taken from my uncle before his death. An argument ensued over that and the relatives left our home,” the teenager said. Around 5.30 pm, the teenager said, he had gone to a nearby market when his father’s relatives returned with a dozen people in four different vehicles and forcibly entered his house. “Seeing the relatives, my grandparents came out of their room and instigated them to kill my parents. They kicked and punched my father before repeatedly attacking him on his chest, face and head with bricks. When my mother went to save him, they tore her clothes and assaulted her. When my father fell unconscious, all of them, including my grandparents, fled,” the minor said. The injured couple was admitted to two different hospitals. While the husband was declared brought dead, the woman has suffered simple injuries. Her statement was recorded, the DCP said. “Our probe has revealed that the murder took place over a financial dispute. Efforts are on to nab the suspects. Further investigation is on,” said DCP Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-bludgeoned-to-death-in-front-of-wife-over-financial-dispute/story-yaWgOq8J8ikUCVzPAddc7L.html
01-09-2020||City||Delhi: Man who jumped parole caught twice in 72 hours||New Delhi: A 25-year-old man who had jumped parole earlier this year found himself twice cornered as he was arrested two times in 72 hours after again committing crimes.The arrested man, Aakash alias Bawla, was first arrested on August 28 when he was escaping after snatching a mobile phone in Rohini and then again on August 31 -- two days after he fled from police custody while being produced at the court in the Tihar Jail complex in the first case. Aakash had been involved in nearly a dozen crimes, including murder, robbery and snatching over the years, police said on Tuesday. Officers from the Rajouri Garden police station, who arrested Aakash for the second time, said he was riding a red scooter when they intercepted him near a drain at Punjabi Bagh around 7 pm on Monday. “When the man saw the police at a check post, he changed his route. This raised suspicion and our motorcycle patrol team chased him. After some distance, the team brushed their bike against his scooter, causing him to fall. He tried to jump into the drain but was caught,” a senior police officer said, asking not to be named. According to the officer, the man identified himself as Aakash alias Bawla. Until his arrest, the police did not know he was a habitual criminal and had fled from Tihar Jail just two days ago. Aakash had a country-made pistol loaded with a bullet, a stolen scooter, and four stolen cellphones with him. “He was found to be a parole-jumper as well,” said another police officer, requesting anonymity. During his interrogation, the second officer said, it was found Aakash had his first brush with crime at the age of 17 in the year 2012 when he and his 13 associates allegedly murdered a security guard of a factory during a dacoity bid in outer Delhi’s Samaipur Badli. He was apprehended at that time and sent to a correction home for a few months. “In 2013, Aakash allegedly entered the house of a minor girl in Mangolpuri and injured her father with a sword because he had asked him not to stalk her. Aakash was arrested and jailed for three years,” said the officer. After being released from jail in 2016, Aakash teamed up with a Sagarpur resident, Sunny, and they committed a series of snatchings and robberies, police said. During this period, he was arrested at least three times. He last came out jail in March 2020 on a parole of 45 days. He jumped parole and continued his criminal activities, the officer said. On August 28 this year, Akash and his associate Amit alias Tushar were caught when they were fleeing after snatching a cellphone. The next day, the two were being produced in a court at Tihar Jail when Aakash freed himself from a constable’s custody, scaled a 10-foot boundary wall of the jail and fled in an auto-rickshaw. Director General (Tihar prisons) Sandeep Goel confirmed the incident. “The person escaped while he was being produced in court at the Tihar jail complex.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-who-jumped-parole-caught-twice-in-72-hours/story-uEKxHmEn0Yo8QNGlMchV3J.html

01-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: A2Z stops fuel plant at Jamalpur dump, PPCB cites violation||At a time when the monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has taken strict note of the municipal corporation’s (MC) failure in taking up solid waste management, private garbage collection company A2Z company has stopped operating the Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) plant and compost plant at the main dumpsite on Tajpur road after Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has denied consent for running the same.This has increased the trouble for MC which is facing heat over its failure in dealing with around 20 lakh tonnes of legacy waste (garbage), which has already been dumped at the main dumpsite. Around 1,000 metric tonnes of garbage, which is generated in the city on a daily basis, would now accumulate at the main dumpsite.The landfill generates highly combustible methane that leads to spontaneous fires, causing massive burning of garbage and highly toxic emissions. This, in turn, leads to widespread air pollution, with serious health implications. Recently, the NGT monitoring committee had directed the PPCB to impose a ₹15 lakh bank guarantee on MC for its failure in dealing with solid waste, and out of this ₹5 lakh was for not dealing with legacy waste.General manager of A2Z company, Vishant Chaudhary said, “The PPCB had given consent to operate the RDF plant for three months in October 2017. After that, we are regularly in touch with the PPCB for getting their permission and have been clearing the objections raised by the board. Now on August 21, the PPCB has rejected their application, due to which we had to stop the RDF and compost plant at the main dumpsite. Now, we have written a letter to the MC to get permission from the PPCB. If we still fail to get the consent then we will be left with no other option than to move the NGT.”A PPCB official said that one of the reasons is that the A2Z company was not running the plant to its full capacity. Starting from March this year till July, the plant was run only at 15% of its capacity, while the remaining waste was getting accumulated at the dumpsite, he said.PPCB member secretary, Krunesh Garg said, “The permission was denied due to certain violations and the company had also failed to follow the directions issued in the past. The company has again applied for permission to operate after fulfilling the requirements.”In 2011, the MC signed a contract with the A2Z company to lift garbage from houses and secondary dumping points and manage the waste by installing a refuse-derived fuel plant, compost plant, and sanitary landfill at the main dumpsite. The RDF plant was made functional in 2017 but it has not been running on full capacity. The A2Z company has also made operational the compost plant at the main site. On average, around 1,000 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city, which was around 1,100 metric tonnes before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-a2z-stops-fuel-plant-at-jamalpur-dump-ppcb-cites-violation/story-cXUZMgSz665rOjurGIrSDN.html

01-09-2020||City||NCRB report: Punjab saw 7 suicides a day in 2019, recorded 37% surge over last year||Punjab witnessed an average seven suicides a day in 2019, reveals the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report that was released on Monday. The report, however, fell short of making vocational classification of these deaths and attributes ‘illness’ as the single largest contributing reason behind the suicide cases reported in the state at 27.7%. A total of 2,357 suicide cases were reported in Punjab last year. The report shares only national figures for farm suicides. Even the state-wise breakdown of the all-India numbers has not been released by the bureau. Experts and rights associations claim that small and marginal farmers and farm labourers form a sizeable section of those taking their lives due to financial stress. What makes them equally worried is that Punjab witnessed a surge of 37.5% per 1 lakh population in 2019 than number of suicides reported in the previous year. The report says Punjab was the second state after Bihar (44.7%) that saw the highest spike in suicides in percentage terms over the last year. Of the 1.39 lakh suicide cases reported in all states last year, 10,281 (7.4%) were associated with the farming sector. Of these, 5,957 were farmers/cultivators and 4,324 agricultural labourers. The NCRB report’s claim that ‘bankruptcy or indebtedness’ was behind only 4.2% suicide cases across the country has been contested by the farmer organisations. Joginder Singh Ugrahan, state chief of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU Ugrahan) raised finger at the figures of suicide cases in Punjab. “As per our estimate, about 3,000 farmers ended their lives in Punjab whereas the NCRB pegs the overall figure at less than 2,400. Projection of linking only 4% deaths to indebtedness reflects dilution of facts,” he said. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of another BKU faction, said even in the suicide cases attributed to ‘illness’ financial stress among farmers cannot be ruled out. “It is only tweaking of figures as anyone taking life due to a disease is actually facing non-availability of resources like healthcare facilities. For a small and marginal farmer, illness and family disputes are directly related to their inability to repay loans and an increased cost of living,” said Lakhowal. Central University of Punjab chancellor SS Johl, an agriculture economist, said the debt waiver scheme the Congress government launched has not helped the farmers in distress. “Following local waiver scheme announcement, small and marginal farmers stopped repaying loans. As the Amarinder Singh-led government did not implement the plan in letter and spirit, farmers are in now more miserable situation as interests have spiraled,” said Johl. Kesar Singh Bhangoo, a professor at the Centre for Research in Economic Change at Punjabi University who has done an intensive research on farm suicides, said the number of farmers who took the drastic step has been rising since 2011. “There may be instances wherein families were reluctant to complete the legal formalities of deaths to claim the death as suicides. It is contrary to the ground reality that a sizeable number of farmers are taking extreme steps. Even the Punjab State Farmers & Farm Workers Commission has ended up as a government organ and failed to prepare any roadmap for the farming sector,” said Bhangoo. Suninder Tung, a professor of psychology at Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), said it is important to identify the vulnerable sections who were committing suicides. “The suicide rate is alarming. It is important to identify the reasons behind such a high rate of suicides in a holistic manner,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncrb-report-punjab-saw-7-suicides-a-day-in-2019-recorded-37-surge-over-last-year/story-cTQWvCyJpmW4ltqTQfX00O.html

Some shopkeepers also distributed sweets in the Chaura Bazar market welcoming the government’s decision to discontinue the odd-even rule.Shopkeepers now demand that the government should also remove weekend lockdown in the city so that they could pull themselves out of the financial morass.State general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra said that the decision taken by the government to discontinue the odd-even criteria has come as a relief for traders and the footfall of customers has already increased in the markets. But still, only around 25% of footfall is being witnessed in the markets.“If the liquor vends and restaurants can be allowed to open on weekends, then why not the shops? Only traders are being targeted by the decisions being taken by the state government. Most customers visit markets on weekends and weekend lockdown is taking a toll on our business. We will conduct meetings with different market associations in the coming days and raise an agitation to press for our demands,” said Mehra. President of Jawahar Nagar shopkeepers’ association, Om Prakash Ahuja said, “If the weekend lockdown is removed, it would be a big relief for traders, who are reeling under losses.”Shopkeepers in Ghumar Mandi raised an agitation against the odd-even rule on Monday and opened few shops to mark their protest against the government.Social distancing goes for a toss in marketsWith all shops opening on Tuesday, the hustle-bustle in the markets returned especially in the old city area, but visitors and shopkeepers were seen giving social distancing a miss. Visitors thronged shops in Mata rani chowk, Saban Bazar, Girja Ghar chowk, and adjoining areas.A shopkeeper in the Mata Rani chowk area, Gurjeet Singh said, “We are making all efforts to maintain social distancing and asking visitors to wear masks. But it is very difficult to maintain social distancing due to the narrow streets in the market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-odd-even-rule-shopkeepers-in-ludhiana-want-weekend-lockdown-to-go/story-ETk34w6NyvKiKJXpDTBnXL.html

Now, he can be arrested any time.Special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula said, “The statements of the three approvers proved to be clinching evidence against the former DGP.” Earlier, Saini had filed an anticipatory bail application seeking stay on his arrest after murder charges were added to the FIR registered against him and others at the Mataur police station in Mohali. The police have claimed that Saini misused the concession of bail granted to him while violating the conditions set out in the court’s May 11 order. The accused has also tried to stall the investigation, they said. The prosecution also pointed out that he also violated another condition of staying in his Chandigarh house till the lockdown period except in case of medical emergency. Saini’s lawyer APS Deol said they will file an appeal against the judgment in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Saini’s another plea in high court wherein he is seeking quashing of the FIR or transfer of the case to the CBI, will come up for hearing in HC on Wednesday. Multani was allegedly picked up by two officials in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, in which four policemen deputed in his security were killed. The police later claimed that Multani escaped from their custody in Qadian, Gurdaspur. Former DSP Baldev Singh, Satvir Singh, a former inspector, Har Sahai Sharma, Anokh Singh, a former sub-inspector, besides Jagir and Kuldip Singh were named in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini/story-fwWtOpDJcqIwBPD9bxZYCO.html

01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhbir expresses shock over neglect of Amritsar||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday expressed shock at the callous manner in which the Congress government had neglected Amritsar which has been ranked amongst the 10 filthiest big cities in the country. Demanding a high-level probe to identify those responsible for defiling the name of the holy city globally, Sukhbir said the city was being discriminated against under the Congress government. “It is shocking that the Swachh Survekshan rankings had revealed that cleanliness in the walled city comprising Sri Harmandar Sahib was the worst, with sewerage facilities being choked and no planned system of garbage collection,” he said. On Tuesday, HT published a story, the first in a five-part series, on Amritsar’s performance in the national rankings, taking an in-depth look at what ails its sanitation and cleanliness. Stating that this state of affairs as well as the Swachh Survekshan ratings undertaken under the Swachh Bharat mission would have a detrimental effect on the image of the city internationally, the SAD president called upon the Congress government to probe corruption in use of funds. He also called for immediate approvals for all pending infrastructure work as well as procurement of more modern machinery that would be needed for cleaning and disposing garbage. Sukhbir said he had been constantly highlighting how the Congress government was discriminating against the city and how cleanliness had been given the go-by in the case of the Heritage Street. “I have myself also cleaned the street on occasions to send a message to the government to maintain this prestigious project but it does not seem to have had any effect on the Congress government. Garbage piles keep lying unattended, making them eyesores for visitors who come from across the globe,” he added. He said the SAD would not sit idle and allow this state of affairs to continue. “The party would initiate a campaign to force the government to provide optimum civic facilities to the holy city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-expresses-shock-over-neglect-of-amritsar/story-GsEJm5fLrWJgsa8wuEKcxJ.html

The CM was addressing deputy commissioners (DCs) and police chiefs of 12 districts through video conferencing from Shimla. He directed the DCs to simplify process of entry to the state but also continue with the mandatory e-pass. He said the government was ensuring that the development in the state does not get affected due to the pandemic. The CM said the life of virus during the rainy season as per medical experts is longer, thus, greater caution must be adopted to check its spread. He said effective steps must also be taken to keep a check on infection amongst the corona warriors including doctors, paramedical staff, police and sanitary workers. The chief minister said asymptomatic patients should be kept in home isolation and health workers should regularly visit such patients for their medical check up. He said better quarantine facility must also be provided for doctors and other paramedical staff. “Industrial units must be asked to create their own quarantine facilities with a minimum 10% total strength of their employees. Small industrial units must be encouraged to create such facilities by pooling,” the CM directed the officials. He said till date 2,14,182 people have been tested for the virus, out of which 6,116 were found infected. “Cases per lakh in Himachal Pradesh were 87.3% as compared to national average of 267.7 cases per lakh.

The database of every vehicle which is checked will be generated and it will have the vehicle number, driver’s name and picture, owner’s details, mobile number and picture of the vehicle,” he added.Terrorists use explosive-laden vehicles in J&K to target convoys of security forces. Last year’s Pulwama terror attack on a CRPF convoy still remains fresh in the minds of people.“If such vehicles are checked via the app, they can easily be traced. Those who indulge in illegal activities on the Pathankot-Jammu-Srinagar highway will surely feel the heat,” the SSP said.“This technology will also reduce burden on cops. It is not practical for human mind to remember all faces and vehicles, so the app will be of immense help. Many stolen vehicles have been recovered in the past few days,” he added.The SSP said that the J&K Police would like to bring all the vehicles entering, leaving and plying in the UT under its ambit.“Checking all vehicles entering the UT will be difficult as the volume of traffic is heavy in J&K. So we are randomly assigning registration to different checkpoints to begin with,” he said. The SSP added that the app is easy to operate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-develop-app-to-keep-tabs-on-vehicles-in-j-k/story-gJg9jR4UOetnOUCeh4CgQO.html

If JD(U) decides to provide a free entry, there will be a virtual stampede in RJD.”Seven MLAs and five MLCs of RJD, which leads the opposition Grand Alliance, have already joined JD (U) in the last one month. This includes Parsa MLA Chandrika Rai, the estranged father-in-law of Lalu Yadav’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav. Chandrika Rai is son of former chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai.“The RJD tally will be worse than 2010. It is like product which has no takers,” Lallan Singh said.RJD, however, challenged Munger MP’s claim. “Such inductions and invites are indicative of desperation. JD(U) has now become a clone of BJP and, like its partner, can go to any length to encourage desertions. When a leader switches sides, it is hardly an endorsement of a winning team. Rather, it’s a last-ditch attempt to stay relevant in electoral politics at any cost,” said Mritunjay Tiwari, media coordinator of RJD.Given the seat constraint in alliance politics, the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) is seriously hamstrung in extending an open offer to sitting RJD MLAs, especially after the recent demand aired by BJP MPs during their interaction with national president J P Nadda favouring a 50:50 seat sharing formula with JD (U).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-rjd-mla-joins-jd-u-13-desertions-in-a-month/story-virTdhAfLkNNZiv3a9Y7UJ.html
01-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: Only 178 appear for JEE Main, against 1,400 in January this year||The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Main, for admission to engineering colleges was held on Tuesday amid stringent precautions and social distancing measures in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Candidates appearing for the examination in the first shift from 9 am to 12 pm reached the examination centre at TCS ION digital zone, Sherpur chowk and were asked to abide by Covid norms.As per sources, only 42% of candidates showed up in the first shift and 48% appeared in the examination in the second shift (3 pm to 6 pm).In the first shift, of the total 170 students, only 73 appeared in the examination while 105 students out of 218 turned up in the second shift. However, in January this year, over 1,400 students took the entrance examination in two shifts. JEE Main is a computer-based test (CBT) conducted by National Testing Agency twice a year for admission to National Institute of Technology (NITs), Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), and government-funded technical institutes. Candidates can appear for either one or both entrance examinations. The best of the two scores is considered for the ranking.Staff was deployed at the entry gate to check the admit card of candidates and a 3-ply mask was given to them by the examination authority. Candidates had to undergo thermal screening at the entry gate and at several points hand sanitisers were also kept.Many students who appeared in the BArch paper in the first shift found the mathematics section to be difficult on account of numerical questions. The paper carried a total of 400 marks.A candidate Anjali Yadav said, “I found the mathematics portion difficult as it took me plenty amount of time to answer all questions. Physics and chemistry were comparatively easy and it was a balanced paper. The authorities have made elaborate arrangements to maintain social distancing at centres. All the students have been asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they entered the centre, they were told to use the masks provided by the examination authority.”“In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, NTA has taken extra precautions to ensure the safety of students,” said, Rahul Kumar, a resident of Kitchlu Nagar. He said, “Of the three sections, I found the mathematics portion tricky and time-consuming. Overall, it was a balanced paper. Somehow, I was able to complete the paper in the prescribed time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jee-main-held-amid-stringent-covid-protocols/story-oblGqk1JvmcfwsgVYFQ0FO.html

They also review every bit of PMC’s preparations for the monsoon,” he said.Dismissing the charge levelled by the state government against him, Suman said flimsy grounds such as lack of leadership quality, inaccessibility, absence of proper cleaning of drainage, etc, were cited as reasons for his suspension, which never came into effect. “Why the government did not fix responsibility on the officers who waste public exchequer and time to sanction projects under Smart City mission and then cancel them without any substantial reasons,” asked the former PMC head.Almost a month before Patna was caught in deluge due to heavy showers for four days (September 27-30) last year, Suman had stepped down as the PMC chief and sought voluntary retirement from his parent department, the ministry of revenue. Suman claimed his VRS was accepted recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cm-too-guilty-for-patna-waterlogging-says-ex-pmc-boss-in-the-dock/story-TWKsWtvutuBhBfTddtzvoO.html

Many Covid-19 patients, who have since recovered, are reluctant to donate plasma because they are scared that they might get infected again. However, we are trying to convince them that the Covid-19 wards and plasma donation centres are two separate entities. And the plasma donation process is absolutely safe,” said Dr. Ashutosh Sayana, principal, GDMC.He explained that the hospital authorities had pulled out all stops to create awareness about donation of plasma through mass media such as newspapers, television channels and other means of communication like social media platforms. Hospital counsellors have been tasked to convince recovered Covid-19 patients to donate plasma, but their efforts have come a cropper to date. Dr. Shashi Upreti, in-charge of plasma therapy and blood bank, GDMC Hospital, said not a single recovered Covid-19 patient has donated plasma since the equipment for plasma therapy was installed at the government-run healthcare facility.“The machinery for conducting plasma therapy was installed at the hospital around end-July, but not a single recovered Covid-19 patient has donated plasma to date. We managed to trace seven-eight recovered Covid-19 patients, but unfortunately, they didn’t have sufficient anti-bodies. As a result, they couldn’t donate plasma,” said Dr. Upreti.She said only the mild and severe Covid-19 patients are mostly able to develop enough antibodies to donate plasma.“For plasma donation we have to check a few parametres. For instance, Covid-19 patients in the age group between 18 and 65 years are eligible to donate, except for pregnant women and those suffering from comorbidities. Most Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic, who recover quickly. However, only mild and severe Covid-19 patients can develop enough antibodies that help them to donate plasma. We have over 800 such eligible donors, but a vast majority refused to donate their plasma. Of the 800, only eight were screened and all of them found to be ineligible, as they did not have sufficient antibodies,” she said.The officials urged the public to come forward and help other Covid-19 patients in the hill state. Dehradun district has reported the second-highest Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand, as over 4,000 people have been found to be afflicted with the contagion.The hospital authorities also highlighted a crisis of blood in the blood bank. Only 10 units of blood were available in the bank until Monday and none from negative blood groups. “We are trying to organise blood donations camps, as the hospital is in dire need of blood for its bank,” Dr Upreti added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/reluctant-donors-make-plasma-collection-tough-at-uttarkhand-s-doon-hospital/story-qn1Is2BmtxKscnz3N96sPM.html

In the first case, the victim, Amarjit Kaur, 60, a resident of Khandur village, said she had gone to Jodhan Market on Monday. There, three women and a man in a car stopped near her and introduced themselves as her relatives.Amarjit said the man was in the driver’s seat, an elderly woman in the seat beside him and two more women in the back seat. The group engaged her in a conversation, and soon after they left, she realised that her gold earrings were missing. ASI Hakam Singh, who is investigating the case, said they had registered a case under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code on Amarjit’s complaint.Police said another woman, Baljit Kaur of Kishangarh Channa village, was targeted by a gang with similar modus operandi in Sarabha village.A separate case of theft was registered in this regard. Police investigation is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gang-takes-away-gold-ornaments-from-two-women-in-ludhiana/story-o3DaOT7CYrl8MiQeLM1jBI.html
01-09-2020||Bhopal||Congress cries foul as Madhya Pradesh police says 70% of complaints in Vyapam scam vague||The Madhya Pradesh police’s special task force (STF), which initiated the re-investigation of Vyapam scam on direction of then Congress-led state government in July 2019, has found 70% complaints vague and anonymous and not even related to the scam, said an STF officer. However, the opposition Congress has alleged that it’s Bharatiya Janata Party government which prevailed over the STF to dispose of complaints without indicting anyone. Also read: Five years on, Vyapam scam returns to haunt Madhya PradeshAccording to the STF officer, the force had received 1,355 Vyapam-related complaints in 2013 and 2014. During this period, the STF registered 154 cases and handed them over to the CBI in July 2015, under orders of the Supreme Court. A large number of complaints were handed over to various district police stations and 197 complaints were pending with the task force. “STF started scrutiny of these 197 complaints last year in July and didn’t find complaints related to Vyapam scam or any other organized crime. Out of 197, STF found more than 70% complaints vague and anonymous as reportedly these were mainly based on accusations against individual candidates, high profile people and government officers without any evidence while the remaining were mostly against candidates for allegedly using fake documents and committing irregularities in different recruitment exams. There were more of personal complaints than any concrete charge related to Vyapam scam,” said the STF officer who didn’t wish to be named. “Out of the remaining, 55 complaints have been disposed of and 16 FIRs have been registered against 16 people for using fake domicile certificates and forged documents, in February this year. The probe in the remaining few complaints has come to a halt in the absence of any documents related to proof for the past six months,” said another officer. STF, additional director general (ADG) of police, Vipin Maheshwari said, “Out of the total complaints, a few complaints have been found worthy of investigation but these are not related to Vyapam scam. Mostly these are individual complaints against candidates who appeared in different exams organised by MP Professional Examination Board (Vyapam). The investigation in these complaints is getting delayed as it needs proof, which are being collected from other government departments.” We will take all the complaints to a logical end soon, said Maheshwari. The CBI has already completed the investigation in 164 complaints out of 170 and filed charge sheets. In five of the remaining cases, the CBI will soon file supplementary charge sheets and in one case, a fresh charge sheet. According to a CBI officer, no foul play was found in 16 death cases out of the 24 related to middlemen, candidates and a journalist, who died during Vyapam scam investigation. The CBI has also filed a second closure report in the matter of much hyped death case of medical student Namrata Damor, which is pending before the court, said a CBI officer, who is not authorized to talk to media. Meanwhile, the whistle blowers said it was the end of Vyapam scam. “The STF didn’t register the statement of complainants. They didn’t even try to investigate the pending complaints. Otherwise, they would have surely found how medical college owners, politicians and government officers were involved in the scam and were also hiding important proof during the earlier investigation. When STF officers were afraid of taking action against high profile people during the regime of then Congress-led state government, we couldn’t have thought of any action against them under the BJP. Now, there is no hope left for justice to Vyapam scam victims,” said Dr Anand Rai, whistleblower and RTI activist. Another whistleblower, Ashish Chaturvedi, said, “Vyapam scam is now a thing of past. The CBI has already failed in probing the case efficiently and STF didn’t do anything concrete except registering FIR against some people. I put my life to risk to fight against high profile people for ruining the future of at least one generation but real culprits managed everything so well that the truth didn’t come out.” Congress MLA and former public relation minister PC Sharma said, “BJP formed its government in a hurry as its leaders were afraid of being sent behind the bars. It’s not STF which didn’t find anything but its BJP-led state government which asked the STF to dispose of all the complaints to save their people.” Home minister Narottam Mishra refused to comment when HT reached out via phone. BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Congress leaders have now started raising questions on everything. The investigative agency did its work efficiently, whether it was the CBI or the STF. The then Congress-led state government’s decision on re-investigation was just a political gimmick. The STF had already taken up all the complaints during investigation in 2013 and 2014.” The Vyapam scam surfaced in July 2013 when police in Indore arrested 20 impersonators appearing for the medical entrance examination. Vyapam is the acronym for Vyavsayik Pareeksha Mandal, the Hindi name for the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) which conducts entrance examinations for professional courses and recruitment tests for government posts ranging from food inspectors to forest guards. In all, 3,500 people were made accused by the CBI in different cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/congress-cries-foul-as-madhya-pradesh-police-says-70-of-complaints-in-vyapam-scam-vague/story-vSNSmPMEtSnqA3Jf199flJ.html

The applications were filed by the ED on August 14 before the chief judicial magistrate, Ludhiana, through special public prosecutor Lokesh Narang. The court heard the matter on August 18 and its order says, “Papers put up before me being duty magistrate. Record not received. Same be awaited till 29.08.2020.” The ED filed three applications after it learnt that the income tax department has placed fresh documents on the case files of Captain Amarinder Singh and Raninder Singh. The ED wanted to inspect or obtain the documents to carry forward its investigation under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), ED sources confirmed, requesting anonymity. The ED has urged the court to allow it to inspect the case file. Earlier, it had initiated action against Raninder under FEMA after the income tax department complained that he had lied under oath about trusts allegedly owned by him in Virgin Islands. Raninder had appeared before the ED in connection with a FEMA violation in 2016 also. Hearing in the three income tax cases against Amarinder and Raninder are underway in the Ludhiana court. The next hearing in the case of the CM is on September 9, while Raninder’s cases would come up on September 10. The IT department claimed Raninder misguided it during the probe and claimed he had documents related to the family’s income and trusts abroad. The IT department alleged that Raninder was a ‘settler’ of Jacaranda Trust, which the family formed. Other undisclosed trusts include Mulwala Holdings Limited and Allworth Venture Holding Limited. The father and son also allegedly carried out ‘undisclosed’ financial transactions through a bank account in HSBC, Geneva, and HSBC Financial Services Limited (Middle East). The IT department said the trusts were established in 2005 and most of the deals were routed through Virgin Islands. It submitted in the court that it has documents sourced from Virgin Islands that show Captain Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder are owners of Marine Mansions in Dubai and other properties in the United Kingdom. Both Amarinder and Raninder had earlier denied any wrongdoing and termed the charges false. Hindustan Times sent an email to the ED headquarters for seeking its official response on the matter but no reply was received till Tuesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-files-plea-with-ludhiana-court-to-inspect-new-records-of-it-cases-against-punjab-cm-son/story-V5HuIrCXkokeWZPVEorfTI.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Centre’s probe into scholarship scam attack on federal structure, says Punjab CM||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday took strong exception to an inquiry being ordered into the alleged scholarship scam by the Union ministry for social justice and empowerment without consulting the state government or waiting for the chief secretary’s probe report. Earlier, Union minister of state for commerce Som Prakash was quoted as saying that a departmental inquiry has been ordered by the social justice and empowerment ministry on his complaint and that he had taken up the matter with the minister concerned, Thawar Chand Gehlot. “The move is another attack on the federal structure of the Indian constitutional polity,” Capt Amarinder Singh said, adding that it was aimed at eroding the state government’s authority as part of the BJP-led central government’s agenda to undermine the governments in all non-BJP ruled states. But, he said, his government will not succumb to such petty and motivated pressures by the BJP or any of its alliance partners, including the Shiromani Akali Dal. He pointed out that the alleged scam into which the inquiry has been ordered took place from 2015-17 under the SAD-BJP regime. The chief minister said if the intent behind the so-called central government departmental investigation was to cover up the BJP-SAD tracks in the case, it would not succeed. It was during an audit by his government that misappropriations came to light, which were now the subject of the chief secretary’s inquiry, Capt Amarinder Singh said. The department had come across gaps in payments made to certain colleges as per the funds sanctioned during the previous regime and it was then that he had decided to order the probe, said the chief minister. The inquiry by him was in line with specific rules of governance and the only lawful course to take, he said, adding that any inquiry by a central department into a case relating to the state without consulting the latter was untenable. Capt Amarinder Singh also slammed the Centre over its anti-Dalit act of withdrawing the post-matric SC scholarship scheme, which was benefitting lakhs of poor SC students in the state by providing them access to higher education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-s-probe-into-scholarship-scam-attack-on-federal-structure-says-punjab-cm/story-vYE2NSXoDPMtCVfHJSAgnL.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal ex-BJP chief Rajeev Bindal’s cryptic post on social media creates flutter in party circles||Rajeev Bindal, who quit as state BJP chief on May 26 after his name surfaced in connection with the bribery scandal involving Dr Ajay Gupta, then Himachal director, health services, created a buzz in party circles with a cryptic social media post on Monday night, saying the BJP and the Jai Ram Thakur government should introspect on what they have lost and what they’ve gained. “Bharatiya Janata Party nay kya khoya kya paya va BJP sarkar nay kya khoya kya paya, iska akalan karna chahiye (The BJP and the government should analyse what they have gained and what they’ve lost),” Bindal, a five-time legislator, wrote on Facebook and Twitter on Monday night. He is incommunicado since then.State unit chief Suresh Kashyap, who has cracked the whip on dissidence in the past fortnight, refused to draw any inference from Bindal’s Facebook and Twitter posts, dismissing them as “Bindal ji’s personal views”. “Whatever Bindal ji has posted are his personal views. He has expressed his opinion on social media not on any party platform. One cannot draw any inference from the post,” said Kashyap, who represents Shimla in the Lok Sabha. Less than four months after being appointed state unit chief, Bindal had stepped down when health director Dr Ajay Gupta was arrested by the State Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau for irregularities in the purchase of equipment by the department. In his resignation letter to BJP national president JP Nadda, Bindal wrote: “Fingers are being raised at the BJP after the arrest of the former director, health services. Being the state BJP president, I feel the matter should be investigated thoroughly without any pressure. I am submitting my resignation on moral grounds.” AUDIO CLIP VOICE SAMPLES MATCH Meanwhile, the voice samples of the audio clip of the conversation between Dr Gupta and Prithvi Singh, an employee of a Punjab-based medical equipment supply firm who is also behind bars, have matched. In the clip that was widely shared on social media in May, Dr Gupta is heard demanding Rs 5 lakh for clearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kit orders for the state health department. Investigators had sought information from the state government on whether Bindal had recommended extension in the service of Dr Gupta, who was due to retire on June 30. The vigilance team could not find any such evidence. REACHING OUT TO SULKING LEADER Meanwhile, Bindal’s successor Kashyap is trying to quell dissidence within the state unit. More than half a dozen squabbling leaders of the state BJP’s Mahila Morcha were divested of their responsibilities recently. BJP general secretary in-charge of Shimla parliamentary constituency Purshottam Guleria has been assigned the task of holding consultations with Bindal, who has been sulking since chief minister Jai Ram Thakur did not induct him into his cabinet even though he was unanimously elected Vidhan Sabha Speaker later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-ex-bjp-chief-rajeev-bindal-s-cryptic-post-on-social-media-creates-flutter-in-party-circles/story-PgQ2f1EsRKsz5Jy79oCa1J.html

Among them, 50 cases are pending in the court and the total amount of these legal cases tax owners is Rs375 crore.”He said, “Most of these cases are of various mobile companies who had challenged the dues in the High Court. If the law department of the PMC follows up these cases on time, the civic body can get more revenue through property tax.”Vilas Kanade, head, property tax department, said, “There are some cases which have double registration for the same property. The total amount for such cases is around Rs136 crore. PMC administration is in a process to put the proposal in front of elected members to delete the double registration.”Velankar said, “Under RTI information, PMC accepted that they had various dues with government offices and various government departments like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER), Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and irrigation department.”“PMC property tax department has written a letter to the water department that instead of paying the water fee to the irrigation department they will recover the tax dues of Rs53 crore from them,” he said.Velankar said, “PMC is playing bands in front of citizens’ homes every year. Instead of concentrating efforts for small recovery, ideally, the PMC should focus on big defaulters.”Hemant Rasne, chairman, standing committee, said, “We are making all efforts to increase the revenue this year. We have deployed 500 additional staff in the property tax department to recover the dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/474-defaulters-owe-pmc-rs1-218-crore-in-property-tax-reveals-rti-query/story-5tWBoqO9nti5bWVf3rrMCK.html
01-09-2020||Pune||Online darshan and 7,500 police officials to ensure empty streets in Pune||The 11-day Ganpati festival will come to a close in Pune on Tuesday without the festivities that usually mark the end of the annual festival. However, the immersion ceremonies will be broadcast by the mandals on their respective social media accounts and by local news channels. “Pune has followed the code of conduct and has proved itself to be the cultural centre. Tomorrow’s (Tuesday) rules are clear: no permission for public immersion. All immersions should be done at local immersion spots. The manache Ganpati have decided the timings and will immerse at the mandaps or within the temple,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police. Annually, the city witnesses over 4,73,000 immersions in the river or at the public immersion spots, according to Shisve. “The immersion will begin at 11:30am with Kasba Ganpati. The manache Ganpati will follow within half an hour of each other as per the order,” said Shrikant Shete, president of Kasba Ganpati mandal. The manache Ganpati (five most important Ganpati’s of Pune) will follow an order for visarjan starting from Kasba Ganpati, followed by Tambdi Jogeshwari Ganpati, followed by Guruji Talim, Tulshibaug, and Kesari Wada. The details of the live broadcast can be found on the independent websites of each of the five. The annual festivities of devotees, rangoli, flowers, dhol-tasha, and procession will be missing and the immersion will happen either within the temple or the nearby mandaps installed by the public Ganpati trusts. “Hardly 10 people will be present - important trust workers - since it will be happening inside the temple. People have extended tremendous co-operation. The need of the hour was such. At least 1.5 crore people watched online. Next year, we will make up for all the lost fervour,” said Ashok Godse, trustee, Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust. Over 7,500 city police officials along with bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS), quick response team (QRT), riot control police (RCP) will be present on the streets of Pune. However, the proceedings might end much before the usual time this year, according to Shisve. “People who come for darshan will be stopped. If need be, we will make a temporary diversion for the roads that lead to major Ganpatis during their visarjan timings. Hopefully, tomorrow everything will wind up by 11pm-12am. Like every year, it will not go on until the next morning,” said Shisve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/online-darshan-and-7-500-police-officials-to-ensure-empty-streets-in-pune/story-wkeYL3CRzjviQqBTZLUNeM.html
01-09-2020||Pune||No Ganpati immersion procession today; PMC seals all ghats||For the first time in at least 100 years, Pune will not witness the much celebrated immersion procession on Tuesday, on the occasion of Anant Chaturdashi. To prevent residents from reaching the riverbeds for immersion of the Ganesh idols, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), has sealed all the ghats and some routes in the peth areas, with police expected to keep a strict watch to avoid crowding in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Most mandals, including the five “manache Ganpati” (most revered), have decided to immerse idols in make-shift tanks set up on the respective mandap premises. Started in 1893, the annual immersion procession for the Sarvajanik Ganeshostav, that lasts over 24 hours, passes through Laxmi road and attracts five lakh people to partake of the festive grandeur. This year though, PMC has arranged for mobile water tanks, idol immersion centres and Nirmalya (offerings) collection centres for people who will not be able to immerse idols at home. According to police estimates, the city witnesses 4,73,000 immersions in the Mula-Mutha rivers, or at public immersion spots, every year. Solid waste management department head Dyaneshwar Molak said, “Many elected members on their own have set up the idol donation centres. A total of 191 idol donation centres have been set up at various chowks and prominent places where citizens can donate the Ganesh idols.” PMC has also set up the nirmalya collection centres at 190 places and erected 191 mobile water tanks where citizens can do the immersion.“As there is no procession, there was no need to depute the staff to clean the roads like every year,” Molak said.Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “Against the background of Covid-19, citizens and Ganesh mandals helped a lot this year, co-operating with the municipal corporation by not carrying out the immersion. I am appealing to all citizens to either immerse the idols at home, only or donate the idol at the centres erected by PMC at prominent places.” Fire brigade department head Prashant Ranpise said, “As there is no procession, fire brigade department has not deputed manpower near the water bodies.” BOX 1No night shift? The Shreemant Dagdusheth Ganesh Trust’s executive president Hemant Rasne said, “It is the first time on the day of Ganesh immersion, the city would remain calm. Every year, people stay awake the whole night to see the immersion on Laxmi road, Kumthekar road, Kelkar road and Tilak road. People used to sit on roads to take the darshan of Dagdusheth Ganesh, which is one of the attractions of the festival. This year the Dagdusheth mandal will do the arati at the temple in the evening and later there will be no procession. The city will start functioning the next day; every year, the immersion procession is continued till the next afternoon.”BOX 2Ganesh immersion schedules of the manache Ganpati mandals All immersions in temples or at site mandaps itseld1) Kasba Ganesh - 11.30am2) Tambdi Jogeshwari - 12.15pm3) Guruji Talim – 1pm4) Tulshibaug Ganpati - 1.45pm5) Kesri Wada- 2.30pm6) Bhausaheb Rangari - 3.15pm7) Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganesh - 6.47pm8) Akhil Mandai Ganpati- 7pm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-ganpati-immersion-procession-today-pmc-seals-all-ghats/story-2nYF94hH9RJZjY00ti4A8K.html

Tagging chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Raina wrote: “What happened to my family in Punjab was beyond horrible. My uncle was slaughtered to death, my bua (paternal aunt) and both my cousins received severe injuries. Unfortunately, my cousin also passed away last night (Monday) after battling for life for days. My bua is still very critical and is on life support.” “Till date, we don’t know what exactly happened that night and who did this. I request @PunjabPoliceInd to look into this matter. We at least deserve to know who did this heinous act to them. Those criminals should not be spared to commit more crimes,” he posted. According to the police, three to four members of the notorious Kale Kachhewala gang had come with the intention to loot and attacked Ashok Kumar, a government contractor, and his family members at their house in Thariyal village near Madhopur of Pathankot. At the time of the attack on August 19 night, the family was sleeping on the terrace of their house. Ashok Kumar suffered head injuries and died the same night, the police said.

01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots case: High court grants bail to Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita||The Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to Pinjra Tod member Devangana Kalita in one of the cases filed against her for alleged provocative speech ahead of the February riots in Delhi, saying it is the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every individual is presumed to be innocent till found guilty. It said police have failed to produce any material that her alleged hate speech instigated women of a “particular community” or it led to the loss of a young man’s life and damage to property.Also read: ED gets suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain’s custody for 6 daysThe court cited the case diary produced in a sealed cover along with pen drive before it and added Kalita’s presence is seen at a peaceful agitation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under Constitution’s Article 19.Kalita was arrested along with another member of the group in May for their role in an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest, which led to violent clashes during the Delhi riots. The two were booked for rioting, unlawful assembly, and inflammatory speeches.“Admittedly, agitation was going on since long, print and electronic media was present throughout in addition to cameras of police department, but there is no such evidence which establishes that the alleged offence has taken place on the act done by the petitioner, except statements recorded under section 164 CrPC much belatedly, though, those witnesses were allegedly remain present at the spot throughout,” the court said.It added no “prejudice would be caused” to the police investigation by the grant of relief to Kalita, and she would be prevented from suffering further unnecessary harassment, humiliation, and unjustified detention. The court said “similarly placed persons” like Kalita have not been arrested. It added the continued custody of the petitioner would serve no purpose.Justice Suresh Kait granted the bail in lieu of Rs 25,000 bond and surety of the same amount while directing Kalita against influencing any witnesses or tampering with the evidence. He underlined personal liberty is the most important fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.Kalita has been arrested in four cases related to communal riots in north-east Delhi in February and has been charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for her alleged role in “hatching a conspiracy along with other accused persons”.The Delhi police have accused some anti-CAA protesters, who blocked a road and made inflammatory speeches, of planning the riots. The arrested anti-CAA protesters, who include students, activists, and local politicians, have denied the allegations and said the police have launched a witch-hunt against them. The violence claimed 53 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-case-high-court-grants-bail-to-pinjra-tod-activist-devangana-kalita/story-k26U7sLCS2HhFq4gOLOesO.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: CBI to question Rhea’s parents||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has summoned the parents of actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is at the centre of a controversy regarding the alleged death by suicide of her friend and actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Rhea’s parents left their residence in suburban Mumbai at around 10:30 am and reached the DRDO guest house in Santacruz (East) around 10:50 am. CBI has been investigating Rajput’s death based on a first information report (FIR) filed by the late actor’s father KK Singh. ED, which is also investigating a case of money laundering against Rhea and others in connection with Rajput’s death, will question Goa-based hotelier Gaurav Arya for the second successive day on Tuesday. Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: Maharashtra home minister says he got requests to probe Sandip Ssingh’s alleged drug linksArya reached the ED office in Mumbai at 11 am. Rajput was found hanging at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. The post-mortem report ruled out any foul play. After a two-week quiet, a political controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart.The jurisdictional turf war spilled into the legal arena as the Supreme Court was approached to decide if CBI could investigate the matter. The issue became deeply acrimonious and divisive at multiple levels — between the Rajput and Chakraborty families, between the actors’ respective sets of fans, between the governments of the two states in question, and between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally Shiv Sena — and left the entertainment industry split vertically.The case opened up a debate in and about the industry, devolving into a war of words and allegations between two camps largely made up of “insiders” (with generational links to Bollywood) and “outsiders” (first-generation actors and filmmakers). Chakraborty and her supporters alleged that the Bihar government was trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-cbi-to-question-rhea-s-parents/story-MIXnDfSjvyVWtwv8khzCuI.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab prisons see maximum human rights violation complaints in country||Punjab jails are the worst in the country when it comes to protecting human rights of prisoners, if the number of complaints filed by inmates is of any indication. According to the National Crime Records Bureau’s recently released report for 2019, the national and state human rights commissions received the highest number of complaints of cruelty and denial of lawful rights of inmates from Punjab in 2019. The state has 24 prisons where 24,174 inmates, including 8,172 convicts and 15,949 undertrials, are lodged against the capacity of 23,488 prisoners, it says. Nearly 20 percent of a total of 290 complaints filed by the inmates with the NHRC are from Punjab. Also, 180 such complaints were received by the Punjab State Human Rights Commission from prisoners, 38 percent of the total received by all state-level commissions across the country. In terms of pending complaints with the NHRC, the highest (59 of 101) were from Punjab. Of a total of 464 complaints pending with all state-level rights commissions, the maximum 103 were with the Punjab body. HAD SECOND HIGHESTNUMBER OF CLASHES The report highlighted that Punjab along with Madhya Pradesh witnessed the second-highest number of clashes or group clashes in the country after Delhi. While the two states recorded 25 incidents each, the national capital had 57 incidents. Interestingly, Punjab was the only state that reported an incident of firing in prison that year. Also, 49 prisoners and 12 jail staff were injured in clashes in Punjab jails, after Delhi where 92 inmates got injured. MOST UNNATURAL DEATHS OF INMATES AFTER UP The report reveals that 137 deaths, including 117 natural and 20 unnatural, occurred in the Punjab jails in 2019. The number of unnatural deaths of inmates was highest after Uttar Pradesh where 29 such incidents were reported. As many as 13 inmates committed suicides in the state’s prisons, again the second highest across the country after UP (20). Two prisoners each were murdered by fellow inmates in the jails of Punjab and Haryana, the highest figure for the prisons of all the states. The report underlines the fact that Punjab reported the highest number of deaths due to HIV the same year. The state reported 9 deaths due to HIV of a total of 41 such deaths across the country’s jails. The data also shows that Punjab has the highest number of inmates at 272 (21 convicts and 251 undertrials) in youth detention centres (borstal schools) across the country. In 2019, of a total of 26,390 persons released on parole, maximum 7,973 were from Punjab, followed by Madhya Pradesh (3,663). IT’S A FASHION TO FILE PLAINTS IN PUNJAB, SAYS ADGP JAILS Additional director general of police (ADGP jails) Praveen Kumar Sinha said it is a fashion in Punjab to file complaints. “Merely filing of complaints don’t establish the fact that there have been human rights violations of inmates in the prisons. Not even a single complaint did go unattended whether it was probed by judicial officers, senior jails officials or police,” said Sinha. On the deaths due to HIV, Sinha said the most victims were drug addicts who used syringes of each other for substance abuse and ended up infecting others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-prisons-see-maximum-human-rights-violation-complaints-in-country/story-3iZh4h0dcqjhANiXN8WgyJ.html

01-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sero survey: BMC explores tie-up with private labs to increase sample size||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities are exploring the possibility of a tie-up with private laboratories to collect blood samples from a large section of Mumbaikars to ascertain how many of them have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but are still unaware about it. The exercise will help the civic officials to figure out how many Mumbaikars have developed antibodies.The private laboratories may be given the task of testing each blood sample they collect from Covid-19 patients and the cost will be borne by BMC.However, private laboratories will conduct the antibody test after they obtain permission from Covid-19 patients. The BMC officials said the proposal has been sent to Maharashtra government for its approval.Daksha Shah, deputy executive officer, public health department, BMC, said, “The tie- up between the civic body and private laboratories for collection of blood samples to ascertain antibodies is at a proposal stage. We have sent our proposal to the state government.”The BMC has a tie-up with 15 private laboratories in Mumbai to conduct Covid-19 tests, using both real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method and rapid antigen detection (RAD) methodology.Besides, In a bid to ascertain antibodies level, the BMC has conducted the first phase of sero-surveillance survey, where 6,900 people were tested. The survey results showed that 57% of slum-dwellers developed antibodies, while the corresponding figure in non-slum areas was 16%.A second round of the survey is in progress for which around 6,300 samples are being collected.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Sero-surveillance survey of antibodies test will help in understanding exposure of virus among a large population. We can also identify potential plasma donors. Private laboratories are conducting these tests over a month, and the figures available for reference to understand the situation.”A sero-surveillance survey that collects blood samples helps identify individuals, who were afflicted with Covid-19 but have since recovered from their viral infection. The survey gives a sense about the spread of the contagion and the measures that can be taken to prevent the viral outbreak.Of the 8,376 samples collected across Mumbai by a private laboratory between July 3 and August 7, the results showed that 2,420, or 28.89%, were detected with Covid-19 antibodies.A high ratio of the antibodies was developed among the residents from Govandi (57%), Dharavi (54%), Worli (42%), Chembur Extension (48%) and Mazagaon (40%), which had emerged as Mumbai’s Covid-19 hotspots.The prevalence of Covid-19 antibodies was relatively lower in certain areas in suburbs and south Mumbai, varying between 20% and 40%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sero-survey-bmc-explores-tie-up-with-private-labs-to-increase-sample-size/story-KPNUNvXB9F66N3MjSnXJgP.html

01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Back to dreaming||As the worries for everyday struggles seem to recede for him, autorickshaw driver Raju has started to think again of a dream he had before the coronavirus shook his world. “My ambition is to have a small plot of land in Gurgaon, and build a house on it.”Indeed, life and its aspirations must go on, and Raju, 24, is back to riding his autorickshaw from 8am to 10pm. “I started driving again not long after the lifting of the (coronavirus-triggered) lockdown, but for some weeks I wouldn’t spend the whole day on the road,” he says, chatting on phone. Initially, Raju explains, he wouldn’t get many customers—“Most people were still scared to get out of their houses.” He thus didn’t see the point of staying out for too long, and would mostly remain at the one-room rented dwelling he shares with his wife and three little kids in Gurugram’s Gandhi Nagar.At this very moment, while talking, the masked Raju is driving a customer to Sector 6— but he rushes to assure that he is chatting through his mobile’s earphones, and that his hands are safely placed on the auto’s steering handle. “Now I get more customers... so I’m working the regular hours,” he says, his voice being one among a host of highway sounds, including the horn he is frequently blowing through the traffic.Feeling secured enough in reclaiming the old routines of his working life, the auto driver is freely talking of his long-time dream. He calculates that it would take him about ₹3 lakh to buy just the land. The realisation of having his own house is essential for him because “I have never had a true home. My parents died when I was very young… my chacha-chachi (uncle and aunt) are the ones who raised me.”Actually, some weeks ago, Raju even slipped out of the metropolis for a 10-day solo trip to his Dwas Pipra village in Katihar, Bihar, to visit the elderly couple: “I had to go check on chacha-chachi. I am what I am because of them.”But he is also a self-made man. Raju arrived in Gurugram years ago as a “baledar”, a labourer. “Buying an auto last year, on loan, raised me to a higher level, until all the gains were destroyed by the coronavirus... I still have to pay back my loan instalments for the auto.”Despite certain improvements in the income, things are not the same as in the pre-corona days. “Back then, I would be earning about ₹10,000 every month,” he says, adding that the figure has now been cut in half.And yet, daily living today is superior to what it was during the lockdown and the weeks that followed. “We were having only aloo or dal-chawal for food, but now we are also having hari subzi (green vegetables), that were difficult for us to afford in those days.”The normal life is back, he concludes, and his earnings shall consequently rise again. “My kids will eat better, they will continue with their school, and my wife and I will again start to save money so we can buy land, maybe somewhere just outside Gurgaon.”By now, he has already dropped the aforementioned customer and is waiting for another one. “I recently studied the rate of my earnings and the price of land these days, and have determined that if something like coronavirus doesn’t happen again, it will take me three years to have my dream of getting a house come true.”He now takes off his mask—there’s no other person in the auto—and flashes a smile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-back-to-dreaming/story-a5wDQt0JIJd5kcthLYJxbM.html

01-09-2020||Delhi||‘Dragon is alive’: HC tells Delhi govt to rework test||The Delhi High Court directed the Delhi government on Monday to rework its testing plan in order to allow the maximum number of people who are asymptomatic to undergo a Covid-19 test through swab-based lab tests (RT-PCR method), pushing for the wider use of a technique that is seen as more reliable. The court, while expressing dissatisfaction on the number of tests being conducted, said “the Covid-19 dragon has been tamed much less slain” and “is looming large in the city and needs to be tackled on priority”. The need to ramp up testing is particularly needed since more people are being allowed to move freely. “You (Delhi government) thought that you had slain the dragon (Covid-19). However, this dragon has several heads which is making life miserable for people. The dragon is alive and cases are rising up in the city every day,” the court said while expressing concern on the increasing number of cases in the city. “This court is therefore not satisfied with the number of testing actually being conducted on the ground by the Delhi government,” it said while hearing a plea filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra on the ramping up of tests in the city. A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, while asking the city government to come up with a new policy, also asked it to examine as to whether the necessity of obtaining a prescription from a private doctor for undergoing the RT-PCR should be made mandatory/optional or done away with. The court also directed the Delhi government to set up Covid-19 testing centres at inter-state bus terminals in the city within seven days for migrants who return to the city from different states. On August 19, the Delhi government had told the high court that it had already set up a testing centre at Anand Vihar ISBT.On Monday, the high court said it expects the Delhi government to come up with an advisory for persons who want to get themselves tested for Covid-19 through the RT-PCR method, as long as it does not adversely impact the testing of samples sent by the government to private laboratories or the timeline within which reports are to be submitted by labs to the government.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.However, Dr Nutan Mundeja, chief of the Delhi directorate general of health services under the city government, told the court it would re-strategise the plan for testing. Since early July, when Delhi increased its testing numbers, the city has been heavily reliant on antigen tests, which are done through swabs as well, but are on-the-spot at health centres and testing camps. Over the past week, at least seven of every 10 tests conducted in the city has been using the rapid antigen method. This proportion has been largely consistent throughout August. Daily tests in Delhi also appear to have hit a plateau. The seven-day average for daily tests in the city stands at 19,715 — off the peak of 21,660 for the week ending July 10. On Monday, the health bulletin said 14,389 tests were conducted in 24 hours. To be sure, the number of tests generally reduces on Sundays and holidays.After going through a comparative study of the sero survelliance reports, the court said that a significant portion of the population in Delhi remains asymptomatic and it is that population which would cause a silent spread of the disease, posing a serious challenge to the health system. The court sought to know from Dr Nivedita Gupta of the ICMR whether the strategy with respect to testing in Delhi can be changed. To this, Gupta said ICMR is only an advisory body and is going to come out with new guidelines. She, however, clarified, that its guidelines do not stop any state government in coming out with their own rules. Citing an example of Punjab, Gupta said the state government had done away with the need for a prescription to getting tests conducted. She said Maharashtra has also tweaked its (ICMR) rules according to its own needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dragon-is-alive-hc-tells-delhi-govt-to-rework-test/story-G70A7re136z7VchLtSHR1I.html

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has deputed a medical team at the centre for women to monitor the health of the patients who have been quarantined at the home. Their condition is reported to be stable.An official of the home said, “All those who have tested positive are asymptomatic and have been quarantined. NMMC is taking good care of everyone. There is nothing to worry.”The cases came to light after an NMMC antigen test camp was organised by former legislator Sandeep Naik through local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. Sources said that apart from the residents of the home, two nuns and some employees have also tested positive. Local BJP leader Sudarshan Jirge, who coordinated the camp, said, “On the directions of Sandeep Naik, we contacted the civic officials and organised an antigen camp, as we had learnt that some of the inmates were sick and needed medical attention.Following the tests of 149 inmates on Sunday, 82 were found positive. They have been quarantined at the centre itself.”Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “An NMMC medical team has been deputed on a 24-hour basis at the centre. Patients have been divided into three wards.

01-09-2020||City||2 Turkmenistan students, stranded in Mumbai amid lockdown, return home after Bombay high court intervention||Following the directions of the Bombay high court (HC), two Turkmenistan students who were stranded in India owing to the lockdown since February, were able to return to their country on Sunday. The students, who are studying in Pune, had approached the HC, as they were kept in a shelter home at Mumbai’s Kandivli area after being rescued from a hotel at Andheri in a raid against human trafficking. While the magistrate had allowed the students to go back to their home country in February, their departure was delayed owing to incomplete documentation and non-availability of flights due to the lockdown. After the students informed the court that there was a flight available for them, the court directed the authorities to expedite the procedure and allow them to return home. A single bench of justice CV Bhadang, while hearing the petition filed by the two foreign students, was informed by advocate Sujit Pathak that the women came to India to pursue the Bachelor of Arts course. While one of them enrolled in a Pune college in 2018, the other joined last year. The duo knew each other and resided in a rented room. In January, they received a call from a mutual friend who invited them to Mumbai. The two students met the friend in a hotel, but soon thereafter, the social service branch of Mumbai Police raided the hotel and rescued them both, along with an Indian woman. It was only when they were produced before the magistrate court did the authorities realise that the caller had tried to trap them into a prostitution racket. Thereafter the custody of the two students was handed over to two non-governmental organsations – Save the Child India and Rescue Foundation – which work to rehabilitate women rescued from prostitution rackets. The duo were kept in a shelter home at Kandivli. On February 10, after perusing the inquiry reports by the officers concerned, the magistrate passed an order allowing the repatriation of the two students to their home country. The students, however, challenged the order as they wanted to complete their education, but the order cast aspersions on their antecedents and restrained them from returning. After their appeal was rejected later the same month, the students decided to return to their country and booked tickets. However, as the exit formalities were not completed, they could not board the flight. Though one of their friends in Pune sought their custody, it was not permitted and hence the students had to continue staying in the shelter home. Pathak informed the court that due to the lockdown, the students were able to travel only in July, but their flight was cancelled. The stigma they faced and their stay at the shelter home was causing the students mental agony and hence, Pathak sought their repatriation at the earliest, as well as setting aside of the February 10 order. On August 28, after the court was informed that a flight was available for the students, the judge directed the authorities to ensure that their exit procedure from India was expedited. According to Pathak the students boarded a flight on the night of August 30 and had managed to leave after spending more than 200 days in the shelter home for no fault of theirs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-turkmenistan-students-stranded-in-mumbai-amid-lockdown-return-home-after-bombay-high-court-intervention/story-gCJQ34dDkSImTkUtM8pUgP.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai demand exorbitant fees amid lockdown, say parents; plan to approach Bombay high court over issue||Parents of students from 10-12 prominent schools in the city are planning to move the Bombay high court (HC), challenging the fee structures of these schools. The decision was announced on Monday at a press conference organised by Forum for Fairness in Education (FFE), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for parents. Jayant Jain, president, FFE, said private schools were not being “considerate” towards parents despite the current situation in which many have their lost jobs or are facing salary cuts. “Schools are charging exorbitant amounts as fees under various heads and have not given any concession to parents even at a time when classes are happening online. Charges like bus fees, laboratory fees etc. need not be taken now. In many cases, fees are not even approved by the parent-teacher associations. We are helping such parents in approaching the right authorities to make themselves heard,” said Jain. Parents said schools asked them to submit documents with respect to their income when they asked for certain concessions. “We are not asking schools to waive off the fees completely. But in some cases, they are asking us to pay thousands of rupees for unnecessary things. For instance, we have been asked to purchase a gadget (tablet) worth ₹50,000. When we questioned this, school asked us to prove that we cannot pay,” said a parent whose child studies at a south Mumbai school. A government resolution (GR) released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay HC on June 26 in response to a petition filed by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-in-mumbai-demand-exorbitant-fees-amid-lockdown-say-parents-plan-to-approach-bombay-high-court-over-issue/story-ebAVlJrfoqEegEYlI7JaPP.html

Ambedkar and his supporters staged a protest outside the temple on Monday, demanding the reopening of temples and other religious places in the state. He and 14 others also went inside the temple and declared it a “victory” of the agitation. Raut on Monday said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government , led by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, will gradually lift all the restrictions. He added that the government has spoken to all the stakeholders who run temples as well as the representatives of the Varkari community on the gradual reopening of the famous temple at Pandharpur. The Sena leader said that Ambedkar, who is the grandson of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, should not have violated the law and the measures put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. “Prakash Ambedkar is a patient leader, who has studied law and he’s also the descendant of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Such statements about going against the law, especially during a medical emergency, is like instigating people... The Covid-19 situation in the state is improving and Prakash Ambedkar should not create any sort of tension in the state,” Raut said, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai. He further said that the protest led by Ambedkar made a joke of social distancing as the crowd that had gathered at Pandharpur for the protest was pushing each other. “Social distancing, which is the most important step to break the Covid chain, had become a joke outside the temple today. Thousands of people gathered there. The transmission of Covid-19 can spread through this [gathering]. The chief minister has anticipated this and thus has not so far allowed the reopening of religious places. Even Prime Minister Modi is not in the mind set to completely lift the lockdown,” Raut added. He also expressed confidence and said Thackeray and the political opponents will collectively find a solution on the reopening of religious places in the state. But Raut also added that no leader should take an “anti-law” stance on the issue and must engage with the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-mp-says-prakash-ambedkar-s-protest-outside-maharashtra-s-vitthal-rukmai-temple-a-joke-on-social-distancing/story-K3H9YXpY5acf48b7OZjKFJ.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai bus contractor loses business during lockdown, now drives taxi to make ends meet||In 2015, bus contractor Yusuf Khan was earning approximately Rs4 lakh a month and his company, Khan Travels, had eight buses to its name. Since the lockdown, most of those buses have been seized by banks; Khan Travels has been effectively grounded, and Khan is making ends meet as a taxi driver. Born and raised in Dharavi, 44-year-old Khan has worked hard to climb up the ranks. As the son of a fruit seller, his childhood was marked by poverty. He left school after Class 8 and started working as an electrician. When he was in his 20s, Khan learnt how to drive and went to work in Saudi Arabia as a taxi driver. He stayed in Saudi Arabia for five years and then returned to Mumbai. With his hard-earned savings, he bought a small bus. In 2013, he set up Khan Travels. By 2015, he had invested in eight buses and was earning around Rs 4-5 lakh each month. When the lockdown was imposed, his earnings dwindled swiftly as schools were closed and transport was taken off roads. “Two school buses were left, after the rest were seized by the banks [Khan had bought the buses with the help of loans], and they are biting the dust in the bus stand. There was no income for several months after the lockdown and I did not see the situation improving,” said Khan, who is the sole breadwinner for his family and the father of two sons aged 13 and 17. In August, Khan started driving a black and yellow cab, which he has leased on rent. “I manage to earn Rs 20, 000 a month as a taxi driver but it is not enough to make ends meet,” he said. The effects of the lockdown were harder to bear because Khan had been hit hard by demonetisation in November 2016. Khan’s monthly income reduced from Rs 4-5 lakh to between Rs 50,000 and 60,000 and subsequently, he had to scale back his operations. He had been hoping to expand by adding more school buses to Khan Travels, but the lockdown put an end to those plans. Since March, Khan could only watch was his carefully-built business collapsed and his savings were depleted. Despite the setbacks, Khan remains determined and optimistic. “I have no regret that things did not turn out as planned and I have no shame to work as a taxi driver again. The money I earn is through sheer hard work. Financially, I have seen some very difficult phases in life and if I have managed to overcome those, I shall overcome this as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bus-contractor-loses-business-during-lockdown-now-drives-taxi-to-make-ends-meet/story-c66coaIKrXym0NcvXRjQSO.html

Two personnel also succumbed to the virus, following which the death toll in the force surged to 156, which also includes 15 officers. Of the 15,294 personnel who were infected, 12,306 have recovered. One of the personnel, who died in the past 24 hours, 46-year-old head constable Santosh Zende, was attached to the Chakan traffic division. This is the first death in the newly-constituted Pimpri-Chinchwad commissionerate. “He complained of sore throat and underwent an antigen test on August 24 and was tested positive for Covid-19. Since August 25, he was undergoing treatment at the Birla Hospital (in Pimpri-Chinchwad). As he suffered from high blood pressure, his condition got worse and he passed away on Sunday,” said senior inspector Vitthal Kubade from the commissionerate. Kubade said that Zende is survived by his mother, wife, an 18-year-old daughter who is pursuing the MBA course and a 13-year-old daughter. “He was a sincere, honest and disciplined policeman. All his colleagues are in a shock. He was the sole wage earner in his family.” According to the commissionerate’s Covid officer, assistant inspector Anil Lohar, of the 322 cases of Covid-19 recorded among the Pimpri-Chinchwad police personnel, only 68 are active cases, while the others have recovered. Meanwhile, 53-year-old assistant sub-inspector attached to the Kulgaon police station of Thane Rural police was the second personnel who died of Covid-19 on Sunday. Shriram Sonawane was undergoing treatment for the virus for over a month at Thane’s Vedanta Hospital. “He developed high fever first and was admitted to the hospital. During treatment, he also developed pneumonia and was given oxygen support for over a month. Sonawane also suffered from high blood pressure.

01-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai receives highest August rain since 1959||Monday’s showers brought the August rain tally to 1,247.7mm, making it the highest in August since 1959. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this month’s rain was the second highest all-time August rainfall, after 1,254mm recorded in 1958, which means it was just 6.3mm short of crossing the all-time August record. In August 1983, Mumbai had recorded 1,243.8mm rain. With 7.6mm rain between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Monday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 1,247.7mm rain from August 1 to August 31 8.30pm. South Mumbai recorded its second highest August rainfall for the period of 1959-2020, as the Colaba weather station recorded 1,132.9mm rain between August 1 and 8.30pm on August 31. IMD data shows the highest-ever rainfall recorded in Colaba was 1,187.6mm in August 1983. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said, “As per our accurate forecast, entire Maharashtra, especially north Konkan, including Mumbai, received above-normal rain during July and August, breaking rain records during both the months.” Mohapatra said during August, the formation of five low-pressure weather systems – a region of lower or reduced atmospheric pressure than normal causing weather disturbances including increased precipitation and cloud formation – in the Bay of Bengal led to 26.6% excess rain or the highest monthly rain pan-India since 1973. “For Mumbai, recurring occurrence of a mid-tropospheric circulation (separate system) over south Gujarat and north Konkan coast simultaneously led to an active monsoon trough and increased moisture incursions from the Arabian Sea, leading to moderate to heavy rain throughout most of the month,” he said. This month, the city witnessed one extremely heavy rain day (August 3-4), one very heavy rain day (August 5-6 when south Mumbai received 331.8 mm over 24 hours), two heavy rain days and 12 moderate rain days. Remaining were light showers, with no rain on only two days of the month (August 2 and 13). Mumbai received 50% of its August average rain (585.2mm) in just the first four days, with 293mm rain. Of this, 271mm was recorded between August 3 and August 4. The monthly mean rain mark was crossed on August 9, and thereafter light to moderate showers continued with a few intense spells up to August 21. Between August 29 and 31, the city witnessed moderate to heavy rain spells that allowed the 1983 monthly rain record to be broken. Independent meteorologists said above-normal August performance was indicated by lake levels (supplying water to Mumbai). With just 37.2% of the required quantum on August 5, lake levels rose to 60% by August 13, further 85% by August 19, and currently stands at 96.1%. IMD said September is likely to have rain showers, but not as strong as July and August. Independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom Akshay Deoras said below-average rainfall activity is possible during the first fortnight of September. “The first fortnight is looking unusually dry, unlike July and August where entire monthly rainfall occurred in the first few days only,” he said. IMD has predicted light to moderate rain from September 1 to 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-receives-highest-august-rain-since-1959/story-6dASU2D75VmZnvWonEUfPK.html

This order will remain effective till November 30. In April, the state government had mandated that private hospitals would have to allocate 20% beds for Covid-19 patients. Out of these, 80% beds are regulated by the civic body. As the order lapsed in August, BMC officials held a meeting with 12 representatives of private hospitals on August 27. However, private hospitals have raised their concerns over the move. They said another extension of the rule will cause them economic losses. Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician with Bombay Hospital, said, “Several private hospitals are facing losses owing to the price capping rule.

01-09-2020||Chandigarh||British Sikh soldier’s promotion makes waves on social media||A British Sikh soldier’s promotion within the UK Army ranks has become a social media sensation after the news posted by his proud wife attracted thousands of messages and comments. Corporal Chamandeep Singh, a Punjab-born soldier in the Royal Logistic Corps (RLC) of the British Army, attended a military school in India for 12 years. During this period, he read about another Indian soldier, Havildar Major Rajinder Singh Dhatt, and his heroic involvement in the Burma campaign of World War II. The story of this Sikh war veteran, along with Singh’s own father having served in the Indian Army, inspired him to move to the UK and join the British Army. He is now a Twitter sensation after his wife, Ceese Kaur Seera, posted the news of his promotion earlier this month, which attracted over 7,300 likes and 500 retweets and comments. “The person who has supported me throughout my journey is my wife, Ceese,” said Cpl Singh, who has been amazed by the worldwide response, including from India. “I just couldn’t believe how many people from all around the world shared and commented on her tweet; it made me feel so proud to be a Sikh soldier and serve this country,” he said. His wife herself works in a challenging role, as a Forensic Science Investigations Officer, and is also the National Lead for the National Sikh Police Association. “We support each other by having a mutual understanding that is built on teamwork and trust. I am always incredibly proud of my husband’s achievements and getting promoted is a huge deal to any soldier, but as a Sikh, it’s so wonderful for our community to see soldiers going up the ranks and achieving so much,” said Ceese Kaur Seera. “I wanted to share this incredible news with my friends through social media; I didn’t think for a second the tweet would do as well as it did – the number of messages we had was amazing,” she said. Her soldier husband was posted to 22 Signals Regiment in October 2017 where he now works as part of the Unit Spares Account providing first-line equipment support to the Light Aid Detachment, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement marking his promotion. Singh is part of 150 Sikhs serving in Britain’s Regular Army, amid soldiers famed for their fierce fighting ability, bravery and loyalty, the MoD said. “I have always been supported throughout my career in the Army, particularly by Staff Sergeant Rogers and Sergeant Adeboga from 22 Signals Regiment. These individuals, in particular, have shown me a huge amount of support, I cannot thank them enough; they are true examples of excellent Army leadership and mentoring,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/british-sikh-soldier-s-promotion-makes-waves-on-social-media/story-EvA4DzauHQMGO9uhorjQ9J.html
01-09-2020||City||Unlock 3.0: Mohali, Panchkula witness major surge in cases, deaths||The Unlock 3.0 procedure that began on August 1 in Mohali witnessed 77% of all positive cases so far and 83% of all casualties.Of the total 3,770 cases reported in the last five months, 2,920 were recorded in August alone, while 65 people out of a total 80 lost their lives.Even the recovery rate in the district saw a decline from 72% in July to 55% in August. According to cumulative test results, a total of 27,076 samples were tested, of which 25,676 returned negative at the rate of 94.85%.The rate of active cases on August 1 was 39.26%, a 5% from 26% recorded on July 1. In the past 60 days, active cases have risen by 20%.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the spur in cases was due to extensive contact tracing and most persons, who became spreaders, had a domestic travel history. “More than 90% positive cases are those who came in contact with pilgrims from Hazoor Sahib, overseas NRIs and residents stranded in other states,” he said.On the spike in deaths, Dayalan said most of them were comorbid patients suffering from diabetes and hypertension. “We have directed all private hospitals to increase their tertiary Covid-care bed capacity to cope with the surge in cases. Keeping in view the deaths of comorbid patients, more hospitals will be equipped with type-III facilities to give primal treatment apart from Covid-19,” he added.‘EXPECT 100 CASES DAILY IN THE NEXT 3 WEEKS’ With 75% of all Covid-19 cases in the district being reported in August alone, experts are expecting a similar pace in the next three weeks as well.Total 1,669 persons tested positive within August out of total 2,230 cases since March. Only 561 cases were reported till July 31. Meanwhile, 18 deaths (1.07% fatality rate) were reported this month as compared to just two till July 31 (0.35% fatality rate).Till July 31, 19,370 samples had been taken and by August 31, 33,001 samples were being tested.Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said: “With Unlock 3.0, people started travelling, training began at ITBP, government offices and public transport resumed service. For nearly a fortnight now, people are least bothered about social distancing or wearing masks. All this led to a sudden surge of cases in August.”“As we are doing parallel testing, house-to-house surveys and picking people who are symptomatic, we expect the same pace of cases (over 100 per day) in the next three weeks and after that we can expect regular 50-60 cases per day,” she added.“However, it’s too early to predict anything and we have to hold on. The focus is on minimising deaths and managing the situation in the best possible way,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-3-0-mohali-panchkula-witness-major-surge-in-cases-deaths/story-00fZ3oYd9bTtSUZYXuWqhO.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||JEE, NEET aspirants in Mumbai Metropolitan Region allowed to travel by local trains to reach exam centres||Students who will appear for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) this month will be allowed to travel by local trains.

On Monday night, the Central Railway issued a statement on the permission for train travel granted to JEE, NEET aspirants. “Candidates who are appearing for JEET and NEET, that will be conducted in September are permitted to travel by special suburban services of the Mumbai suburban network of Central and Western Railways. Except for essential services staff and aspirants and their companions, others are requested not to rush to the stations. It is also requested that travellers follow medical and social protocols as mandated for Covid-19,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jee-neet-aspirants-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-allowed-to-travel-by-local-trains-to-reach-exam-centres/story-SBcOUzZOtiVuoO6xUwrWSL.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||73% of all Covid-19 deaths in Chandigarh reported in August alone||August has proven to be the worst month so far for Chandigarh where the pandemic is concerned with 3,300 new positive cases and 41 new deaths being reported.This means that 75% of the total cases were reported in August alone while more than 73% deaths reported so far were also registered in this month.At 5.3%, the average seven-day growth rate of cases is the highest in the country, while the number of active cases has increased five times between July 31 and August 31. A majority of the positive patients, however, opted for home isolation.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has directed doctors to focus on symptomatic patients and regularly monitor those in home isolation. An official spokesperson said, “They should be brought to the hospital in case there is deterioration or aggravation of their medical condition. The control room must check their status every day over the phone and the ambulance should be ready to shift them to the hospital. Such a facility should be available round-the-clock.”SEPTEMBER CRUCIAL MONTHExperts say September is going to be a crucial period, and tracking and testing should be ramped up.Director of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Dr Jagat Ram, said the cases were expected to grow in the month of September as well. “This month is going to be crucial for the pandemic. The cases may start decreasing only by the end of this month. Till then, extra precautions need to be taken; not adhering to safety precautions could be more harmful,” he said.Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER, said for every positive case, a minimum of 15 contacts needed to be traced and tested to control the pandemic. “If 100 persons test positive, 1,500 of their contacts need to be identified and tested. This chain needs to grow and if enough contacts are identified and tested, you can expect that the cases will start to decrease in the next one to two weeks,” he said.INCREASING POSITIVITY RATE A GRIM FACTORIn August, the UT recorded an increase in the positivity rate as well. For every 100 people tested in this month, 20 returned positive. This ratio was only 7 positive cases per 100 people tested till July 31. The UT conducted 16,138 tests in August against 14,239 tests conducted from March till July 31.“This calls for more aggressive testing and tracing. On average 15 contacts need to be identified and tested. High-risk groups with underlying diseases need to be taken special care of. Chandigarh being a small city can actually take the lead in such initiatives. People in certain professions who make direct contact with a large number of people should also be regularly tested. They can be asymptomatic carriers,” added Dr Rajesh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/73-of-all-covid-19-deaths-in-chandigarh-reported-in-august-alone/story-m192d1MSRBocMkJtb7hMmO.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Students in Maharashtra can appear for final-year exams from home||The Maharashtra government will allow students to appear for their final year examinations from their homes, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. These exams for professional and non-professional courses are likely to start in early October and the state may seek an extension up to November 10 from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to complete the examination process. A final decision is expected in the next two to three days. The state’s higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said on Monday, “Majority of the vice chancellors have suggested seeking one month’s time [up to October 31] from UGC to complete the examination process. A few also suggested an extension up to November 10. The state government has requested the committee ensure students won’t have to step out of homes to appear for examinations considering the pandemic. A consensus among vice chancellors has been reached on the issue, following which a decision has also been taken,” Samant said. Following a Supreme Court (SC) order, the state had formed a committee of vice chancellors to suggest measures to safely complete the examinations process. A committee of vice-chancellors from various universities had met on Sunday to consider the best options for final year exams. It is expected to submit its report on Wednesday to the higher and technical education department. The report will later be discussed before the state disaster management authority, which is headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, for final approval. “The committee of vice chancellors will submit their report on September 2 which will be discussed in the meeting of state disaster management authority where a final decision will be taken,” said Samant, after meeting the vice-chancellors. Samant said the vice chancellors have sought a day’s time to finalise modalities and guidelines for conducting examinations. “The committee of vice chancellors will submit their report on September 2, which will be discussed in the meeting of state disaster management authority where a final decision will be taken,” said Samant, after meeting with the vice-chancellors. Last week, SC had ruled out students being promoted without writing final year examinations and also upheld a July 6 directive of UGC to hold exams by September 30. However, SC gave states the liberty to approach UGC to postpone the deadline and hold examinations after September 30, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is likely that examinations can be conducted in the first week of October and will be of fewer marks than the regular ones so that students won’t have to go through lot of stress. They will also get September for studies,” Samant said, adding that organising examinations during Covid-19 crisis was challenging. “We are also trying to figure out how to accommodate students who are not comfortable with online examinations,” he said. Prajakt Tanpure, minister of state for higher and technical education, said that there are multiple options that allow students to take the exams from their homes. “The state has options such as open book exams that allow students to refer to books to answer the question; multiple choice question (MCQ); optical mark recognition (OMR); and assignment-based exams, through which students can appear for examinations from home,” Tanpure said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-in-maharashtra-can-appear-for-final-year-exams-from-home/story-Q8Yffu39ZNfrWyJi7a6HnI.html

01-09-2020||City||Maharashtra government allows inter-district travel, permits more staff in office||Almost five months after imposing the lockdown, the state government has now allowed inter-district travel, increased the workforce in government-private offices, done away with e-passes required for travel and allowed hotels and lodges to operate at their full strength. The relaxations will come into effect from September 2, a day after the conclusion of the ongoing Ganesh festival. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar issued the notification on Monday, extending the ongoing lockdown till September 30, while lifting a few restrictions. Although the Central government has restricted the lockdown only to containment zones, the Maharashtra government has continued the curbs in 19 municipal corporation-governed urban areas. Contrary to the Central diktat, the state government continued a ban on operations of Metro services in Mumbai. The state government has not allowed religious places to open, despite the pressing demand by various political parties and religious organisations. The state has also not allowed gymnasiums to open, although chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said two days ago that the government was positive about allowing them to operate. Eight days after the Central government’s diktat of doing away with e-passes required for inter-district travel, the state has announced lifting curbs on inter-district travel, doing away with passes or permission. Private passenger buses, mini buses, too, have been allowed to operate. The restrictions on inter-state travel, however, continue. While increasing the attendance in government offices, all officers in Class A and B category have been asked to attend the office daily. The attendance of the employees in category C and D has been increased to 50% or minimum 50 employees in areas, excluding the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region. In these areas, the category C and D employees will attend the offices at 30% of their strength or 30 employees, whichever is more. “Private offices can now operate at 30% of their strength (or 30 employees, whichever is more) from existing permitted strength of 10% or minimum 10 employees,” the notification states. After allowing hotels, lodges, guest houses to operate at a third of their capacity from July 8, they have now been given permission to operate at their full strength. “We have continued with certain restrictions outside containment zones, under the powers conferred upon states. States can impose stricter norms, but cannot dilute the central restrictions. There could be more relaxations in a phased manner in the future. We have not allowed inter-state travel, although inter-district movement has now been allowed,” said chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. Schools, colleges, educational institutions, theatres, swimming pools, bars will remain closed till September 30, the notification has stated. Metro rail too will remain shut at least for one more month. The restrictions on social, political, cultural gatherings, too, continue, the notification has stated. “From operations of the gymnasium to opening of the religious places are on the cards. Even the Centre has given relaxations in a phased manner and some of them come into effect from September 21. We have ample time to think over more relaxations till then,” said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-allows-inter-district-travel-permits-more-staff-in-office/story-2hhndZ1EkewPI6pg3uPgiO.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court directs Maharashtra govt to respond to Parsis’ plea to pray at Tower of Silence||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state government to hear a plea by the representatives of the Bombay Parsi Panchayat (BPP) who sought permission to hold a prayer meeting for its members at the Dongarwadi Tower of Silence at Kemps Corner.After the state submitted that it could only allow one such prayer meeting across Maharashtra for the entire community, the court directed the panchayat to consider the same, and meet Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary home (special) and Kishor Raje Nimbalkar, secretary, disaster management department at Mantralaya on Monday evening. The court also directed the state to submit the decision of the two officers by Wednesday. A division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing the petition filed by Viraf Mehta, a trustee of BPP was informed by advocate Prakash Shah that the panchayat representing its Mumbai members had approached the court seeking permission to hold special prayers for the departed souls at the Dongerwadi Tower of Silence at Kemps Corner.Shah submitted that the premise was spread over 55 acres and has five separate pavilions where members of the community wanted to come and pray for the souls of their departed loved ones on Farvardin Roj on September 3. Shah submitted that the panchayat would ensure that all social distancing norms would be followed, hence the state should be directed to grant permission for allowing the around 500 members of the community to conduct prayers between 7.30am and 4.30pm on the day. However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni objected to the petition and said that if the petition was only meant for one Tower of Silence then the state was opposed to it. He, however, added that if the petition was representative of all Towers of Silence across Maharashtra, the state was willing to consider the application in the same way as it had considered the applications of the Jain and Muslim community for Paryushan and Moharram respectively.Though Shah submitted that the BPP was only seeking permission for Doongerwadi at Kemps Corner, the court directed the officials at Mantralaya to give the representatives of BPP a hearing on Monday evening and submit its report to the court on Wednesday when the petition would be decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-directs-state-to-respond-to-parsi-community-s-plea-to-pray-at-tower-of-silence/story-juWus2Abxx3WAWRzFT2KkL.html

01-09-2020||Mumbai||Equal street in Mumbai: BKC roads to open up for bicycles soon||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will soon introduce the ‘equal streets’ concept in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). This would mean no vehicular entry in BKC for a day, enabling citizens to ride their bikes or undertake other leisure activities. MMRDA is planning to start the initiative from October 2. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA made this announcement at the launch of a public bike-sharing initiative at BKC on Monday. “It will be like the equal streets initiative of Bandra or the one in Bengaluru where the roads are free for citizens for a day. We are planning to do it every Sunday,” said Rajeev, adding that except the main BKC avenue, all roads will be free. The initiative in Bandra was started by a group of citizen associations, organising various leisure activities for all age groups. BKC is Mumbai’s topmost commercial hub, where there is not much activity on weekends. MMRDA is also planning to improve all the footpaths in the complex and make it cycle-friendly. The work will start after monsoon, Rajeev said. On Monday, the authority launched Yulu bikes, a public electric bike-sharing facility from the Raheja Towers in BKC. Around 100 e-bikes will be available at nine different locations (including the Bandra and Kurla stations) for commuters. “Around three lakh people alight at the Bandra and Kurla stations every day, of which 75% come to BKC via autos. While autos have their own advantage, these bikes will also work to commuters’ advantage with its pricing, ease of commute and parking,” Rajeev added. Commuters can download the Yulu app from the play store and register. Once you find a Yulu zone, you can unlock the bike for ₹5, post which you will be charged Rs 1.5 for every minute. Commuters will have to pay Rs 199 as a deposit and can also avail the super saver packs. The bikes will also be sanitised after every ride, a spokesperson from Yulu said. Madhav Pai, director, World Resources Institute (WRI) said, “Mumbai needs last-mile connectivity options and these initiatives are ideal for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/equal-street-in-mumbai-bkc-roads-to-open-up-for-bicycles-soon/story-57FzjentRKCHkWdttTBz4M.html

Residents alleged that the authorities were waiting for a mishap to happen and that there was no supervision on the part of the civic body or the concerned contractor.Mukesh Garg, MC superintending engineer, said though they had cleared the water, they will check again and direct the contractor to depute somebody so that children don’t jump into the water.Former GMADA executive engineer NS Kalsi said, “It is complete negligence on the part of the civic body. Commuters are facing a lot of problems due to road blockage. In case any accident happens, the MC will be held responsible since they have failed to lend an eye to the issue.”The ₹22-crore project, inaugurated on March 2 by health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, will mitigate the sewerage problems of Phases 1 to 11. The project is being set up near NIPER in Phase 10 under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme.

How will be the accountability fixed? If we take into account cases investigated in the last few years… Did any big wheel get sentenced?” Khemka tweeted.“Haathi ke daant dikhane ke kuch aur khane ke kuch aur hote hain (The visible teeth (tusks) and those used by an elephant to eat are not the same,” the officer wrote on the micro-blogging site, hinting at the possible double standard in the agency’s working.Responding to a follower who asked whether the Supreme Court ruling on punishing cops when accused get let off in criminal cases was relevant, Khemka said, “Has any cop ever been punished when an accused gets acquitted. Bofors? 2G Spectrum? Or any other.”To another follower, he wrote: “The question is who will appoint an honest and effective officer. Everybody liked a flexible spine.” In reply to a question about an alternate solution, the officer asked: “What is the solution to a weak character?”While the IAS officer refused to comment on the intent behind his tweet, it clearly showed his disillusionment with the functioning of the central agency tasked with probes involving politicians, bureaucrats and high-profile individuals.Khemka, who has been in a whistle-blower in several major scams, is also learnt to be disappointed with the way the CBI has probed cases involving former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, including the Manesar land release case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ias-officer-khemka-trains-guns-at-cbi-seeks-accountability/story-SBKvf6Zr2HRJcnmxn3zBFJ.html

Locals rushed her to the nearby hospital where she was declared dead.The garage was closed since March due to the lockdown. “We have sent the body for post-mortem and have registered a case of accidental death,” said Warade. “We have booked Vipin Raut, the owner of the garage for negligence. If the pit would have been covered or a guard was deployed, this accident would have been averted,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-year-old-drowns-in-open-car-washing-pit-in-virar/story-fKXZl6Owtt0WTpru5Et4UL.html

01-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: CBI continues to question Rhea Chakraborty; ED quizzes Goa hotelier||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continued to question actor Rhea Chakraborty for the fourth consecutive day on Monday in their probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Rhea is at the centre of a controversy following the alleged death by suicide of Rajput, 34, on June 14. Rhea left her home at 10:30am on Monday to appear before CBI officials at the DRDO guesthouse in Santacruz (East) and was questioned for nine-and-a-half hours. The agency also quizzed Rhea’s brother Showik, Rajput’s cook Neeraj Singh, househelp Keshav Bachner, flatmate and creative manager Siddharth Pithani, and his former business manager Shruti Modi. CBI officials, on condition of anonymity, said Rhea and the others were questioned about various financial transactions. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is conducting a parallel probe into money laundering allegations that have emerged in the case, questioned Goa-based hotelier Gaurav Arya for around nine hours on Monday. Arya reached the ED office in Mumbai at 10:45am, after he was summoned for questioning. Arya runs Hotel Tamarind and Café Cotinga in Goa.ED officials had last week visited Hotel Tamarind at Anjuna, a coastal village in north Goa, but found the property to be shut. They have stuck a notice on the door of the hotel, which according to officials has been shut since the lockdown restrictions were enforced in March to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Arya has also been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and is being investigated by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The NCB had last Wednesday registered a first information report (FIR) against Rhea, Showik, talent manager Jaya Saha, Modi and Arya under sections 20, 22, 27 and 29 of the NDPS Act.Modi’s advocate Ashok Sarogi said, “Rajput was a very ambitious person, and was looking for various kinds of investments. He had called a meeting of his chartered accountant (CA), advocate and others on how he could utilise his money, and how he could save money for his future. My client has no role to play with respect to the drugs angle that has come up in the case. But it is certain that Rajput used to do drugs. There are WhatsApp chats in their closed group in which people were chatting about it, Sushant was also in the group. Modi had just joined work, around mid-July last year. They used to chat in the group and she was asked to forward the message to another person and it seems that it was regarding drugs, and Modi was not aware. But subsequently, when she got to know by end-July, she clearly told Rajput that she was not here for all these things, and had offered to quit her job.” “Sushant told her that she will not be part of the WhatsApp group, and after that she did not get any messages related to drugs and was not part of it,” said Sarogi. “She quit the job after she fractured her leg in February. As of now, NCB has not called her for inquiry. ED has already questioned her.”The NCB action came after the ED wrote to the agency, asking it to probe if drugs were supplied to Rajput and Rhea, who has been questioned multiple times by the latter.Arya’s name cropped in Rhea’s WhatsApp conversations related to drugs. ED officials, however, have so far refused to divulge details of whether there were any financial transactions between Arya and Rajput, or Chakraborty or others named in the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) registered by the central agency.Rajput was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. After a two-week quiet, a controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterparts. The probe was handed over to CBI by the Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of the Bihar Police’s first information report (FIR) filed on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who has accused actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money.Chakraborty, who has been questioned multiple times by the agencies, has denied all allegations levelled against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-cbi-continues-to-question-rhea-chakraborty-ed-quizzes-goa-hotelier/story-9lPkCqKaEdQJ5x0TifrsSO.html
01-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Congress demands probe against filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh||Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Monday met state home minister Anil Deshmukh and demanded a thorough probe into filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh’s alleged links with the drug cartel in Bollywood and his relationship with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sawant said he has also handed over a few documents as proof and the minister has assured him to pass on the complaint to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is currently investigating actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.BJP, however, rubbished the allegations and termed them a “publicity stunt”. When HT called Ssingh for a comment, his phone was switched off, and he had not responded to messages till the time of going to press. Ssingh was one of first few people to reach the residence of Rajput after the news of his death emerged on June 14. Sawant, in his three-page letter to Deshmukh, has pressed for the need to probe Ssingh in various cases. “The producer of a biopic on PM Narendra Modi was the only filmmaker to sign a MoU worth Rs177 crore at the Vibrant Gujarat summit in January 2019, just days ahead of the release of the biopic. Did Gujarat government favour Ssingh’s Legend Global Studio by signing a MoU with him just because he was the producer of the biopic? The MoU was signed despite the fact that the company had suffered financial losses of Rs66 lakh in 2017 and Rs4 lakh in 2019. On what basis did Gujarat government sign a MoU worth Rs177 crore with such a loss making company,” said Sawant.Sawant also alleged that Ssingh had called state BJP office 53 times from September 1, 2019, to December 23, 2019 during the Maharashtra Assembly elections. “In the backdrop of the allegations of Ssingh’s direct involvement in the drug cartel in Bollywood, the questions being raised are who in BJP was in touch with Ssingh and who is shielding the producer… The producer is learnt to have briefed a senior BJP leader about the death case,” Sawant alleged. When asked about the evidence he has about Ssingh, Sawant said a probe will “bring out the truth”. “I have submitted the balance sheet of Ssingh’s company, the photographs of him signing a MoU and the records of a serious case registered against him in Mauritius. We have demanded a probe so that the truth comes out,” he said.BJP rubbished the allegations, saying it was just a publicity stunt by the Congress. “Sawant has started levelling allegations the moment Rajput death case went to the CBI. If there was serious proof against Ssingh in the case, why did the state police not investigate it when the probe was with them for more than two months? Was the state police under political pressure to not probe certain angles? Instead of levelling allegations, Congress should give firm evidence to the investigating agency helping it to unearth the truth,” said Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-congress-demands-probe-against-filmmaker-sandeep-ssingh/story-nI4bNwXoYatFfnQsmC7HNL.html

The young recipient, a Class-8 student at a private school in Sector 19, was greeted with flowers and best wishes and a painting on organ donation symbolising that the “circle of life should not break”, as he and his mother exited the hospital and got into the home-bound ambulances. Madhu, the boy’s mother, said, “We are indebted to the PGIMER team for their care, concern and compassion. There were many phases of hopelessness and despair when we thought we have lost the battle. But, the PGIMER team with their constant medical and psychological support, helped us sail through and come out victorious in both challenges; first the heart transplant and then, Covid-19.”Complimenting the young boy on his successful recovery, PGIMER director Jagat Ram said, “I am elated that the untiring efforts of the PGIMER team paid off and the young heart recipient is on his way home. It is a moment of triumph and jubilation not only for him and his family, but for the entire medical team as his recovery from Covid-19 was a tremendous challenge due to his recent heart transplant.”GD Puri, dean (academics), PGIMER, appreciated the family for their cooperation and trust in the hospital team. He urged them to take forward the message of observing safety precautions including wearing masks, hand washing and social distancing. “This will be the biggest service to the medical fraternity, who are risking their own lives to save the lives of others,” he said.The cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTVS) team, headed by Shyam K Singh, conducted the transplant surgery on July 31. The donor’s heart was in good condition.“The only hick-up we faced was the recipient contracting Covid positive, but he was taken good care of and recovered well,“ doctors saidAjay Bahl, department of cardiology, PGIMER, who has been involved in the case since the beginning, said, “A week after the transplant, while still in recovery here in PGIMER, the boy developed fever and was found to be Covid positive. Prior to the transplant, he had tested negative. But thanks to the multi-disciplinary teams that managed him, he has made full recovery and been discharged exactly a month after the transplant.”Vipin Koushal, additional medical superintendent and in-charge, Covid hospital, and Ajay Bahl from department of cardiology, were present at the Class-8 student’s sending-off ceremony along with other team members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/13-year-old-heart-recipient-recovers-from-covid-19-in-chandigarh/story-OkIyWchXGyX3bGYocAlTKL.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana asks colleges to make UG admission process more inclusive for students with disabilities||In an initiative aimed at making the admission process more accessible for students with physical disabilities, the state higher education department has asked colleges across Haryana to make arrangements for having a more “inclusive” process for the upcoming undergraduate (UG) admission process.In a directive shared with college principals of government colleges across the state on Tuesday, the department said it wants bring more PWD (persons with disabilities) students into institutions across the state under its ‘Inclusive Admissions’ campaign.As part of the campaign, a phone number for missed call registrations will be procured by the department. Students who call on the number will receive assistance from the ‘Inclusive Admissions’ teams in during the online admission process.“To aid our PWD students in filling online admission forms, the department seeks to launch an Inclusive Admission Campaign. Under the campaign, a number for registering missed calls will be procured and PWD students will be encouraged to give a missed call on the said number to get their admission forms filled,” Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, wrote to college principals.The state education department said that keeping in mind the goals of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which was approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, Haryana government wanted to incorporate an element of inclusivity at the entry-level by assisting prospective candidates with disabilities at the time of admissions.Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said the government was introducing the element of inclusivity to the admission process for physically disabled students, who face inconveniences at the time of admission. She said the college had already deputed students from the college who would be volunteering during the entire admission process. “The department is focusing on an inclusive admission process this time. Due to the pandemic, it becomes even more imperative that disabled students receive assistance. Our student volunteers will be involved at every stage of the admission process. They will act like virtual friends who’ll ensure that disabled candidates are able to complete the admission process without any hassles,” said Khullar.Student volunteers will be trained virtually and will be provided access to laptops and other devices required for completing the online process, said Khullar.The state education department is, however, yet to release the schedule for online admissions to government colleges across the state. Due to the pandemic, the admission process has been delayed by months this year.Vijay Adlakha, principal, Government Girls College, Sector 14, said the missed call number for admission would be made operational once the admission portal opens for registration and prior to that, colleges had been asked to prepare a team of volunteers who would take part in the initiative.“Applicants with any kind of disability who require assistance with the admission process can call on the helpline that will be released by the department. Such applicants will then be connected to volunteers who will assist them till the admission process is completed,” said Adlakha. He said that the admission process and the volunteers will be monitored through WhatsApp support groups.Currently, colleges across the state have a select number of reserved seats for PWD students under various categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-asks-colleges-to-make-ug-admission-process-more-inclusive-for-students-with-disabilities/story-jkVUYbIsMDzTDaaIyiBpmJ.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||35 bars and restaurants in Gurugram shut their business due to poor demand||At least than 35 bars and restaurants in the city, including 11 in CyberHub, have shut down since a nationwide lockdown was imposed in March to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The excise and taxation department said in the past few months, several restaurant owners have approached them, offering to surrender their licence, as they are finding it difficult to survive in the current situation. Several new establishments have also surrendered their liquor licence and vacated their premises.Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation officer (DETC), East, said 35 restaurant owners have surrendered their licences so far due to high operational costs and poor consumer demand. Although many restaurants have started their operations, but people are hardly visiting them. “We have already waived one-third of the licence fees, bringing it down to ₹2 lakh. We have started the liquor licence renewal process for the next quarters. But we fear that more restaurant and pub owners might be prompted to surrender their licences.There is not even a single case where owners have resumed operations without liquor due to poor footfall,” she said. There is a total of 327 restaurants, pubs and bars across the city. Most of the outlets are situated on Golf Course Road, Sector 29 and the Cyber Hub.Earlier this year, the excise department had waived off licence fee for the first quarter (April-June) and is now offering a 20% discount on the advance payment of the fees for the third and fourth quarters in an effort to revive the food services industry. It is not yet clear if the fee for the second quarter (July-Sept) would be waived off as well. Last week, the Haryana government allowed liquor to be served only at tables of restaurants. However, pubs and bars will continue to remain closed, including all establishments with dance floors.However, despite such concessions, the future of the food services industry seems grim, said many restaurant owners. Aditya Bhaskar, owner of Nooba chain of outlets which shut their operations in Cyber Hub and on Golf Course Road on August 1, said that the industry was going through a tough time. “There are no guests in any of the places; people are not willing to come out to dine. We don’t know from when can pubs and bars start operating. We did pay our staff, including all our chefs, as it was our responsibility to take care of their well-being. However, we are unable to pay the rent anymore without any income,” he said. The restaurant owners also alleged that the government did nothing for the food services industry and left them to fend for themselves. Vikram Nair, owner of Khaaja Chowk which shut shop in July, said the rents were really high and dealing with government officials was difficult. “With the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, there’s no clarity as to when the situation will get back to normal. It might take another year or so for the food services industry to get back on its feet,” said Nair. Restaurant owners added that even though the lockdown rules have been relaxed, the crisis is likely to have a long-term impact on the industry. Owners who shut their operations also said that the remaining outlets will find it difficult to survive if the present situation continues for next quarter or so. On an average, one in three establishments could shut down permanently, said restaurant owners. “The rent and overhead costs are so high that without any income it was very difficult to continue. We waited for five months but failed to revive the business. It was difficult to pay salaries, electricity bills and rent. While the liquor licence fee for first quarter was waived off, but we are unwilling to pay for the upcoming quarters without knowing the future of the business,” said Raghav Baweja, owner of Big Wong at Cross Point Mall in DLF Phase-4, that stopped operations in March-end. He added that the rent of an 80-seater restaurant in Gurugram is nearly₹6 lakh per month. Aruna Singh, DETC, East said they are waiting for new orders from the state government that are likely to benefit the hoteliers and restaurant owners. “The industry has suffered huge losses and owners had no other option but to surrender their liquor licences. They were paying high rents and many of them were paying their staff salaries despite little or no business. The department is trying to support such establishments but regaining consumer demand is not in our hands. Restaurants have been allowed to serve liquor but the pub and bars are yet to be operational. We have sent recommendations to the government, requesting for a waiver of their liquor licence fees until the operations are in full swing,” she said. The restaurants were given permission to resume their operations at 50% capacity from June 8. A total of nine five-star hotels, seven four-star hotels and five three-star hotels have also resumed serving liquor to guests. Officials said the hotel association of Gurugram had written to the department in June requesting them to waive their liquor licence fee as they have been shut since March 25. Inderjeet Banga, head, National Restaurants Association of India, Gurugram chapter, said that they have requested the government to support the food services industry given the present state of affairs. “The sate government has allowed serving liquor at tables in the restaurant. It has also offered a rebate of 20% for the next two quarters if we submit the liquor licence fees in the next 10 days,” he said, adding that they are trying to get more concessions so that more restaurants do not have to shut their operations. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/35-bars-and-restaurants-in-gurugram-shut-their-business-due-to-poor-demand/story-1bQ8jHvRorTSQZqqiRKa1L.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||Armed robbers steal car, motorcycle, cash from priest in Farrukhnagar||Three unidentified men barged into the premises of a temple in a village in Farrukhnagar Sunday morning and allegedly robbed the temple’s priest and his family of cash worth ₹28,000, five mobile phones, a car and a motorcycle. The police said at least one of the suspects was carrying a gun while the other two had wooden sticks. No arrests have been made in the case so far.According to the police, the incident was reported around 2am on Sunday morning when the complainant, Murari Das, who is a priest at a temple in Hari Nagar village, was asleep in a room in the temple’s compound. In the police complaint, he said, “I was asleep when a suspect, who had a gun, barged into my room. He was accompanied by two aides, who had wooden sticks with them. Their faces were covered. They threatened me to no make any noise or else they would shoot me. They took the keys of my car, my wife’s earrings, and ₹28,000 cash.”Das added that the suspects then entered another room, where his relatives and a helper were asleep. “The suspects took their phones and also forcefully snatched the keys of a motorcycle from my relative. Then they drove away in the car and the motorcycle,” he said.A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The suspects are yet to be identified. We are checking the footage from CCTV cameras in neighbouring areas for possible leads.”A case was registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 392 (robbery), 458 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code and section 25/54/59 of the Arms Act at Farrukhnagar police station on Sunday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/armed-robbers-steal-car-motorcycle-cash-from-priest-in-farrukhnagar/story-LcXMWU00wfoTSi2RSjw2eO.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Schools, parents divided over calling senior students for academic guidance||With the Central government’s Unlock 4 guidelines allowing students of classes 9 to 12 to visit schools on a voluntary basis from September 21 to seek academic guidance, some government schools in the city are preparing to call students on a rotational basis once the SOPs are issued by the state government. Most private schools, on the other hand, plan to continue with online classes and are not in favour of asking senior students to visit the school. Parents too continue to remain divided on the issue. While those who do not have access to smartphones and internet connection are willing to send their wards to schools, others prefer online or telephonic consultation. As part of the guidelines, students of classes 9 to 12 can be permitted to visit schools for academic guidance with the written consent of parents, starting September 21. The standard operating procedures for this will be issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). While protocols for the same are yet to be issued, government schools in the city welcomed the move and said that it will help students who are unable to access online lessons. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that such visits would help students who had not been able to stay in touch with online lessons regularly due to issues ranging from the absence of smartphones to erratic internet connectivity. “Apart from issues of accessibility, there are some students who are unable to keep up with online lessons due to poor comprehension or irregular lessons. Teachers will be able to assess the issues that they are facing better through in-person interaction,” said Sharma. She said that the school had plans to call students in small batches of five each for clarification of doubts pertaining to concepts. “Our school has enough space to accommodate small groups of students. We are planning to call five students from classes 10 and 12 on a particular day. This will give them a chance to resolve queries and understand concepts that they might be struggling to comprehend. Each student can interact with a teacher while practising physical distancing protocols,” said Sharma. She said that the school had already made arrangements for thermal scanning and sanitisation at the entrance. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said that the school was awaiting state guidelines before allowing students to visit schools. “Parents whose children have not been able to keep in touch with online classes regularly would prefer if they are allowed to visit the school for clarification of doubts. We already have Covid-19 protocols in place but will wait for the government to issue specific guidelines,” said Miglani. Most private school administrators, however, said that online classes were going well due to which students might not prefer to visit schools for academic assistance. Anita Malhotra, principal of Lotus Valley, said that the school would wait for another month or more before it decides to call students for even academic assistance. “We will write to parents, and only if they agree, we will consider the possibility of calling students. September is too early to call students and we are planning to wait till October or much later,” said Malhotra. She said that online classes had been going smoothly and children were happy with lessons. “We are getting good feedback on online classes and don’t think parents would be willing to send them to school this year,” said Malhotra, adding that the school was planning to call teachers to school before students. “We are planning to call teachers in smaller groups so that they can gradually start taking classes from school. They need to get used to school visits, possibly on alternate days,” she said. Parents of children in private and government schools had mixed responses about sending children to school. Most parents whose children study in private schools said that they would prefer online or telephonic interaction over physical visits for any assistance. “We’d prefer to call or email the teacher if our son needs any assistance. Physical visits to schools would be our last choice. So far, teachers have been available for remote assistance,” said Kaushik. Lalit Kumar, whose daughters study in different government schools in the city, said that he’d send his daughters to school if they needed help. “We don’t have a smartphone at home due to which regular lessons have been disrupted. If the school allows, my daughters would definitely visit and meet the teachers for guidance,” said Kumar. Sudesh Raghav, who holds additional charge as Gurugram’s block education officer, said that while the Central government had given permission to schools, the state government was yet to issue any guidelines on the subject. “We are waiting for the state government to issue guidelines and will proceed accordingly. Teachers in the state have already been reporting to work since June,” said Raghav. He said that parents, teachers, and students, especially in senior classes, were worried about the completion of the syllabus and the government was taking feedback from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-schools-parents-divided-over-calling-senior-students-for-academic-guidance/story-xJ2znBPwdQRacboh7HHuDK.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||Man strangles wife, cooks up story that she was bitten by a ‘venomous creature’; arrested||A man was arrested for allegedly strangling his wife to death in Nathupur village in DLF Phase-3 area on Monday. The police said after murdering her, the suspect cooked up a story that she had died after being bitten by a “venomous creature”. The police said inquest proceedings were initiated and after the post-mortem examination, it was found that she had died of asphyxia. Following this, the man was booked on charges of murder and was subsequently arrested. According to the police, on Sunday morning, they received a call from Nathupur village. The caller told the police that a 20-year-old woman, Nikki Kumari, had died due to a suspected case of poisoning after being bitten by some worm. The police said her husband, Roshan Paswan, a gardener, stated, in a written complaint at Nathupur police post, that she had died after being bitten by a venomous creature. The police filed an inquest report under Section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the post-mortem examination was conducted on Sunday. The police said, according to the preliminary report of the autopsy, the cause of death was “asphyxia due to ante mortem ligature” — thereby suggesting that the woman had been strangled. Kumari’s father, Parmanand, 48, a rickshaw driver from Supaul, Bihar, said in the police complaint, “My daughter had got married to Paswan in March 2019 and both had been staying in a rented room in Nathupur since then. I live in the same plot three rooms apart. For the past few days, he had been harassing her. He used to beat her up and had threatened to kill her. On Sunday around 7am, Paswan came to my room and informed me that Nikki was unable to breathe as she had been bitten by a poisonous worm. I reached her room and saw her lying dead and we informed the police. Parmanand said that he suspected that his daughter was strangled to death by Paswan sometime between Saturday night and Sunday morning. “The post-mortem report confirmed my suspicion. Paswan had given a false complaint to the police, claiming that she died after being bitten by a venomous creature.” Lal Singh, in-charge, Nathupur police post, said, “The suspect, Roshan Paswan, strangled his wife after an alleged argument and then cooked up a story that she had died due to a bite from a worm. After the post-mortem report, he was booked on charges of murder and arrested.” A case has been registered at the DLF Phase-3 police station. Man found dead near Pataudi RoadIn another incident, a 38-year-old tea seller was found murdered, across the road from Pataudi Road police post, on Monday morning. The police said preliminary probe suggested that he was bludgeoned to death with stones the previous night. The police have registered a case of murder against unidentified persons. According to the police, the victim has been identified as Baijnath Jha, a native of Darbhanga in Bihar. The police said Jha had been selling tea and vegetables from a cart near the police post on Pataudi Road for several years and often slept on a mattress next to his cart. The police said after Jha did not return to his house on Sunday night, his wife, Usha, asked one of their five children to check upon him on Monday. His son saw him lying on the mattress with a blanket covering his body and assumed that he was asleep. A few hours later, his wife decided to check. She removed the blanket and saw him lying motionless with injuries on his face and head. Rakesh, in-charge of Pataudi Road police post, said, “Preliminary probe suggests that he was beaten up and hit with stones on head and face, sometime during the night. His wife has not named any suspect in the police complaint. We have initiated a probe.” A case was registered against the unidentified accused under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Shivaji Nagar police station on Monday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-strangles-wife-cooks-up-story-that-she-was-bitten-by-a-venomous-creature-arrested/story-NzkV2g0sYpX4kiM4YPrF1I.html

However, a number of steps recommended by the revenue generation committee to improve the civic body’s financial health could not be discussed.This was the first time that the MC offered a one-time settlement scheme to water bill defaulters despite absence of such a provision in the Chandigarh Water Supply Bye Laws. That was the reason why the general house approval was required after it was suggested by the committee.With this, the MC will issue a notification and three months will be given to around 20,000 defaulters to pay the arrears at discounted rates.The scheme stipulated one-time payment of arrears with a 10% rebate. Those paying in two instalments will get a 7% discount and others paying in three lots will get 5% off.About Rs 41.60 crore remains unpaid for up to June 30, 2020, with defaulters including domestic, industrial, and commercial users and government departments. Of this, Rs 37.44 crore was the principal amount and Rs 4.16 crore the surcharge amount.A surcharge of 10% will be imposed on those not paying their bills by the due date.Other approvalsThough the committee made around 20 suggestions, the house was able to discuss just a few, including generation of funds from Mahila Bhawan in Sector 38, and revised license fee for permissions to grow hedges.A proposal to increase charges from Rs 25 per 100 sq ft a year to Rs 250 for permissions to grow hedges was rejected.The hedges can be grown adjacent to houses on V5 and V6 roads of MC.When BJP city chief and councillor Arun Sood objected to the provision of conviction against violators, the MC decided that a request would be made to the UT administration to drop the conviction clause.Imposition of fines will continue.Till the administration’s approval no conviction proceedings will be started, the MC decided.Other plans that were approved included display of advertisement boards at the around 74 public toilets in garden/green belt/parks under MC jurisdiction, which its horticulture department maintains.The house also gave the go ahead to the installation of bank ATMs at various tubewells, boosters and community centres. It decided that the best sites would be selected first before requisite permissions are taken from the UT administration.SETTLEMENT SCHEME FOR DEFAULTERSThose who haven’t paid their water bills will get three months to deposit arrears.10% rebate if arrears are paid in one instalment7% rebate if arrears are paid in two instalments5% rebate if arrears are paid in three instalments||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-approves-plan-to-recover-41-crore-from-unpaid-water-bills/story-viPldrTIvSlpirw9QE7VoO.html

Till August 29, nearly 81% of the people infected with the deadly infection in the district were under home isolation.In Haryana, Rewari had the highest number of patients under home isolation (90%) followed by Jind (86.5). Sonipat district had the least number of patients (19%) in home isolation.Till August 29, Gurugram had a total of 11,693 patients infected with Sars-CoV-2—the pathogen that causes coronavirus, and out of these, 9,509 asymptomatic patients were under home isolation. According to the state’ health department data at least 8,687 patients in home isolation have recovered completely so far. As many as 165 of patients under home isolation had to shift to a hospital or a Covid care centre after their condition deteriorated. So far, one death has been reported under home isolation in the district.Across the state, only four such deaths have been reported including two in Faridabad and one in Jind.Gurugram health officials said asymptomatic Covid-19 patients preferred to be in home isolation, while those with symptoms and co-morbid condition are being hospitalised. “Home isolation is allowed only if the coronavirus positive patients have appropriate facilities at their home. We won’t allow patients to go for home isolation until we confirm they have necessary facilities,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Home isolation was allowed in Gurugram in the first week of May.Since the cases are increasing in the district, Yadav said the district health department is working on a campaign to keep family members of an infected person under home quarantine for 14 days and high-risk contacts (with co-morbidities) suspected of contracting the virus will be shifted to Covid care centres. Due to poor occupancy of beds in such centres, the district administration has also reduced the number of isolation beds reserved in hotels and guest houses for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. From 3,481 beds reserved in different hotels in June, the count now stands a 386. Since, most asymptomatic patients prefer home isolation, only 321 beds in seven hotels have been reserved as self-paid isolation facilities. and 65 beds in two hotels are kept as government-paid facility.Faridabad, as per the state data, had shifted highest number of coronavirus patients, at least 237 from home isolation to hospitals and Covid-19 care centre so far. Across the state, nearly 62% Covid-19 patents are under home isolation (till August 29).On Monday, Gurugram reported 113 new cases, taking the total tally to 11,917. At least 994 are active cases, with 858 patients under home isolation, 120 patients undergoing treatment in hospitals, and 16 in Covid care centres set up in hotels. The Covid-19 death toll stands at 133 in the district. Panipat, which has the highest number of active case (over 1000) at present has kept 59% of its patients in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-81-of-active-cases-home-isolated-till-aug-29-in-gurugram/story-Z9yLuCFTtbS61t0FJAs3WN.html
01-09-2020||City||Farmers accused of illegal construction on authority land get anticipatory bail||GREATER NOIDA: The district court has granted anticipatory bail to two farmers accused of construction on the land acquired by the Noida authority. The accused, Rishi Ram Chauhan and Nand Kishore, both residents of Baraula in Sector 49, claimed that their land on khasra numbers 767 and 768 is declared as abadi land for over 50 years.The authority had booked them under IPC Section 447 and under the provisions of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The prosecution stated that the two accused were constructing multi-storeyed building on Noida authority’s acquired land in Baraula. They were restrained several times by the authority, but they refused to stop the work.The court stated that as per the available documents it is clear that the Noida authority acquired the said land. However, petitioners claimed that the land was abadi land and they have not taken any compensation from authority for its acquisition, which was confirmed by Industrial Development Committee report of April 24, 2010. The committee had found the said land a fit case for regularisation and lease back on submission of ownership documents. “Additional District Judge Vineet Chaudhary has granted anticipatory bail to the accused. Investigation officer is directed that in case situation arises that they need to be arrested, the petitioners should be released on bail on furnishing personal bond of Rs 30,000 and two sureties,” Dayanand Bhati, assistant district counsel, Gautam Budh Nagar, said on Monday.“The accused will cooperate in investigation and will be present before investigating officer when he calls them. Without court’s permission, they cannot visit foreign country. Further, it is stated that this order does not give permission to them for construction at site. The authority is free to take action on illegal construction as per law,” said Bhati.According to Bhati, land owner Shreya Chauhan, father of petitioners, had submitted lease back papers to the authority and in January 1984, he had applied for power connection to run flour mill at this land. The authority had issued NOC for the mill and thus the physical possession was with the petitioners, although records show the legal possession of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-accused-of-illegal-construction-on-authority-land-get-anticipatory-bail/story-7wL3mgitTsGpyUAuPoSseJ.html
01-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG to deploy sweeping machines to clean city streets||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to clean at least 200 kilometres of the city roads with 10 new sweeping machines allocated by the Haryana government, said officials of the civic body on Monday. Until now, MCG used to outsource the cleaning of roads to a Delhi-based contractor. However, the cleaning process was largely labour-intensive and could cover only a fraction of the roads, said officials familiar with the matter. The civic body on Sunday cancelled its contract with its concessionaire, and Monday was the last day of its operations. “The concessionaire had three sweeping machines. However, with each machine, at least six workers of the contractor were deputed for both maintaining them as well as manually cleaning the stretches. The process was hence slow. With the Haryana government announcing that they are phasing out outsourcing of road sweeping across the state, we have taken up the responsibility on our own,” said an MCG official in the civic body’s health wing.Earlier in September 2019, the then directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) minister Kavita Jain had announced that the government would be providing road sweeping machines to municipal corporations and municipal councils across the state.Between September 2019 and January 2020, 44 such machines were distributed across the state, including four for the MCG, said the civic body officials.“Over the last three months, we have procured six more from the Haryana government. With a stock of 10 road machines, we are now fully equipped for managing the task on our own. All 10 machines will be used to clean the city streets every night,” said the MCG official.As per MCG officials, each machine costs between ₹75 lakh and ₹1.5 crore and is capable of cleaning a stretch of 4km per hour. Officials added that a daily target of cleaning more than 200km has been set, which will help phase out the need for using manual labour for cleaning the roads. “With the help of these machines, one stretch of road will be cleaned at least 2-3 times in a week. Besides eliminating the need of manual labour, the machines will also help in reducing air pollution across the city by not allowing dust or other suspended particles to accumulate,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.A road sweeping machine operates like a vacuum cleaner. It first dispels a large amount of water at a particular spot, while its hydraulic broom then scrubs the road surface. Following this, a large vacuum collects dust and other particles from the streets.MCG officials said that these machines would be put to use from midnight till 6am every day when the volume of vehicles on the roads is comparatively low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-to-deploy-sweeping-machines-to-clean-city-streets/story-vgiBkoi7eQIorZUYEzG1cI.html
01-09-2020||Noida||Residents raise concern over rising number of stray cattle on Noida streets||With the rising number of stray cattle roaming freely on the streets of Noida, residents of the city have raised concerns, citing issues of safety during commute. As per the Noida authority, there are nearly 2,000 stray cows on the streets of the city. Animal activists, however, peg the number at around 5,000 based on a rough estimate made during the lockdown. Additionally, the forest department, in its 2019 animal census, noted that there are at least 217 “feral cows” in the city that are born out of abandoned cattle on the roads. Both officials and animal welfare organisations associate the rising number of stray cattle to the practice of abandonment by their owners because of old age and diseases. Meanwhile, residents of the city have complained to the authority regarding the number of accidents that have taken place due to the presence of stray cattle. “Accidents are happening on a regular basis. Last year, a mother and son died in accident because of stray cattle,” said Amit Gupta, a social activist and a resident of Sector 77. “There are certain accident-prone areas like those along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway or near Sector 137, where the presence of cattle has made commuting unsafe. The roads are narrow and there are plenty of U-turns and diversions. Cows suddenly appear out of nowhere, leading to accidents” said Ankit Mishra, a resident of Sector-97, Noida. According to animal welfare organisations said at least five to six calls are received on a daily basis, reporting injuries to cattle. “We get at least six to seven calls, reporting cows being hit by vehicles. No driver would ever hit a large animal willingly. On many occasions, drivers of such vehicles are also injured,” said Kaveri Rana, district head, People for Animal (PFA). Sanjay Mahapatra, who runs the city-based NGO, House of the Animals, said, most of the cows he rescued during the lockdown seemed to have been abandoned due to old age. “Since we don’t have enough facility to accommodate so many cows, we have requested the Noida authority’s cow shelter. However even they lack adequate infrastructure,” he said. Officials of the Noida Authority said that they are expanding their infrastructure to accommodate more cows. “Two new sheds of five acres each have been approved that are capable of holding 1,000 cows and 1,000 bulls and oxen each. We are currently looking for land for the same,” said SC Mishra, Project Engineer (Health), Noida authority. According to the officials, the authority’s existing cowshed in Setor-135 houses 748 cattle as against the capacity to hold 532 animals. Out of 748 animals, over 400 are cows. “Most of these animals have been abandoned by their owners. We are currently spending ₹60,000 per day on feeding these animals. There is another private cowshed in Sector-94 but even that is filled to its capacity. Currently there are 11 sheds in Sector-135 and within a month, two more sheds will be added to accommodate more stray animals,” said Dr Abhishek Dabar, a veterinary doctor at a Sector -135 cow shed. Citing lack of money by owners to feed their cattle as the main reason for their abandonment, Dabar stressed that more investment is required to ensure the welfare of domestic animals. “Poor nutrition is a leading cause of diseases among cattle. At least 70% of the domesticated cattle are either suffering from mastitis or infertility, due to which the productivity drops, forcing owners to abandon them. Many abandoned cattle we bought here did not have their ruminal microflora developed. This means that they were not given proper straw to eat and only grazed on whatever they could find. After administering medication and ensuring nutrition, about 65 cows at our shed are now producing milk,” Dabar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-raise-concern-over-rising-number-of-stray-cattle-on-noida-streets/story-1reOI8WBhssRMPR1scQONJ.html

According to the police, the incident was reported to them by a passerby after which a police team was rushed to the spot. The girl was declared brought dead at the hospital, the police said.The police believe that the newborn was barely a few weeks old. “However, we will know about the exact age of the infant and cause of her death only after the autopsy report comes in,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.A case has been registered at Phase 3 police station against unidentified persons under Section 318 (concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body) of the Indian Penal Code.“We are working on tracing people who might be related to her and trying to find the reason why she was abandoned,” said the DCP.Police officials suspect it to be a case of an illegal abortion but are keeping all angles open like disregard of a girl child. In another incident, the body of a 34-year-old man was found in the Surajpur area around 9.30am on Monday. The man was identified from some identity cards found in his clothes’ pockets as Saroj Kumar, a resident of Kulesra.“We have spoken to the deceased’s family who said that he had been disturbed for the past few days.

01-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad admin directs departments to take pollution abatement measures||Ghaziabad: In view of the approaching winter season which in the past has seen high air pollution levels in Ghaziabad, the district administration on Monday held a review meeting with different departments and agencies. The administration directed that the pollution abatement measures should be kicked off well before the onset of winter season. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has sought action plans from the traffic police department, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), municipal corporation and pollution body, among others. He directed the officials to find out inventory of all the diesel generator (DG) sets which are used in residential, commercial and industrial sectors. “The pollution levels during winter have been high in the city. We do not wish the situation of previous years to prevail this year. So, we have directed beforehand that all the departments should proactively take measures in their domain in order to tackle pollution. The preparation should start now and all the pollution causing sources should be identified,” Pandey said. “Among several measures, we have directed that roads requiring repairs should be identified and repairs should be taken up. Further, the road sweeping machines should be deployed and work should start at the earliest. Some more meetings will follow in coming days,” he said. During the last winter season, the Ghaziabad city on several occasions had topped the list of most polluted cities in the country as per the daily air quality index issued by the Central Pollution Control Board.The DM directed the officials to pay special attention to hotspot areas like Sahibabad, Bhopra, Panchsheel Enclave, Hindon Vihar and other industrial areas. Some of these areas in the past have reported burning of plastic waste, which has added to pollution levels. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the agencies like the municipal corporation and the GDA have been asked to get GIS mapping of all open areas in their jurisdiction so that dust emission can be tackled. “The authority (GDA) has also been asked to communicate to the construction site owners (having projects with area more than 20,000 square metres) to make self audit of the measures available with them so that timely action can be taken to prevent pollution,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. Sharma, who attended the review meeting, also said that the pollution body will prepare the audit sheets in coming days. “The authority will also pursue projects and get the installation of anti-smog guns well before the start of winter season. The officials of the UP Jal Nigam have been directed to take up maintenance of all the sewage treatment plants in timely manner. Similarly, the traffic police and officials of the UP State Road Transport Corporation have been asked to put curb on heavy vehicles like trucks and buses which are parked roadside,” he added. The UPPCB officials said that they have been tasked to check industrial units and ensure they do not use the non-designated fuel like rubber, plastic, etc, which result in smoke and pollution. Ghaziabad is also a prominent industrial town and has witnessed high pollution levels in the past few years. It is also identified under the list of 15 non-attainment cities in UP (by UPPCB) which have high levels of air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-admin-directs-departments-to-take-pollution-abatement-measures/story-N7Ube8kpCyaiVPzr3MGBDI.html
01-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad admin seeks more ICU beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration on Monday asked the representatives of private hospitals, providing paid Covid treatment in the district, to increase the number of Covid and ICU beds in order to treat patients who are referred to from the government facilities. The district administration plans to increase the number of reserved ICU beds in the private hospitals to about 50 from 19, officials said. The officials said that the decision was conveyed to the private hospitals at a meeting on Monday after the directions were received from the state government which said that the district magistrate can reserve up to 50% beds in private hospitals if there is a shortage of L2 or L3 category beds in the government Covid facilities. “We have asked the private hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds and ICU beds. They have also been asked to reserve 50% beds so that these can be used for referral of critical patients from government facilities in case of requirement. Further, we have asked the district health department to find out possibility of more private hospitals which can provide Covid treatment,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. At present, the district has 10 private hospitals which are providing paid Covid treatment and having a total of 598 Covid beds that include 98 ICU beds. “Out of 98 ICU beds available in private hospitals, we have already got reserved 19 beds so far. Now, we have planned to increase the number of reserved ICU beds to about 50. We will use these beds if the government facilities face a shortage of ICU beds. This arrangement will help us bring down the fatalities further,” said an officer from district health department on condition of anonymity. In the government facilities, the district has just 37 ICU beds available at the two hospitals at Sanjay Nagar (L2) and government-acquired Santosh hospital (L3).According to the state control room, the district has a total of 68 deaths till August 31 while the tally of Covid-19 cases stood at 8,353. This gives the district the case fatality rate of 0.81%. “We have planned that critical patients will be immediately referred to the private ICU beds. In case the patients require costly medicines like Remdesivir, we can provide them or the hospitals can charge us extra,” the health officer said. The officials of the private hospitals who attended the meeting said that consideration for hike of charges should be made. “In the times of pandemic, the healthcare staff are taking risk and attending to the patients. The officials should consider raising the charges so that other operating costs are met. I don’t think that any hospital will be denying treatment, but hike in charges should be considered,” said Dr Mahesh Chaudhary, director (operations), Navin Hospital at Vaishali. The district officials said that under the arrangement of 50% reserved beds, the government will pay up for the treatment of referred Covid patients on the basis of rates prevalent under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna. Under the scheme, the cost of a general ward bed is Rs 1,800 per day and that for a high dependency unit is Rs 2,700 per day. The cost of beds without ventilators has been fixed at Rs 3,600 per day while those with ventilators are fixed at Rs 4,500 per day. The officials of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad chapter, said that the government should consider the fact that operational cost of ICU beds are high. “So, they should consider hike in rates, at least near to what has been recommended by the Dr VK Paul committee. The rates under the Ayushman scheme are less. If the rates are increased, the hospitals will be more willing to cooperate,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of IMA – Ghaziabad. Based on the recommendations of committee headed by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, the UP government has capped the prices for Covid-19 beds between Rs 8,000 and Rs 15,000 for paid Covid treatment in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-admin-seeks-more-icu-beds-in-private-hospitals-for-covid-19-patients/story-KAtvZpThAZTmpnzVLYE76I.html

Initially, we thought that it was rainwater that did not drain out. After an officer was sent to have a look at the roof, it was found that it was the overhead water tank that was overflowing and leading to wastage of water,” Pandey said.“This is why the penalties of different amounts were levied against the basic education officer and other staff of his office, “ he added. The DM issued directions for deducting the fines from the salaries of the staffers and said that amount of the fines will be credited to the water conservation fund.The DM also said that some staffers at the office were also found absent from their duty during the surprise check. “The basic education officer was in Sahibabad and attending to Covid-19 surveillance duties. However, we found that six staff members of the office were absent from their duty. Hence, their one-day salary will be deducted and they have been asked to give a reason for being absent from duty,” Pandey said.Chaudhary said he has been deployed as the sector magistrate for Covid-19 surveillance work. “The water tank was overflowing as its valve had malfunctioned. It has broken down several times even though we have got it repaired it on various occasions. The valve malfunctioned at the time of inspection too, and hence, the DM issued directions for levying fines” Chaudhary said.DM Pandey further said that all departments have been asked to complete pending works.“All departments have been asked to take up public related works on a priority basis. If it is found that the work is not taken up on time, action will follow. Surprise inspections will continue,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tank-found-overflowing-at-office-ghaziabad-basic-education-officer-staffers-fined/story-WS9MpJWOaKMtriM3I0BewI.html
01-09-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University panel suggest 5% semester-fee waiver||Amid protests on campus by various student bodies, a Panjab University panel on Monday suggested 5% semester-fee waiver for all students. A panel member, requesting anonymity, said they have also suggested giving more concessions to physically disabled and students from weaker financial backgrounds. The panel has also recommended allowance for staggered fee payment. However, student bodies had rejected this proposal earlier. The committee's recommendation will be sent to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar for final approval. Protests on campus demanding complete semester-fee waiver amid the Covid-19 pandemic have also resulted in scuffles. Amid the controversy, the university has postponed the last date of fee submission. Earlier, students were told to deposit fees by August 11, which was extended to August 31 and later to September 5.Student leaders and varsity officials have discussed the matter at least twice in August without any outcome. Even the meeting between student leaders and the V-C ended without a decision being made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-panel-suggest-5-semester-fee-waiver/story-4NghMVo6J4sl3VEPEquunO.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||Facebook played a role in fuelling riots, says Delhi panel||The Delhi Assembly’s peace and harmony committee on Monday said it had prima facie found that social media company Facebook was complicit in aggravating the riots that took place in north-east Delhi in February this year, leaving 53 dead and over 400 injured.The committee on Monday held its second hearing after it took cognisance of “several complaints” received from people based on an article published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14. The report titled ‘Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics’ stated that Facebook officials, especially its top public policy executive in India, Ankhi Das, allegedly cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate-speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence. After the hearing, the peace and harmony committee’s chairperson Raghav Chadha said the panel is now left with no other option but to summon Facebook officials in its next hearing, the date of which will be notified soon. Facebook did not respond to mails, messages and calls seeking a comment on the matter.“The committee has decided to summon Facebook officials in its next meeting in order to examine them on oath and determine their culpability. This is because the panel has prima facie found Facebook complicit in the Delhi riots of February 2020 on the premise of the incriminatory material produced on record by the witnesses, as well as their scathing depositions before the Committee,” Chadha said.BJP spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.The committee observed that there should be an independent investigation leading to the filing of a supplementary charge sheet in the ongoing cases related to the Delhi riots on the basis of supportive and corroborative material during the course of the purported investigation.The witnesses whose statements and other proofs were examined on Monday include Awesh Tiwari, a journalist from Chhattisgarh who had lodged an FIR against Facebook’s policy director Ankhi Das, Kunal Purohit, an independent journalist and researcher and Subhash Gatade, another independent journalist.“The witnesses drew significant correlation with the recent phenomenon of Black Lives Matter Movement which emerged after the brutal murder of George Floyd, an African-American. In this case, Facebook played a major role in containing hate speech. But, when confronted with similar situations in India during the Delhi riots, Facebook chose to flagrantly ignore these guidelines and sheltered offensive and hateful content on its platform. The witness also deposed the current ruling dispensation in India is the highest spender on advertisements on Facebook platform,” the panel said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/facebook-complicit-in-aggravating-n-e-delhi-riots-says-delhi-assembly-panel/story-1HkXrGw4fWSOpoLUrVuCsO.html

01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt warns private schools against charging anything other than tuition fee||The Delhi government on Monday again warned all private schools in the city against charging parents anything other than tuition fees during the lockdown and directed them to immediately refund or adjust money in case they have collected any other payment from parents in the period. The Directorate of Education’s (DoE) order is in continuation of its April 18 notification that said private schools would charge only tuition fee until the lockdown was in effect -- a move that made parents happy but upset schools.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia tweeted saying, “Arvind Kejriwal’s government’s big decision in the interest of parents of private school students. Private schools have been directed not to change fee under any other components other than tuition fees. Schools will have to adjust the money in the coming months in case they have already collected additional fees from parents.”In an order issued to all private schools on Monday, the DoE said they had received a number of complaints, not only from parents but also from other quarters, alleging that many private unaided recognised schools of Delhi had started charging the fees under many other heads other than the tuition such as like annual charge, development charge, etc.The DOE said this was in “contravention to the directions issued by Directorate of Education vide order dated 17/04/2020 & subsequently dated 18/04/2020”. “Such act of the schools is not only in the clear violation of the above directions issued vide order dated: 17/04/2020 & subsequently dated 18/04/2020 but also an inhumane act on their part, keeping in view the prevailing Covid-2019 pandemic conditions and long closure of schools.” The directorate said it received several representations from private schools, saying the “lockdown period was over” and now they could charge fee under all heads -- tuition, annual charge, development fee and some earmarked levies also. “This position as claimed by Private Unaided Recognised Schools is not correct as unlocking stage is still going on in a phased manner and hence, complete lockdown is yet to be over and schools are yet to be open for physical classroom learning,” the DoE order stated.The DoE has warned schools that action under Section 24 of the Delhi School Education Act and Rules would be taken against them in case of non-compliance. It said, “...The schools will not increase any fee in the academic session 2020-21 till further directions,” the order said.“If any private unaided recognised school has charged fees/amount other than the tuition fees in contravention of order dated 18/04/2020, the same shall be refunded or adjusted immediately,” it added.The DoE asked schools not to deny access to online education to students who are unable to pay school fee due to the financial crisis arising out of closure of business activities during the lockdown. They have also been directed to give timely salaries to their staff.Parents welcomed the fresh order while private schools termed it as “injustice”. SK Bhattacharya, president of the Action Committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools -- an umbrella group of 400 schools -- said, “How will schools survive without money? From where we will pay salaries to teachers? The annual charges and development fee are necessary to meet necessary expenses such as property tax, maintenance and also pay salary to the staff since tuition fee is not adequate. This is absolutely injustice with private schools.”Aparajitha Gautam, president of Delhi parents Association, said the order is a big relief for parents. “We have been receiving a lot of complaints from parents against schools. The government should ensure the schools follow the order. Many schools have already violated the April 18 order by charging money under other components than the tuition fee and increasing fee.The government should take action against such schools as well,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-warns-private-schools-against-charging-anything-other-than-tuition-fee/story-zkZceNqPLdZOfz57RVjvCM.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro construction behind flooding in GK-2 basements: Study||Occupants of 15 houses and shops in blocks M, S and E in Greater Kailash-2, south Delhi, have been contending with a peculiar problem for the past few months. Their basements remain flooded even when there is no rain. After having exhausted all options to rectify the problem in vain, the residents sought help from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), whichc hecked its pipelines and found no leakage. The DJB then requested the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) to look into the issue. An interim report from the CGWB, submitted on Monday, and another from an independent scientist have found “obstructions” in the groundwater flow due to several man-made structures and the construction of Delhi Metro tunnels. A team of scientists from the CGWB had conducted a field study of the area between August 19 and 28 to table the interim report. GK-2 residents’ welfare association had also roped in a Ranchi-based geologist to conduct a study using remote-sensing technology. Findings of both reports are similar.Sanjay Rana, president, GK-2 RWA, said, “The reports have come and now we hope to get a solution to this problem soon. We fear that the foundation of these houses may get damaged due to the constant inundation.”“The groundwater movement from South (Jahanpanah city forest) to Northwest (Savitri flyover) affected. The construction of Metro tunnels and basements (more than 4 metres deep) has obstructed groundwater flow line in the study area,” the CGWB report stated. The Metro structures had come up in early 2018. “The rise in water level has gone unnoticed that year and in 2019 because till then, groundwater had not entered basements,” the report said. The report highlights that the area reported good rainfall on August 22-23 with which the water level in the area rose by an average of 0.5 metres on August 24. “The water level on August 19 ranged between 2.5-6.5 metres below ground level (bgl). The maximum depth of basements facing seepage problem is 6 metres bgl,” the report said. The report by geologist Akhilesh Singh said, “The construction of big commercial units and construction of Metro networks towards north and northwest side of the GK-2 area might have influenced the aquifer connectivity. Restricted flow of water towards northern side together with high recharge due to heavy rainfall from the southern side, might have caused the rise in groundwater and inundation.”“It is a localised groundwater problem, “ Singh told HT over phone. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), in response to HT’s query, said the tunnelling work was completed in 2018. On this particular stretch, it was completed in 2016 itself. “The tunnels near Savitri flyover were built 10-15 metres below the ground (equal to a 3-5 storey building) and the water table is below the tunnel. Therefore, it is not possible to obstruct the flow of the water, which is already flowing below this level,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said. “However, if there are any specific complaint, the DMRC is open to addressing the same,” he said. Also, the CGWB suggested several measures to the DJB, including draining of water through the existing tubewells and fixing of the stormwater drain. A DJB spokesperson said, “We have received the CGWB report. DJB will meet officials of agencies concerned and prepare an action plan to address the issue.” GK MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj, said, “I discussed the report with DJB officials. DJB will chalk out a plan to implement the recommendations to fix the problem.” Manu Bhatnagar, principal director, natural heritage division, INTACH, said groundwater level rising is a good sign and a desirable natural phenomenon. “In the past few years, the DJB water supply in the area has been good, which has reduced the dependency on tubewells. Also, the annual recharge during the monsoon has raised the water table towards its natural and original level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gk-2-basements-flooded-study-finds-groundwater-flow-obstructed-by-metro-tunnels-other-structures/story-tpJgBD3A0fUnG9SYBZXcYI.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi records AQI of 41 — lowest since records kept||Delhi on Monday recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 41 -- the lowest since 2015 since when AQI monitoring records are being maintained in the national capital. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the average AQI in Delhi was 41 in the “good” category. This was also the fourth “good” air day recorded over a month since 2015. Board officials said the good air quality was because of a combination of factors, including incessant rainfall, good winds and already reduced levels of pollution during the lockdown months. The CPCB data says while 2015 and 2016 did not record any “good” days, two were recorded in 2017 on July 30 and 31, with AQI readings of 43 and 47, respectively. The year 2018 did not record any “good” air day as well. In 2019, two consecutive ‘days were recorded on August 18 and 19, with AQI readings of 49 on both of those days. So far, five “good” air days have been recorded this year. “There were two good air days in 2017 followed by two in 2019. This year we already have five good air days, and 41 is the lowest AQI. Its good news for residents,” said a senior CPCB official who asked not to be named.The first such day was on March 28 (during the first week of the Covid-19-induced lockdown) with an AQI reading of 45. Then on August 13, after heavy rain, the AQI was recorded at 50. On August 20, again, when Delhi received “very heavy” rainfall, the AQI was again 50. On August 24, an AQI of 45 was recorded.On a scale of 0-500, a value of 0-50, the air quality is considered good (minimal health risk), 51 -100 is satisfactory (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is moderate (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease), 200-300 is poor (breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure), 300-400 is very poor (respiratory illness on prolonged exposure) and 400-500 is severe (affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases).“Usually, the monsoon months are cleaner than the rest of the year. This month, as well as this year so far, has been exceptionally good because of intense and continuous rainfall as well as good winds over the past few days, which cleansed the air of all the pollutants. Besides, the overall pollution levels have been low as an impact of the lockdown imposed to curb Covid,” said a second senior CPCB official who also asked not to be named. HT had earlier reported that this August recorded only “good” and “satisfactory” days with not a single “poor” air quality day being recorded. According to officials in the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with incessant rainfall over the past two weeks, this August has been the second ‘wettest’ in 12 years. The Capital received 364.8 mm rainfall this August, 30% above the normal mark. Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior program manager, clean air programme, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said, “The air quality analysis for this year in comparison to previous years reveals the air has been much cleaner because of a combination of factors. The good meteorological conditions combined with low emission because of the lockdown and reduced economic activity even after the reopening together resulted in good air.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-records-aqi-of-41-lowest-since-records-kept/story-55eSONSKjwVKVAslQDtSnI.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||EDMC asks govt to provide ‘Covid-19 funds’||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday passed a proposal demanding special funds from the Delhi government to fight Covid-19. The proposal was passed in a standing committee meeting of the corporation, which said it was going through an acute financial crisis and was facing difficulty in providing PPE kits, masks and gloves to its corona warriors.Nirmal Jain, mayor of EDMC, said the proposal was passed in view of the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the city. “Since Covid-19 cases are on the rise and need to be taken care of properly. We have asked the Delhi government to provide us with a separate special fund for fighting coronavirus. Fighting with Covid-19 needs special equipment, kits, masks and gloves and for this we need additional funds. It becomes tough for EDMC to spend additionally on Covid gears as the civic body is already passing through a financial crisis,” Jain said.Responding to the EDMC’s demand, Aam Aadmi Party senior leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said, “Ask them to pick up the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. It clearly states the Delhi government has already given around Rs 4,000 crore as loan to the three MCDs...”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/edmc-wants-special-funds-from-govt-to-fight-covid/story-GXWUGMb3y3Gq8JL6j8y6wO.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||Woman trafficked from Bihar, raped, forced into prostitution||A 24-year-old woman who was trafficked from Bihar by an agent of a fake placement agency and later sold into prostitution, escaped from her confines last week and sought help from the Delhi Police.Police said after her husband left her and with no source of income to raise her two children, the woman came to Delhi with the agent in the hopes of getting a job and later brought her children along as well. But the agent allegedly sold her to another person who sexually exploited her and then forced her into prostitution, senior police officers said.Police said last week, the woman fled the place where was being confined and approached the Delhi Police, seeking their help. A team of the Netaji Subhash Place police station later carried out an operation and arrested three men, including the agent Sanjay Shah,34, the police said.“The other two arrested men were identified as Kishan Rai alias Krishnu,25, and Aarif alias Rahul,40, both from Delhi. Shah belongs to Bihar and he had allegedly lured the woman to Delhi in 2017, following his frequent visits to her native village to offer the women there employment in Delhi,” a senior police officer associated with the case said, requesting anonymity.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said on August 23, the woman called the police and in her complaint accused one Kishan Rai of “raping her and forcing her into prostitution.”The woman told the police that Kishan is the person to whom she was sold by Shah. She has alleged that Kishan raped her after promising to marry her. When she learnt that he was already married and confronted him, Kishan “forced her into prostitution”. Aarif is Kishan’s associate and he too had raped her, the woman alleged.The woman’s was counselled and her statement was recorded. She told the police that her husband left her and their two children and married another woman in their home town in Bihar. In 2017, she met Shah who promised her a job and brought her to Delhi. He got her a job as a domestic help in two houses in north and outer Delhi, the officer said.“The woman told us that in 2018, Shah made her steal cash and jewellery from her employer. She was arrested and remained in jail till February this year, when Shah got her released on bail and sold her to Kishan, who raped her and then pushed her into prostitution,” the officer said, quoting the woman’s statement.On August 24, the police team laid a trap by sending the woman to a park near Kishan’s house after she informed him about her return. When Kishan reached the park, the police caught him. His interrogation led to the arrest of Shah from Narela and Aarif from Vijay Vihar.“The three men were arrested under sections 376 (rape), 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 370 A (exploitation of a trafficked person), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code,” DCP Arya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-trafficked-from-bihar-raped-forced-into-prostitution-three-arrested/story-7qonIHBI3T0SPHIFby5gxK.html
01-09-2020||Pune||Two arrested as alert fuel pump staffers nab thief in Koregaon Park||Two men have been arrested for trying to steal money from a fuel station staffer in Koregaon Park on Sunday afternoon.The arrested men have been identified as Majid Akbar Shaikh (19) and Vrushabh Baba Pise (20), both residents of Yerawada. The complainant, Shantaram Sonane (25) is a resident of Santoshnagar in Katraj and a member of the Roshni petrol pump staff in Koregaon Park. One of the two accused snatched Rs 5,700 from Sonane. The two men arrived at fuel station on a bike and refilled petrol in their vehicle. Once done, Pise, who was riding the bike, took the vehicle to the air-filling station located at the exit of the petrol pump while Shaikh stayed near Sonane.As Pise started the bike, Shaikh snatched Rs 5,700 collected by Sonane from customers and made a run for the bike, according to the complaint. “The workers rushed behind them and grabbed the rider as Shaikh tried to sit on the bike. Shaikh slipped from their grip and left with the bike and Pise was handed over to the police,” said PSI Chalke.“They were remanded to one day in police custody. While Pise had been caught at the petrol pump, we tracked Shaikh and arrested him from Laxminagar. The entire amount was recovered from them,” said police sub-inspector Ropesh Walke of Koregaon Park police station who is investigating the case.Pise has one case of extortion registered against him by Pune police in 2020. There is no previous case found registered against Shaikh so far, according to the police.A case under Section 392 (punishment for robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Koregaon Park police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-arrested-as-alert-fuel-pump-staffers-nab-thief-in-koregaon-park/story-u537TmESearu7WGljb3MTJ.html
01-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Medical Association asks govt to step in, help renew licenses||The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) has asked the state government to look into the matter of a majority of nursing homes — many treating Covid-19 patients — operating with expired licences. The Delhi government has not renewed the registrations of such clinics, which expired on March 31. The Delhi government said health minister Satyendar Jain has directed the department to renew licences of nursing homes till December 31, 2020.But Delhi Medical Association officials said no order has been issued as yet.Dr BB Wadhwa, president of DMA, said, “Till last year, the registration was renewed without any hassles. All we had to do was just apply for it. But with changes in the norms for fire safety last year, no registrations have been renewed. Due to this, owners are facing problems.”Wadhwa said, “We have had several meetings with the health department, including those with health minister Satyendar Jain, in this regard. Two months ago, he had assured us that the registration will be renewed till December 31, 2020. But no order has been passed as yet.”A Delhi government spokesperson said, “Several instances have come to light recently, where renewal of health licences is pending on behalf of Delhi government’s health department. Health minister Satyendar Jain has instructed the department to issue orders for automatic renewal of all health licences up to December 31, 2020, keeping in mind the extraordinary constraints being faced by various organisations providing health care services due to the lockdown and pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nursing-homes-with-old-licences-treat-covid-patients-govt-urged-to-look-into-matter/story-NXaiXoJ0QwiGl3IvXMdglL.html
01-09-2020||World||Donald Trump wades into racial tensions with visit to Kenosha||President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice with a trip Tuesday to Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the objections of local leaders.The city has been riven by protests since the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man hit seven times in the back by police as he was getting into a car while they were trying to arrest him. On the eve of his visit, Trump defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men at a demonstration in Kenosha last week and accused Democrat Joe Biden of siding with “anarchists” and “rioters” in the unrest.“I’m there for law enforcement and for the National Guard because they’ve done a great job in Kenosha. They put out the flame immediately,” said Trump as he boarded Air Force One.Upon his arrival in the Midwest, his motorcade passed a mix of supporters, many holding American flags, and protesters, some carrying signs that read Black Lives Matter. As police stood by, barricades were set up along several of the city’s major thoroughfares in an effort to keep onlookers some distance from the passing presidential vehicles.Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers who deployed the National Guard to quell demonstrations in response to the Blake shooting, had pleaded with Trump to stay away for fear of straining tensions further.“I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,” Evers wrote in a letter to Trump. “I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.”Biden has assailed Trump over the deadly protests that have sprung up on his watch. But Trump, claiming the mantle of the “law and order” Republican candidate, is offering himself as the leader best positioned to keep Americans safe.He insisted his appearance in Kenosha would “increase enthusiasm” in Wisconsin, perhaps the most hotly contested battleground state in the presidential race, as the White House said he “wants to visit hurting Americans.” The White House said Trump was not going to meet with Blake’s family. Blake’s family planned a Tuesday “community celebration” to correspond with Trump’s visit.“We don’t need more pain and division from a president set on advancing his campaign at the expense of our city,” Justin Blake, an uncle, said in a statement. “We need justice and relief for our vibrant community.”The NAACP said Tuesday neither candidate should visit the Wisconsin city as tension simmers. Biden’s team has considered a visit to Kenosha and has indicated that a trip to Wisconsin was imminent but has not offered details.Biden, in his most direct attacks yet, accused Trump earlier Monday of causing the divisions that have ignited the violence. He delivered an uncharacteristically blistering speech in Pittsburgh and distanced himself from radical forces involved in altercations.Biden said of Trump: “He doesn’t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat, and he’s stoking violence in our cities. He can’t stop the violence because for years he’s fomented it.”Trump, for his part, reiterated that he blames radical troublemakers stirred up and backed by Biden. But when he was asked about one of his own supporters who was charged with killing two men during the mayhem in Kenosha, Trump declined to denounce the killings and suggested that the 17-year-old suspect, Kyle Rittenhouse, was acting in self-defense.After a confrontation in which he fatally shot one man, police say, Rittenhouse fell while being chased by people trying to disarm him. A second person was shot and killed.“That was an interesting situation,” Trump said Monday during a news conference. “He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell. And then they very violently attacked him. ... He was in very big trouble. He would have been — he probably would’ve been killed.”After Trump’s defense of Rittenhouse, Biden laced into his response, saying in a statement: “Tonight, the president declined to rebuke violence. He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder because of his attacks on others. He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.”The president also suggested that some police officers “choke” when faced with challenging situations and offered an odd comparison, likening them to golfers who “miss a 3-foot putt.”Trump and his campaign team have seized upon the unrest in Kenosha, as well as in Portland, Oregon, where a Trump supporter was shot and killed, leaning hard into a defense of law and order while suggesting that Biden is beholden to extremists. Trump, en route to Wisconsin, lamented the shooting in Oregon and again tried to link the violence to Democratic leadership.Trump aides believe that tough-on-crime stance will help him with voters and that the more the national discourse is about anything other than the coronavirus, the better it is for the president. In the interview with Fox, Trump insisted that if he were not president, “you would have riots like you’ve never seen.”Protests in Kenosha began the night of Blake’s shooting, Aug. 23 and were concentrated in the blocks around the county courthouse downtown. The first three nights, more than 30 fires were set and numerous businesses were vandalized. There was an estimated $2 million in damage to city property, and Kenosha’s mayor has said he is seeking $30 million from the state to help rebuild.The violence reached its peak the night of Aug. 25, two days after Blake was shot, when police said a 17-year-old armed with an illegal semi-automatic rifle shot and killed two protesters in the streets. Since then marches organized both by backers of police and Blake’s family have all been peaceful with no vandalism or destruction to public property.In Pittsburgh, Biden resoundingly condemned violent protesters and called for their prosecution — addressing a key Trump critique. And the former vice president also tried to refocus the race on what has been its defining theme — Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 180,000 Americans dead — after a multi-day onslaught by the president’s team to make the campaign about the violence rattling American cities.Biden’s wife, Jill, on Tuesday kicked off a multi-week, 10-city tour of schools disrupted by the pandemic in eight battleground states, drawing a direct line from the empty classrooms to the administration’s failures combating Covid-19.During her tour of a Wilmington, Delaware, school, she spoke with teachers and administrators about doubts that in-person learning will actually resume anytime soon and the challenges -- including obtaining new small desks and protective equipment to make sure classrooms can handle social distancing -- if they do. She said feelings about heading back to school “have turned from excitement into anxiety, and the playgrounds are still.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-wades-into-racial-tensions-with-visit-to-kenosha/story-AJGuYv4XxtqlDAAhUBufUK.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageState media broadcast images of thousands of students hoisting the Chinese flag -- a daily routine at all public schools -- despite warnings to avoid mass gatherings.Schools have drawn up plans to switch back to online teaching should new outbreaks emerge, city officials said last week.Students were advised to wear masks to and from school and avoid public buses or trains if possible.Schools were also ordered to conduct drills and training sessions to help prepare for new outbreaks.Official figures show Wuhan accounted for 80 percent of China’s more than 4,600 coronavirus-related deaths and was under a strict lockdown for more than two months from late January. The city also conducted a mass testing campaign targeting ll million residents in May.China has now largely controlled the spread of the virus, and schools across the country -- which were closed in late January -- have gradually re-opened.Shanghai re-opened schools in May, and the capital city Beijing, which recently suffered from a local outbreak of the virus, said it will resume all schools including kindergartens in September.Beijing authorities require teachers and students to wear face masks on campus.China has not reported any new local transmissions of the coronavirus in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-ground-zero-for-coronavirus-epidemic-re-opens-all-schools/story-i8lD7Vh3hKPcCbS20Gy4mM.html
01-09-2020||World||I was disappointed, says Justin Trudeau on toppling of statue of Canada’s first prime minister||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tearing down of a statue of the country’s first PM Sir John A MacDonald in Montreal last week. At a media interaction in that city, Trudeau said he was disappointed and “actions such as that have no place in a society that abides by the rule of law.”His criticism of activists tearing down the statue of MacDonald came even as Francois Legault, Premier of the province of Quebec where Montreal is located, said the statue will be restored to its place in the park square. Trudeau was in the city on Monday and castigated those behind toppling the statue, as he said, “Choices like this, to rely on vandalism to advance causes, is not going to help anyone move forward the right way.”Protestors in Montreal supporting a movement to defund the police toppled and defaced the statue on Saturday. While no group took responsibility for the act at Place du Canada in Quebec’s largest city, there was a march in Montreal that afternoon featuring activists seeking defunding the police, and in support of Black Lives Matter and Indigenous peoples.According to a video of the incident, a cluster of people scaled the monument where the statue was prominently featured and then pulled it down using ropes after unbolting it from its pedestal. The statue was also decapitated and defaced with graffiti.According to the national broadcaster CBC, a leaflet found at the site read, in part: “Sir John A. Macdonald was a white supremacist who orchestrated the genocide of Indigenous peoples with the creation of the brutal residential schools system, as well as promoting other measures that attacked Indigenous peoples and traditions.”Statues of MacDonald have been attacked in various parts of the country in the past but this was the first time one was brought down. Canada witnessed demonstrations in several cities including Toronto, Calgary and Montreal on Saturday.The vandalism came in for criticism from leaders. Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante condemned the vandalism leading to the tearing down of the statue and said such acts “cannot be accepted nor tolerated.” She added, “I understand and share the motivation of citizens who want to live in a more just and inclusive society. The discussion and the actions that are required must be done in a peaceful manner, without ever resorting to vandalism.”The Premier of Quebec Francoise Legault described the act as “unacceptable” and added, “We must fight racism, but destroying parts of our history is not the solution.

It addresses key urgent issues such as restoring to India special trade benefits in the US in exchange for larger access for American companies to Indian dairy and medical devices sectors.The minister said the two sides could have “ideally” signed the deal during President Donald Trump’s India visit in February, but for some “dots and commas that needed to be finalized”.“We have actually sorted out most of the issues around this initial trade agreement,” Goyal said at a session of the annual summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership forum (USISPF), a trade body of companies from both countries.While negotiators grappled with the outstanding wrinkles, the two countries, as the rest of the world, shifted all their attention and resources to tackling he Covid-19 epidemic. “We lost valuable time during that period,” the minister said of the severe lockdown of the initial weeks in India.The two sides are now ready to wrap it up, the minister said, referring to a recent conversation with Lighthizer. The entire package is “near ready and can be finalized at anytime that the local political situation in the US permits them to”, he added.The US has is well and truly in election mode now. President Trump, who is seeking a second term, faces Joe Biden, the former vice-president and Democratic nominee for president. Also on the ballot on November 3, election day, are the entire House of Representatives, a third of the US senate and many state-wide positions.“We, on India’s part, believe that it has to be win-win for both countries,” Goyal said of the deal under discussion. The “architecture of the initial deal” that has been created is in the best interest of businesses in India and the US and it’s in the interest of both countries to “deepen our strategic partnership with this initial trade deal”.“It will open the doors to starting a dialogue on a larger bilateral engagement,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-ready-to-sign-trade-deal-says-us-to-take-final-call/story-qvLJeLOKVVWHWLajOBJQDI.html
01-09-2020||World||Senate Republicans may take up Covid-19 relief bill next week: White House||Senate Republicans are likely to take up their Covid-19 relief bill next week offering $500 billion in additional federal aid, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Tuesday, adding that the administration was still weighing help for US airlines.In an interview on CNBC, Meadows said he expected Senate Republicans’ legislation would be “more targeted” than House Democrats’ offer and could either be used as a building block or be passed on its own while negotiations continue.Congressional negotiations on further federal intervention amid the novel coronavirus pandemic remain at a standstill after the Democratic-led US House of Representatives passed its $3.4 trillion measure back in May.Republican President Donald Trump and his administration have said they could support a $1 trillion bill. Democrats offered to split the difference with a roughly $2 trillion compromise, but there has been little movement.Meadows told CNBC the administration “was nowhere close” to Democrats’ $2 trillion offer but added: “We’ll get there in the end.”It was unclear whether Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell planned to take up the bill next week. Republican Senator John Barrasso said a conference call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the White House was scheduled for later on Tuesday to discuss the matter. Asked about efforts to aid airlines, which have furloughed or laid off thousands of workers and curtailed flights as the outbreak had upended travel, Meadows said any aid “remains an open question” and that the administration is “looking closely at a number of executive actions.” Meadows said he and Mnuchin met with Trump late on Monday and that the president tasked them “to get as creative as we can within the confines of the law to put forth as much money as we can so we can keep this economy going.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-republicans-may-take-up-covid-19-relief-bill-next-week-white-house/story-WwuFBVrzWUy7dgecPAGLOO.html
01-09-2020||World||Lt Gen Bajwa will explain, says Imran Khan’s minister after corruption scandal hits home||China Pakistan Economic Corridor chairman Lt General (retd) Asim Saleem Bajwa, who has landed in the middle of a scandal over his family’s rise in assets that coincided with his elevation in the army, will come up with a detailed explanation of the family’s growth in assets, Pakistan’s information minister Shibli Faraz said late on Monday evening after the government’s initial response to brush aside the controversy appeared to be ineffective.A news website ‘Facts Focus’ last week traced the growth of the Bajwa family’s business empire in the United States and Pakistan and claimed that there was a correlation between the retired army officer’s clout and his family’s investments.The website’s investigation also revealed that the retired army officer’s wife had been a shareholder in all the family’s foreign businesses from the very beginning. It turns out that according to the assets declaration form that Gen Bajwa had filed with the government claimed his wife did not hold any foreign assets.By the time journalist Ahmad Noorani published the news report, the Bajwa family’s business empire is alleged to have included 99 companies (five were later shut down) in four countries including a pizza franchise with 133 restaurants worth an estimated $ 39.9 million.The website pegged the family’s combined investments to develop the business at $52.2 million. At current exchange rates, it comes to a whopping Pakistani Rs 8.6 billion (Indian Rs 3,848 million). The investments started pouring in after 2002 when Asim Bajwa got himself a prize posting in General Pervez Musharraf’s staff. His brother Nadeem Bajwa, who worked as a delivery driver, also started working his way up. By 2008, the family had opened 53 franchises. As the army officer moved up the hierarchy, so did the business.The website, which published documents to back up its findings, said it had reached out to Gen Bajwa, who is overseeing implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor - a project that runs into billions of dollars - but he chose not to respond to its findings.Gen Bajwa clearly adopted the same approach when the freshly-minted website published its report last week. He put out a 22-word rebuttal on his Twitter handle. “A malicious propaganda story published on an unknown site, against me and my family, (just uploaded on social media) is strongly rebutted,” he said.Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also chipped in. “It is now a common practice that the news is run without confirmation. A news should be made public once it is confirmed. The truth in this case will come to the fore soon,” Qureshi said on Friday, according to a report in the Dawn newspaper’s website.When the rebuttals didn’t help, information minister Shibli Faraz stepped in with a tweet. “I have just spoken to Asim Bajwa. He will explain in detail the news about his assets in a few days,” the minister announced.The corruption scandal has come as a huge embarrassment to Prime Minister Imran Khan who had appointed Gen Bajwa to oversee implementation of the CPEC project as well as the PM’s special assistant on media. Imran Khan routinely accuses opposition leaders of corruption. Like when opposition leaders did not allow two legislations to pass in the Pakistani Senate, PM Khan had gone hammer and tong to slam them, alleging that they wanted him to give them immunity for their corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corruption-scandal-singes-cpec-boss-lt-gen-asim-bajwa-pak-says-he-will-explain/story-CCUdNwPbMFkJD2cu8VkwuL.html
01-09-2020||World||Uber extends mask selfie verification feature to riders||Uber Technologies Inc on Tuesday said it will roll out a global selfie feature to verify its ride-hail customers wear a mask, modeled after a similar feature introduced for drivers in mid-May.Uber instituted its “No Mask No Ride” policy on May 18 and extended it indefinitely due to the ongoing pandemic, requiring both drivers and riders to wear a face covering at all times during a ride.Drivers are required to take a selfie with a mask each day before starting work, while drivers and riders are able to cancel a trip without penalty if they report the other party is not wearing a mask. Failure to comply can lead to account deactivation.The rider selfie feature will be rolled out in the United States and Canada by the end of September, and across Latin America and other regions after that, Uber said.Unlike for drivers, the rider app will only prompt a passenger to take a selfie if a driver previously reported they were not wearing a mask.“We definitely wanted to make sure that we are targeting this feature to riders who are maybe just coming back to the platform and maybe they’re not aware of ... our (mask) policy,” Sachin Kansal, Uber’s Senior Director of Product Management, said in an interview.Demand for ride-hailing trips has dropped sharply during the pandemic, especially in the United States, Uber’s largest market.Kansal said 99.5% of all Uber trips since mid-May had been completed without driver or rider complaints over masks.The selfie feature does not use facial recognition technology, but simply detects the mask as an object on the face, Kansal said. Uber stores selfie photos for 96 hours to settle potential disputes, but then permanently deletes them, a spokesman added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-extends-mask-selfie-verification-feature-to-riders/story-2CHb23CeS4gEuz08EFhfYL.html
01-09-2020||World||French paper, Charlie Hebdo, attacked in 2015 reprints Prophet caricatures||The French satirical paper whose staff was decimated in a violent attack by Islamic extremists in 2015 is reprinting caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed cited by the killers, declaring “history cannot be rewritten nor erased.” The announcement on Tuesday came on the eve of the first trial for the January 2015 attacks against Charlie Hebdo and, two days later, a kosher supermarket.The killings touched off a wave of violence claimed by the Islamic State group across Europe. Seventeen people died — 12 of them at the editorial offices — along with all three attackers.Thirteen men and a woman accused of providing the attackers with weapons and logistics go on trial Wednesday.In an editorial this week accompanying the caricatures, the paper best known for vulgar irreverence said that although it had declined to publish caricatures of Mohammed since the attacks, doing so for the opening of the trial was necessary.“The only reasons not to stem from political or journalistic cowardice,” the editorial said.As the attackers, brothers Chérif and Said Kouachi, walked away from the carnage, they cried out “We have avenged the Prophet.” Claiming the attacks in the name of al-Qaida, they then killed a wounded policeman point-blank and drove away.Two days later, a jailhouse acquaintance of theirs stormed a kosher supermarket on the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, killing four hostages and claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group. The Kouachi brothers had by then holed up in a printing office with another hostage. All three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids.The supermarket attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, also killed a young policewoman.The caricatures re-published this week were first printed in 2006 by the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten, setting off sometimes violent protests by Muslims who believe depicting Mohammed is blasphemy.Charlie Hebdo, which was then little-known outside France and regularly caricatures religious leaders from various faiths, republished them soon afterwards.The paper’s Paris offices were firebombed in 2011 and its editorial leadership placed under police protection, which remains in place to this day.Laurent Sourisseau, the paper’s director and one of the few staff to have survived the attack, named each of the victims in a foreword to this week’s edition.“Rare are those who, five years later, dare oppose the demands that are still so pressing from religions in general, and some in particular,” wrote Sourisseau, who is also known as Riss.Three of the accused, including the wife of one of the attackers, will not be at the trial because they are abroad and it’s not known if they’re alive or dead.Most of the 11 who will appear in court say they knew it was for a crime but claim they had no idea it was for mass killings.Among those inside the market was Lassana Bathily, an employee whose home village in Mali was just 20 kilometers from that of Coulibaly’s.Bathily hid a group of the store’s Jewish customers in a cold room and slipped out to warn police about the terror attack inside. Eleven days later, the unlikely hero was granted French citizenship. He is among nearly 200 plaintiffs at the trial.“We want to know what really happened even if the terrorists won’t be there. I hope that those who worked with them, helped them financially will be punished for what they did. That’s the only thing we expect,” Bathily said.“We want to know the truth because we don’t know anything, we’ve heard nothing for the past five years.” The world rallied behind France in the days after the killings.Leaders from around the world joined millions of people who poured into Paris’ enormous République plaza and other gathering spots in France bearing defiant signs that read “I am Charlie.” But the January 2015 attacks were seen as a colossal intelligence failure for France.At least one of the Kouachi brothers had traveled to Yemen to train with al-Qaida. Chérif Kouachi, the younger, acknowledged as much in an interview with a French television network during their final siege.Said Kouachi was under surveillance until mid-2014. In a 2008 interview with Le Monde newspaper, Coulibaly himself described prison, where he met Chérif Kouachi then awaiting trial on terrorism charges, as “the best crime school.” Their jailhouse mentor is among those scheduled to testify.Afterwards, the French government reorganized its intelligence structure, raised the national security budget and hired hundreds more investigators to monitor homegrown extremists.“The opening of this trial is the moment to remember that the fight against Islamist terrorism is a major priority of the government,” Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said Monday in a speech at the French intelligence headquarters. “We will fight relentlessly.” The trial will be filmed for posterity, a rarity in France reserved for proceedings of historical import.One of the three absent defendants is Hayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly’s wife who fled to Syria days ahead of the attacks. She took a starring role in one of Islamic State’s propaganda blitzes, urging French Muslims, men and women alike, to follow her path.French media reported that a woman who returned from Syria encountered Boumedienne last year at the enormous al-Hol camp for Islamic State families, living under an assumed name. Since then, the camp has seen numerous escapes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-paper-charlie-hebdo-attacked-in-2015-reprints-prophet-caricatures/story-Gg4KUpe4WFcS5JtlzxOHMM.html
01-09-2020||World||Canada abandons clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccine after China blocks shipment||Canada has been forced to abandon the first proposed clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine in the country after Beijing blocked the shipment from a Chinese company involved in the collaboration. The Canadian government has now turned to a couple of American drug companies, signing agreements for 114 million doses of potential candidates to combat the coronavirus pandemic.The Government had announced the partnership between the National Research Council of Canada or NRC and CanSino Biologics, headquartered in Tianjin, China, in May. However, the NRC has said that CanSino no longer had the authority to ship the vaccine for trials to Canada. Those trials were to be held at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which had also shared its research expertise with the Chinese firm.“Subsequent to signing, the Government of China introduced process changes regarding shipping vaccines to other countries,” the NRC said, in a statement.It also noted that the agreement had been reviewed by CanSino’s collaborators in the Chinese Government - the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Science and Technology. The vaccine is being tested on soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army, while it was scheduled to have had human trials in Halifax.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has now announced that the country has inked deals with two American companies, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson “to procure millions of doses of experimental Covid 19 vaccines.” It had recently also signed similar agreements with two other companies, Pfizer and Moderna.“With these additional agreements in place, Canada has now secured access to four of the leading vaccine candidates,” the Prime Minister’s office (PMO) said in a statement.Anita Anand, Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement, said, “We are taking an aggressive approach in procuring a portfolio of the most promising vaccine candidates in order to ensure that Canadians will have access to them as quickly as possible once they have been approved.”The CanSino agreement had come under criticism at the time when it was announced, as it came while two Canadians, including a former diplomat, were being held captive in China, in what Canadian officials described as “hostage diplomacy.” Several Canadians have also been sentenced to death in China after a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver where she is facing trial for fraud related to a bank in attempting to bypass sanctions on Iran. Even as that case proceeds in Canada, relations with Beijing have hit a new low over the past two years, making the collaboration agreement particularly surprising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-abandons-clinical-trials-of-covid-19-vaccine-after-china-blocks-shipment/story-WCrlERdTykWwudzD0RXjPN.html
01-09-2020||World||China in 70 years has not occupied an inch of foreign land: Beijing||Beijing on Tuesday again blamed India for the latest bout of tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, saying China has never occupied an inch of territory belonging to another country and New Delhi should take its concerns seriously and contribute to peace and tranquillity at the border.“Seventy-odd years since the founding of new China, China never provoked any war or conflict and never occupied an inch of other country’s territory. China border troops always strictly abide by the LAC and never crossed the line,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying.India on Monday said that it had pre-empted “provocative military movements” by China to change the status quo along the LAC on the southern bank of the Pangong Lake.Also Read: Satellite imagery shows PLA building heliport at tri-junction of India, Bhutan,ChinaThe Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops violated the consensus reached during military and diplomatic engagements and “carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo” on the night of August 29-30, Indian Army spokesperson Col Aman Anand said in a statement on Monday.“Indian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground,” he said.The Chinese military refuted the Indian Army statement on Monday evening, claiming that its troops had not crossed the LAC.Also Read: Forget disengagement, China opens new front along LACOn Tuesday, Hua reiterated the view.“The Indian side’s statement may be different from the Chinese but there is only one truth and fact,” she said.Responding to question on the differences in the two statements, she said: “Perhaps there are some communication issues. I think both sides should stick to facts and have goodwill in maintaining the overall bilateral relations and take concrete measures to jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity along the border.”Hua also referred to the Indian military’s strengthening of deployment along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. “We noticed that for some time in India there have been many media reports about increased military along the border. I think people of the two countries want to live peacefully together and such Indian media reports are not consistent with people’s aspirations,” she said.The spokesperson added that for some time China and India have held multilevel engagement and talks and made active efforts to peacefully resolve differences on the border and possibly disputes to safeguard peace and tranquillity along the border.“But on August 31st, the Indian troops broke earlier consensus reached at meetings and talks, and on the southern bank of Pangong Lake and near the Reqin mountain, Indian troops illegally crossed the line, open provocation causing renewed tensions.”The Indian troops, she alleged, violated China’s territorial sovereignty and the two sides’ agreements and consensus and undermined the peace and tranquillity. “It goes against the two sides’ efforts for some time to ease the situation. China expressed firm opposition and lodged solemn representations,” she said. “We asked the Indian side to immediately stop all provocations, pull back the trespassing personnel, stop actions that might complicate or escalate the situation.”She said China hopes the Indian side will take Beijing’s concerns seriously and make concrete contributions to peace and tranquillity and development of bilateral relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-70-years-has-not-occupied-an-inch-of-foreign-land-beijing/story-eVxbF0U7ZL8GZPVZmqt9xI.html
01-09-2020||World||President Xi’s call for bolstering defences in Tibet ‘misguided’ and ‘unrealistic’: Lobsang Sangay||Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for bolstering border defences in Tibet and “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism are “misguided” and “unrealistic”, the head of the Tibetan government-in-exile has said. Lobsang Sangay, the sikyong or president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, also expressed concern at China’s military build-up on the Tibetan plateau, and questioned Beijing’s “military expansionism and its intentions on the ‘five fingers’ as well as on the border regions of Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Uttarakhand”. Xi had given a call to promote the “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism and to build an “impregnable fortress” to maintain stability in Tibet while addressing China’s top leadership on Saturday at a forum on future governance in Tibet. Also Read: Sinicise Tibetan Buddhism, build fortress around Tibet, says Xi JinpingXi was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that the government and military leaders should “solidify border defences and ensure frontier security” as well as ensure “national security and enduring peace and stability” in Tibet, which shares a long border with India. Responding to Xi’s remarks about building “an impregnable fortress” in Tibet, Sangay said: “China has been quietly militarising the Tibetan plateau for over 60 years under the pretext of development and modernisation. For Tibet, this has only led to an influx of soldiers, Han (Chinese) settlers, and weapons. “For its neighbours, this militarisation of the Tibetan plateau has led to a military build-up on its borders, jeopardising the already contentious border regions as evidenced by the recent Galwan incident.” Sangay said that “to foster stability in Tibet, China must first address the genuine grievances of the Tibetan people and not to forget the 154 Tibetans who have set themselves on fire in protest against Chinese policies in Tibet”. He added that the increasing militarisation of Tibet is a “serious source of concern for the Tibetans as well as India and Asia’s security at large. Restoring the status of Tibet as a zone of peace with its historical demilitarised border with India is the only way of enduring peace in Asia.” Sangay, who heads the Central Tibetan Administration based in Dharamshala, HP, said: “The root cause of instability in Tibet is not the Tibetan people’s faith, but the repressive and failed policies of the Chinese government. The continuation of these hard-line policies and repression is only going to make matters worse. That’s why genuine autonomy based on the ‘middle way approach’ is the only viable solution.” He also refuted Xi’s call for “sinicising”. “China’s policy of sinicising Tibetan Buddhism is a misguided attempt at controlling the Tibetan people’s religious belief and the reincarnation system. China must draw on its past experiences and allow the Tibetan people to maintain its distinct faith and religious traditions,” he said. The remarks were a reference to increased efforts by Beijing to choose the next Dalai Lama. Chinese authorities have said they would reject any successor to the current Dalai Lama chosen outside China, and experts have contended that any Indian involvement in the issue could potentially affect bilateral relations. The Chinese president’s assertions and Sangay’s response came against the backdrop of the dragging India-China border standoff. Tensions flared again on Monday, when the Indian Army said it had thwarted China’s “provocative military movements” to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of the Pangong Lake. Some experts have suggested that the Indian government should play up the Tibet card as part of efforts to pressure the Chinese to complete the stalled disengagement and de-escalation process on the LAC. Sangay said Buddhism is more important than communism for Tibetans. “To force them to treat communism as more important than their faith is not only a violation of international religious freedom, but is also deeply misguided. Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism is never going to work. The last 60 years of Chinese rule in Tibet is a testament to that fact,” he added. The demolition of Larung Gar and Yarchen Gar, two of the largest Buddhist institutes in the world, by Chinese authorities was a “tragic example of Chinese atrocities on Tibetan Buddhism”, he said. Despite their suffering, the people in Tibet are “still strong and remain faithfully devoted to the Dalai Lama”, Sangay said. He also emphasised that, as envisioned by the Dalai Lama, Tibetans seek “genuine autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution”. He added, “Resumption of dialogue with...the Dalai Lama or his envoys remains the only foreseeable solution to resolve the Tibet issue.” The Central Symposium on Tibet Works was the Chinese Communist Party’s most important forum for Tibet policies. The two-day meeting was the first such gathering since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-xi-s-call-for-bolstering-defences-in-tibet-misguided-and-unrealistic-lobsang-sangay/story-eVvwGTUkzEvDWVTh5ooPBK.html

In his 50 years in politics, he made positive contributions to China-India relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday responding to a question from the state-run media on Mukherjee’s death.Referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in 2014 and his meeting with Mukherjee, who was the 13th Indian President, she said after the meeting the two countries had issued a joint statement on building closer partnership.“It is a heavy loss for China-India friendship and for India. We express deep condolences over his passing and extend sincere sympathies to the Indian government and his family,” she said.Mukherjee had visited China in 2016 and in a series of meetings with the Chinese leadership and the business community had sought greater market access in the world’s most populous country for Indian businesses.In a speech delivered in the southern trade and business hub of Guangzhou in Guangdong province, Mukherjee had said economic ties between the two countries had grown considerably from under $3 billion in 2000.By 2015-16, the bilateral trade had crossed $70 billion, he had said.“India believes there is great potential for economic and commercial cooperation among our two nations ... the stability of our relationship in recent years provides an enabling basis for utilising these opportunities and coming together,” Mukherjee had said in an indirect reference to the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two nations.While alluding to China’s repeated decision to block India’s inclusion in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a grouping of 48 nations, Mukherjee had said New Delhi had always supported Beijing’s inclusion in international organisations.India, he had said, believed that China’s presence must be there in multilateral organisations, as otherwise its huge population would be left unrepresented.“The basic cardinal principle of India’s foreign policy is to recognise divergences … we have never indulged in expanding the divergences but reducing the divergences and expanding the areas of agreement,” Mukherjee had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-president-pranab-mukherjee-s-death-heavy-loss-to-ties-says-china/story-oUYyasYjvSnfx4ugdmxDIL.html

01-09-2020||World||62,000 workers in Singapore yet to be tested for coronavirus||A total of 62,000 workers in Singapore, mostly foreigners employed in labour-intensive industries, have yet to be scheduled for their mandatory rostered routine testing for Covid-19 ahead of the screening deadline on Saturday, authorities warned on Tuesday.Those who fail to do so will not be able to return to work, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Building and Construction Authority (BCA), Economic Development Board (EDB) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) said in a joint press release.To date, about 1,500 employers have yet to log into HPB’s swab registration system to schedule their workers for their rostered routine testing. This is about 8 per cent of the total number of employers who have to do so, said the release.As part of the safeguards to ensure the safe restart of work, workers, many of them from India, staying in dormitories, workers in the construction, marine and process sectors and personnel who go into the work sites are required to undergo rostered routine testing every 14 days.Employers are reminded that these workers must have completed a swab test in the preceding 14 days and started their 14-day rostered routine testing cycle, reported Channel News Asia, citing the release.Workers who have not done so will have their AccessCode Status reflected as Red under the “Health Status” and will not be able to return to work, the press release stated.“We remind these employers to quickly schedule appointment slots for their workers to avoid disruption to their business operations. They can view the available test locations in the swab registration system when booking appointment dates.“This comprises 18 Regional Screening Centres across the island,” added the press release. Once workers have been scheduled under the swab registration system for the first time, they will be automatically assigned new dates for future rostered routine testing swabs.Employers should log in to the swab registration system regularly to check if there are new workers whom they need to schedule appointments for.The authorities said employers who behave irresponsibly and persistently fail to schedule workers for rostered routine testing may have their work pass privileges curtailed.BCA has taken action against a group of companies and their workers who have failed to undergo rostered routine testing for a prolonged period of time, despite multiple reminders to their employers.BCA said it has rescinded the approval to resume work for 1,148 workers thus far. These workers will be allowed to return to work once they have undergone their rostered routine testing.Meanwhile, Singapore reported 40 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including one in the community and seven imported infections.This brings the national total to 56,852.The single community infection is a foreign worker on work pass here, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily preliminary update. All seven imported cases had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, said MOH.The rest of the infections is among foreign workers.The seven imported cases reported on Monday had returned from India and Malaysia on Aug 17 and 19.With 72 cases discharged on Monday, 55,658 patients have fully recovered from the disease and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. A total of 78 patients remain in hospital, while 1,049 are recuperating in community facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/62-000-workers-in-singapore-yet-to-be-tested-for-coronavirus/story-utdVtygaXVmbMQ1mMh0wnI.html

But Beijing’s aggressive manoeuvres in Ladakh, the South China Sea and beyond - seen to have been prompted by a design to divert attention from domestic troubles - have cratered China’s relations with its neighbours and soured relations with its three important food suppliers - the United States, Canada and Australia.As it is, China’s ultra-nationalistic wolf warrior diplomacy and the aggressive military posture by People’s Liberation Army in Ladakh is a throw-back to 1962 when the then paramount leader Mao Zedong used the border skirmish with India to mask the failed Great Leap Foward movement that killed millions of Chinese of hunger.Xi Jinping’s renewed focus on the crash diet last month had immediately set off speculation that his government expects its food supply to get worse.China had seen it coming. Back in May, Premier Li Keqiang had promised to draw up a food security plan amid the coronavirus pandemic, assuring parliament that China could ensure food for its 1.4 billion people ‘through our own efforts’, reward higher yield of grains and promote the recovery of pig production.Agriculture minister Han Changfu had added that the African swine fever that led to the killing or culling of 100 million pigs was a threat but there won’t be a big increase in price of pork, a staple food for many families that makes China its world’s biggest consumer. Official statistics, however, indicate food prices went up by 13 per cent in July compared with a year ago and the price of pork, by about 85 per cent.The surge of crippling floods in the Yangtze River basin, the source of most of China’s rice, had affected production and transportation, disrupted lives of millions and left behind large swaths of farmland under water. The Qingyi river, an upper Yangtze tributary, saw its worst flooding in a century.Already, according to data from the China General Administration of Customs, China’s grain imports had risen by 22.7 per cent (to 74.51 million tonnes) in between January and July as compared to the same period last year. Wheat imports saw a 197 per cent year-on-year increase with import of 910,000 tonnes. During the month, corn imports also went up, year-on-year, by 23 per cent to 880,000 tonnes.To be sure, China and its state-funded institutes have denied that a shortage of domestic food was round the corner. China’s state media said the summer grain output had reached a record high of 142.8 billion kg this year.“There is no need to worry,” said a report released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on August 17. But the report cautioned, according to news agency AFP, that China’s “food shortfall” will increase in coming years unless major agricultural reforms are undertaken.China’s state media has linked Xi Jinping’s campaign to the global food crisis predicted by the United Nations, a warning that was repeated by the world body two months back when it asked governments to act swiftly to avoid disaster. The underlying theme of the narrative has been that for China, the real threat to food security comes from food wastage rather than epidemic or floods.China does waste an awful amount of food. Ordering or serving more food than is needed is seen as a measure of the host’s hospitality. The state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences estimated that 17 million to 18 million tons of food served in big cities in 2015 was wasted, enough to feed a country the size of South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-curious-link-behind-china-s-ladakh-moves-and-a-looming-food-crisis-analysis/story-sDciTiVr7Uj8ydGail5cRK.html
01-09-2020||World||‘Outsized demands to claim territory’: US official on China action in India||The US will push back against China’s aggressive actions, including its “outsized” territorial claims on the border with India, even as it eyes the possibility of formalising the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad as an alliance, a senior state department official has said. Deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said China has been “picking a fight right now on virtually every front” and has “exploited every opportunity they can from technology theft to assertion of national sovereignty over the territory and territorial waters of other countries”, and the US is in a “concerted effort to push back on all fronts”. “Our strategy is to push back against China in virtually every domain. We’re doing it in the security area. We’re doing it in terms of outsized demands to claim sovereign territory, whether it’s in the Galwan Valley of India on the India-Chinese border, or whether it’s in the South Pacific. We’re also doing it economically,” he said. Biegun made the remarks during a conversation with Richard Varma, former US envoy to India, at a leadership summit organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) late on Monday. Asked about China’s aggressive actions on the disputed border with India, in Hong Kong and across the Indo-Pacific, Biegun said the Donald Trump administration is focused on countering the “predatory practices from the Chinese economy” and is working to “balance out the US-China economic relationship”. China was welcomed into global institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) two decades ago in order to help the country transition to a more rules-based order, but this “experiment has failed across all the domains”, he said. He said that China “grew so quickly at the beginning of this century” that its “outsized influence in those institutions is instead seeking to transform those institutions to China’s interests”. This is unacceptable from the point of view of the US, which is pushing back in institutions such as the World Health Organization or World Intellectual Property Organization, he added. China is repressing the Tibetans and Uyghurs, has breached an agreement with the UK on the transition of Hong Kong, and is “near hostilities with the government of India” and “in a state of hostility with the people of Taiwan”, Biegun said. Replying to a question on the possibility of giving a formal shape to the Quad – an informal dialogue mechanism between Australia, India, Japan and the US – and whether the larger strategy behind it was counterbalancing the rise of China, Biegun said there was “certainly a temptation in governments” to formalise the mechanism. The Indo-Pacific, he noted, is lacking in “strong multilateral structures” such as NATO or the European Union. “The strongest institutions in Asia oftentimes are not inclusive enough, and so...there is certainly an invitation there at some point to formalise a structure like this,” he said. Biegun cautioned that responding to the threat of China itself would not be enough of a driver for such an organisation, and the goal of the US is to “create a critical mass around the shared values and interests...in a manner that attracts more countries in the Indo-Pacific...to be working in a common cause or even ultimately to align in a more structured manner”. He said Washington would keep its “ambitions checked to start with a very strong set of members”, and a formal alliance would only “happen if the other countries are as committed as the United States”. Biegun also noted that India had recognised that it “can’t be a passive player” in relation to developments in the Indo-Pacific region and this has driven the recent activities of the Quad, including a weekly meeting of the four members along with New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam on ways to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. He also said a ministerial meeting of the Quad is expected to be held “this fall in Delhi – that’s the intention anyway – in person”. He added, “I’d say this Quad concept has really helped India find a place in the larger Indo-Pacific theatre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outsized-demands-to-claim-territory-us-envoy-on-china-action-in-india/story-YYsjJ9wosbnEIF8o3DBhON.html

01-09-2020||World||US moots a formal structure for the Quad, like NATO and EU||The United States on Monday said it is open to “exploring” ways to formalise the Quad, as the group of Indo-Pacific powers it forms with India, Japan and Australia is called.Starting in 2017, the Quad has met once or twice a year at the level of officials and ministers — New Delhi is expected to host the next ministerial in the fall — but the group has lacked the kind of institutionalised organisation that supports something like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of the EU.“It is a reality that the Indo-Pacific region is actually lacking in strong multilateral structures,” Stephen Biegun, the US deputy secretary of state (he is the American counterpart of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla), said on the opening day of the annual summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a trade body of companies of the two countries.“They don’t have anything of the fortitude of NATO, or the European Union,” he added, referring to the most popular models being talked about for the formalised structure. “There is certainly an invitation there at some point to formalise a structure like this.”The top diplomat indicated a certain inevitability about the formalised structure that had not been known previously. It’s something that, he said, could happen in the “the second term of the Trump administration or, (if he doesn’t win) the first term of the next president”.A formalised, institutionalised structure, Biegun said, would meet the need for a “sustained regular communication between countries with those shared interests and values”.Biegun, who is not a career diplomat but a political appointee, displayed rare candour in identifying China as a unifying threat to the Quad but argued for a higher purpose: “I think responding to the threat of China in and of itself, or any potential challenge from China in and of itself, would be enough of a driver, though it also has to have a positive agenda”The Quad has been decades in the making. But it began meeting in its intended format and spirit with some kind of predictable regularity in 2017. Its meetings started small at first, at the level of officials. But quickly graduated to the ministerial level, with the first such meeting held on sidelines of the UN general assembly meetings in September 2018.While a summit-level meeting of the Quad hasn’t taken place yet, talk of a formalised structure has been gaining ground, starting with a core membership of the four, which could expand to include more — such as the Quad+3, addition of New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam, which emerged as a US-led group that held weekly consultations on Covid-19.“Remember even NATO started with relatively modest expectations and a number of countries chose neutrality over NATO membership in post-World War 2 Europe,” Biegun said, adding that the original NATO “only had 12 members, relative to its 27th today so you could start a little bit smaller and grow into your membership.”So long as the purpose is right and as long as “we keep the ambitions checked — to start with a very strong set of members,” he said, “I think it is worth exploring”.Although, he cautioned, “it only will happen if the other countries are as committed as the United States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-moots-a-formal-structure-for-the-quad-like-nato-and-eu/story-eH043B79BqUCdyH3fqgBpJ.html
01-09-2020||World||Portland protests: Oregon state police called as tensions escalate||State police and law enforcement from neighbouring suburbs were sent to Portland, Oregon, on Monday as tensions mounted following a fatal weekend shooting in the midst of clashes between supporters of President Donald Trump and counter-protesters.Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler on Sunday warned of an escalation of violence after seeing a flurry of social media posts vowing revenge for Saturday’s shooting victim, identified by the right-wing Patriot Prayer militia group as one of its supporters.Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, announced a plan on Sunday that she said would allow for peaceful protest while cracking down on lawlessness that has often accompanied demonstrations since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, the Black man who died under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis.“Every Oregonian has the right to freely express their views without fear of deadly violence. I will not allow Patriot Prayer and armed white supremacists to bring more bloodshed to our streets,” Brown said in a statement. In addition to temporarily sending in state police troopers and officers from neighboring jurisdictions, the FBI and federal prosecutors will add resources to prosecute criminal offenses stemming from protests, Brown said.Portland’s demonstrators, demanding reforms of police practices they view as racist and abusive, have frequently clashed with law enforcement and on occasion with counter-protesters associated with right-wing militia groups.Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested, including 29 accused of taking part in an unlawful assembly on Sunday night. Two of them were found with loaded handguns, while others were carrying knives and rocks, police said.The Trump administration in July deployed federal forces to Portland to protect a U.S. courthouse that has been the focus of violent protests and other federal property, drawing criticism that their presence only heightened the unrest. The federal agents were later withdrawn.STREET CLASHES AND DEADLY SHOOTINGTensions flared on Saturday night between a large caravan of demonstrators driving through the city in pickup trucks waving pro-Trump flags, and opposing protesters in the streets.Video on social media showed individuals in the trucks firing paint-balls and chemical irritants at opposing demonstrators as they rode by, while those on the street hurled objects at the trucks and tried to block them.Investigators have yet to say whether the fatal shooting grew out of those confrontations. Police identified the victim on Monday as Aaron J. Danielson, 39, of Portland, who died from a gunshot wound to the chest.Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson, speaking to local radio, described Danielson as a “very gentle, very courageous” person whom he had never seen become violent or even angry.“It doesn’t matter what you believe in politically ... if you knew him as a person, you would never hurt him,” Gibson said.Another associate, identified in a YouTube interview as Chandler Pappas, said he was with Danielson when they were confronted by assailants on the street. “They hunted us down. They recognized our Patriot Prayer hats,” Pappas said. Afterward, he recounted, “The shooter took off running.”Pappas said there was no precipitating incident.“The two of us alone, away from the rest of the Trump rally with all the trucks and all the other noise going on - I think they isolated us and they thought they could get away with it,” Pappas said, adding that neither he nor Danielson were armed.Luke Carrillo, a longtime friend and business partner, told reporters Danielson was a “proud American” but “was not a radical, not a racist, not a fascist.” And he called for all parties in Portland to “renounce any further acts of violence.”Trump has seized on civil disturbances in Portland and other cities to blame state and local Democratic leaders as he amps up his calls for law and order ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.“Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.Democrats have countered that Trump is stoking violence and racial strife with divisive rhetoric that has emboldened right-wing activists.“This president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country,” Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said during a visit to Pittsburgh. “He can’t stop the violence - because for years he has fomented it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portland-protests-oregon-state-police-called-as-tensions-escalate/story-QYKx5tgo6mIZiwKvYmDVeN.html

01-09-2020||World||‘Donald Trump a toxic presence in our nation for 4 years’: Joe Biden||Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, on Monday called president Donald Trump a “toxic presence” who has exploited violence linked to anti-racism riots as a “political lifeline” to save his campaign for a second term doomed by his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic.Biden attacked Trump’s central re-election thesis that the Democratic challenger supports the violent protests, benefits from it and will unleash more of it on the country if elected. And the president had already caused the chaos he was seeking to warn of, Biden said, adding, in fact he was stoking it for political mileage.“Donald Trump has been a toxic presence in our nation for four years,” Biden said in a speech in Pittsburg, in battleground state Pennsylvania. “Poisoning how we talk to one another. Poisoning how we treat one another. Poisoning the values this nation has always held dear. Poisoning to our democracy.”He added, as a rhetorical follow-up question: “Will we rid ourselves of this toxin? Or will we make it a permanent part of our national character?”Biden also sought to clarify his own stand on the protests, which Trump and his surrogates have sought to wrongly characterise as sympathetic to “thugs” and the “radical left”. “I want to be clear about this: Rioting is not protesting,” he said. “Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting.”“None of this is protesting – it’s lawlessness – plain and simple,” he added.The Democrat has led the Republican president in all polls in recent months, although by a narrowing margin in recent days.He faces an aggressive push-back from Trump and his allies in the final stretch of the polls, the last two months till November 3. They have sought to portray Biden as weak on law and order and a puppet of the radical left wingers of the Democratic party that have been most visible in recent months marching in anti-racism protests all over the country, confronting police and, at times pushing lines of orderly conduct.Biden sought to punch holes in that narrative in the speech. He argued that Trump should take responsibility for the protests and the violence as they took place on his watch as president, instead of passing them off as warnings of a dystopian future under the presidency of his Democratic challenger.“Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline,” Biden said.Trump sought to hit back later, calling Biden’s speech “strange”. And he attacked Biden for not mentioning “the far left” and that “what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word “Antifa”, short for anti-fascists, an extreme left wing comprising white and colored activists opposed, among other things, to white nationalists.Trump went on to, in fact, defend a 17-year-old white nationalist who shot dead two protesters in Kenosha, in the unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, by a white police officer. The shooter was “trying to get away from” protesters chasing him, he said, echoing the shooter’s defense attorneys. “I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have probably been killed,” said Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-a-toxic-presence-in-our-nation-for-4-years-joe-biden/story-0Ko4XwEv5DeDrTIBnjtAqM.html
01-09-2020||World||Hong Kong begins mass-testing for Covid-19 amid public doubts||Hong Kong began a voluntary mass-testing program for coronavirus Tuesday as part of a strategy to break the chain of transmission in the city’s third outbreak of the disease.The virus-testing program has become a flash point of political debate in Hong Kong, with many distrustful over resources and staff being provided by the China’s central government and fears that the residents’ DNA could be collected during the exercise.The Hong Kong government has dismissed such concerns, saying that no personal data will be attached to the specimen bottles and that samples will be destroyed in Hong Kong after the exercise.The testing program began at 8 a.m. with residents heading to more than 100 testing centers staffed by over 5,000 volunteers.More than 500,000 people in the city of 7.5 million signed up in advance for the program, which will last at least a week. It is aimed at identifying silent carriers of the virus — those without symptoms — who could be spreading the disease.The government expects 5 million people will take part in the program, which could be extended to two weeks depending on demand.Hong Kong’s worst outbreak in early July was blamed in part on an exemption from quarantine requirements for airline staff, truck drivers from mainland China and sailors on cargo ships.At its peak, Hong Kong recorded more than 100 locally transmitted cases a day, after going weeks without any in June.The outbreak has slowed, with the city reporting just nine cases on Monday, the first time in two weeks that daily infections had fallen to single digits. However, the government and some experts say that community testing can help detect asymptomatic carriers to further stop the spread of the virus.Respiratory medicine expert professor David Hui that even though infections have dwindled, the proportion of cases with untraceable sources of infection remain between 30% and 40%.“That means there must be some silent transmission going on, so community testing has some role in picking up these silent transmitters,” said Hui, who is a public health adviser to the city’s government. “Hopefully if we can identify these people and isolate them for a period of time that may help to break the transmission chain in the community.”The program is more effective if most of the population takes part, Hui said.“If only 1 or 2 million people take part, then we may not be able to achieve that objective,” he said.Other experts, such as Dr. Leung Chi-chiu, a respiratory specialist and a member of the Medical Council of Hong Kong, said that the testing program plays only a supplementary role in controlling the pandemic in the city, due to the long and variable incubation period of the coronavirus.Leung said that mass-testing may not be the most cost-effective method, as it is not easy to pick up the disease in its early development, especially if a person is not having symptoms or have not had recent exposure to an infected patient.Even if mass-testing could identify infected patients, they may already be past the infectious stage, he said.Leung said that large-scale testing will not be able to replace traditional methods of social distancing and contact tracing measures, and should only be used as a complementary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-begins-mass-testing-for-covid-19-amid-public-doubts/story-qR8PxVPnxLlYn1C3q6nRFN.html

In addition to the US trial, a final-stage test of the inoculation is underway in the UK and could yield preliminary results as soon as next month. Other companies that have Covid-19 vaccines in phase 3 trials include Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The trial had been delayed for several days, according to researchers from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health who are helping conduct the tests. The university is one of the sites where the trial is being run, and plans to begin injecting healthy volunteers on Tuesday, according to William Hartman, a UW Health anesthesiologist and investigator on the trial. It plans to ramp up to injecting 50 people a day shortly after the Sept. 7 Labor Day holiday, he said in an interview.An Aug. 27 article in the Palm Beach Post reported that the US trial of AstraZeneca vaccine has been put on hold due to political pressure, perhaps because US regulators planned to grant an emergency use authorization on the basis of the trial in Europe.Hartman said he was told the hold was due to unspecified operational issues.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “There was a hold on enrollment. We don’t really know what the reason for that was. We were told it had nothing to do with safety and didn’t have anything to do with an EUA, it was just an operational issue,” Hartman said in a phone interview. “On Friday evening, they lifted that hold.”An email shared with Bloomberg that Hartman received on Aug. 28 from AstraZeneca and contract research organization Iqvia Holdings Inc. stated the hold “was lifted and we have our first patient screened and randomized.”Americans should understand that “there are no corners that have been cut,” said Hartman, in a phone interview. “We are going to proceed with the trial independent of any political pressure.”People in the trial will get either the experimental vaccine or a placebo made of saline.In a separate statement, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot nodded at concerns that review of a vaccine could face political pressure.“In recent weeks we have seen an increasing number of questions around the safety and availability of vaccines to fight this terrible Covid-19 pandemic and I want to reiterate my commitment that we are putting science and the interest of society at the heart of our work,” Soriot said. “We are moving quickly but without cutting corners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-starts-us-final-stage-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-QbbqQuoY8UmszkUS6dR8iL.html
01-09-2020||World||Macron reaches Lebanon after new PM named under French pressure||France’s President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beirut hours after Lebanese leaders named diplomat Mustapha Adib as the new prime minister on Monday under French pressure, and will press for reforms aimed at dragging the Middle East nation out of a financial abyss.With its economy devastated by a financial crisis, a swathe of Beirut in tatters following a huge port explosion on Aug. 4, and sectarian tensions rising, Lebanon is facing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war.Macron was met at the airport by President Michel Aoun in the French leader’s second visit in less than a month. “So President, it’s been a busy day, hasn’t it,” Macron told Aoun.He also addressed the Lebanese people in an Arabic-language tweet, saying he had returned as promised to “work together to create necessary conditions for reconstruction and stability”.Macron will push politicians to enact reforms that donors have demanded to tackle corruption and waste before they will release financial support.Senior Lebanese officials said Macron’s mediation was essential in securing agreement on a new prime minister in the 48 hours before consensus emerged on Adib, the former ambassador to Germany. Politicians had been deadlocked last week.“The opportunity for our country is small and the mission I have accepted is based on all the political forces acknowledging that,” said Adib, who won the support of nearly all Lebanon’s main parties in consultations hosted by Aoun.“There is no time for talk and promises ... It’s the time to work with everyone’s cooperation,” he said.He called for the formation of a government of competent specialists in record time, an immediate start to reforms and a deal with the International Monetary Fund. Lebanon’s talks with the IMF on vital support have been stalled since July.Forming governments has often taken months in the past.“We welcome the nomination of a new prime minister and hope that a new government will be formed shortly with a mandate to implement the policies and reforms that Lebanon needs to address the current crisis and restore sustainable growth,” an IMF spokesperson told Reuters.Adib, who has a doctorate in law and political science, later visited areas hardest hit by the port explosion that killed some 190 people and injured 6,500.“Our children died. We don’t recognise you,” a passerby shouted at him as he inspected the shattered neighbourhoods. Another offered to shake hands with Adib, who wore a facemask as Lebanon battles COVID-19.The explosion, caused by what authorities say were 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, led to the resignation of the previous government, now acting as caretaker.UNDER PRESSURESince October, the crisis has sunk Lebanon’s currency, locked savers out of deposits held by a paralysed banking system and fuelled poverty and unemployment. The root cause is decades of corruption and waste overseen by a political elite.Macron’s visit coincides with Lebanon’s centenary, at a time of profound doubts that it has a future as a viable state under the sway of former warlords and sectarian leaders loyal to different regional masters, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Macron made a series of phone calls to Lebanese leaders at the weekend that were vital to securing consensus on Adib.“It was the pressure of his calls to everyone, the pressure of his coming to Lebanon, the pressure of everyone not wanting to upset him,” a senior Lebanese politician said.A French presidency source said Macron was demanding “a government of mission, clean, efficient, able to implement the necessary reforms in Lebanon”.Macron told journalists on Friday that the exceptional moment facing Lebanon led him to increase pressure.“France has convinced its European and American partners and a good part of the regional partners that we are honest brokers,” he said.Adib’s name surfaced on Sunday when he was nominated by former prime ministers, including Saad al-Hariri who heads the biggest Sunni Muslim party. Under the Lebanese system, the post of premier must go to a Sunni.Hariri’s Future Movement and the powerful Iranian-backed Shi’ite party Hezbollah were among those nominating him.With Hariri’s backing, Adib will enjoy more support than Hassan Diab’s outgoing government, nominated by Hezbollah and its allies which together have a parliamentary majority.Lebanon won pledges of more than $11 billion in support at a Paris conference in 2018 conditional on reforms it failed to carry out.

01-09-2020||World||US President Trump, Joe Biden clash over violence at anti-racism protests||As violence at anti-racism protests continued through the weekend, Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, challenged President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term on a law-and-order plank, to condemn violence of “every kind” as he has himself.President Trump has been quick to condemn violence at anti-racism protests, blaming it on “thugs”, “anarchists, agitators, and criminals”, and left wing radicals, whom he has tried to tie to Biden. He has been slow, however, to criticize killings by white police officers and white supremacists.Biden, on the other hand, has been under mounting pressure to condemn violence accompanying the protests and dissociate himself from left wing activists involved in some of them.“I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right,” Biden wrote in a tweet on Sunday, adding, “. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.”Without addressing Biden’s challenge, Trump tweeted hours later. “When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists, Thugs & Agitators in ANTIFA (anti-fascists)?”Trump broke his silence on the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man by white police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin days after saying late last week, “It was not a good sight”. He was referring to a video of the incident. But he has not condemned the shooting of two protestors by a white supremacist in the same city who reportedly self-identified himself as a Trump-supporter.President Trump continued to pressure Democrats, who control Kenosha in Wisconsin and Portland in Oregon, the two cities in the grip of the ongoing unrest. He called Portland “a mess” and its Democrat mayor a “joke”. About Kenosha, he said the city would have ceased to be if had not insisted on sending federal troops there. One man was killed in Portland on Saturday as a caravan of Trump supporters rolled through the city, getting into heated exchanges with protestors. Leader of a right-wing group Patriot Prayer identified the man as Jay Bishop and a “good friend”. Police have provided no details of the shooting. “Rest in Pace Jay,” Trump tweeted on Sunday.Also on Sunday, one police officer was killed and another was wounded by an armed gunman in St Louis, Missouri. The incident was not related to the protests and authorities have said the suspected person has a long list of criminal charges and involvements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-joe-biden-clash-over-violence-at-anti-racism-protests/story-4QecwA1DlMN1Ua3bac5ftK.html
01-09-2020||World||In China’s Xinjiang, forced medication accompanies lockdown||When police arrested the middle-aged Uighur woman at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak, she was crammed into a cell with dozens of other women in a detention center.There, she said, she was forced to drink a medicine that made her feel weak and nauseous, guards watching as she gulped. She and the others also had to strip naked once a week and cover their faces as guards hosed them and their cells down with disinfectant “like firemen,” she said.“It was scalding,” recounted the woman by phone from Xinjiang, declining to be named out of fear of retribution. “My hands were ruined, my skin was peeling.”The government in China’s far northwest Xinjiang region is resorting to draconian measures to combat the coronavirus, including physically locking residents in homes, imposing quarantines of more than 40 days and arresting those who do not comply. Furthermore, in what experts call a breach of medical ethics, some residents are being coerced into swallowing traditional Chinese medicine, according to government notices, social media posts and interviews with three people in quarantine in Xinjiang. There is a lack of rigorous clinical data showing traditional Chinese medicine works against the virus, and one of the herbal remedies used in Xinjiang, Qingfei Paidu, includes ingredients banned in Germany, Switzerland, the U.S. and other countries for high levels of toxins and carcinogens.The latest grueling lockdown, now in its 45th day, comes in response to 826 cases reported in Xinjiang since mid-July, China’s largest caseload since the initial outbreak. But the Xinjiang lockdown is especially striking because of its severity, and because there hasn’t been a single new case of local transmission in over a week.Harsh lockdowns have been imposed elsewhere in China, most notably in Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected. But though Wuhan grappled with over 50,000 cases and Hubei with 68,000 in all, many more than in Xinjiang, residents there weren’t forced to take traditional medicine and were generally allowed outdoors within their compounds for exercise or grocery deliveries.The response to an outbreak of more than 300 cases in Beijing in early June was milder still, with a few select neighborhoods locked down for a few weeks. In contrast, more than half of Xinjiang’s 25 million people are under a lockdown that extends hundreds of miles from the center of the outbreak in the capital, Urumqi, according to an AP review of government notices and state media reports.Even as Wuhan and the rest of China has mostly returned to ordinary life, Xinjiang’s lockdown is backed by a vast surveillance apparatus that has turned the region into a digital police state. Over the past three years, Xinjiang authorities have swept a million or more Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities into various forms of detention, including extrajudicial internment camps, under a widespread security crackdown.After being detained for over a month, the Uighur woman was released and locked into her home. Conditions are now better, she told the AP, but she is still under lockdown, despite regular tests showing she is free of the virus.Once a day, she says, community workers force traditional medicine in white unmarked bottles on her, saying she’ll be detained if she doesn’t drink them. The AP saw photos of the bottles, which match those in images from another Xinjiang resident and others circulating on Chinese social media.Authorities say the measures taken are for the well-being of all residents, though they haven’t commented on why they are harsher than those taken elsewhere. The Chinese government has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, at times clashing violently with many of the region’s native Uighurs, who resent Beijing’s heavy-handed rule.“The Xinjiang Autonomous Region upheld the principle of people and life first….and guaranteed the safety and health of local people of all ethnic groups,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing Friday.Xinjiang authorities can carry out the harsh measures, experts say, because of its lavishly funded security apparatus, which by some estimates deploys the most police per capita of anywhere on the planet.“Xinjiang is a police state, so it’s basically martial law,” says Darren Byler, a researcher on the Uighurs at the University of Colorado. “They think Uighurs can’t really police themselves, they have to be forced to comply in order for a quarantine to be effective.”Not all the recent outbreak measures in Xinjiang are targeted at the Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities. Some are being enforced on China’s majority Han residents in Xinjiang as well, though they are generally spared the extrajudicial detention used against minorities. This month, thousands of Xinjiang residents took to social media to complain about what they called excessive measures against the virus in posts that are often censored, some with images of residents handcuffed to railings and front doors sealed with metal bars.One Han Chinese woman with the last name of Wang posted photos of herself drinking traditional Chinese medicine in front of a medical worker in full protective gear.“Why are you forcing us to drink medicine when we’re not sick!” she asked in a Aug. 18 post that was swiftly deleted. “Who will take responsibility if there’s problems after drinking so much medicine? Why don’t we even have the right to protect our own health?”A few days later she simply wrote: “I’ve lost all hope. I cry when I think about it.”After the heavy criticism, the authorities eased some restrictions last week, now allowing some residents to walk in their compounds, and a limited few to leave the region after a bureaucratic approval process.Wang did not respond to a request for interviews. But her account is in line with many others posted on social media, as well as those interviewed by the AP.One Han businessman working between Urumqi and Beijing told the AP he was put in quarantine in mid-July. Despite having taken coronavirus tests five times and testing negative each time, he said, the authorities still haven’t let him out – not for so much as a walk. When he’s complained about his condition online, he said, he’s had his posts deleted and been told to stay silent.“The most terrible thing is silence,” he wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo in mid-August. “After a long silence, you will fall into the abyss of hopelessness.”“I’ve been in this room for so long, I don’t remember how long. I just want to forget,” he wrote again, days later. “I’m writing out my feelings to reassure myself I still exist. I fear I’ll be forgotten by the world.”“I’m falling apart,” he told the AP more recently, declining to be named out of fear of retribution.He, too, is being forced to take Chinese traditional medicine, he said, including liquid from the same unmarked white bottles as the Uighur woman. He is also forced to take Lianhua Qingwen, a herbal remedy seized regularly by U.S. Customs and Border patrol for violating FDA laws by falsely claiming to be effective against COVID-19.Since the start of the outbreak, the Chinese government has pushed traditional medicine on its population. The remedies are touted by President Xi Jinping, China’s nationalist, authoritarian leader, who has advocated a revival of traditional Chinese culture. Although some state-backed doctors say they have conducted trials showing the medicine works against the virus, no rigorous clinical data supporting that claim has been published in international scientific journals.“None of these medicines have been scientifically proven to be effective and safe,” said Fang Shimin, a former biochemist and writer known for his investigations of scientific fraud in China who now lives in the United States. “It’s unethical to force people, sick or healthy, to take unproven medicines.”When the virus first started spreading, thousands flooded pharmacies in Hubei province searching for traditional remedies after state media promoted their effectiveness against the virus. Packs of pills were tucked into care packages sent to Chinese workers and students overseas, some emblazoned with the Chinese flag, others reading: “The motherland will forever firmly back you up”.But the new measures in Xinjiang forcing some residents to take the medicine is unprecedented, experts say. The government says that the participation rate in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in the region has “reached 100%”, according to a state media report. When asked about resident complaints that they were being forced to take Chinese medicine, one local official said it was being done “according to expert opinion.”“We’re helping resolve the problems of ordinary people,” said Liu Haijiang, the head of Dabancheng district in Urumqi, “like getting their children to school, delivering them medicine or getting them a doctor.”With Xi’s ascent, critics of Chinese traditional medicine have fallen silent. In April, an influential Hubei doctor, Yu Xiangdong, was removed from a hospital management position for questioning the efficacy of the remedies, an acquittance confirmed. A government notice online said Yu “openly published inappropriate remarks slandering the nation’s epidemic prevention policy and traditional Chinese medicine.”In March, the World Health Organization removed guidance on its site saying that herbal remedies were not effective against the virus and could be harmful, saying it was “too broad”. And in May, the Beijing city government announced a draft law that would criminalize speech “defaming or slandering” traditional Chinese medicine. Now, the government is pushing traditional Chinese remedies as a treatment for COVID-19 overseas, sending pills and specialists to countries such as Iran, Italy, and the Philippines.Other leaders have also spearheaded unproven and potentially risky remedies – notably U.S. President Donald Trump, who stumped for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which can cause heart rhythm problems, despite no evidence that it’s effective against COVID-19. But China appears to be the first to force citizens — at least in Xinjiang — to take them.The Chinese government’s push for traditional medicine, given free to Xinjiang residents, is bolstering the fortunes of billionaires and padding state coffers. The family of Wu Yiling, the founder of the company that makes Lianhua Qingwen, has seen the value of their stake more than double in the past six months, netting them over a billion dollars. Also profiting: the Guangdong government, which owns a stake in Wu’s company.“It’s a huge waste of money, these companies are making millions,” said a public health expert who works closely with the Chinese government, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. “But then again – why not take it? There’s a placebo effect, it’s not that harmful. Why bother? There’s no point in fighting on this.”Measures vary widely by city and neighborhood, and not all residents are taking the medication. The Uighur woman says that despite the threats against her, she’s flushing the liquid and pills down the toilet. A Han man whose parents are in Xinjiang told the AP that for them, the remedies are voluntary.Though the measures are “extreme,” he says, they’re understandable.“There’s no other way if the government wants to control this epidemic,” he said, declining to be named to avoid retribution. “We don’t want our outbreak to become like Europe or America.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-s-xinjiang-forced-medication-accompanies-lockdown/story-CAlKvq0oEVFFFI8BuXYDjM.html

The monsoon season that began around June in South Asia ends in September.In the western Indian state of Gujarat, 14 people have died in the last two days in various incidents related to heavy rains and flooding, said officials at the State Emergency Response Centre.Rains in Gujarat are 20% higher than the long-period average, according to the local government. The state’s desert area of Kutch received rainfall that was 2.5 times higher than the average.More heavy to very heavy rains are expected in several parts of the state over the next two days, according to the India Meteorological Department.In Odisha state to the east, floods have killed at least 17 people in the past week, displaced thousands and affected more than half a million people, officials said.Hundreds have died in the northeastern state of Assam and neighbouring Bangladesh this monsoon.(This story corrects paragraph 5 to say Gujarat has received 20%, not 10%, more rains, and Kutch has seen 2.5 times more, not 3-1/2 times)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/landslide-floods-from-monsoon-rains-kill-at-least-41-in-india-nepal/story-uIaE7d2oo6eAonLUprte9J.html
01-09-2020||World||Our strategy is to push back against China in every domain: Top US official||Asserting that Beijing has been picking up fights right now virtually on every front of its interest, a top American diplomat on Monday said the United States’ strategy to counter it is to push back against China in every domain.“Our strategy is to push back against China in virtually every domain. We’re doing it in the security area. We’re doing it in terms of outsized demands to claim sovereign territory, whether it’s in the Galwan Valley of India on the India-Chinese border, or in the South Pacific,” Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said during third India US Leadership Summit.The summit was organised by US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF).The Trump Administration is also doing it economically, he said.“The president has led the charge against the predatory practices from the Chinese economy and the Phase One trade deal is just a first step in that (direction), to be followed by many others in the years ahead to equalize and balance the US-China economic relationship,” he said, during a conversation with Richard Verma, former US Ambassador to India.Underpinning all of that is a demand for basic reciprocity, he said. “For a very long time, there had been a desire to extend to China special privileges and benefits, and even the benefit of the doubt among them, to bring China into a more modern and prosperous future,” he noted. “Twenty years ago when that initiative was launched in earnest with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, the bet by most policymakers was that eventually, the weight of the institutions that China was joining would slowly redirect the Chinese political system and Chinese interests to a point where China would become much more invested in a rules-based order...,” Biegun said.He added that these rule based-orders would at least moderate the tendencies of the Chinese government to make it a better partner for many around the world, even if they do not make China a true democracy.“Unfortunately, this (US) administration has reached the conclusion that the experiment has failed across all the domains that I mentioned and we’re pushing back against China,” Biegun said. Instead of finding some reasonable balance and shared interests, the US has found that the Chinese have exploited every opportunity that they can -- from technology theft to assertion of national sovereignty over the territory and territorial waters of other countries, he said. “The United States is in a concerted effort to push back on all fronts,” he added. “But perhaps the biggest failed assumption was that the institutions that China joined would ultimately change China. What the US has found that China grew so quickly at the beginning of this century that its outsized influence in those institutions is seeking instead to transform those institutions to China’s interests,” said Biegun. “That’s unacceptable from our point of view and we are pushing back in the institutions like the World Health Organization or like the World Intellectual Property Organization. “We are pushing back hard to ensure that organizations either adhere to their core principles or we make clear we are not going to be a party to those efforts. There is a lot of concern about China, but there is an all-of-government effort here to turn it back,” the diplomat said. According to Biegun, there is real concern inside Beijing as to what they are confronting. “Internally, China is simultaneously trying to erase Tibetan cultural identity; they are repressing hundreds of thousands, if not more than a million, Uyghur Muslims and trying to separate these people from their faith and their historical tradition,” he said. The Chinese government has breached the UK-China agreement on the transition of Hong Kong and asserted direct state control from Beijing that has completely abolished the “one China, two systems” commitment that Beijing made to the UK and to the Hong Kong people to uphold through 2049, he alleged.But beyond the internal challenges, China is also facing deep strategic and economic tensions with the United States of America, as the US seeks to push back against these various areas of concern, Biegun said.Pointing out Beijing’s attitude of multilateral confrontation with various countries across the globe at the same time, Biegun said it is in “near hostilities with” India, in a “state of hostility” with Taiwan, “in competition and less than cooperative relationship with Japan” with a “deep, steep deterioration of their relationship with Australia and to some extent with New Zealand”. “They have been in a contentious battle of words and more with many of US partners in Europe over Covid-19 disinformation and several other Chinese behaviours are deeply disturbing to our European partners. “From China’s perspective, whatever they’re doing can’t possibly be seen as working as they’re picking a fight right now on virtually every front and on every area of interest that the People’s Republic of China has,” Biegun said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-strategy-is-to-push-back-against-china-in-every-domain-top-us-official/story-oOXVz2TiOSdviUJumSjHRL.html
01-09-2020||India||Assam records 50% jump in drug-related cases in two months: DGP||Assam has recorded a nearly 50% jump in cases related to illegal drugs in the past two months, director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta informed on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference on the day of rejoining duty after recovering from Covid-19, Mahanta stated that the sharp rise in cases showed police pro-activeness in detecting those cases. “The drive against illicit trafficking of drugs has picked up since June 26, when International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is marked. The rise in numbers indicates police seriousness in dealing with these kinds of cases,” the DGP said. Between June 26 and August 30, the number of drug-related cases has gone up by 49.6%. Similarly, there has been a jump of 46.13% in the number of people arrested during that period, Mahanta said. While 401 cases were registered and 694 people arrested between January 1 to June 25, 200 cases were registered and 338 people arrested between June 26 and August 30. According to a police release, this year till August 30, the Assam Police have recovered 9.27 kg of heroin, over 3,000 kg of ‘ganja’, 8.62 kg of opium, 51,347 bottles of cough syrup and over 6.38 lakh illicit tablets. The recovery of heroin, ‘ganja’ and psychotropic substance tablets have gone up by 53.6%, 60.04% and 274% respectively, the release said. “The sustained drive has weakened the network of drug traffickers. We are also probing links of international drug rackets involved in the trade and also how they are linked to trade in illegal arms as well,” Mahanta said. The DGP said that since some cases couldn’t lead to convictions in the past due to procedural lapses, training has been imparted to police officials through webinars on how to handle drug-related cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-records-50-jump-in-drug-related-cases-in-two-months-dgp/story-Uee4EDmMS6nh2j4oKTDMeK.html
01-09-2020||India||Maoist leader may surrender in T’gana||Hyderabad/Raipur: Top Maoist commander Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathi, 72, who led the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) for over one-and-a-half decades, offered to surrender to the Telangana police, officials in the state intelligence department said on Tuesday. According to the officials, Ganapathi conveyed the message to the police through some Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders. The surrender is likely to materialise in a couple of days. The Maoist commander carries a reward of ₹1.50 crore on his head. Telangana police department confirmed the report that Ganapathi was willing to surrender. “We have reliable information that along with Ganapathi, his close associate Mallojula Venugopal Rao is also contemplating surrendering to the government. We welcome, even if any other Maoist leaders join them to surrender,” a statement from the police department said. Mallojula Venugopal Rao, also known by other names like Bhupathi, Sonu and Abhay, is a member of the politburo of CPI (Maoist) and Central Military Commission. Stating that the Maoist leaders willing to surrender could approach the police through their relatives or well-wishers, the department said the police would extend all cooperation to them as was given to other Maoist party central committee members like Jampanna and Sudhakar in the past. The officials quoted above said Ganapathi decided to surrender owing to ill-health and that he was suffering from asthma, diabetes and also severe joint pains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-leader-may-surrender-in-t-gana/story-zOiiApDkVpgzBIQDE2cCkL.html
01-09-2020||India||Sangay slams China Border defence policy||New Delhi Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for bolstering border defences in Tibet and “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism are “misguided” and “unrealistic”, the head of the Tibetan government-in-exile has said. Lobsang Sangay, the sikyong or president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, also expressed concern at China’s military build-up on the Tibetan plateau, and questioned Beijing’s “military expansionism and its intentions on the ‘five fingers’ as well as on the border regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand”. Xi had given a call to promote the “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism and to build an “impregnable fortress” to maintain stability in Tibet while addressing China’s top leadership on Saturday at a forum on future governance in Tibet. Xi was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that the government and military leaders should “solidify border defences and ensure frontier security” as well as ensure “national security and enduring peace and stability” in Tibet, which shares a long border with India. Responding to Xi’s remarks about building “an impregnable fortress” in Tibet, Sangay said: “China has been quietly militarising the Tibetan plateau for over 60 years under the pretext of development and modernisation. For Tibet, this has only led to an influx of soldiers, Han settlers, and weapons. “For its neighbours, this militarisation of the Tibetan plateau has led to a military build-up on its borders, jeopardising the already contentious border regions as evidenced by the recent Galwan incident.” Sangay said that “to foster stability in Tibet, China must first address the genuine grievances of the Tibetan people and not forget the 154 Tibetans who have set themselves on fire in protest against Chinese policies in Tibet”. He added that the increasing militarisation of Tibet is a “serious source of concern for the Tibetans as well as India and Asia’s security at large. Restoring the status of Tibet as a zone of peace with its historical demilitarised border with India is the only way of enduring peace in Asia.” Sangay, who heads the Central Tibetan Administration based in Dharamshala, said: “The root cause of instability in Tibet is not the Tibetan people’s faith, but the repressive and failed policies of the Chinese government. The continuation of these hardline policies and repression is only going to make matters worse. That’s why genuine autonomy based on the ‘middle way approach’ is the only viable solution.” He also refuted Xi’s call for “sinicising”, saying: “China’s policy of sinicising Tibetan Buddhism is a misguided attempt at controlling the Tibetan people’s religious belief and the reincarnation system. China must draw on its past experiences and allow the Tibetan people to maintain its distinct faith and religious traditions.” The remarks were a reference to increased efforts by Beijing to choose the next Dalai Lama. Chinese authorities have said they will reject any successor to the current Dalai Lama chosen outside China, and experts have contended that any Indian involvement in the issue could potentially affect bilateral relations. The Chinese president’s assertions and Sangay’s response came against the backdrop of the dragging India-China border standoff. Tensions flared again on Monday, when the Indian Army said it had thwarted China’s “provocative military movements” to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong Lake. Some experts have suggested that the Indian government should play up the Tibet card as part of efforts to pressure the Chinese to complete the stalled disengagement and de-escalation process on the LAC. Sangay said Buddhism is more important than communism for Tibetans. “To force them to treat communism as more important than their faith is not only a violation of international religious freedom, but is also deeply misguided. Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism is never going to work. The last 60 years of Chinese rule in Tibet is a testament to that fact,” he added. The demolition of Larung Gar and Yarchen Gar, two of the largest Buddhist institutes in the world, by Chinese authorities was a “tragic example of Chinese atrocities on Tibetan Buddhism”, he said. Despite their suffering, the people in Tibet are “still strong and remain faithfully devoted to...the Dalai Lama”, Sangay said. Sangay also emphasised that, as envisioned by the Dalai Lama, Tibetans seek “genuine autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution”. He added, “Resumption of dialogue with...the Dalai Lama or his envoys remains the only foreseeable solution to resolve the Tibet issue.” The Central Symposium on Tibet Works was the Chinese Communist Party’s most important forum for Tibet policies. The two-day meeting was the first such gathering since 2015. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangay-slams-china-border-defence-policy/story-GAQOsbhhtmcv4KmXM1idzI.html
01-09-2020||India||JEE (Main) starts off amid strict measures||New Delhi The Joint Entrance Examination (Main), or JEE (Main) — a six-day process for admissions to premier engineering colleges — began on Tuesday amid stringent precautions and in keeping with social-distancing measures even as the Union education ministry said the exercise was smooth.The JEE (Main) exam was held across the country in two shifts (9am-12 noon and 3pm-6 pm). Measures such as staggered entry and exit for candidates, sanitizers at the entrance, and the distribution of masks were in place in view of health risks posed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA), a government body that conducts the examination, kept an eye on the proceedings through cameras in each venue. “JEE was conducted smoothly all over the country. I would like to thank all state governments and officials of the National Testing Agency for the smooth conduct of the examination,” higher education secretary Amit Khare said.According to a person aware of the developments, “initial estimates suggested that around 60% of the candidates had travelled to examination halls to take the test”. He, however, said these were preliminary estimates and data was being collated.This year, around 858,000 candidates registered for the exams from September 1 and 6. On Tuesday, candidates interested in bachelor’s degree courses in architecture or planning took the test. Candidates aspiring to join a BE or a BTech course will sit for the exam from September 2-September 6.The examination became controversial with a large section of students demanding its cancellation in the wake of Covid-19. Leaders such as Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, DMK president MK Stalin and Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia demanded that the test be postponed.But on August 17, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea seeking the postponement of JEE and the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (for admission to medical and dental courses), saying a precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.In the midst of a pandemic and the debate over students’ safety, the JEE (Main) exam began late this year; it is usually held in April.“On the first day, out of 3,020 registered students, only 1,664, or 55%, remained present, while 1,356 (45%) did not turn up. Normally, 25-30 per cent students skip the exams every year. The percentage this year is higher by 10-15,” Virendra Ravat, JEE coordinator for Gujarat told PTI, while discussing state-specific numbers.Some students complained of inadequate public transport available to reach the examination centres. “We had to face a lot of inconvenience to appear for the examination. But there was no option for us,” said Fiza Siddiqui, 18, who travelled from Bahraich to Lucknow with her father.Fiza said social-distancing was properly maintained during the exam and there was no chaos at her centre.Like many other students from different parts of the country, Fiza found the mathematics section of the paper slightly difficult and aptitude part easy.Satish Prakash, who took the exam in Patna and found the paper easy, said: “Preparation at the exam centre was good. Circles were marked on ground for students to facilitate queues at the entrance gate.”Ravindra Singh, another student who took the test in Ludhiana, said, “The invigilator, too, was wearing a mask. The only common surface we touched was the attendance sheet. I was wearing gloves.”At Ranchi’s Tupudana based examination centre, students were reminded about social distancing norms through loud-speakers. “I was very anxious before the exam, but questions were easy. I found the mathematics section a bit lengthy. Aptitude and drawing sections were easy,” said Puja Kumari, who appeared for the exam in Ranchi .Partha Jagati, a Nainital student, found physics questions a bit tricky. “Otherwise, everything went well,” she said.Ananya Sharma, who appeared for the exam in Jaipur, said she and her friends prepared for the exam by taking mock tests while wearing masks and gloves. “This helped us to cope with anxiety at the examination centre,” she said.

01-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Indian economy declined by almost a fourth in the first quarter of 2020-21 compared to a year ago, and there are fears that when data from smaller companies and the informal sector is factored in, the fall could be much higher. The coronavirus disease and the lockdown imposed to fight it — there was a near-total lockdown for 68 days, including the entire months of April and May, although some restrictions were relaxed starting mid-April — have clearly roiled the economy. By how much? The loss of 23.9% of GDP, or Rs 8.6 lakh crore (in 2011-12 prices; at current prices, the amount is Rs 11.1 lakh crore), in these three months. Every Indian has seen a loss of Rs 6,466 in this period, although, to be sure, the pandemic hasn’t affected everyone equally.SHARP CONTRACTIONData shows that private consumption is down 27%. There is also the beginning of what some financial advisors term precautionary saving. Still worse, investment fell by 47% in the quarter. Among large economies too, India’s rate of contraction was the sharpest. The general consensus among economists and statisticians is that the contraction will be larger — because proxies have been used to make good the gaps in data collection (the ongoing pandemic made this difficult), and because data on small companies and the informal sector isn’t readily available, although it is anecdotally known that small companies and the informal sector have been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown.TOUGH TIMES AHEAD It is now becoming clear that a 5% contraction in FY21 may have been an underestimation. Unless there is a miraculous turnaround in fortunes, the Indian economy will likely contract in the second and third quarters. The numbers released on Monday show that private consumption is down 27%, which isn’t surprising — some people have lost jobs, others have taken salary cuts, and everyone has become cautious with spending. There is also the beginning of what some financial advisors term precautionary saving — with the prospect of the proverbial rainy day now being all too real. Still worse, investment, one of the pillars on which the economy is built, fell by 47% in the quarter. Among large economies, India’s rate of contraction was the sharpest — by quite a bit. The US, for instance, saw its economy shrink by 9.04% in the same quarter year-on-year (its second, because it follows the calendar year for accounting unlike India). GOVT RESPONSEThe govt should spend money to boost aggregate demand, which includes both consumption and investment. One radical alternative is debt monetisation. Given that the primary economic challenge right now is on the demand-side, the government need not worry about inflation just yet. The consensus among experts, before these numbers were released, was that the Indian economy would shrink by at least 5% in 2020-21. It is now becoming clear that 5% may have been an underestimation. India is two months into its second quarter (July-September), and business activity is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, although it has improved since May. And while there are positive signs in some high-frequency indicators (those released more frequently than a quarter, such as car sales data), there’s nothing to suggest that India is in the midst of a V-shaped recovery as emphasised by the chief economic adviser.Indeed, given the current economic context, even the prospect of a U-shaped recovery looks challenging. Unless there is a miraculous turnaround in fortunes, the Indian economy will likely contract in the second and third quarters. And for the year as a whole, it is possible that the Indian economy will contract by much more than 5% in 2020-21. Some experts believe the number could be close to 10%, though there are others that see this as an extreme estimate.What should the government’s response be?The simple answer to this would be: spend. The government should spend money to boost aggregate demand, which includes both consumption and investment. The problem is that it has limited headroom. Data released on Monday showed that its fiscal deficit is already at 103% of the 2020-21 estimate. One radical alternative (that people are already beginning to talk of) is debt monetisation. In other words, India could consider monetising at least part of its deficit. At one time, any country even thinking of this would have been censured by the world at large. It is a sign of the times, and the pressing economic challenges facing countries, that Indonesia’s decision to monetise $40 billion of its debt didn’t provoke any strong criticism (it did cause a flutter, though). One of the classical economic arguments against this is that it will boost inflation. Given that the primary economic challenge right now is on the demand-side (supply isn’t a constraint, at least, not yet), the government need not worry about inflation (again, not just yet).This could also help the federal governments meet its payout commitments to the states, which are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic and, therefore, need more money.After all, it will take something special, even unconventional, to deal with an Act of God.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-0a82hFFAlVP6y2gbXvBUdK.html
01-09-2020||India||SJM tells PM Modi not to allow foreign defence firms to register as Indian vendors||The Swadeshi Jagran Manch has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him not to allow foreign defence companies to register themselves as Indian vendors by setting up subsidiary companies in India as it would be in contravention of the government’s thrust on self reliance. An affiliate of the RSS, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch has pointed out that with the change in investment policy allowing FDI up to 74% under automatic route in defence production, the definition of Indian vendor has been diluted significantly “Swadeshi Jagran Manch is of the considered opinion that ‘Indian vendor’ should only mean an entity in which majority ownership and control is retained by Indian Resident Citizens. Diluting the definition of ‘Indian vendor’ will be a deadly blow to Indian Defence Industry,” the letter signed by the national co-convenor of the SJM, Ashwani Mahajan said. It would cause a severe blow to the existence of the domestic defence industry, both big and small which has developed indigenously, as foreign companies would start getting same treatment, which domestic industry gets especially under ‘Buy IDDM (Indian Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured)’ categories where special preferences are given to the ‘Indian Vendor’, the letter said. The SJM which has been in the forefront of seeking a rejig of trade and investment policies and boycott of Chinese products has said that if a foreign company is registered in India, and has started making in India, its technology policy is not governed by Indian laws, they are governed by the laws of country of their origin. “…All the gains, which were expected by banning of imports of 101 defence items would be squandered away, as foreign companies establishing their units, would be covered by procurement by the government as a domestic company,” the letter said. In August India announced that it will ban the import of 101 types of weapons and ammunition over the next five years — from artillery guns to light military transport aircraft and conventional submarines to long-range land attack cruise missiles — in a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. Mahajan underlined that procurement from companies registered in India, where majority shareholding is that of foreigners, is no different from imports, as they would be either importing their components from foreign destinations or would be contracting with companies of their choice, with little chance of developing domestic capabilities. “We understand that the intent of the Government, so far has been that first preference be given to Indian IDDM, that is, Buy Indian IDDM. Therefore, by any chance companies registered in India but owned by foreigners, shouldn’t be included in this category. Second preference in government procurement should be to Indian companies, namely companies having Indian shareholding of 51 per cent or above. However, if ‘clarification’ is to be believed, in both these categories, foreigners will gain dominance and ‘Self Reliance’ in defence will be a distant dream,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sjm-tells-pm-modi-not-to-allow-foreign-defence-firms-to-register-as-indian-vendors/story-66sOpJer0dUwwmQHEhcaTO.html

We are consulting state governments. We will soon announce and let everyone know as and when they are started,” a railway ministry spokesperson said. The ministry did not provide details on how many special trains are being planned.The home ministry on Saturday issued guidelines for the fourth phase of an exercise to lift restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), announcing that metro rail services can resume in a graded manner from September 7. The Railways have currently suspended all regular passenger trains indefinitely. Regular trains have remained suspended since March 22. Earlier in June, the ministry had said passenger trains, including express and suburban services that were earlier suspended till June 30, will not operate till August 12. The 15 pairs of premium Rajdhani trains connecting Delhi with different parts of the country, which began on May 12, and 100 pairs of long-distance trains, which began on June 1, will continue to function.On August 11, the ministry had clarified that all regular trains will continue to remain suspended but additional special trains will be operated based on the requirement.“This is to bring to the notice of all concerned that, as decided and informed earlier on as well, regular passenger and suburban train services will continue to remain suspended till further notice. It may be noted that 230 Special Trains, which are running at present, will continue to operate…The occupancy of special trains is being monitored on a regular basis. Additional special trains may be run based on the requirement. However, all other regular trains and suburban trains run before lockdown, will remain suspended for the time being,” the ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-cater-to-demand-more-special-trains-being-planned-railways/story-CJwSnZJP5LUSAvfJ0tDLoO.html
01-09-2020||India||BJP to take out Ram rath yatra ahead of bypolls in Madhya Pradesh||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers will take out ‘Ramshila poojan’ rath yatra in 27 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh where bypolls are expected to be held next month, party leaders said.The first such rath yatra will be taken out in Surakhi state assembly constituency of Sagar district in Bundelkhand on Wednesday and will be led by revenue and transport minister Govind Singh Rajput. Rajput represented Surakhi assembly constituency till March this year before he along with 21 Congress MLAs resigned from the state assembly to join the BJP. The rath yatra will be held over 10 days.“Some religious people were of the view that we should send Ramshila (bricks) to Ayodhya for construction of the temple. Ramshilas will be taken in five directions in the constituencies for its worship from September 2 to September 11 after which the same would be carried to Ayodhya,” he said.Rajput who was inducted in the state cabinet on April 21 without being a member of the state assembly is likely to contest the bypoll from the constituency on a BJP ticket to retain his position as a minister, party leaders said. The bypoll will decide the fate of the BJP government as well. The party which replaced Congress in power on March 23 this year has 107 MLAs in the 230-member state assembly, nine short of the majority mark. The Congress has 89 MLAs and there are 2 BSP, 1 SP and 4 independent MLAs in the assembly. BJP needs to win 9 seats out of 27 to retain the power. According to convener of the Rathyatra Anil Tiwari there are five vehicles which will be used as ‘Rath’ (chariot) which will carry bricks made of eight metals including silver. “We have got permission from the district administration for the Ramshila poojan rathyatra. The police and our party workers will ensure compliance of all the safety norms against Covid-19”, he added. But BJP’s former member of Parliament Alok Sanjar who was present in Sagar when the announcement was made denied that the exercise was connected with the bypolls.“The programme has nothing to do with the bypolls and it has been organised in view of sentiments of people who want to contribute to construction of the Ram temple which could be possible with a firm stand on the issue and able leadership of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi.State BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “The party has not taken any formal decision to take out any rath yatra for worship of ‘Ramshila’. However, if any party worker or leader in any district wishes to hold any programme for such a worship given his faith in Lord Ram he is free do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-take-out-ram-rath-yatra-ahead-of-bypolls-in-madhya-pradesh/story-KsJw07rsVOo2Gx4lBWJ6XK.html
01-09-2020||India||In Hyderabad, people flout social distancing norms to participate in Ganesh Chaturthi festivities||Thousands of people took part in the immersion of Ganesh idols on Tuesday, concluding the 10-day long Ganesh Chaturthi festivities, but many of the devotees hardly cared for Covid-19 norms. Unlike in the past, in which huge crowds of people used to take part in the centralised procession of Ganesh idols to Hussain Sagar Lake in the city, various Ganesh Chaturthi festival committees took out their own procession of idols in which people took part in large numbers. Individuals also brought the idols in private vehicles. Though the turnout was comparatively less due to the Covid-19 threat, people did not follow any social distancing norms. At many places, young men were dancing together to the music without maintaining any distance. Some people wore facial masks, but many others were found without any such precautions. Around 5,000 Ganesh idols were immersed in the Hussain Sagar Lake and other water bodies in the city where elaborate arrangements had been made.Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said around 50 cranes were installed at Hussain Sagar Lake to facilitate the immersion process. Barricades were erected to close down the road at important places for smooth flow of vehicles towards the lake, he said. The Shobha Yatra (grand immersion procession) of the Balapur Ganesh idol commenced in the morning and concluded in the evening. The crowds were far less compared to last year. The famous Khairatabad Ganesh idol, which was just nine-foot in size compared to 60 feet last year, was also immersed in the Hussain Sagar Lake in the evening. The police commissioner said the immersion of Ganesha idols was peaceful. Tight security arrangements were made and around 15,000 personnel deployed in the city. “Citizens are cooperating with the police and administration in ensuring an incident-free immersion and all wings of the city police are monitoring the programme. The immersion process will conclude by the early hours of Wednesday,” he said. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi Youth and other organisations decided not to arrange any prasadam distribution programmes and to strictly follow Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-hyderabad-people-flout-social-distancing-norms-to-participate-in-ganesh-chaturthi-festivities/story-YW9EJdX75zWGWuOJssZbgL.html

01-09-2020||India||Tourism industry hopes for turnaround after Goa opens borders, bars under Unlock 4||The Goa government’s decision to lift all restrictions on the movement of people across the state borders under Unlock 4 has offered hope to the state’s tourism industry that it will encourage people to consider vacationing later this year.But the decision also drew flak from locals who said that it was too soon to life restrictions that were put in place to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant announced that there would be no restrictions on the movement of people in and out of the state, which he said was in tune with the central government’s directives. In response, the Goa Airport too announced that screening and the testing were being lifted. “As per the announcements by the Govt of Goa restrictions on interstate travel have been removed in line with guidelines of Govt of India. No more requirements of Covid19 -ve report and no more test requirements for domestic travellers,” the Airports Authority of India, which runs the civilian terminal at the Goa airport, said. The airport handled 34,700 passengers in August, the highest since April and significantly higher than the around 20,000 passengers the airport handled in the months of June and July.The state’s tourism department had said that the need for quarantine upon arrival as well as quarantine upon return to their respective states was an additional deterrent to tourists as well as to business travellers many of whom arrive only for a short stay. The tourism stakeholders hope that with the travel guidelines now clearer, it will help people plan their holidays if not now, then for later this year. An added filip was the reopening of bars, which the industry says will also give the restaurant industry a boost. According to an per an order issued by the Excise Department on Monday all “valid licence holders whose licences are not otherwise suspended and are already renewed for this financial year are permitted to commence the sale of liquor for consumption on premises except in containment zones… provided that they make mandatory arrangements for social distancing distancing between workers, adequate gaps between shifts, staggering lunch breaks of staff, etc.”The government has also mandated that “no liquor be sold without a mask or face cover... and that customers maintain six feet distance from each other” among other conditions. “We are also worried about the virus, because we do not know how fast it is spreading. We have to inspire confidence in people if they are to come back. It will take some time,” Michael Carrasco, the president of the All Goa Bar and Restaurant Association, said. Goa’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism and while the return of the tourists is still some months away, stakeholders are hopeful that with the path now clearer things will turn a corner by November-December. However, many have cautioned that the decision is premature. The Goa unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the chief minister seems to have given up all efforts to control the spread of Covdi-19.“The breakneck speed at which the BJP government has opened up the state, shows that CM Pramod Sawant, having given up all efforts to either control the spread or ensure treatment of the infected, is only waiting for herd immunity to develop in Goa. The CM has thrown open the borders to everyone, with no testing required. He says this is as per MHA guidelines. But MHA guidelines have only removed the requirement of an e-pass and the guidelines dated 29/08/20 expressly state that movement of people is still to be regulated as per SOPs in place,” the AAP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourism-industry-hopes-for-turnaround-after-goa-opens-borders-bars-under-unlock-4/story-49UFLFN3KJw2mmsEyLf5TM.html

01-09-2020||India||Patna municipality ex-boss in the dock for waterlogging says Nitish Kumar also to blame||Former commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation, Anupam Kumar Suman, on Tuesday ridiculed the state government’s show cause slapped on him for disciplinary action for last year’s water logging in Bihar’s capital city and said chief minister Nitish Kumar should also be held to account for the mess.Suman, a 2004-batch Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, said he took to the media to reply to the state government’s charge, which he received a couple of days ago, because the letter did not have any significance as he had taken voluntary retirement.“I would have definitely given a befitting reply had I been in service,” said Suman, adding that he came to know about the state government’s action against him only through the media.Blaming the acute shortage of resources and lack of political will for perennial waterlogging in Patna, Suman said he was a victim of a witch-hunt. “If head of the institution is held accountable for fault at the subordinate level, how the PMC mayor, departmental minister and the chief minister shall escape the responsibility. They also review every bit of PMC’s preparations for the monsoon,” he said.Dismissing the charge levelled by the state government against him, Suman said flimsy grounds such as lack of leadership quality, inaccessibility, absence of proper cleaning of drainage, etc, were cited as reasons for his suspension, which never came into effect. “Why did the government not fix responsibility on the officers who waste public exchequer and time to sanction projects under Smart City mission and then cancel them without any substantial reasons?” asked the former PMC head.Bihar’s urban development department minister Suresh Sharma said that action against Suman, then Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation MD AP Singh, an IAS officer, and other officers was taken on the recommendations of a high-level committee headed by the development commissioner.“Action was justified as all executive powers of the PMC are vested with the commissioner and not with the mayor or other elected representatives. Mayor or minister does not have any role in implementation of the scheme. Water logging was caused as the PMC couldn’t take appropriate steps, as assured during the review meetings, to deal with the situation,” Sharma said.Almost a month before Patna was caught in deluge due to heavy showers for four days (September 27-30) last year, Suman had stepped down as the PMC chief and sought voluntary retirement from his parent department, the ministry of revenue.

The creation of the “Supply Chain Resilience Initiative” was mooted by Japan amid the Covid-19 crisis, which has played havoc with supply and manufacturing chains, and the three countries held preliminary discussions on the issue over the past few weeks, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. During their first virtual meeting on the issue, commerce minister Piyush Goyal and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Simon Birmingham and Kajiyama Hiroshi, outlined their intention to work for the launch of the new initiative because of the “pressing need for regional cooperation on supply chain resilience in the Indo- Pacific”, a joint statement said. They signalled their determination to “take a lead in delivering a free, fair, inclusive, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment and in keeping their markets open”, it added. The ministers instructed their officials to promptly work out details of the new initiative for its launch later this year, and called on other countries in the region with similar views to join the initiative, the statement said. The people cited above said the supply chain initiative was a natural follow on to the security cooperation between the three countries, both bilaterally and through platforms such as the Quadrilateral Dialogue Mechanism or Quad, which also includes the US. The three countries will now work with regional partners, including members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), to build stronger supply and manufacturing chains that are protected from external shocks and influences, the people said. The three nations see countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and New Zealand among the players who can have a key role in the initiative, the people added. The issue of supply chains found mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address on Independence Day, when he said: “Many businesses around the world see India as a supply chain hub today. Now we have to move forward with ‘make in world’ as well as ‘make for world’.” Addressing the trilateral meeting, Goyal said the initiative couldn’t have come at a more opportune time in the post-Covid-19 scenario, when there is a likelihood of churning of supply chains in the Indo-Pacific region and it was incumbent on the three countries to take the initiative. “The diversification of supply chain is critical for managing the risks associated with supply of inputs including disciplining price volatility. We could provide the core pathway for linking value chains in the region by creating a network of reliable long-term supplies and appropriate capacities,” he said. In order to improve competitiveness of sectors, the three countries may need to identify manufacturing and services sectors that contribute the most to domestic value addition in the region. “We support the need for specific activities listed for enhancing the resilience of the supply chains, which include those related to [promoting] and facilitating trade and investment as well as diversification of production base,” he said. Goyal noted that the cumulative GDP of Australia, India and Japan during 2019 was $ 9.3 trillion and their cumulative merchandise goods and services trade were $ 2.7 trillion and $0.9 trillion respectively. “With such a strong baseline, it is important that we use this opportunity to work towards enhancing the share of our trade and investment in the region,” he said. However, he pointed out that Japan’s procurement of many specific products from India was limited despite Japanese global imports being high. This includes sectors such as steel, marine products, processed agriculture, agro-chemicals, plastics, carpets, clothing and footwear. He expressed hope the proposed initiative would try to bridge this and work towards enhancing mutual trade. Former Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House who closely tracks the Quad, said the supply chain initiative has been in the works for some time. “Essentially, the thinking is that the Quad with its political, strategic and security elements isn’t enough of a response to the emerging situation in the Indo-Pacific and it needs an economic pillar, including deeper economic cooperation, trade, connectivity, supply chains and global and regional value chains,” he said. “It should be welcomed that India is moving in that direction. These are early days and concepts are being cleared. How effective this initiative will be will depend on action on the ground, and we don’t have much time to lose while focussing on the concretising of ideas,” Bhatia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-australia-and-japan-to-launch-resilient-supply-chains-for-indo-pacific/story-0e4j7CfG9kz0AmH0tK1ndL.html

01-09-2020||India||I look at the craft of acting in a very different perspective, says Chandan K Anand||Actor Chandan K Anand believes that life comes to a full circle so it is important to keep on doing your bit to support the upcoming talent. “Ever since I came in the industry, I always wanted to do something for the newcomers — be it actors, writers or directors. Finally, over the years, I have reached a position where I can provide a platform to them in my own small way. With my own production house, we have come up with two short films and more will follow soon,” said ‘Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl’ and ‘Rangbaaz’ actor over the phone. From acting in theatre to doing television and then films, Chandan feels it has a great journey so far. “It is overwhelming to see my dreams as an actor fulfilled. That’s what an actor is hungry for — performance-based roles that are loved by the audiences. Also, I want to spread goodness with my craft and it was with my production house ‘Naksh Originals,’ I came up with two short films . First is ‘Gannu Ali’ and another tentatively titled ‘Bawal’ that was extensively short in Lucknow waiting to be released. Former has been written and directed by me it is available on online whereas the latter is all hard work of my team.” After working in critically acclaimed film ‘Parched’ along with TV series ‘Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,’ Chandan says he loves working across mediums. “For me the medium is never a reason to take up work, what matters is my character. I am working not only because it’s my passion but I work exceptionally hard to support my team and creativity. Thankfully, I have been getting good projects and my aim of take my craft to right audience is also happening simultaneously. I’m inclined towards mediation and spirituality that too is the reason of my looking at the craft of acting in a different perspective altogether,” said actor who is currently busy with TV daily ‘Barrister Babu’ and an untitled web series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-look-at-the-craft-of-acting-in-a-very-different-perspective-says-chandan-k-anand/story-w7LWGJNPUpW3ph2ZGlzMfM.html
01-09-2020||India||At home with success, Amit stays put||In Lucknow since Holi, ‘Bulleya’ singer Amit Mishra has set up his studio and has decided to make his hometown his base. His ‘Ganpati Aarti’ was recently released digitally, which he recorded at his studio. “I am completely working from Lucknow and maintaining my Mumbai set up as well. Four singles of mine, which will come in September onwards, were recorded here. Besides, I have recorded four film songs that we may re-dub in Mumbai,” said the singer. Mishra said that he will keep his base in Lucknow and travel to Mumbai balancing his ‘janambhoomi’ and ‘karambhoomi’. “It’s true that I have to ultimately work with the industry there, as most filmmakers and composers prefer dubbing as a team. So, my plan is to keep my base in my hometown and travel to Mumbai for work and other places once gigs start. Though it entails extra expenditure but God has been kind and I will be able to financially balance both places.” The ‘Manma Emotions Jage’ singer feels one needs to be on the backfoot these days. “You need to go on the backfoot for that perfect shot. So, I am building my studio set-up. We have set up high-end equipment, amplifiers and got acoustics in place, in collaboration with singer-composer Anand (Tripathi) bhaiya, who is a Bhatkhande Music University alumni. ‘Tinka-tinka jod kar’ we have set this up and the results are coming out well. Though it’s taking longer, doing it from here. Once the market opens up, I am sure we will bounce back.”Since the lockdown, he has not moved out of Lucknow but has been recording from here. “Besides my own songs, I am also recording for Pritam Da’s ‘Jam It’.” In the given scenario, he is getting satisfactory work and returns. “Things are happening on the financial front but since gigs are not happening and brand recordings are slow, so things are moving slowly. But given the situation, I am happy that I am staying with my family and still able to make money from here.” Beyond money, he feels it’s a great time to hone his voice. “It’s true that there was an overuse of vocals and riyaz and learning was being compromised. During this period, we got time for this. Like, I did good sessions with my vocal coach Jaime Vendera sir for my upcoming English project in which I have sung a medley which is very international. It will be released soon.” However, four singles are ready for digital release. “I am not featured in them as I am not shooting in this given situation. Three songs are final and production of the fourth song is underway. I have sung films as well, but that is for next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/at-home-with-success-amit-stays-put/story-3sokhieWXkKea1Gz0OqKXO.html
01-09-2020||India||Eminent Lucknow architect Prof SM Akhtar, to design Ayodhya mosque||Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow architect-cum-town planner and founder dean, faculty of architecture, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi will design the mosque that will come up in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya district, the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) said Tuesday. Other than the mosque, Akhtar will also design other public utility establishments, including a hospital, Indo-Islamic Research Centre, community kitchen and a museum on the allocated 5 acre mosque complex. The land was allocated to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) in compliance with the Supreme Court order in the Ayodhya case verdict. “We have appointed prof SM Akhtar as consultant architect and hence he will design the entire masjid complex that would come up on the 5 acre land in Dhannipur,” said Athar Hussian, spokesperson of IICF — the trust was formed by UPSCWB to carry out the construction of the mosque and other structures on the mosque complex. Prof Akhtar, who was born and brought up in Lucknow, said the mosque would come up on around 15,000 square feet land and would be an amalgamation of Indo-Islamic architecture. Akhtar, who has penned several books on architecture and environment, said the other establishments on the complex would also be constructed in the same architectural theme. “Besides the mosque, a major portion would be utilised for construction of a hospital. Other utility establishments will be built on the remaining land,” the professor said. He said that bridging the gap between the two communities through his architectural skills would be his sole aim while giving shape to the project. Last month, the IICF had announced that the mosque would be named as Masjid Dhannipur. UPSCWB’s decision to construct the mosque also drew strong reactions from the community, with some people saying that a mosque cannot be constructed on land given by the government. Shaista Amber, a social activist and president All India Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) and eminent Urdu poet Munawwar Rana had raised objection to construction of the mosque on the allocated land. Rana, in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested the construction of a grand hospital on the entire 5 acre land in Dhannipur, naming it after Lord Ram’s father King Dashratha. Besides, he had also offered a chunk of his ancestral land in Rae Bareli for construction of the mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eminent-lucknow-architect-to-design-ayodhya-mosque/story-OIQbbleohJCuEgzE6dj6MI.html
01-09-2020||India||India says China resorted to provocative action, its actions in clear violation of agreements. Read full statement here||India on Tuesday said China resorted to provocative action a day earlier when it attempted to change the status quo in the Pangong Lake area even as military-level talks were underway. China’s actions this year have been in clear violation of agreements, the spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs said.Read full statement by Ministry of External Affairs here:As you aware, India and China have been closely engaged through diplomatic and military channels over the past three months to resolve the situation along the India-China border. It would also be recalled that earlier the two Foreign Ministers and the two Special Representatives had agreed that the situation should be handled in a responsible manner and either side should not take any provocative action or escalate matters and ensure peace and tranquility as per bilateral agreements and protocol.The Chinese side however, violated this understanding and engaged in provocative military maneuvers in the late night of 29th and on 30th August in an attempt to change the status quo in the South Bank area of Pangong Lake. As stated yesterday by Indian Army, the Indian side responded to these provocative actions and took appropriate defensive measures along the LAC in order to safeguard our interests and defend the territorial integrity. Furthermore, yesterday on 31st August, even as the ground commanders of the two sides were in discussions to de-escalate the situation, the Chinese troops again engaged in provocative action. Due to the timely defensive action, the Indian side was able to prevent these attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo.The actions and behavior of the Chinese side since earlier this year along the LAC has been in clear violation of the bilateral agreements and protocols concluded between the two countries to ensure peace and tranquility on the border. Such actions are also in complete disregard to the understandings reached between the two Foreign Ministers as also the Special Representatives.We have taken up the matter of recent provocative and aggressive actions with Chinese side through both diplomatic and military channels and have urged them to discipline and control their frontline troops from undertaking such provocative actions.The Indian side is firmly committed to resolve all outstanding issues along the LAC in the Western Sector through peaceful dialogue. In this context, we expect the Chinese side to sincerely abide by the understanding reached earlier and earnestly work with the India to resolve the situation and to restore peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-china-resorted-to-provocative-action-its-actions-in-clear-violation-of-agreements-read-full-statement-here/story-Y1CG3CqlCGegc0Ofg196LJ.html
01-09-2020||India||Ahead of Bihar assembly polls, 13th RJD lawmaker joins Nitish Kumar’s JD (U)||Desertions from the RJD ahead of assembly polls in Bihar continued on Tuesday when another party MLA, Virendra Kumar, joined the ruling JD (U), taking the total number of legislators, including MLCs, who have recently bolted the Lalu Yadav-led party in the state to 13.JD (U) leader and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, alias Lallan Singh, who inducted the MLA from Teghra assembly segment into the party, said, “Several other MLAs are sending feelers. If JD (U) decides to provide a free entry, there will be a virtual stampede in RJD.”Seven MLAs and five MLCs of RJD, which leads the opposition Grand Alliance, have already joined JD (U) in the last one month. This includes Parsa MLA Chandrika Rai, the estranged father-in-law of Lalu Yadav’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav.Chandrika Rai is son of former chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai.“The RJD tally will be worse than 2010. It is like a product which has no takers,” Lallan Singh said.The RJD, however, challenged Munger MP’s claim. “Such inductions and invites are indicative of desperation. JD (U) has now become a clone of BJP and, like its partner, can go to any length to encourage desertions. When a leader switches sides, it is hardly an endorsement of a winning team. Rather, it’s a last-ditch attempt to stay relevant in electoral politics at any cost,” said Mritunjay Tiwari, media coordinator of RJD.Given the seat constraint in alliance politics, the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) is seriously hamstrung in extending an open offer to sitting RJD MLAs, especially after the recent demand aired by BJP MPs during their interaction with national president J P Nadda favouring a 50:50 seat sharing formula with the JD (U).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bihar-assembly-polls-13th-rjd-lawmaker-joins-jd-u/story-OSH4ZfYPIdNgYhYPAqOQaL.html
01-09-2020||India||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad writes to Facebook’s Zuckerberg. Read full text here||Dear Mr. Mark Zuckerberg,Greetings from IndiaAt a time when we are all collectively battling a global pandemic, let me share my best wishes for you and your family members’ well-being.I am writing this letter to raise serious concerns, some of which we have also raised in the past with senior officials of Facebook. I have often heard you and your senior management talk about the general benefits of connectivity, and more specifically in the context of your products to the global community. Facebook’s stated mission is to give people the power to build communities and bring the world closer. The global scale achieved by the products of the Facebook group make it one of the prime movers in this goal of achieving connected communities across the world. However, what we have seen in the last few months goes contrary to achieving the stated goals of Facebook.I have been informed that in the run up to 2019 General Elections in India, there was a concerted effort by Facebook India management to not just delete pages or sub stantally reduce their reach but also offer no recourse or right of appeal to affected people who are supportive of the right-of-centre ideology. I am also aware that dozens of emails written to Facebook management received no response. The above documented cases of bias and inaction are seemingly a direct outcome of the dominant political beliefs of individuals in your Facebook India team.As a transnational digital platform, Facebook must not only be fair and neutral, but also visibly seen to be so, to users of diverse beliefs and ideologies Individuals working in any organisation may have their individual likes or dislikes, but that must not have any bearing on the public policies and performance of the organisation. It seems from credible media reports that Facebook India team, right from the India Managing Director to other senior officials, is dominated by people who belong to a particular political belief. People from this political predisposition have been overwhelmingly defeated by the people of in successive free and fair elections. After having lost all democratic legitimacy, they are trying to discredit India’s democratic process by dominating the decision-making apparatus of important social media platforms. Facebook is the latest tool in their arsenal to stroke internal divisions and social disturbances.It is problematic when Facebook employees are on record abusing the Prime Minister and senior Cabinet Ministers of India while still working in Facebook India and managing important positions. It is doubly problematic when the bias of individuals becomes an inherent bias of the platform. And it is unacceptable when political biases of individuals impinge on the freedom of speech of millions of people.However, looking at recent media reports, it seems that these deeply entrenched vested interests aren’t satisfied with the shrinking space for one side of the spectrum in India and want to throttle it completely. The spate of recent anonymous, source-based re ports is nothing but an internal power struggle within your company for an ideological hegemony.No other logic can explain how facts are being spun by the selective leaks from within your company to try to portray an alternate reality. This interference in India’s political process through gossip, whispers and innuendo is condemnable. This collusion of a group of Facebook employees with international media is giving a free run to malevolent vested interests to cast aspersions on the democratic process of our great democracy. I would like to point out that there have also been multiple instances recently where Facebook has been used by anarchic & radical elements whose sole aim is to destroy social order, to recruit people and to assemble them for violence. However, we are yet to see any meaningful action against such elements. Is this action also held back by the same vested interest groups who have incentive in stoking political violence and instability in India?A major issue with Facebook is the outsourcing of fact-checking to third party fact- checkers. How can Facebook absolve itself of its responsibility to protect users from misin. formation and instead out-source this to shady organizations with no credibility. We have seen in india that right from the assessors for on-boarding fact-checkers to the fact checkers themselves, harbour publicly expressed political biases Regularly vigilant volun teers on social media have to fact-check the fact-checkers! Even after on-boarding so many fact-checkers, lot of misinformation related to COVID-19 and its aftermath went un checked. How can an organisation like Facebook be oblivious to these realities? A transnational digital platform with a wide user base cannot remain immune to local sensitivities either. A certain act which may be acceptable as per social norms in a par secular country but many not be conducive to the social norms of another country. Face book Community Guidelines must acknowledge this aspect of diversity and respect it To respect the social, religious, cultural and linguistic diversity of India, Facebook should put in place country specific Community Guidelines.Facebook has been a novel experiment in democratizing the expression of people and giving a platform to millions of ordinary citizens to freely express their views, connect, build communities, associate and communicate. I hope that you are cognizant that this experiment should not be allowed to be hijacked by a vested lobby that abhors free speech and tries to enforce one world view and rejects diversity.I wish you and your family the best of healthhearer wishYours trulyRavi Shankar Prasad||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-writes-to-facebook-s-zuckerberg-read-full-text-here/story-Un4yaONsW897MyIU1JXK4M.html
01-09-2020||India||Over 9 lakh ineligible beneficiaries of PM-KISAN scheme detected in Assam||Over 9 lakh ineligible beneficiaries in Assam had availed benefits of Pradhan Mantri-Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), the federal cash transfer scheme meant for farmers, agriculture minister Atul Bora told the state assembly on Tuesday. Replying to a query by leader of opposition Debabrata Saikia, the minister informed that 9,39,146 people who were not eligible had been included as beneficiaries for the scheme, which was launched in February last year and provided income support of Rs 6,000 a year to farmers. In May this year, the union agriculture ministry had stopped payments to beneficiaries in Assam and asked the Assam government for a report and probe into a potential fraud in the PM-KISAN scheme. Following the directive, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had ordered an inquiry into the irregularities and entrusted additional chief secretary Jishnu Barua to detect ineligible beneficiaries and submit a report within a month. On Tuesday, Bora informed the assembly that among the 33 districts in the state, the highest number of ineligible beneficiaries were detected in Barpeta (1.51 lakh) followed by Kamrup (85,711) and Baksa (53,533). The minister said that initially over 39.39 lakh persons had registered as beneficiaries of the scheme, but over 8.19 lakh of them were declared ineligible by the Centre for discrepancies in bank account details. This reduced the number of beneficiaries to 31.20 lakh. Of these, the Centre termed another 3.17 lakh as ineligible bringing the number of beneficiaries to down further to around 28 lakhs. Following a detailed survey conducted across the state, around 18.67 lakh of the beneficiaries were found to be eligible while over 9.39 lakh found ineligible, Bora told the assembly. The minister said that efforts are underway to recover the sums already allotted the ineligible beneficiaries under the scheme and till date over Rs 94.26 lakh has been collected. On detection of their roles in inclusion of ineligible beneficiaries in the scheme, the state government has suspended two district agriculture officers and an agriculture development officer. A data entry operator has been dismissed for his role in the irregularities and several cases lodged, Bora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-9-lakh-ineligible-beneficiaries-of-pm-kisan-scheme-detected-in-assam/story-eeFICPwpW2OvfB9GbeATjJ.html

The GST collection in August last year was Rs 98,202 crore.The finance ministry said the decline is also due to the fact that many small businesses have not filed their monthly returns. “It may also be noted that the taxpayers with turnover of less than Rs 5 crore continue to enjoy relaxation in filing of returns till September,” the statement said. “During the month [August 2020], the revenues from import of goods were 77% and the revenues from domestic transaction (including import of services) were 92% of the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” it said.Out of the gross revenue of Rs 86,449 crore in August 2020, the Central GST (CGST) part is Rs 15,906 crore, State GST (SGST) is Rs 21,064 crore, Integrated GST (IGST) is Rs 42,264 crore (including Rs 19,179 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 7,215 crore, it said. The government has settled Rs 18,216 crore to CGST and Rs 14,650 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement, it added.“The total revenue earned by the Central Government and the state governments after regular settlement in the month of August, 2020 is Rs 34,122 crore for CGST and Rs 35,714 crore for the SGST,” it said. GST collection was badly hit in the beginning of the current financial year due to the 68-day hard lockdown across the country since March 25, which was imposed to check the spread of Covid-19. The collection in April 2020 had plunged 72% to Rs 32,172 crore compared to the same month last year.The collection had seen an annual fall of 38% in May 2020 at Rs 62,151 crore. The year-on-year fall in June this year came down to 9% at Rs 90,917 crore, mainly because of collection of past dues. The revenue in July 2020, however, saw a 14.3% year-on-year drop at Rs 87,422 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-collection-fell-1-in-august-2020-over-the-previous-month/story-S7jZRoDrqpV4RRWym7GsXK.html

01-09-2020||India||Centre should borrow to pay states GST compensation’, KCR tells PM Modi||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday strongly opposed the Central government’s suggestion that states should go in for additional borrowings to meet the shortfall in the Goods and Services Tax compensation payable by the Centre. In a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rao suggested that the Centre itself should borrow loans to the extent of the entire shortfall amount based on the strength of the receipts into the cess amount. “The entire debt servicing - both principal and interest can be paid from the cess collected for such an extended period, beyond 2022, as the GST council may decide,” he said. Stating that Telangana had fully supported the introduction of GST regime keeping in view of the national interest, KCR reminded that the then UPA government had assured the states on payment of full compensation arising out of abolition of central sales tax (CST). “However, the states were denied CST compensation and Telangana was deprived of Rs 3,800 crore on account of revenue loss. Though the GST Compensation Act stipulated that full compensation for the loss of revenue, on account of implementation of GST shall be paid to the states on a bi-monthly basis, there have been long delays in the payment of compensation and the states have not been paid GST compensation since April, 2020,” he said. The chief minister said due to lockdown on account of Covid-19 pandemic, Telangana had suffered a revenue loss of 83 per cent, whereas Covid-19 pandemic related expenditure had gone up. “We are faced with the difficult task of meeting the expenditure through front loading of market borrowings, taking resort to ways and means advances and overdrafts,” he said. KCR refused to buy the argument that the additional borrowings by the Centre would influence yields on Central government securities and had other macro-economic repercussions. “The borrowings by the Centre as well as the States are from the same financial system and pool of investors and their impact on the macro-economic situation is not very different. Borrowings by the States will also push up the yields on government securities,” he said. He said with the introduction of GST, States are left with no major buoyant taxes of their own, while the Centre is still left with buoyant sources like income tax, corporation tax and customs duties. In addition, the Centre has access to more non-tax revenues such as dividends from the RBI, Central Public Sector Undertakings, etc. Thus, the Centre is endowed with more resources to help the states, he pointed out. KCR alleged that the Centre has violated the provisions of the GST Compensation Act by parking the surpluses in the Compensation Fund in its Consolidated Fund instead of parking them in the non-lapsable Compensation Fund in the Public Account and using the surpluses for meeting its expenditure in the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. Now that there is a deficit, States are being asked to borrow, he said.“Strong states make the nation strong. So far, all the decisions by the GST Council have been taken unanimously. I think we need to maintain this tradition in future too,” the chief minister said.

01-09-2020||India||India writes to Facebook, alleges it is the latest ‘tool’ to create social disturbances||In a strongly worded letter, India has raised the issue of free speech with social media giant Facebook, alleging that the platform is the “latest tool” being used to create “internal divisions and social disturbances” by vested groups. In a letter written by Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, India has raised the need for country specific community guidelines and said that as a transactional digital platform, Facebook must not only be fair and neutral, but also visibly seen to be so. Also read: India writes to Facebook, alleges it is the latest ‘tool’ to create social disturbancesThe letter comes in the wake of a controversy stoked by a report in the Wall Street Journal, alleging that Facebook showed a bias in not taking down content from the BJP supported pages or accounts that flouted norms and that its head of public policy in India, Ankhi Das, showed support for the BJP. “I have been informed that in the run-up to 2019 general elections in India, there was a concerted effort by Facebook Indian management to not just delete pages or substantially reduce to reach but also offer no records or right of appeal to affected people who are supportive of the right of the Centre ideology. I’m also aware that dozens of emails written to Facebook management received no response,” the letter says. Also read: BJP alleges Cong-Facebook nexus, new report says Das took credit for ‘Modi’s campaign’The IT minister has also flagged the issue of FB employees running campaigns to discredit the democratic process of the country. “Individuals working in any organisation may have their individual likes or dislikes, but that must not have any bearing on the public policies and performance of the organisation. It seems from credible media reports that Facebook India team, right from the managing director to other senior officials is dominated by people who belong to a particular political belief,” the letter says. Following the WSJ report, the Congress also wrote to Zuckerberg seeking details on steps being taken to investigate allegations that the social media giant does not apply hate speech rules to posts by BJP members. Prasad in his letter has, however, hit out at the allegations and without taking names said that people from a particular “political predisposition have been overwhelmingly defeated in successive free and fair elections. After having lost all democratic legitimacy, they are trying to discredit India’s democratic process by dominating the decision making apparatus of important social media platforms.” The minister has also pointed out that it “problematic when Facebook employees are on record abusing the Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers of India while working in Facebook India and managing important positions.” Alleging that the employee’s bias could impact free speech the letter says, it is “unacceptable when political bosses of individuals impinge on the freedom of speech of millions of people.” Also read: Report on Facebook’s leniency to BJP members’ communal posts causes rowWithout naming the report, the letter says that recent media reports suggest that “deeply entrenched vested interests aren’t satisfied with the shrinking space for one side of the spectrum in India and want to throttle it completely.” “… The spate of recent anonymous, source-based reports is nothing but an internal power struggle with within your company for an ideological hegemony… No other logic and explain how facts are being spun by the selective leaks from within your company to try to portray an alternate reality. This interference in India’s political process through gossip, whispers and innuendo is condemnable,” the letter said. WSJ report was based on internal emails and interviews with employees. The other issues that the minister has flagged include the platform being “used by anarchic and radical elements whose sole aim is to destroy social order, to recruit people and to assemble them for violence” and “outsourcing of fact checking to third-party fact checkers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-writes-to-facebook-alleges-it-is-the-latest-tool-to-create-social-disturbances/story-6DLyiMJY6dwajtyk61jklL.html

Prasad also pointed out that “it is problematic when Facebook employees are on record abusing the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers while still working in Facebook India.”The union minister wrote, “I have been informed that in the run up to 2019 general elections in India, there was a concerted effort by Facebook India management to not just delete pages or substantially reduce their reach but also offer no recourse or right of appeal to affected people who are supportive of right-of-centre ideology.”Prasad wrote that people from a certain “political predisposition have been overwhelmingly defeated by the people of in successive free and fair elections” and that Facebook is the latest tool in their arsenal to stroke internal divisions and social disturbances.“It is problematic when Facebook employees are on record abusing the Prime Minister and senior Cabinet Ministers of India while still working in Facebook India and managing important positions,” the letter to Zuckerberg read. “It is doubly problematic when the bias of individuals becomes an inherent bias of the platform. And it is unacceptable when political biases of individuals impinge on the freedom of speech of millions of people,” it stated. Citing “credible media reports”, Prasad also accused Facebook India team of being dominantly managed by people who belong to a particular political belief. The letter comes a before day the meeting of a Parliamentary committee where opposition parties are likely to raise the issue of Facebook India’s alleged bias towards BJP, and reports of its public policy head Ankhi Das supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and disparaging opposition in internal messages.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ravi-shankar-prasad-writes-to-mark-zuckerberg-says-facebook-used-by-anarchic-radical-elements-to-destroy-social-order/story-o5YUWjXbdHn9bWdeSe1puL.html

The examination will continue for a couple of days, people familiar with the probe said. After the NIA took over the smuggling probe it asked the chief secretary to provide CCTV footage from July 2019 to July 5, 2020. Initially officials manning the control room said some cameras were damaged in lightening, but later admitted that visuals can be retrieved. Later they said some of the visuals are quite heavy and difficult to copy and asked the NIA to mention a specific period and time so that they can copy them. In the midst of a tiff, a minor fire occurred at the general administration department and some “important files” were destroyed in it. While officials blamed it on a short circuit, opposition parties alleged that the fire was intentional in order to destroy evidence in the smuggling case. ALSO READ | Customs grilling Kerala CM’s former IT fellow in gold smuggling caseThere are reports that main accused in the smuggling case Swapna Suresh was a regular at the state secretariat and many officials helped her to get access to important people. The NIA sought the visuals to check her access to the seat of power. After the smuggling came to light on July 5, the government had suspended the CM’s powerful secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, for his alleged liaison with Suresh. Later the NIA, Customs and Enforcement Directorate had questioned Sivasankar. The NIA suspects that many officials had helped her. The smuggling case was discovered after the customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consular office in Thiruvananthapuram. Later, the case was handed over to the NIA and main accused Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru a week later. At least, 20 people have been arrested in the case and many central agencies are helping the NIA in the ongoing probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-nia-examines-cctv-footage-of-kerala-secretariat-to-probe-office-fire/story-eBJa00QWDwDx85w1CMLMWN.html

01-09-2020||India||Mask use and social distancing may prevent 2 lakh Covid-19 deaths in India: Study||Widespread mask use and data-driven social distancing measures in India may help prevent over 200,000 Covid-19-related deaths in India by December 1, according to a modelling study which shows the disease will continue to pose a major public health threat in the country. The study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US suggests that there is an opportunity to further limit the toll of Covid-19 in India. It highlights the critical need for people to comply with face mask use, social distancing, and other Covid-19 prevention guidelines as advised by the public health authorities. “India’s epidemic is far from over, as a large proportion of the population is still susceptible,” IHME Director, Christopher Murray, said in a statement. “In fact, our modelling shows there is a wide range of potential outcomes, depending on the actions that governments and individuals take today, tomorrow, and into the near future. Mask-wearing and social distancing are crucial to mitigate the spread of the virus,” Murray explained. Reacting to the findings of the modelling study, Gautam Menon, Professor, Departments of Physics and Biology, Ashoka University in Haryana said it is certainly true that mask wearing and distancing measures will significantly slow the progress of the disease while protecting vulnerable populations. “My first view is that the IHME model predicts a peak in infections only by early to mid-December, peak numbers of close to 6 million new infections per day and total deaths of about 500,000 in the ‘no intervention’ scenario,” Menon told PTI. However, he noted that these numbers appear inflated compared to other estimates and models which suggest a peak that should happen well before mid-December. “Given that, the estimate of lives saved (in the study) may be on the excessive side,” Menon noted. The researchers in the IHME study noted that India’s response to Covid-19 has produced some significant successes that highlight the opportunity to limit the pandemic’s toll in the country. Giving the example of some urban areas, including Delhi, they explained that containment measures which include intensive contact tracing, widespread testing, mask-wearing, and social distancing mandates have helped reduce the spread of the virus. Their modelling study found that, in the best-case scenario, India can expect approximately 291,145 total Covid-19 deaths by December 1, up from 60,000 in late August. This scenario assumes that face mask usage increases to near-universal (95 per cent) levels and that six-week, state-level lockdowns are re-imposed if the daily death rate exceeds 8 per million in the states. On the other hand, if lockdown restrictions continue to ease up and face mask usage remains at current levels, India can expect approximately 492,380 total deaths by December 1, according to the study. In this scenario, the researchers said, 13 states would each have over 10,000 total Covid-19 deaths by that time, while currently only Maharashtra has crossed this threshold. “India is at a tipping point. If hospitals in those states are unable to accommodate everyone needing Covid-19 care, the result will be more deaths and greater long-term harm to state and local economies,” Murray said. The researchers said until there is a widely available vaccine against Covid-19, much of India’s population remains susceptible to the disease. “Monitoring trends state-by-state, encouraging mask use, continuing social distancing and hygiene precautions, and using state-level or district-level lockdowns if needed can help save lives and minimise the impact of the pandemic on India’s health and economy,” the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-use-and-social-distancing-may-prevent-2-lakh-covid-deaths-in-india-study/story-MH8DAdcimJLSnKYW9s485J.html
01-09-2020||India||Season’s first catch nets more plastic than fish in South Goa||Traditional fishermen in Goa, who ventured into sea for the first time as the monsoon rain and wind subsided, were in for a rude shock when they netted more plastic than fish.It also underlined how loads of trash is polluting the seas. According to a recent publication of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), out of the 300 million tonne of plastic produced in the world every year, around 8 million tonne end up in oceans and make up for 80% of the marine debris from surface water to deep sea sediments,Strong winds and currents bring the marine trash close to coasts, where the traditional fishermen fish and that is the reason that fishermen from villages from Benaulim to Cavelossim beaches in South Goa have returned with the huge quantity of marine trash. “I have been a fisherman for 47 years and never in my life have I seen the kind of garbage being drawn up in the nets as we have seen this year. It is as if someone is deliberately dumping truckloads of garbage into the rivers or the sea,” Pele Fernandes, a traditional fisherman, said. The traditional fishermen, or raponkar as they are called locally, use wooden canoes to venture out to sea either manually rowing them or using an outboard motor. “It is an occurrence now every other day. At this rate the fishermen will go hungry,” Fernandes added. Unlike previous years, this year, more youth because of loss of employment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and closure of the booming tourism industry, have opted for the traditional occupation to tide over the financial crisis. However, they are staring at losses owing to the plastic as well as the big trawlers encroaching on waters that are traditionally reserved for the traditional fishermen. “The trawlers that are by law banned from fishing within 5-kms from the shore are coming as close as 100 metres close to the shore. No action is being taken,” Fernandes said. Dixon Vaz the chairman of the biodiversity committee of the Cavelossim village, where the fishermen have also been drawing up more plastic than fish said it was the sea currents that were throwing back all the plastic that was discarded in the sea. “The government agencies tasked with cleaning up are not doing their job,” Vaz said. “The fish catch has been reducing every year and the plastic in catch is increasing,” he said. Scientists have explained that the sea throws back a lot of flotsam generally composed of organic material like twigs and seaweed but with increasing plastic in the ocean an increasing amount of plastic is finding its way back to the shore. With rivers emptying into the sea with greater force during the monsoon months the currents bring back to the shore all that floats with it. “This problem is only going to amplify in the years to come. It is noticed this time of the year because the winds blow perpendicular to the coast and the waves bring with it whatever floats. On days when the winds are strong and the waves are high, they will find a lot of garbage on the coast,” Dr Antonio Mascarenhas a former scientist with the National Institute of Oceanography. “This is only a small sample of what is actually in the sea. The real problem is much bigger and is only going to get worse,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/season-s-first-catch-nets-more-plastic-than-fish-in-south-goa/story-ANivurTZdlXRDnmTpruXVL.html

The country’s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdown weighed on the already declining consumer demand and investment. “GDP -23.9. The ruining of the country’s economy began with demonetisation. Since then, the government introduced one erroneous policy after another,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also alleged that the government was responsible for the slump in the economy. Rahul Gandhi had spoken of an “economic tsunami” six months ago, while the government announced a package just for “show” and look at the condition now, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. The BJP government has caused the slump in the economy, she alleged. Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi, “Modi ji, at least now accept that what you hailed as masterstrokes were actually ‘disaster strokes’ -- demonetisation, faulty GST and lockdown.” The GDP contraction is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started being published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts. Chief economic adviser K V Subramanian, however, has said the economy is “experiencing a V-shaped recovery” after the lockdown eased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruining-of-economy-began-with-demonetisation-govt-introduced-erroneous-policies-rahul-gandhi/story-ktRjCpp5P48Hjw7d1Xr1cL.html

The state continues to face a surge of fresh cases which is reducing the number of days before another lakh cases are added to the tally.Maharashtra recorded one lakh cases in 96 days. Since then the pace of infection has gathered speed with the state touching the 2-lakh mark in 22 days, the 3-lakh mark in 14 days, the 4-lakh mark in 11 days and the 5-lakh mark in 10 days. It crossed the 6-lakh mark in nine days and while it took only eight days to cross the 7-lakh mark.It had crossed 7-lakh cases mark on August 25 while the tally of 6 lakh was crossed on August 17.In August alone, the state reported 3,71,328 cases, highest ever in a month with an average of 11,975 cases daily.Maharashtra recorded 2,47,392 cases in July, 1,02,172 cases in June, 57,157 cases in May, 10,196 cases in April and 302 cases in March. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state said that the state may take months to reduce daily infections. “Going by the current scenario, it may take months to bring down daily cases until a vaccine arrives in the market. People are not ready to protect themselves. In that case, the state will have to make its surveillance more aggressive. This can be achieved by making Covid testing accessible to all. Like Mumbai, the mandatory condition of having prescription from a doctor for testing need to be removed from across the state,” he said.The death toll of the state also reached 24,583 after 184 deaths were reported on Monday. In August, the state reported 9,589 deaths, which is also the highest in a month so far. In July, a total of 6,988 deaths were reported, while in June, May, April and March, total number of deaths recorded were 5,638, 2,286, 449 and 10 deaths respectively||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-set-to-rise-by-another-lakh-in-only-seven-days/story-oVYv9uFHjxk81eMzEnLjVM.html
01-09-2020||India||Petrol rate hiked by Rs 1.65 a litre in a fortnight, no change in diesel prices||Petrol has become costlier by Rs 1.65 per litre over the last fortnight as fuel retailers have raised its rate to Rs 82.08 since August 15. The prices of diesel have remained unchanged over the last month at Rs 73.56 a litre.Also read: Jet fuel prices hiked 3%Initially, retail prices of both petrol and diesel remained frozen for the first 15 days of August at Rs 80.43 and Rs 73.56 in Delhi. Petrol prices started increasing from August 16 with 14 paise a litre hike that day. Thereafter, petrol rates increased gradually.Over the last fortnight, petrol prices were revised about a dozen times even as international rates did not fluctuate much as benchmark Brent crude remained in the range between $45.4 per barrel and $45.9 a barrel. On Tuesday, Brent crude opened at $45.60 per barrel and was trading at $45.86 a barrel, 1.28% up from Monday close of $45.28 per barrel.India, which imports over 80% of crude oil it processes, and pays in dollar, has also seen a marginal 0.8% softening of its cost of imports in the last one fortnight. India’s average crude oil purchase cost (the Indian basket) that also factors in rupee-dollar exchange rate, was at Rs 3,268.13 per barrel on August 31.An oil ministry official said diesel and petrol prices in the country are linked to the international prices of finished products, and not crude prices. The government has no role in the daily revision of petrol and diesel rates as they are deregulated products, he said requesting anonymity. The government had deregulated petrol pricing in 2010 and diesel in 2014.State-run fuel retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – declined comments on the matter.SC Sharma, an energy expert and a former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said in August international diesel prices moved up by a marginal 0.05%, but petrol prices have seen volatility in the month on the upward side between about 5% and 7%. “Hence, diesel prices were kept constant without change, while the petrol prices were increased in line with volatility,” he said.“Rupee has also improved during the month (August). It is understood that the impact of rupee strengthening has been factored in petrol prices,” he added. As India pays oil import bills in dollars, appreciation of the rupee against dollar helps in reducing the import cost.The Delhi government in July reduced value-added tax on diesel by over Rs 8 per litre, making it cheaper than petrol. Dilip Khanna, transactions partner (oil and gas) at consulting firm EY, previously known as Ernst and Young said, while the excise component for both fuels is almost similar, the pump rates of the two fuels differ because of differences in state levies. He said that petrol prices have lower impact on the inflation compared to diesel.Gagan Dixit, vice president at equity research firm Elara Capital, said the 15-day average international petrol (gasoline) prices increased $2.5 per barrel that resulted the increase in gasoline cost to companies, which is passed to consumer. Unlike gasoline, 15-day average international diesel prices decreased $0.5 a barrel that resulted in Rs 0.45 per litre decrease in diesel cost to the companies, but they kept diesel prices unchanged, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-rate-hiked-by-rs-1-65-a-litre-in-a-fortnight-no-change-in-diesel-rates/story-oQozEHUM7smdX7IGXeH8VN.html

The party has decided to contest on all 70 seats in 2022 assembly polls in the hill state.The LJP has formed a core team that will look into the formation of all district and assembly-level segments in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled state. The LJP is a BJP ally in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre.Kedarnath Pundit, who heads the LJP in Uttarakhand, said the party is seriously considering making inroads into the hill state politics, as it seeks to emerge as an alternative to both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress.“We are focusing on getting as many new members as possible in each one of the 70 assembly segments. Priority in ticket allocation will be given to those candidates, who get maximum members for the party in their respective constituencies. Besides our traditional vote bank of backward and minority community, we are focussing on hilly areas and rural cluster voters in the state,” said Pundit.Soon, a delegation of the party leaders will meet state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and submit him a memorandum regarding local issues being faced by the public.“We want to play the role of a pro-active and constructive Opposition party. Issues related to both Kumaon and Garhwal regions will be effectively raised by our party in the coming days,” said Raghunath Kumar, state general secretary, LJP. Kumar said that the LJP would not enter any alliance with regional outfits such as the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) because the latter failed to realise the aspirations of the public.It would not be a politically expedient move to forge a tie-up with the UKD, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-janshakti-party-to-contest-all-70-seats-in-2022-uttarakhand-assembly-polls/story-w27o0eoCTKySrPdzQOiV1J.html

The court also termed the detention order of February 13, 2020, against Khan by the Aligarh district magistrate as ‘bad’. The bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Saumitra Dayal Singh passed the order on a petition filed by Dr Khan’s mother Nuzhat Parveen seeking his release.In the petition, it was alleged that earlier in February, Dr Khan was granted bail by a competent court. However, he was not released and three days later, the NSA was invoked against him, said the petition, adding that his detention was illegal. The plea challenged the detention of Dr Khan for three days before NSA was imposed on him even after he secured bail in all the cases registered against him.Also read: ‘UP Police will kill me,’ says Dr Kafeel Khan after arrest over anti-CAA remarksKhan has been behind bars since January 29 after he allegedly delivered a speech during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests at Aligarh Muslim University in December last year.His detention under the NSA was extended by three months on May 12 and then again on August 4 for three more months. “The speech given by Khan was not provocative. It was not intended to provoke religious sentiments among AMU students.” argued his lawyer.The counsel for the state government defended the detention order on the ground that under the NSA, a detention order can be passed on ‘subjective satisfaction’ of district authority and Dr Khan’s inflammatory speech disturbed public order and later, the protest turned violent.“The speaker was certainly opposing the policies of the government and while doing so, certain illustrations are given by him, but that nowhere reflects the eventualities demanding detention. A complete reading of the speech prima facie does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence. It also nowhere threatens peace and tranquillity of the city of Aligarh. The address gives a call for national integrity and unity among the citizens. The speech also deprecates any kind of violence. It appears that the District Magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent. The entire speech being a subject matter of a criminal case pending against Dr Kafeel Khan, therefore, it would not be appropriate for us to make much comments on that.”, observed the bench on the speech made by Dr Khan on AMU campus.“An important aspect of the matter is that the detenue addressed the gathering on December 12, 2019. At that time, the district administration, Aligarh, did not find the speech of Dr Kafeel Khan sufficient for preventive detention. Nothing has been said in the order of detention or the grounds for detention that district administration had any information within the period from December 12 , 2019 to February 13, 2020 about any effort made by the detenue to cause even a simple scar to the peace or tranquillity or the public order of the city of Aligarh. It is only after passing of the bail order by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aligarh, the police officials and the District Magistrate, Aligarh initiated the process for detaining Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act, 1980 …. the detenue was roaming free and he had ample time to make all the efforts to damage public order in the city of Aligarh, if he was intending to do so”, observed the bench.Dr Kafeel Khan, a paediatrician, hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, in which about 60 children died allegedly due to lack of oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-orders-dr-kafeel-s-release-sets-aside-detention-under-nsa/story-IoAR6XGUBO9DZdTkwxbqSP.html
01-09-2020||India||In Bengal, CSIR-CMERI scientists set up world’s largest ‘solar tree’||Scientists at the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) in West Bengal have installed a ‘solar tree’ that is likely to be the largest of its kind in the world. “This is the largest solar tree as per our knowledge producing up to 11,500 watts (11.5kw). The second largest tree has been set up in London and produces around 8.6kw,” said Harish Hirani, director of CMERI, the country’s apex research and development institute for mechanical engineering under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). A solar tree is a metal structure resembling a tree that has solar panels fitted on the branches. The solar panels connected through metal branches produces solar power. The CMERI solar tree has 35 panels each with a capacity of 330 watts. “Producing around 12,000–14,000 units of clean and green power in a year, the solar tree has the potential to save 10–12 tons of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere every year,” he said. One of the main hurdles while setting up solar panels on a large scale and for producing huge amount of renewable energy is availability of land. The inclination of the tree arms (tree branches) holding the panels can be adjusted to get the maximum output, a feature which is not available in roof top panels. The CMERI developed solar tree costs around Rs 7.5 lakh. “Solar trees because of their design use less space and hence can produce more power per unit area. But one of the major hurdles of solar tree is its capital investment. This pushes up the cost of one unit of electricity produced. The cost is almost double than that of solar roof top panels which takes around Rs 3.5 to produce one unit,” said SP Gon Choudhury, renewable energy expert and a Green Oscar awardee. The scientists at CMERI said that as the shadow area is minimum in solar trees they could be set up in agricultural farms to run pumps, e-tractors and tillers as an alternative to diesel. The excess power can be sent to the grid providing economic return to farmers. “This solar tree is a quantum leap towards making an energy reliant and carbon negative India,” said Hirani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-csir-cmeri-scientists-set-up-world-s-largest-solar-tree/story-azXMwE2EGe6Fd8ambi4FUP.html

I was referring to the one by Sahodaran Ayyappan, an ardent disciple of Sree Narayana Guru. If you are not convinced, read his Onapattu,” the minister tweeted. But many saints and BJP leaders did not accept his clarifications. “Issac has defamed Hindus. What right has he got to insult Hindu Gods like this? He should withdraw his tweet and tender an apology,” said Swami Chidanandapuri, seer of Adviatha Ashram. “I don’t know who gave him licence to insult Hindu gods. He should tender an apology,” said BJP state president K Surendran. Meanwhile Delhi Chief Minister Aravind Kejriwal also found himself in a controversy with a tweet on the occasion of ‘Vamana Jayanthi.’Vamana Jayanti is celebrated to mark the occasion of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Lord Vamana to defeat king Mahabali.The festival of Onam celebrates the yearly home-coming of mythical demon king Mahabali and his tweet glorifying Vamana hasn’t gone down well with Malayalis who flooded social media with memes and trolls targeting Kejriwal. For the people of Kerala, Mahabali remains an icon of equality, justice and honesty. They vouch they can’t rewrite tradition and history with the changing times. According to legend, after being checkmated by Vamana, Mahabali asked Lord Vishnu a boon to visit his people once a year. The boon was granted and people believe Mahabali visits them on ‘Thiruvonam’ day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-s-mahabali-vs-vamana-tweet-on-onam-sparks-row-bjp-seeks-apology/story-43pldn8iiLYDJOtQIxuChP.html

The Chinese Army has installed such equipment all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and use them effectively to monitor Indian activities and respond quickly whenever they find Indian patrols on the areas claimed by them.Sources said the cameras and surveillance equipment has been removed after the Indian side occupied the dormant height within its territory. China has been claiming that the height belongs to them and wanted to capture it to get into an advantageous position all along the southern bank of Pangong lake area and the nearby Spangur Gap, an open territory where Chinese armoured regiments were deployed. Sources said the Indian side has prepared very well for responding to the Chinese reaction in view of the action by own troops including a Special Operations unit and Sikh Light Infantry troops there. One of the Indian Army jawans also lost his life in an anti-personnel mine explosion while patrolling in the area.The Indian side has done heavy deployment of armoured regiments including the BMP Infantry Combat Vehicles and different types of tanks flown in from armoured divisions from the plains.The preparation for the action had been done by the Indian Army recently as the heavy movement of logistics and equipment was done by the force. The Indian Army has preempted the Chinese action to occupy the strategic height on the intervening night of August 29-30 and thwarted a Chinese action to do so after an intense face-off there.The Chinese and Indian troops are engaged in a standoff for over three months after the PLA troops marched into Indian areas in Finger area and other parts of the Ladakh sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-chinese-cameras-and-sensors-indian-troops-managed-to-beat-pla-in-occupying-height/story-Gw4sfjLvYX09hyUU7vag9O.html

The former President (84) died on Monday evening, 22 days after has admitted to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral) in south Delhi to undergo a surgical procedure to remove a brain clot from which he never recovered. He had also tested Covid-19 positive during his treatment in the hospital.Mukherjee’s mortal remains were brought to his residence at 10, Rajaji Marg earlier on Tuesday morning, where President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, former PM Manmohan Singh, BJP president JP Nadda, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, chiefs of the three services and a host of dignitaries paid their tribute. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also paid his homage. “Paid tributes to respected Shri Pranab Mukherjee. He would be remembered by generations for his efforts towards India’s progress,” PM Modi tweeted after paying a floral tribute to the leader, who he considered to be his mentor and a father-figure. The Union Cabinet observed a two-minute silence in memory of Mukherjee, who had served as the Union minister for finance, defence and external affairs during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) rule between 2004 and 2014, among his other portfolios and roles in his long and distinguished career in public life. “The cabinet expresses profound sorrow at the sad demise of Pranab Mukherjee, former President of India.

01-09-2020||India||BJD lawmaker blew off river embankment that flooded villages, claims BJP||The opposition BJP in Odisha on Monday accused a BJD MLA of blowing off a river embankment in flood-affected Jajpur district with dynamite and sought stringent action against him.BJP state general secretary Lekhasri Samantsinghar alleged that the 300-feet breach in one of the embankment of Kelua river, a distributary of Brahmani river in Jajpur district, was deliberately created by blowing it off using dynamite.“BJD MLA Pranab Balabantaray and his maternal uncle Naren Jena alias Badal Jena, who is a junior engineer, are involved in the act. An amount of Rs 24.42 crore was spent to revamp the 20-feet wide embankment last year so that it can withstand any kind of floods. The embankment was breached to embezzle the money,” alleged the BJP leader.Neither BJD MLA Balbantray nor the party commented on the allegations even as HT sought their comments.Engineer-in-chief of water resources department Jyotirmaya Rath also admitted that the breach in embankment of Kelua river was an artificial one. “An FIR has been lodged in connection with creation of the breach in Kelua river embankment using dynamite. District administration will take action,” said Rath. He added that so far 36 breaches have been created in river embankments, including 5 breaches in Mahanadi river system.The floods in Odisha have left 17 people dead and over 10,000 houses damaged while affecting 1.4 million people in 20 districts. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik who made an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas on Monday, ordered distribution of 50 kg of rice and Rs 500 to all families in the villages that have been severely affected/inundated/marooned due to the current flood. Besides, one polythene sheet will be given to each deserving household whose house has been damaged.Demanding stringent action against the Balabantaray and Jena, the BJP leader said cases should be filed against them under the Explosives Act and National Disaster Management Act for putting public lives at risk. Meanwhile, police have launched an investigation into the matter after assistant engineer of Jaraka Irrigation department Kamadev Das filed an FIR in this regard. No arrests have been made so far.Water resources department officials said as many rivers are flowing above the danger level it will take at least 12-15 hours to get drained into the sea. “Since full moon day is on September 2, draining of the water into the sea will get halted and it will take four more days for this water to get drained,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-lawmaker-blew-off-river-embankment-that-flooded-villages-claims-bjp/story-wul3k0UVLfdcRHIzp8wxZM.html
01-09-2020||India||August receives 27 per cent more rainfall, fourth highest in 120 years||The country received 27 per cent more rainfall than normal in August, the fourth highest amount in the last 120 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The overall rainfall recorded in India from June 1 to August 31 was 10 per cent more than normal, the IMD said on Monday. The official rainfall season in the country is from June 1 to September 30. “August has recorded 27 per cent more rainfall than normal,” R K Jenamani, scientist with IMD’s national weather forecasting centre, said. In its forecast for August last month, the IMD had predicted rainfall of 97 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) with an error margin of plus or minus 9 per cent. Monsoon in the range of 96-104 per cent of the LPA is considered normal. “Rainfall recorded in August 2020 is the fourth highest in the last 120 years and highest in 44 years,” Jenamani added. This is also one of the rainiest months of August recorded. The August of 1926 saw 33 per cent more rainfall than normal, the highest precipitation recorded so far in the month; 1976 recorded 28.4 per cent more rainfall than normal, while the August of 1973 recorded 27.8 per cent than normal. This year saw 27 per cent rainfall.   Mahesh Palwat, vice president, Skymet Weather, said due to formation of five low pressure areas in Bay of Bengal in August, the month recorded excess rainfall. A low pressure area is a cyclonic circulation. It is also the first stage of a cyclone. However, it is not necessary that every low pressure develops into a cyclonic storm. Jenamani said five low pressure areas formed over Bay of Bengal brought heavy rains over central and north India. Of the five, four developed into a well-marked low pressure area. Several parts of the country witnessed floods last month due to incessant rainfall last month. Jenamani said the first low pressure area formed between August 4-10 off the Odisha coast. It moved across central India and Gujarat and entered into the north Arabian Sea and dissipated over the Oman coast. The second low pressure area formed between August 9-11 off the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coast. It moved across Chhattisgarh to northeast Madhya Pradesh. Its remnant moved to northwest India, causing floods in Jaipur on August 14, he said. The third one was between August 13-18. It moved across Chhattisgarh to northeast Madhya Pradesh, but its remnant as circulation moved over to northeast Rajasthan and south Punjab during August 18-20.  This caused a major rain spell over northwest India. It was at the same time that the Delhi-NCR recorded flooding due to heavy rainfall. The fourth one formed between August 19-26 and it moved across central India to southwest Rajasthan and adjoining south Pakistan. The weather system also caused floods over Odisha on August 20-21, over Telangana including Warangal and part of Hyderabad on August 21, west Madhya Pradesh on August 22 and south Rajasthan and Gujarat on August 23 and 24. The last and the fifth system also formed between August 24-31. June had recorded 17 per cent more rainfall than normal while July ended with a 10 per cent rainfall deficiency. The IMD had predicted that July will get rainfall that is 103 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA), which falls in the “normal” category.  The LPA rainfall over the country for the 1961-2010 period is 88 centimetres. In its Long Range Forecast for rainfall in the second half (August-September) of the 2020 Southwest Monsoon released last month, the IMD said August was likely to receive rainfall that is 97 per cent of the LPA with an error margin of plus/minus nine per cent. “Quantitatively, the rainfall over the country as a whole during the second half of the season is likely to be 104 per cent of the LPA with an error margin of plus/minus eight per cent,” it had said. The northwest division of the IMD has an overall 9 per cent deficiency. It comprises Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and the Union territories of Chandigarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have recorded deficient rainfall. The central India division received 21 per cent more rainfall so far. The division comprises Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and the Union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Gujarat has recorded large excess rainfall while Goa saw excess precipitation.   The south peninsula meteorological division of the IMD has received 20 per cent more rainfall than normal. The division covers Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka and the Union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu have recorded excess rainfall. The east and northeast India division has also recorded 2 per cent more rainfall than normal. The division comprises West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and the northeastern states.  Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram recorded deficient rainfall while Sikkim has witnessed large excess.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/august-receives-27-per-cent-more-rainfall-fourth-highest-in-120-years/story-wheQzZ9nivSvoNTq7sgKBI.html

Charu Sinha, IPS officer of the 1996-batch Telangana cadre, will now be heading the Srinagar sector for CRPF as the Inspector General. This is not the first time when she has been assigned such a tough task, earlier also, she had worked as IG, the Bihar sector in CRPF and has dealt with Naxals. Under her leadership, various anti-Naxals operations were carried out. Later, she was transferred to IG Jammu in CRPF where she spent a long and successful tenure. On Monday, a fresh order came appointing her as the IG Srinagar sector.Current Director-General CRPF AP Maheshwari headed the Srinagar sector as IG in 2005.The sector, which started functioning in 2005 never had a female officer at the IG level. This sector involved in anti-terror operations and closely work with the Indian Army along with Jammu and Kashmir police.“Srinagar sector is located at Brein Nishat, Srinagar (J-K).

01-09-2020||India||Stickler for protocol: When Pranab Mukherjee snubbed Obama and Erdogan||Former President Pranab Mukherjee was a stickler for protocol. He stuck to not sidestepping procedure even if it meant turning down special requests, which could, in diplomatic subtext, be read as snubs. Consequently, there was a kerfuffle when he refused to visit the then Prime Minister of Turkey Tayyip Erdoğan during a visit to Istanbul in 2013. Erdogan had suggested that Mukherjee call on him instead of the other way round. “He was conscious of the fact that he was the President of India and the etiquette that had to be shown to his position could not be compromised. So when a senior officer of the Indian Foreign Service suggested that Mukherjee should put aside protocol and visit the PM; he was furious. He refused to call on the PM and asserted that the protocol of a PM calling on a President be followed. The officer got a dressing down for suggesting otherwise,” recalled Maj Gen Anil Khosla who served as Mukherjee’s military secretary. Mukherjee’s visit to Turkey came after a 15-year long hiatus, where he held long meetings on India-Turkey relations. In 2017, he hosted Erdogan, now the President of Turkey at Rashtrapati Bhavan and hosted the customary official dinner known as the Banquet in honour of the visiting President and First Lady Emine Erdoğan.

In 2015, when the secret service, known for its unmoving and impenetrable security cover for the US President, arrived at Rashtrapati Bhavan with an invitation for Mukherjee to join United States President Barack Obama in his ‘beast’ (the US presidential state car) , the answer was an emphatic and spontaneous “no”. Obama was the guest of honour at the Republic Day parade and, as per tradition, the two dignitaries were expected to show up for the regalia in the President’s car. While the US authorities insisted on Obama travelling in the beast that was specially flown to India; Mukherjee opted for the safety of his own Limousine. Also Read: ‘True friend’: Sheikh Hasina condoles Pranab Mukherjee’s death in letter to PM Modi“Eventually after a bit of back and forth, the two leaders travelled in separate cars and Obama reached a few minutes ahead of the President,” Khosla recalled. The absolute adherence to protocol, to laid-down strictures was hallmark Mukherjee, said former bureaucrat Thomas Mathew, who served as his additional secretary. Turning down mercy petitions had fetched the former President some unfavourable and uncharitable remarks by the commentariat. Those opposed to the death penalty, in particular, made snide remarks on social media. After he turned down the mercy pleas of Ajmal Kasab, accused of carrying out the attack of 26/1 and Afzal Guru, who was convicted for his role in the 2001 Parliament attack, they alleged that the President had turned the Mughal Garden into a hanging garden.“He wanted to be kind and he wanted to ensure that there is justice. If there were issues where he felt that the case had been considered in depth by the Supreme Court, he did not want to interfere. But in cases where he felt that the Supreme Court had looked at it legally and human accentuating factors had not been considered; and because of the authority vested in him to consider such cases by the Constitution, even after the Supreme Court had given its decision, he gave it to the home ministry for further consideration,” Mathew said. Also Read: Farewell, Pranab daDuring his presidency, Mukherjee cleared petitions that had been pending from 2000; rejecting 28 of the 32 mercy petitions. “While officials or politicians not knowing their history or facts would rile him; what upset him the most was not being able to complete his walk. He used to set a target to cover a certain distance in a specific time frame, and even if he missed it by a minute, he would be in a foul mood for slowing down,” Khosla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stickler-for-protocol-when-pranab-mukherjee-snubbed-obama-and-erdogan/story-yTpIoAltki6mbnSyRct89H.html

CDMB authorities will allow online darshan in the revered shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri in a bid to keep the viral infection at bay.Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer (CEO), CDMB, said, “Initially, online darshan will be available for the Badrinath shrine, where cameras are being installed.”Raman said the cameras and other equipment are being installed by a telecom company for free of cost. “The equipment is being installed by the company as per a CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiative, but they will be owned by the board. Work has started in Badrinath and it will be followed by the Kedarnath shrine. However, the process may take a while, as the heavy equipment needed to be lugged to a higher altitude at the height of the monsoon season,” said Raman.The CEO, an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) official, said that after the work is completed, images and videos of the four shrines would be live-streamed on several websites. “The live streaming will be done on the board’s or the chief minister’s website and also via social media platforms,” he said. Raman said the online darshan initiative would be reviewed after the viral outbreak subsides.“This is not a permanent arrangement. We will stop the online initiative after normalcy returns in a post Covid-19 world,” he added.The CDMB data showed that 21,670 pilgrims visited the Char Dham portals until August 30. The CDMB authorities said 10,899 and 6,491 devotees visited Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines, respectively, until August 30. Badrinath and Kedarnath portals were opened for the public on May 15 and April 29, respectively. While the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines have reported 3,837 and 533 pilgrims, respectively, after their portals were opened on April 26. The authorities maintained that the virtual inflow of pilgrims is much less this year because of the contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cameras-installed-at-badrinath-dham-for-online-darshan-amid-pandemic/story-u5PtYBhSuz8MF5iOqYVIgI.html
01-09-2020||India||Ola, Uber strike: Lukewarm response to protest; Delhi services not hit||A protest planned by a section of drivers of application (app)-based ride-hailing taxi services at Mandi House in central Delhi on Tuesday morning evoked a lukewarm response, as vehicles were largely available for commuters in the national capital.The protesting cab drivers are demanding an extension of the moratorium on loan repayment of their cars, which lapsed on August 31 (Monday) and also a hike in fare because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Though the stir was planned at 10 am on Tuesday, no cab driver or taxi union leader were present at the scheduled protest site outside Himachal Bhawan in Mandi House until 11.30 am. Kamaljeet Singh Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers’ Association of Delhi, said the union is trying to convince cab drivers to join the protest. The cab drivers’ tepid response to the protest was a blessing in disguise for commuters.Puneet Sachdeva, who arrived at Arwachin Public School in east Delhi’s Vivek Vihar for his Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main that started at 7:30 am on Tuesday, said he had pre-booked the cab through the ride-hailing app aggregator Uber and it arrived on time. “I had read about Tuesday’s cab strike in the media. I was worried that my cab booking would get cancelled. But, fortunately, the driver turned up on time for the pick up,” he said. Devika Kashyap, another commuter, said she was able to book a cab to go to her office in Green Park in south Delhi. “But the fare was a little higher than usual. I paid around Rs 50 more than what I usually pay for the same distance,” she said. Gill, a leader of one of the cab drivers’ associations, said, “Drivers are unable to pay their EMIs (equated monthly installments) because of the acute financial crisis caused due to the Covid-19-induced 68-day lockdown restrictions. The moratorium of loan repayment lapsed on August 31 and the banks are putting pressure on us to pay EMIs. Drivers are scared that banks will tow away their vehicles for default in the payment of their EMIs.”Tuesday’s protest, which some cab drivers claimed could turn into a strike, had also found support from the Delhi Taxi, Tourist Transporters and Tour Operators’ Association. Sanjay Samrat, president of the association, said cab drivers have also demanded the withdrawal of “heavy penalties” against them for the violation of the maximum speed limit. “The cab drivers will assemble near Himachal Bhawan at Mandi House on Tuesday to seek the Central government’s action on their demands,” he said.The ride-hailing app aggregators such as Ola and Uber refused to comment on the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ola-uber-strike-lukewarm-response-to-protest-delhi-services-not-hit/story-SRiVE1Lqfr3IGMphFQBt6K.html
01-09-2020||India||‘Economy is stressed’: Centre to SC on interest on loans during moratorium||Indian economy is “stressed”, the Central government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday, stating that issues relating to levy of interest on loans in moratorium and interest on such interest requires detailed consideration by the Centre, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Bankers Association.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the Centre, the RBI and the Bankers Association should be allowed to “put their heads together” and come up with a solution.“There are issues. The economy is stressed. This requires some discussion. What I am suggesting is to allow the Centre, RBI and Bankers Association to put our heads together. We will have to identify the class of borrowers, sectors, etc which will take a hit,” Mehta said.The court was hearing a plea for waiver on interest charged by banks, citing the relief earlier announced by the RBI on the payment of equated monthly instalments (EMIs) between March and August 31 due to the pandemic.The plea by Agra resident Gajendra Sharma specifically cited the RBI’s March 27 notification announcing a moratorium on loan repayments while permitting banks to levy interest. The notification to the extent of allowing levy of interest was challenged by Sharma.Mehta told the court on Monday that the moratorium period is extendable by two years as per the RBI circular. The moratorium announced by the RBI had expired on August 31.During the last hearing, the Court had asked the Centre to file an affidavit in the matter instead of relying on the RBI’s affidavit and “hiding behind RBI”.The court was informed by Mehta that the Union government filed its affidavit on Monday.The matter was adjourned for detailed hearing tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economy-is-stressed-centre-to-sc-on-interest-on-loans-during-moratorium/story-KNyDlqEnY85b8aS0ganuPM.html

01-09-2020||India||Suga leads Japan PM race as ruling party plans slimmed-down leadership vote||Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, moved a step closer to becoming the next premier after the ruling party decided on Tuesday on a slimmed-down leadership vote that favours the long-time lieutenant of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Suga has also won the backing of the largest faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), media reported, making him a strong front-runner to replace Abe, who abruptly announced on Friday he was stepping down for health reasons.Suga has not publicly announced his candidacy for leader of the LDP but has indicated privately that he intends to run, a source told Reuters. Media reported he would formally announce his intention to run on Wednesday.The party’s leader will almost certainly become prime minister because of its majority in the lower house of parliament. Suga, 71, is widely expected to stay the policy course set out by Abe, including the “Abenomics” strategy aimed at reviving the economy and keeping it afloat amid the Covid-19 pandemic. A self-made politician, Suga was chosen by Abe in 2012 for the pivotal role of chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and riding herd on bureaucrats.Suga’s most likely rivals for the top spot will be former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida.The LDP general council’s decision to keep rank-and-file party members out of the leadership vote gives Suga, with his powerful backers, a leg-up in the race. Ishiba, who is more popular with voters, as well as hundreds of other party members had opposed the format.“I think that both for democracy and for the party, this is something that should not be,” Ishiba said on TV Asahi. AVOID POLITICAL VACUUMLDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, whose faction is backing Suga, said a simplified vote, by party MPs from both chambers of parliament and heads of local chapters, would be taken in the interest of speed.“We must elect a new leader as soon as possible to avoid creating a political vacuum,” Nikai told reporters.LDP General Council chief Shunichi Suzuki said the vote was unanimous, with some worrying that a prolonged process would place a burden on Abe’s health.“If we hold a full-spec election, it would take two months to complete,” he told reporters, adding that policymaking on budget and coronavirus measures would also suffer.On Monday, younger LDP legislators had met with Nikai to present a demand from more than 140 MPs and about 400 local party lawmakers for a full-scale vote. Several local chapters including Osaka had also demanded the same.The LDP is expected to hold its leadership vote on Sept. 14, with an official announcement due on Wednesday.Financial markets also favour and appear to have factored in a win by Suga.“He is considered to be a very effective policy leader within the party and bureaucracy ... and was key to Abe’s successful tenure,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.“Suga’s experience with the virus situation, including his appropriate push-back on complete shutdowns, is key, as this is Japan’s greatest concern right now,” he added.Other possible contenders are Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defence Minister Taro Kono, who both said on Tuesday they had not yet decided whether to run, while former cabinet minister Seiko Noda said she would not run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suga-leads-japan-pm-race-as-ruling-party-plans-slimmed-down-leadership-vote/story-mrEWGj4NEBAJacd6yguKWM.html

Even cancer can be cured by consuming toddy regularly. It was once considered to be poor man’s liquor, but now even people travelling in Mercedes Benz cars are showing interest in consuming toddy,” Goud said, adding that the Telangana government had been promoting toddy tapping as a profession.This is not the first time that the excise minister has pitched for the consumption of toddy. In May, Goud announced that toddy tappers would be permitted to sell toddy as an alternative to liquor in all the districts, in the wake of closure of wine shops during Covid-19 pandemic.In June, the minister announced the introduction of Neera, a palm-wine, which is an unfermented form of toddy, and its by-products manufactured by Telangana Palm Neera and Palm Products Research Foundation.“Neera helps dissolve kidney stones, help in dealing with diabetes and keep the urinary tract in perfect health. It will also help boost immunity and reduce constipation. Nutrients in Neera such as potassium and iron will help reduce pulmonary problems,” he said.Stating that Neera is helpful in treating migraine and reducing body heat, Goud said the government would encourage manufacture of more Neera by-products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-cancer-can-be-cured-by-consuming-toddy-regularly-telangana-minister/story-koFhTDTklpAiSDYeL2bsFP.html

The Indian Army has also matched weapons and blunted the Chinese offensive both at south of Pangong Tso and Rezang La by a counter-offensive mounted by the Special Frontier Forces,” said a senior military official.As of now, both the armies are matching each other in strength with the Indian Army present in strength to repel any Chinese aggression along the 1,597 km Line of Control (LAC) in Ladakh.Also Read: Forget disengagement, China opens new front along LACThe Indian counter-offensive has ensured that its troops are now dominating heights along its side of the LAC and monitoring the Chinese movement. “The situation is dire and the possibility of escalation cannot be ruled out as Chinese PLA under instruction of Beijing is going all out to push the Indian Army,” said a second senior military commander.While military-to-military and diplomatic channels are open between the two countries, fact is India is now facing China which believes that it is a global superpower and wants to make its posturing in Ladakh to send a message to its adversaries elsewhere.“The Chinese president is in the Middle-Kingdom mode and will continue to deepen the difference on the LAC. It is deliberately trying to push the Indian Army into reaction without caring a damn that this might lead to serious blood-letting. The Chinese aggressive posture will continue till the November US Presidential elections as there is no other country which is willing to take on Beijing,” said a China watcher.There is a glimmer of hope for peace if the meeting between Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi happens on the side-lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ministerial meet in Moscow. But any further escalation from the PLA will end up scuttling any diplomatic initiative.Even as the PLA aggression in Ladakh is on, national security planners in Delhi are monitoring all moves with clear-cut directions that there should be no territorial compromise in Ladakh or anywhere along the 3,488 km LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-border-situation-critical-in-ladakh-after-pla-aggression-in-chushul/story-4zTfnLKDqoWFuKlkxOX8OJ.html

01-09-2020||India||‘Something is on’: Official on Maoist leader Ganapathi’s offer to surrender||Top Maoist leader Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathi, said to be in his 70s, who led the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) for over one-and-a-half decades has offered to surrender to the Telangana police, highly placed sources in the intelligence department said.According to sources, Ganapathi had offered to surrender to the police through some Telangana Rashtra Samithi leaders close to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. The surrender is likely to materialise in a couple of days.Incidentally, both Ganapathi and KCR are from the erstwhile combined district of Karimnagar in the northern Telangana. The Maoist leader carries a reward of Rs 1.50 crore on his head.It is learnt Ganapathi has decided to surrender owing to his ill-health. He is said to be suffering from asthma, diabetes and also severe joint pains. Though he is still part of the central committee of the Maoist party, he had not been very active in the movement and had been hiding in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, sources said.Senior police officers posted in Chhattisgarh also claimed that they had specific information about the surrender of Ganapathi. “We cannot confirm the surrender but something is happening. There is buzz about this surrender among the Maoist leaders of Chhattisgarh and we have been told something has happened in Telangana,” said a senior IPS officer on condition of anonymity.Ganapathi, who was instrumental in building the Maoist movement across the country, played a major role in the formation of CPI (Maoist) with the merger of CPI (ML-People’s War Group) and the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) in 2004. He had been the general secretary of the party since then till he stepped down to pave way for Namballa Kesava Rao alias Baswaraj, 63, to take over the reins of the party in November 2018. Baswaraj was heading the central military commission and People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army of the party then.Apparently, Ganapathi was asked to step down from the general secretary post as part of restructuring of the central committee and also because of age and ill-health.Hailing from an agriculturists’ family in Birpur village of Telangana’s Jagtial district (erstwhile part of Karimnagar), Ganapathi is a graduate in science and worked as a teacher before joining the Naxalite movement during the Jagtial peasants’ movement in the late 1970s.A close follower of Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, the founder of CPI (ML-People’s War Group), Ganapathi rose to the top ranks within a decade and established contacts with international Maoist organisations. He is seen as an ideologue of the Maoist movement in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/something-is-on-official-on-maoist-leader-ganapathi-s-offer-to-surrender/story-QQitoNaSZDZS9ou6IcEyfN.html
01-09-2020||India||Supreme Court gives telecom companies 10 years to clear AGR dues||The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the telecom companies 10 years to repay Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues which run into about Rs 1.6 lakh crore.While reducing the time period, the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra issued following directions: The telecom firms will have to pay 10 per cent of dues by 2021 due to Covid-19 and the rest can be paid in instalments by March 31, 2031.In the event of default, the company will be punishable for contempt of court, the bench said.On the point as to whether spectrum can be sold by the telecom companies facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the bench asked the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to decide whether spectrum can be subject matter of resolution process.The top court had in October 2019 delivered the verdict on the AGR issue for calculating government dues of telecom companies, such as Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices, as licence fee and spectrum usage charges.Later, the department of telecommunications (DoT) had in March this year moved a plea seeking permission for staggered payment in a time period of nearly 20 years for the telecom companies. But the court had earlier observed that the request of telecom companies seeking 20 years for the payment of AGR dues in a staggered manner was unreasonable.On August 21, the top court had directed the DoT to apprise it the basis of spectrum sharing done by telecom companies and how much is the liability of the sharers.The top court asked the DoT secretary to file a specific affidavit apprising it about who was using the spectrum from the date of grant of license and from which date the respective sharing of spectrum has taken place.The Centre had earlier told the top court there was a difference of opinion between two of its ministers (DoT and the ministry of corporate affairs) on the issue of sale of spectrum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-10-years-time-for-telecom-companies-to-clear-agr-dues/story-rqSmubVZ85AXXymNMC2oCO.html
01-09-2020||India||‘Kafeel Khan’s speech didn’t promote hatred’: HC orders his release, says invoking NSA illegal||The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday ordered the release of Dr Kafeel Khan, detained in December last year for his speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The court said that Khan’s speech did not promote any kind of hatred or violence.After his detention, the Uttar Pradesh government had invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against Khan. However, the court said that imposing the stringent act was illegal based on the grounds submitted by the authorities.The doctor has been in jail since January 29 for allegedly delivering a provocative speech at the Aligarh Muslim University on December 10, 2019, during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests.The high court bench comprising chief justice Govind Marhur and justice Saumitra Dayal Singh allowed the habeas corpus writ petition filed by the doctor’s mother Nuzhat Perween seeking his release and stated that Khan’s speech did not promote any kind of hatred or violence.“A complete reading of the speech also no where threatens peace and tranquility of the city of Aligarh. The address gives a call for national integrity and unity among the citizens. The speech also deprecates any kind of violence. It appears that the District Magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent,” the judgement read. Also, according to the habeas corpus petition, the doctor was granted bail by a competent court and was supposed to be released on bail. However, he was not released for four days and later the NSA was imposed on him. Hence, his detention was illegal as it was passed to nullify the effect of the bail granted by a competent court.Khan had earlier hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, in which several children died due to lack of oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-high-court-orders-release-of-up-doctor-kafeel-khan-detained-under-nsa/story-UTEZKhovqJKHBTGVtbB5CI.html
01-09-2020||India||‘Negotiations should not be held hostage’: India, 3 others on UNSC reform||India has joined hands with Brazil, Germany and Japan to call for expediting the process for reforming the UN Security Council, with the four countries saying that inter-governmental negotiations on the issue have dragged on for more than a decade without substantial progress.The four countries, also known as G4, outlined their position in a common letter submitted to the President of the UN General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, on Monday. They demanded action for transforming the UN Security Council in line with “Common African Position”, and said negotiations shouldn’t be held “hostage, procedurally and substantially, by those who do not wish to bring about reform”.India’s letter, submitted by the deputy permanent representative to the UN, K Nagaraj Naidu, referred to the draft decision regarding roll-over of the inter-governmental negotiations on equitable representation and increase in the membership of the Security Council, and said this process “must capture clearly the tangible progress” made in two meetings held earlier this year.The letter said clear progress was made in the negotiations this year with member states backing the “Common African Position” as laid down in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, and the “urgent need for transparency and application of the General Assembly’s rules of procedure to the inter-governmental negotiations”.The Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, containing the common African position on reform of the UN Security Council, were developed by a committee on UN reform established by the African Union Summit in 2005. “The growing support for the Common African Position has, in fact, been reinforced not in one but multiple forums, and from multiple groups,” the letter said. The concept was also backed by the Non-Aligned Movement, comprising 120 states, in October 2019 and by G4 in a foreign ministers’ joint statement in September 2019. “Consequently, it is only correct and fair that the growing support expressed for the Common African Position in the two meetings of the [inter-governmental negotiations] earlier this year are captured in the body of the roll-over decision. Otherwise, we will be in the danger of endorsing an incorrect perspective of this year’s work and give an impression that nothing has transpired,” the letter said.The letter also emphasised the need to redress the “historical injustice against Africa” and to “ensure better African representation in a reformed Security Council in line with the Common African Position”. India and the three other countries also expressed their concerns about the inter-governmental negotiations since 2009, saying “there has been practically no progress in the discussions”. “Even the discussions are dubbed as informal and the UNGA rules of procedure do not apply. In eleven years, the situation has not changed. There has been no attempt to capture the discussions in a single consolidated text for negotiations,” the letter said. “In fact, the [inter-governmental negotiations] process has become a convenient smokescreen to hide behind for those who do not wish to see any reform in the Security Council. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that the process is not held hostage, procedurally and substantially, by those who do not wish to bring about reform in the Security Council,” it further said. “If this happens, and there are indications that this is already happening, those who demand reform will be forced to look for other ways to achieve the same end outside the [inter-governmental negotiations] process,” it added.The letter also noted UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ call on July 18 for reform of the Security Council. It quoted him as saying, “The nations that came out on top more than seven decades ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions...Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negotiations-should-not-be-held-hostage-india-3-others-on-unsc-reform/story-SrJ6YFBHWYjyqHVzM2W8zM.html
01-09-2020||India||Unlock 4 begins: Here’s a look at everything that has changed from September 1||The fourth phase of the relaxations in Covid-19 curbs came into effect from Tuesday (September 1). Called Unlock 4, this phase seeks to bring the normal life across the country to pre-coronavirus levels.In the guidelines announced for Unlock 4, the Centre has allowed resumption of metro services and cancelling the requirements for e-passes for inter-district travel.Schools and colleges too will remain closed. The Centre has asked the state governments to not enforce lockdown without prior consultation. But, some state governments have taken to extend the existing curbs.For example, the Delhi government on Monday decided to maintain status quo on prohibited activities till September 2 in the national capital.In an order, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority said the government reviewed the present Covid-19 situation and it has been considered to continue the restrictions on those activities which are presently not permitted in the city.While gyms have not been allowed to reopen in the city, weekly markets have been allowed to function on a trial basis till September 6.Maharashtra, which has seen the highest number of Covid-19 cases, lifted restriction on inter-district movement of persons and goods, and said e-pass will not be required for undertaking such a journey from September 2.At the same time, the government said the general lockdown in the state will continue till September 30 as part of efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19.The state government has also raised attendance in its offices and allowed hotels and lodges to operate at 100 per cent capacity from September 2, but schools, colleges, cinema halls and swimming pools will continue to remain closed till September 30.In Tamil Nadu, all the places of worship will open from today. “Under relaxed norms, no complete lockdown will be enforced on Sundays in September. E-pass system for inter-district travel will be discontinued. All places of worship, hotels and resorts have been allowed to re-open,” chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said.In Odisha, the state government on Monday lifted lockdown restrictions for September and announced its guidelines for Unlock 4. Open air theatres will be allowed to open in the state after September 21. The state government’s order said that no authority shall impose any local lockdown at district, sub-division, city or below levels outside the containment zones. However, whenever required in the interest of containment of the disease and prevention of the spread of infection, restrictions on mobility, congregation, operation of shops and establishments, offices and other activities may be imposed in consultation with the central government, Chief Secretary A K Tripathy said in an order.The places which will remain closed to the public in Odisha include religious places, cinema halls, swimming pools, entertainment complexes, auditoria and assembly halls. These will remain closed till September 30.Meanwhile, in West Bengal, the state government has taken a cautious approach in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Complete lockdown will be imposed across the state on September 7, 11 and 12 to contain the spread of the infection, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Monday.The order issued by Sinha also said lockdown will be extended in containment zones in West Bengal till September 30.The Madhya Pradesh government on Monday announced withdrawal of statewide lockdown on Sundays, but cinema halls and swimming pools will continue to remain shut till September 30.Covid-19 testing will not be mandatory for all those wishing to enter Goa from September 1 and the bars-restaurants can open although they will have to follow the guidelines issued by the Uniojn home ministry, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday.Here’s a look at things allowed by the home ministry during Unlock 4:• The Delhi Metro is expected to resume its services for public from September 7, in a ‘phased manner’, as per the Union home ministry’s guidelines. Further details on the functioning and usage of the metro by the public will be shared soon in detail. The authorities are working to ensure that all the Covid-19 protocols are in place before the operations resume. The passengers will be undergo thermal scanning before boarding the metro.• Bars, which have been shut since March, will also open from September 1.• In a significant directive, the home ministry said that state governments shall not impose any local lockdown outside the containment zones without prior consultation with the central government.• The latest guidelines will allow gathering with more number of people. All the social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions will be permitted with a ceiling of 100 people, though this will come into effect from September 21.• However, the ban on international commercial passenger flights to and from India has been extended till September 30, barring exceptions mentioned by the government. The restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights, according to the office of Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Schools and colleges will remain closed during the Unlock 4 period. However, students from Classes 9 to 12 will be allowed to visit schools in areas outside the containment zones only on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-4-begins-here-s-a-look-at-everything-that-has-changed-from-september-1/story-f230gINeXdDEsAs888B5oI.html
01-09-2020||India||MHA asks states to create SOPs to combat crimes against weaker sections||The ministry of home affairs has asked all the states and union territories to formulate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for combating crimes against weaker sections of the society, including women, children and scheduled castes/scheduled tribes, and to prevent their victimisation. In a detailed communication, reviewed by HT, the states/UTs have been asked to evolve a coordination mechanism among various departments in their jurisdiction to strengthen the law enforcement response when it comes to vulnerable sections and sensitise officers at all levels. Issued with the approval of home minister Amit Shah, the MHA letter suggests some steps which states may take while forming the SOPs, such as setting up a response mechanism to promptly deal with incidents of crime against vulnerable, oppressed and deprived sections of society; identifying crime prone areas and then monitoring them constantly. The MHA has recommended that an adequate number of cops should be deployed in crime prone areas for vulnerable sections. It has said that there should be intensive patrolling in hot-spots; especially in the locality of the weaker sections, which should be visited by senior police officers periodically to instill a sense of safety and security among the people. The police patrolling should be increased during night; number of police help booths, especially in remote/lonely stretches should be increased and number of female cops be increased in mobile police vans. The home ministry also feels there is a need to sensitise the whole law enforcement machinery through structured training of cops at all levels.Importantly, state/UT governments have been asked to take adequate measures for the economic and social rehabilitation of the victims of crime particularly women, SCs/STs and other weaker sections. To stop child trafficking, bonded labour and domestic servitude, the MHA has asked states to ensure that all placement agencies are registered and conduct round the clock surveillance of railway stations and bus stands. The ministry, in March this year, released Rs 100 crore to all states/UTs for upgrading and establishing Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs). The police particularly have been asked to make sure there is no delay in registering an FIR in all cases of crimes against women, children and SCs/STs as well as widely disseminate the pan-India Emergency Response Support System helpline number 112 in schools, colleges, hospitals, taxi stands, cinema halls etc.“Cases should be promptly investigated and a chargesheet against the accused filed promptly,” the MHA note says. It has further asked states to sensitise the law enforcement agencies about amendments in the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in 2018, in which section 18A has been inserted to remove the clause where a preliminary enquiry was earlier required before filing an FIR. “Enforcement agencies should be instructed in unambiguous terms that enforcement of rights of the weaker and vulnerable sections including SC, ST, women and children should be ensured. Police should play a more proactive role in detection and investigation of crimes against women,” the ministry added. All the states/UTs have been asked to submit an action taken report (ATR) in this regard. Beena Pallical, General Secretary of Dalit Arthik Adhikar Andolan (DAAA), said - “It’s an excellent direction given by the Centre to states. This will really help in implementation of various legal provisions for vulnerable sections, particularly the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. We see thousands of atrocities against Adivasis and Dalits which should be controlled by the states after this notification. States will have to take responsibility towards the weaker sections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-create-sops-to-combat-crimes-against-weaker-sections/story-s0jSpzQrHQb87aShoRCk5K.html
01-09-2020||India||India records nearly 70,000 new cases of Covid-19, tally close to 3.7 million||The number of the coronavirus disease cases reached close to 3.7 million in India after 69,921 new cases surfaced on Tuesday.According to Union health ministry update, there are 7,85,996 active cases of the disease while 28,39,882 patients have been discharged.The country recorded 819 fatalities according to the health ministry data, which pushed the death toll to 65,288.The ministry had said on Monday that the country’s recovery rate has increased to 76.62 per cent, while the fatality rate has declined to 1.78 per cent.The last five lakh recoveries have been recorded in only eight days in comparison to preceding same number of recoveries, which were recorded in 10 and nine days respectively, the ministry said.The health ministry stressed that more than 70 per cent of the deaths occurred due to comorbidities.Meanwhile, the Centre is focussing on the states which are witnessing a sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. According to the health ministry, central teams will be deployed in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where spikes have been recorded.It asserted that the teams will support the states’ efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management of positive cases.The teams will also guide the states in effectively managing the challenges related to timely diagnosis and follow up, the ministry said in a statement.Each of the multi-sectoral teams will comprise an epidemiologist and a public health expert.Of these four states, Uttar Pradesh has the maximum number of active cases, followed by Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-nearly-70-000-new-cases-of-covid-19-tally-crosses-3-7-million/story-Pmz8U8BzQrfsxQCQ4a07mO.html
01-09-2020||India||Mask use can prevent 200k Covid deaths in India: Study||Widespread use of masks and maintaining social distancing measures can prevent at least 200,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related deaths by December 1, shows a new modelling of the pandemic in the country. The new data, which was released last Saturday, has underlined the critical need for the public to comply with the use of face masks, maintain social distancing norms and other Covid-19 guidelines issued by the government to prevent the spread of the contagion. “Meta analysis of individual studies has shown that masks can reduce disease transmission by 40% for individuals and in aggregate at population level you can see results for India. The use of masks doesn’t impede any economic activity. Besides, it’s extremely cost-effective,” said Dr Christopher Murray from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, which has done the modelling of the viral outbreak. “The masks don’t need to be high-end ones such as N-95. Cloth masks will do just fine,” he added. In the worst-case scenario, India may report 492,380 Covid-19 deaths by December 1 because of easing of lockdown restrictions and the use of masks at the current level, the modelling has forecast.If the healthcare crisis deepens, 13 states are staring at over 10,000 Covid-19-related deaths each by December 1, the modelling has warned.Now, only Maharashtra – the epicentre of the viral outbreak in the country – has reported over 10,000 deaths because of the contagion and it’s toll tally is 23,775. The data from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) showed that 62,550 Covid-19 patients have succumbed to their viral infection.In the best-case scenario, the deaths can potentially come down to 2,91,14, the modelling has suggested. However, it has recommended certain dos and don’ts for the Covid-19-related toll tally to improve.To begin with, the use of masks must go up to 95% coupled with reimposition of a six-week lockdown in states if the daily death rate in a state exceeds eight per million population . In the best-case scenario, the model predicts at least eight states are likely to cross 10,000 Covid-19 deaths by December 1. Andhra Pradesh (19,685), Karnataka (31,001), Kerala (11,602), Maharashtra (85,686), Punjab (16,404), Tamil Nadu (24,592), Uttar Pradesh (21,524) and West Bengal (22,053) have been projected to report these fatalities due to the viral infection by December 1. The data scientists in the paper agree that India’s response to Covid-19 has produced some significant successes that highlight the opportunity to restrict the pandemic’s toll in the country. In some urban areas, including Delhi, containment measures such as intensive contact tracing, ramping up of daily testing mechanism, wearing of masks, and maintaining social distancing norms have helped reduce the spread of the contagion. Initially, IHME had started modelling the epidemic in the United States of America (USA) in March. Later, it was expanded to other countries in Europe and Latin America, and now they cover most nations in the world with epidemics of any size, including India. “In terms of average error for forecast, we have the smallest error, of about 20% at 10 weeks, among the models. We update our models every week, for every country, as it is important to understand many aspects of the epidemic. It’s important to stay on top of it,” said Murray. Epidemiologists said that these estimates are aligned with the available evidence on the use of masks. “Their estimates suggest that we might be saving at least 419 deaths per day from a month now, if we were to mandate universal use of masks. It is not only intuitive but aligned with overall evidence that we have so far,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, head, life course epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-use-can-prevent-200k-covid-deaths-in-india-study/story-y525iKAHAJdJiZVz0wySwI.html

01-09-2020||India||Supreme Court judgment today on payment of AGR dues||The Supreme Court (SC) will pronounce its verdict on Tuesday on whether to allow telecom companies, or telcos, to makes staggered payment of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.The judgment will be pronounced at 11.30am by a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra.Major telcos, including Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel, owe substantial amounts to the Department of Telecom (DoT).The total liability on Vodafone-Idea is Rs58,254 crore out of which it has paid more than Rs7,000 crore, while over Rs50,000 crore is the outstanding amount. Bharti Airtel had a total liability of Rs43,980 crore, out of which it has cleared more than Rs18,000 crore and is yet to pay Rs25,976 crore.The apex court in its judgment delivered on October 24, 2019, had upheld the interpretation given to the definition of AGR by the DoT and included revenues from various heads for calculation of the dues while imposing a cumulative burden of over 1.69 lakh crore on 16 telcos.Review petitions against the judgment were dismissed by the apex court on January 16.Later, the DoT itself had approached the SC in March seeking permission to allow the telcos to pay outstanding AGR dues to the tune of 1.43 lakh crore in annual instalments over a period of 20 years.DoT had argued that if as a consequence of the judgement, any of the major service providers face the most drastic consequence of proceedings under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, then the consumers would be jeopardised because porting of mobile numbers from non-operational to operational service providers would take considerable time leading to disruption of services. It was submitted that competition in the telecom sector and quality of services given by mobile companies would be adversely impacted and it would lead to loss of direct and indirect employment besides negatively impacting foreign investment sentiment.During the course of the hearing, telcos sought 15 years to complete the payment.The SC had on July 20 reserved its verdict on whether to allow the prayer to make payment in instalments. Later, the court also heard the matter separately with respect to the companies under liquidation and the recovery of amounts from them.Out of 1.43 lakh crore outstanding dues, Rs38,959 crore are due from four companies which are under liquidation. Reliance Communication (R-Comm), which is one of the companies under insolvency, alone owes more than Rs25,000 crore out of the Rs38,959 crore due from the four bankrupt telcos.The court considered the question of whether spectrum could be sold or assigned under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The court had during the hearing expressed its reservations that subjecting spectrum to resolution process under IBC could result in government dues being wiped out.The telcos have maintained that though they do not have ownership of spectrum, and they can transfer the same under contract.Spectrum sale is crucial for banks that are financial creditors under IBC since the value of teclos under insolvency will reduce greatly without spectrum.The court will consider whether spectrum-sharing agreements will cast additional obligation on Jio and Airtel. Jio had entered into spectrum-sharing agreement with R-Comm, while Aircel and Videocon had traded their spectrum to Airtel. The judgment on this aspect was reserved on August 24.The SC judgment is expected to clarify whether additional AGR liability will be fastened on Jio and Airtel on account of the past dues of Aircel, R-Comm and Videocon..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-judgment-today-on-payment-of-agr-dues/story-WRdjiuQDzkuX6exJ4EpPfL.html

01-09-2020||India||2 lakh Ola, Uber drivers on strike, commuters in Delhi-NCR to face problems||The drivers of cab aggregators Ola and Uber in the Delhi-NCR region are on strike from Tuesday demanding extension of the moratorium on loan repayment and a hike in fare in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Around two lakh drivers of the cab services have given the strike call as their appeals have not led to any action by the government, said Kamaljeet Singh Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi, a union of Ola-Uber drivers.“Due to the acute financial crisis caused by lockdown, drivers are unable to pay their EMIs. The moratorium of loan repayment ended today and the banks are already putting pressure on us. Drivers are scared that banks will tow away their vehicles for not paying EMIs,” Gill said on Monday.The drivers are demanding withdrawal of e-challans issued against their vehicles for speeding, according to a pamphlet circulated by them. They also want a higher commission from the cab aggregators while travelling between Delhi and NCR destinations like Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurgaon.Both Ola and Uber have so far not reacted to the strike call given by the drivers.The strike call comes at a time when other public transport systems, like metro, are not operational and buses are working at reduced capacity.“Most of the drivers are finding it difficult to feed their families at this time and have no means to fulfil their financial obligations. Unless the government helps us, there is no way we can work without fear of losing our vehicles,” Gill said.As part of the protest plan, the cab drivers will assemble near Himachal Bhawan at Mandi House on Tuesday to seek government action on their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-lakh-ola-uber-drivers-on-strike-commuters-in-delhi-ncr-to-face-problems/story-vuryKxnAGQTmNerK8j8SzO.html
01-09-2020||India||Amid apprehensions and strict protocols, JEE (Main) kicks off today||The National Testing Agency (NTA) has started conducting the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main for undergraduate engineering aspirants from Tuesday, despite protests over the safety concerns for students and others owing to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Around 858,000 students will appear for the test at 660 centres across the country between September 1 and 6.Earlier on August 25, NTA had announced that besides JEE-Main, it would also hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate medical and dental aspirants on September 13. The JEE (Main) is for admission to engineering colleges such as National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other centrally-funded technical institutes.The JEE-Main, which is being held in two shifts of morning and evening, started at 7.30am on Tuesday. The entrance exam for admission to an undergraduate degree in architecture will also be held on Tuesday.NTA and the Central government’s bid to conduct JEE-Main and NEET has sparked off a row, where the opposition parties have questioned the move amid the pandemic. However, the government has been adamant, as it has argued that the aspirants’ academic year would be in jeopardy.Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Monday appealed to all states to ensure candidates could appear for JEE-Main smoothly.“After my interactions with the chief ministers and administrative level officials of almost all the states, I can assure all the candidates and their parents/guardians that they will be provided all possible assistance. My best wishes for the bright future of all of you!” Pokhriyal tweeted on Monday evening.Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday also tweeted, saying that his ministry has allowed JEE-Main and NEET aspirants and their parents to travel by special suburban services in Mumbai on the days of the examinations. “Supporting students appearing for NEET and JEE examinations, Railways has permitted them, and their guardians to travel by special suburban services in Mumbai on exam days. General passengers are requested not to commute,” he tweeted.However, several candidates expressed apprehensions about their safety. Avya Sharma (18) a resident of east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar and a JEE-Main aspirant, said: “My father will pick and drop me to the centre since it’s unsafe to take private taxis. I will wear a mask and hand gloves, and carry a hand sanitiser. I am scared about my safety. My parents are asking me to maintain social distance norms. We cannot afford to miss the examination, despite the extraordinary circumstances.”NTA has prepared an elaborate protocol to ensure social distancing at examination centres. The authorities have increased the number of centres in a bid to maintain social distancing norms.Following are the SoPs issued by the NTA for the examination centres:Each examination centre will have the following additional inventory1) Gloves and masks for all staff on examination duty2) Gloves and masks for candidates in case they do not come with their own hand sanitiser at entry and inside the examination centres as needed.3) Spray bottles, sponges/cloth for disinfecting items such as desk/table, door handles, etc.4) Disinfectant liquid with 1% sodium hypochlorite for spraying in the examination centres5) Liquid handwash/soap in washrooms 6) Thermo guns to check temperature of candidates and all staff on dutyHow will the day begin at the examination centres?1) Examination centres’ floors and walls, doors, gates, will be cleaned with disinfectant backpack spray machines2) Candidate Seating Area to be thoroughly sanitized (desk and chair)3) All washrooms will be cleaned and sanitised4) Door handles, staircase railing, lift buttons, etc. will be disinfected 5) Wheelchairs, if present, at the examination centres will be sanitised6) Used gloves and masks will be disposed off at the end of the dayManaging candidates after entry into the examination centre:1) Staggered time slots for reporting in a bid to avoid overcrowding2) At the entry of registration room, body temperature will be recorded using thermal scanner3) Seating arrangement to comply with social distancing norm.4) An invigilator will not touch any document of the candidate.Items permitted into the examination room/hall for candidates:1) Masks2) Gloves4) Transparent water bottle5) Sanitiser6) Examination-related documentsPost-examination measures:1) The candidates will be permitted to move out in an orderly manner – one at a time.2) Volunteers will be present along the exit path to ensure orderly movement of candidates..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-apprehensions-and-strict-protocols-jee-main-kicks-off-today/story-OpfjJoC0EOFbCPb6ftIT9O.html
01-09-2020||India||‘Border not demarcated, there will be problems’: Chinese minister on LAC row||India and China need to manage and control their differences and not allow them to become conflicts, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has told a foreign audience, adding that Beijing is committed to maintaining stability along the disputed Sino-India border.China is also willing to resolve differences with New Delhi through dialogue, Wang said, adding, at the same time, that India is to blame for the tension at the border. The problems between the two countries should be placed in “appropriate places” in bilateral ties, the Chinese foreign minister further said.Wang was speaking at the prestigious French Institute of International Relations in Paris on Monday, hours after the Indian army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had accused each other of triggering a new bout of tension at the south bank of Pangong Tso and the Reqin pass near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.India said on Monday that it had pre-empted “provocative military movements” by China to change the status quo along the LAC on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, a development that widened the trust deficit between the two sides and dealt a blow to efforts to reduce tensions.The incident followed the lack of forward movement in the disengagement and de-escalation process even after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks.Meanwhile, Wang, who is on a week-long five-country Europe tour, including stops in France and Germany, gave a speech and took questions from senior European politicians and executives on China, India and the world.“China-India relations have recently attracted the attention of all parties. What I want to tell you is that China has always been committed to maintaining stability in the Sino-Indian border areas,” Wang said according to a Mandarin transcript of the interaction released by the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday.“We will not take the initiative to complicate and expand the situation. Of course, we must also firmly safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said in the lengthy response.“The border between China and India has not been demarcated, so there will always be problems of this kind. We are willing to manage various problems through dialogue with the Indian side. At the same time, these issues should be placed in appropriate places in bilateral relations,” Wang, who is also the state councilor, told his audience at the institute.Wang mentioned the meetings between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the consensus they had reached.“For example, instead of ‘dragon and elephant fighting’, ‘dragon and elephant dancing together’, ‘1 plus 1 is not equal to 2, but equal to 11’ and so on. These are all philosophical views,” he said.“For another example, the leaders of the two countries agree that cooperation between the two sides is greater than differences, and common interests are greater than contradictions. Differences must be managed and controlled, especially not allowing differences to become conflicts”.Wang said the two governments should implement the consensus reached between Xi and Modi.The two countries are “highly complementary” to each other, he said, adding: “China is willing to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries to help India accelerate its own development.”“If both China and India can develop, 2.7 billion people will move towards modernisation together. This will be an unprecedented and spectacular sight in the cause of human progress. I hope India can also view and deal with problems from this perspective,” Wang said.Disengagement between border troops had begun after a conversation between Wang and national security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on July 6 – both are also the special representatives for the ongoing border talks.Despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks following the Wang-Doval conversation, differences have remained, mirroring the trust deficit between the neighbours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/border-not-demarcated-there-will-be-problems-chinese-minister-on-lac-row/story-UAXSFMxhKfxm3EscQc4QOI.html

01-09-2020||India||August, third month of monsoon, ends with 10% excess rain||Many parts of Gujarat have reported flooding after Madhya Pradesh (MP) following extremely heavy rainfall was recorded in these areas on Sunday and Monday. Monsoon rain from June 1 until August 31 is at 10% excess in the country.A region-wise break-up of the data shows rainfall is 21% and 20% excess over central India and southern peninsula, respectively; 9% deficient over the north-west and 2% excess over east and north-east India.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said rains would gradually reduce over flood-affected regions and start picking up over northern plains, north-eastern states and parts of southern peninsula. There is no likelihood of development of any low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, and, as a result, monsoon is likely to be subdued for the coming week, it said.Parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan are affected by extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), including Jamnagar (24 cm); Jodhpur (23 cm); Dwarka (21 cm); Botad and Morbi (20 cm) each . “But we are not expecting severe floods in Gujarat because it has rained only for a day instead of persistent rains for two-three days such as in MP and Odisha. There is a mid-latitude westerly trough (low-pressure area) that is moving eastwards, while the low-pressure is over western Rajasthan that is moving further west. The convergence of the two is likely to bring heavy rains in Punjab and the adjoining region in Pakistan,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre (NWFC), IMD.“There is no likelihood of any low-pressure area developing over the Bay of Bengal for the next 10 days. So rain will be limited to the northern foothills and southern peninsula, including Kerala and Karnataka, but remain subdued over central India, which is a good thing since the region is impacted by floods. Whenever the monsoon trough moves to the north, a convergence zone develops in the extreme south peninsular region. Hence, heavy rain is likely in Kerala over the next few days,” Jenamani added.The low-pressure area over western Rajasthan, which brought floods in MP, when it was over western MP, is very likely to move northwards during the next 24 hours and become less marked thereafter. The western end of the monsoon trough lies to the south of its normal position (from Ganganagar in Rajasthan to the Bay of Bengal) and eastern end lies close to the Himalayan foothills.Due to these favourable conditions widespread to very heavy rainfall is very likely over western Rajasthan on Tuesday. Under the influence of interaction between south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea and mid-level westerly trough, widespread and heavy rain is also likely over northwest India and western Himalayan region on Wednesday and Thursday. “Under the influence of strengthening of the north-south trough along the east coast, rainfall intensity over peninsular India is very likely to increase from Tuesday. South Interior Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are very likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday, the IMD bulletin said.Persistently very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 cm, was recorded in two-three days—from August 25 to 27 in Odisha and from August 27 to 30 over MP. In MP’s Chhindwara district’s 12 weather stations recorded 20 to 41 cm of rain on August 28 to 29. While Chaurai in MP recorded 41 cm in a day, which is likely to be the highest ever recorded figure that the IMD is trying to ascertain. This spell triggered widespread flooding in MP. Eight dams in Odisha, Maharashtra, MP and Karnataka continue to be at over 100% storage capacity, according to the Central Water Commission (CWC).August received record rains at 26.3% excess, which is the highest in 44 years. The country has recorded 61.5% and 36.7% excess rainfall over central India and the southern peninsula, respectively; 19.1% deficient over east and the north-east; and 1.9% excess over north-west India.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.The impact of good monsoon rain on farmers has not been that significant, said experts. “During the initial days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, sowing was impacted due to labour shortage and market uncertainty. Now, vegetable growers are affected by severe rains that have damaged the crop in many parts of the country. Consequently, vegetable prices are likely to go up. How efficiently we have used rain water depends on how much harvesting has occurred locally. India doesn’t have large scale systems in place to harvest rainwater locally and run-off is rampant. Rainy days have reduced and extreme rainfall has increased that needs to be factored into a data analysis,” said Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Telangana.Monsoon is likely to start retreating from September 17, as per the new normal onset and withdrawal dates issued by IMD in April, as compared to September 1 until last year. IMD’s new onset dates are based on analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and withdrawal dates are based from 1971 to 2019 by its scientists in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/august-third-month-of-monsoon-ends-with-10-excess-rain/story-YIGMTCXquHuRYchWqiMx0J.html
01-09-2020||India||Ex-Assam CM Tarun Gogoi’s oxygen saturation dips; stable, say doctors||Veteran Congress leader and former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who has tested positive for coronavirus, had a sudden drop in his oxygen saturation level on Monday night. A senior doctor at the hospital told HT on Tuesday morning that the 85-year-old’s condition is stable and there’s no cause for immediate worry. “Ex-CM Tarun Gogoi who is admitted to Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) for Covid-19 had a sudden fall in oxygen saturation to 88% at 11:30 pm. The team of doctors supervising his health immediately decided to give 1 unit of plasma with 2 l of oxygen on mask. O2 saturation is now maintained between 96% and 97%,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Monday night. Gogoi, who was CM for three consecutive terms from 2001 till 2016, was tested as Covid-19 positive on August 26. The Assam government has constituted a eight-member team of doctors to monitor his health parameters regularly. “There is sometimes fluctuation in oxygen saturation levels as he is an elderly person. But right now his condition is stable and there’s no need of immediate worry. His health is being monitored frequently,” said a senior doctor at GMCH on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-assam-cm-tarun-gogoi-s-oxygen-saturation-dips-given-plasma-therapy/story-skJja9830iUZm863SHhoZK.html
01-09-2020||India||Prescriptions a hindrance to scaling up tests, say city labs||With the central and state governments pushing to scale up testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), diagnostic chiefs of approved laboratories called for the requirement of a prescription to be scrapped, arguing that a growing number of people are getting tests due to non-clinical reasons, such as for travel to other states. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research – which lays guidelines for the country’s testing strategy – RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests should be conducted among nine categories such as symptomatic people with a history of travel, hospitalised patients who develop influenza-like symptoms, and asymptomatic high-risk contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 patient. Labs need a doctor’s prescription to perform an RT-PCR test, considered the gold standard to check for Covid-19. In contrast, a rapid antigen test can be performed outside laboratories and is recommended for residents of containment zones and in hospitals. Anybody can get the test, which does not need a prescription to be performed. Citing ICMR guidelines, the Delhi government has scaled up rapid antigen tests in the city, performing about 70% of the total tests done in the city by this method. On average, Delhi has tested over 17,500 samples a day in August. Experts say the antigen test is less sensitive than the RT-PCR method, and is likely to throw up false positives. Currently, a high proportion of the RT-PCR tests are also being availed by those who need it for “non-clinical” reasons such as travel or before a surgery. “Almost 50% of the tests we are performing are for persons in need of the test for non-clinical reasons. Why do they need a prescription? And an additional step discourages more people from the more accurate RT-PCR test. It is easier to avail rapid antigen test, and the government is doing a large proportion of it for free,” said Dr Vidur Mahajan, associate director of Mahajan Imaging.“When we are reporting 70,000 and 80,000 cases of Covid-19 each day, and the country is in the process of unlocking, anybody who wants to get tested should be allowed to get tested. What is the need for a prescription? Also, now there is no shortage of kits or qualified labs to perform the test,” said Dr Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director of Lal Pathlabs, one of the largest chain of laboratories in the country. Not only does it act as a hurdle, a need for prescription means people spending more for a doctors’ consultation. “For a person who needs to get the test done because they are travelling to states like Karnataka, Uttarakhand, or Jammu and Kashmir that insist on an RT-PCR test done 72 hours prior to travel, it makes no sense to go to a doctor. They do not have symptoms that need to be examined; they do not need medical attention. However, they are forced to pay for a doctor’s consultation either online or in person,” said Dr Deepak Sadhwani, head of Prognosis laboratories. Dr Nutan Mundeja, chief of the directorate general of health services, Delhi government, told the Delhi hight court on Monday that the city-state would re-strategise the policy/plan for Covid-19 testing. “The Delhi government has said it will scale up testing further, but there is a need to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests as well. If you see, antigen tests were approved for containment zones and healthcare settings but are being utilised everywhere,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prescriptions-a-hindrance-to-scaling-up-tests-say-city-labs/story-E2ovlbD9RzKZN4qduIQ46M.html
01-09-2020||India||Need to relook Covid-19 testing strategy, experts advise Centre||Experts from Indian Public Health Association (IPHA) have recommended the Central government relook the Covid-19 testing strategy in such a way that it results in guiding the public health response and effectively limiting the spread of the disease.In a third joint statement on the Covid-19 pandemic in India, a task force of eminent public health experts has advised the government that the experience from other countries indicates that increased testing does not prevent the deaths from Covid-19.“A few countries like Japan, Sri Lanka with the lowest testing rates have the lowest fatality due to Covid-19. There is evidence from other countries too that the present testing strategies are unable to contain deaths and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,” it said.Dr Sanjay Rai, President of IPHA said: “The current benchmark for the adequacy of testing is 140 tests per million population per day, and sample positivity rate of less than five percent. In order to reach this target indiscriminate testing is being resorted to. Testing by itself is not a control strategy. Moreover, daily testing of more than one million, mostly ill-defined population, is imposing heavy economic cost without commensurate benefit for control effort.”“There is a need to relook at the testing strategy in a way that it results in guiding the public health response and effectively limiting the spread of the disease,” he said.So far, India has reported about 36 lakh Covid-19 cases with 64,469 deaths. Till date, India has conducted 4,23,07,914 tests for Covid-19, and at least 8,46,278 of those were conducted in the last 24 hours.“The testing strategies in densely populated urban areas, and the limited disease spread in rural areas must be different. In most cases, by the time the testing is done and the results are made available, the infection has already spread to close contacts. This is more pronounced in rural areas,” Dr Rai said in the report.The presence of a large number of asymptomatic cases in all states/UTs further compounds the problem of early detection as the current testing strategy does not allow for testing of asymptomatic persons unless they are close contacts of a diagnosed case, the report mentioned.A large number of tests e.g. RT-PCR, CBNAAT, TRUNAT, RAT, etc have been employed for the Covid-19 test. In order to achieve the pre-defined target, peripheral health functionaries are using whichever test is available, flouting the guidelines. For example, use of RAT in areas that are neither a containment zone nor a health facility.The strategy of “Test, Track, Treat, isolate” focusing on early identification of the cases to limit their transmission to others and also for effective clinical management is helpful when the epidemic is at its very early stage to avoid its foothold in the community.“Since the virus has already widely spread in the community in many geographical areas, the current strategy would not serve the intended objectives. Moreover, confirmed cases represent only a fraction of the total estimated cases as is indicated by sero-surveillance surveys. Hence, a greater number of tests being carried out will yield a greater number of detected cases without any benefit in reducing the deaths which should be the primary goal,” experts noted.“In areas with high incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases, all symptomatic cases should be treated on the lines of confirmed cases to isolate and treat to reduce the spread and mortality even without testing as the probability of being positive is quite high. This is the usual practice adopted during an outbreak situation. This brings efficiency in preventing the spread of infection and making it cost-effective,” it read.There is a need to re-assess the thrust on testing strategy and shift to syndromic management, especially in the high sero-prevalence states and districts for efficient management of resources.A pragmatic and differential testing strategy needs to address issues of testing high-risk populations, testing only in the early stages of the outbreak, and testing as part of monitoring. Universalization of testing may be an extremely expensive proposition and unlikely to yield any public health benefits for control strategy, the report said.A joint task force of eminent public health experts of India was constituted by IPHA, and the Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM) in April 2020 to advise the Union government for containment of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-relook-covid-19-testing-strategy-experts-advise-centre/story-kwVjBJI7rWDlXnY5gtlL0L.html
01-09-2020||India||The repository of knowledge set high standards of bipartisanism||For the long years that he was in public life, Pranab Mukherjee burnished his political savvy with sharp intellect, an exceptional sense of history, and a memory that many among his peers considered photographic.The raconteur in him would be in full flow in leisurely “addas” at the Talkatora Road bungalow that was his home for years. An academician who strayed early into politics, his stories from the past afforded a rare peep into contemporary events. The cups of tea that came didn’t always cheer; the buffet of anecdotes did! That was the time when he smoked a pipe. He was a living specimen of what Albert Einstein wrote about the tribe: “I believe that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs.”Pranab da was no Einstein, but could prove him wrong. His artful genius was evident as much after he quit smoking. When in a mood to talk, he left an abiding impression, be it public speeches or private conversations. He was outstandingly perceptive and statesmanlike when, as a minister, he addressed the Lok Sabha in a debate on Bangladeshi migrants; spoke while being the President at the relaunch of National Herald, a newspaper founded by Jawaharlal Nehru; or attended the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) function as ‘Citizen’ Mukherjee after his term at Rashtrapati Bhawan.Each of these speeches were replete with wisdom, reflecting the world view he had inherited, acquired and enriched through his innings in politics. Of particular interest in an unflattering way was his 2018 visit to the birthplace of Keshav Baliram Hedgewar before speaking at the RSS event in Nagpur. In his remarks in the visitors’ book, he called the Sangh’s founding sarsanghchalak a “great son of mother India”.That had several among his admirers shooting across the bow. His lesson in history to those who cared to ask was: Hedgewar, who died in 1940, was in the Congress till 1923, when he quit over the leadership’s approach to the Khilafat movement. He also had his hosts take him on as-is-where-is basis by not digressing from his Nehruvian convictions in his address at the RSS function.Ideology apart, Mukherjee was a deeply religious man. Yet it was difficult always to discern whether democracy’s highest temple, the Parliament, was his second or first halt.It was in fact an article on his stellar record as a parliamentarian that fetched this writer his indulgence that stayed. Highlighting the number of parliament sessions he attended without a break, HT ran the piece with the caption: “At 70, Pranab still debating”. He found apt the analogy from the gentleman’s sport of cricket. That wasn’t the least surprising. The House of Elders, where he learnt the art of debate and disagreement, was once a platform embellished by the parliamentary rigour of members such as Hiren Mukherjee, Bhupesh Gupta, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mukherjee’s healthy regard for adversarial thought saw him break protocol as President to visit the ailing Vajpayee at his residence in 2015 to confer the Bharat Ratna. Reminiscing his rookie phase, he often talked about the Communist duo’s scholarly interventions, their rapier wit, the eye for detail, and the prowess to persuade. That Mukherjee could acquire those attributes over time was acknowledged by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sumitra Mahajan, then the speaker of the Lok Sabha. At the farewell ceremony for him as President, she said: “You are a guru from whom generations of parliamentarian have received lessons… You are respected for your impeccable knowledge of parliamentary rules and procedures and exemplary memory of events and precedents.” Mukherjee’s memory recall could indeed dazzle the best of minds. Having once joined in the middle of his conversation with a journalist researching for a book, I heard him recall names of Congress Working Committee members from the 1960s onwards.He was as good with dates as with names and events. Having authored several books, he was the go-to person for politicians, academia, researchers and media persons looking for meaningful perspectives and prescient thought. As the Congress’s man for all seasons, its chief troubleshooter, his was an enviable repository of knowledge. Starting with commerce, finance, defence and external affairs, he held most key portfolios barring home.For someone who was never home minister, Mukherjee set high standards of bipartisanism by cooperating with the Vajpayee regime as the chairman of the ministry’s parliamentary Standing Committee. His interface then with the government was Arun Jaitley, who often spoke of him in glowing terms. His institutional memory of the Congress made him an equally valuable party apparatchik. When asked once by this writer about Sonia Gandhi’s strong point as a leader, he described her as a person who “listened patiently and acted consensually”. He said that her willingness to take advice lent her the strength she needed to have her way when opinion was divided.Mukherjee’s role model, however, was Indira Gandhi - as an administrator and the party chief. In a troubled mood once over the BJP’s “celebratory posturing” over ordinary foreign policy gains, Mukherjee made a revelation. By his account, Pakistan’s Zia-ul-Haq had let Indian commandos operate on his country’s soil to free an Indian Airlines plane hijacked to Lahore in the 1980s. The secret wasn’t ever let out. Why? In statecraft certain things are kept under wraps to save the helper the opprobrium at home. That leaves room for Good Samaritan diplomacy in the future. On diplomacy, another incident comes to mind. During UPA-1 Mukherjee had assured the Left parties supporting the government from outside that they would be briefed before India signs the nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That pact was among the prerequisites for setting into motion the Indo-US nuclear deal the Communist parties opposed.Then the minister for external affairs, he apparently was in the dark when our ambassador in Vienna signed the safeguards deal on February 2, 2009. This writer called him to ascertain his views, only to have the taste of his famous quick temper. He banged the receiver with a cryptic: “I’ve nothing to say… It’s not my job to save your job.” A couple of minutes later, a close aide of his was on the line, dictating his brief response — but not before apologising on his behalf for his angry first reaction. That Pranab da one will forever remember, and miss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-repository-of-knowledge-set-high-standards-of-bipartisanism/story-1V5Y6hFPysLf2wC7mApiyO.html
01-09-2020||India||Lockdown phase took severe toll on economic activity||India’s GDP contracted by 23.9% in the April-June quarter this year compared to the same period last year. This suggests that the lockdown’s toll on economic activity has been more severe than expected. A Bloomberg poll of 15 economists expected the contraction to be 19.2%. India was under an almost complete lockdown for the months of April and May. The lockdown was not the problem, but it is the manner in which it was implemented and the policy response which has followed that have made things worse, said experts. To be sure, the GDP numbers released on Monday are only the first estimates and they could be revised downwards further. This is because, the informal sector numbers, which are likely to have suffered more, will only become available at a later stage, Pranab Sen, India’s former chief statistician said. The economic contraction has affected the entire non-farm economy including the government sector. Agriculture was the only silver lining with a growth of 3.4%. Gross Value Added (GVA), which measures the value of production minus taxes contracted by 22.8%. Even the Public Administration, Defence and Other Services sub-sector, which captures spending by the government, has contracted by 10.3%. The contraction in government spending will only increase going forward as state governments are facing a severe resource crunch, said Himanshu, associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. This will only complicate the recovery going forward, he added.The expenditure side numbers suggest that both consumption and investment demand collapsed during the lockdown. Private Final Consumption Expenditure contracted by 26.7%. Gross fixed capital formation, which measures investment, suffered a contraction of 47.1%.Government Consumption Expenditure, however, grew by 16.4%. Even nominal GDP contracted by 22.6%, which means that the base of tax collection will shrink. ‘The fact that wholesale price indices are in contraction mode should have left no doubt that producer prices are declining. This is bound to show in nominal growth numbers, said Pranab Sen. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser (CEA), ministry of finance said the economic performance in the April-June quarter is primarily due to an exogenous shock (Covid-19 pandemic) that has been felt globally, and India has already started a V-shaped recovery after the lockdown was eased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-phase-took-severe-toll-on-economic-activity/story-FlfxcGR15S7ehOSZ9YacLM.html
01-09-2020||India||Tributes pour in from across political spectrum for a colossus of public life||Political leaders cutting across party lines paid tributes to former President Pranab Mukherjee, who died at the age of 84 on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as a scholar par excellence and a towering statesman who was admired across the political spectrum. Modi said Pranab has left an indelible mark on the nation’s development trajectory.“As India’s President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee made Rashtrapati Bhavan even more accessible to common citizens. He made the President’s house a centre of learning, innovation, culture, science and literature. His wise counsel on key policy matters will never be forgotten by me,” the PM tweeted. Congress president Sonia Gandhi recalled Pranab’s long association with her party and said the void left behind by his demise would be difficult to fill. “He brought distinction to every post he held, he established a genuine rapport with colleagues across the political spectrum, and he served our country with utmost dedication.” West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee expressed deep sorrow over the 84-year-old’s death and said with his demise “an era has come to an end”. “So many memories. A visit to Delhi without Pranabda is unimaginable. He is a legend in all subjects from politics to economics. Will be forever grateful. Shall miss him immensely,” Banerjee tweeted. Kerala chief minister and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Pinarayi Vijayan said that Pranab was a politician “who played a significant role in upholding India’s prestige at the international level”. “He stood for the protection and empowerment of constitutional values and constantly strived to inculcate values in the society, including secularism,” he said. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat hailed the former president as “a great scholar and a patriot” whose loss cannot be compensated.“India’s former President Dr Pranab Mukherjee’s passing away is a huge loss for all swayamsevaks who had come in contact with him. I had met him twice when he was President and three to four times afterwards,” Bhagwat said in a video message in Hindi.Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also expressed sorrow over the demise of Mukherjee.“His demise has caused an irreparable loss to the political arena of the sub-continent,” Hamid said, describing Mukherjee as a “real and sincere friend” of Bangladesh. Hasina, too, called Mukherjee a “true friend” of Bangladesh and a guardian-like figure to her family. “The news of Mr Pranab Mukherjee’s demise deeply saddened her . . . she became emotional and nostalgic as she reminisced her many memories with him,” state-run BSS reported, quoting the premier’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tributes-pour-in-from-across-political-spectrum-for-a-colossus-of-public-life/story-u2rr0l9hGmCiEwl9VhT9kI.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee: A towering figure of Indian politics leaves behind an unmatched legacy||For 50 years, till a few days before he was detected with a brain haemorrhage on August 10, Pranab Mukherjee kept a diary. It must make for compelling reading. For much of this period, Mukherjee was active in public life. He positioned himself as a reliable support system, a trusted vice-captain to at least three Prime Ministers. Then, as the country’s first citizen, he had a vantage view of politics at the highest level from Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mukherjee, 84, died 21 days after the surgery at the Army Research and Referral Hospital on August 10, leaving behind a rich legacy of old-school politics, three children, countless friends across parties -- and the diary. His death elicited an outpouring of grief across the political spectrum, a reminder of his brand of politics that placed a premium on personal equations—the reason why everyone called him Pranab da and not the distant Pranab babu. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government awarded Mukherjee India’s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna last year, said: “He has left an indelible mark on the development trajectory of our nation. A scholar par excellence, a towering statesman, he was admired across the political spectrum...” Also read| Had Pranab da become PM in 2012, political events post 2014 would have been different: Venu RajamonyCongress President Sonia Gandhi, to whom his loyalty was never in question, said, “He brought distinction to every post he held, he established genuine rapport with colleagues across the political spectrum and he served our country with utmost dedication.”And former PM Manmohan Singh, a junior of Mukherjee who became his senior and boss, said: “He and I worked very closely in the Government of India and I depended on him a great deal for his wisdom, vast knowledge and experience of public affairs”. Mukherjee was born in Mirati, a nondescript village in undivided Bengal on December 11, 1935. His father Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, was involved in India’s struggle for independence and would go on to serve in the West Bengal Legislative Council between 1952 and 1964 from Congress. Also read: Pranab Mukherjee was a workhorse who excelled at different rolesPranab da has spoken of how, as a young boy, he had to walk for miles, and during the monsoon swim across an overflowing river, to reach school. But he doggedly pursued education. For him, India’s Independence in 1947 meant simple dreams, better food and a footbridge across the river. By 1963, with degrees in political science and history (a Masters) and law, Mukherjee was teaching political science at Vidyanagar College and Howrah Chaitanya College in West Bengal. The young boy from Mirati might have thought he had arrived – but in truth, he was just getting started. In 1969, he was involved in VK Krishna Menon’s successful run in the Midnapore Lok Sabha constituency (Menon was contesting as an independent). The same year, Bangla Congress, a regional offshoot of the Indira Gandhi-led Congress, sent him to the Rajya Sabha (Two years later, it merged with the main party). He had four more terms in the Rajya Sabha (1975, 1981, 1993, and 1999) before he won 2004 Lok Sabha election in Jangipur. He retained his seat in 2009 and three years later, became President of India. Also read: A gentleman who had the memory of an elephantThrough these four decades , he was a key player in the political mainstream, expect for the period between 1984 and 1989, when he was sidelined by the late Rajiv Gandhi, who considered Mukherjee a rival for the PM’s post after Indira Gandhi’s assassination. In 1986, he even formed his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress in West Bengal, but merged it with the Congress, after making up with Rajiv Gandhi, in 1989. While Mukherjee himself has said the Prime Minister’s office was not for him, it was widely believed that his biggest ambition was the country’s top elected office in the leafy corner of the South Block. It remained a distant dream, but he did ascend Raisina Hill, occupied various other corners of North and South Block, and finally settled for a tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan. His first PM, of course, was Indira Gandhi. He was a junior minister of industry in her 1973 cabinet. In 1982, he rose to be finance minister in her government. Then came his brief stint in the wilderness. But he was soon back. Also read: Congress’s troubleshooter whose mark was on every UPA policyJairam Ramesh’s semi-autobiographical book “To the Brink and Back” narrates how Mukherjee prepared a draft roadmap of the new government and its economic priorities in 1991 before P V Narasimha Rao became the PM. Mukherjee was the chief architect behind India’s accession to the WTO in January 1995. While the prospects of India acceding to an all-encompassing multilateral trade regime met with strong domestic opposition, Mukherjee convinced Rao and later signed the WTO Trade Agreement. And a year later, when Rao—sidelined into oblivion—needed a Delhi resident to support his bail application, Mukherjee’s wife (she owned a house in GK 2) signed the documents in the police station. Mukherjee’s relationship with Manmohan Singh was perhaps the most complex and, at the same time, most rewarding. Having served under Mukherjee in various capacities, Singh initially continued to call his former boss “sir”, much to the latter’s discomfort. Finally, when Mukherjee announced it was untenable to be addressed as sir by his boss, Singh resorted to Pranab ji . He worked hard under Singh, but like most members of the UPA cabinet, his loyalty was tilted towards Sonia Gandhi. Mukherjee enjoyed unbridled power, led the defence, finance and foreign affairs ministries, headed more than 100 groups of ministers (GoMs; the UPA’s preferred tool for policy-making and trouble shooting) and had a say in every policy, right from the creation of an anti corruption ombudsman to the stimulus package of 2008 which saved India from economic ruin. To be sure, Singh and Mukherjee differed on quite a few issues. There was exasperation in the PMO at the way some Mukherjee aides tried to run the show in the ministry. But Singh never missed seeking out Mukherjee’s counsel on key issues of economy and foreign policy. When the Pakistan PM said he would come to Mohali to watch the world cup match between the two countries in 2011 with Singh, the latter asked Mukherjee what he should discuss. Mukherjee retorted, “anything under the sun except serious bilateral issues.” (The finance minister had little idea about one-day cricket and would praise Singh’s patience for spending a whole day in a stadium) Days after Singh’s retirement in 2014, this writer asked his principal secretary TKA Nair, why the PM, a progressive economic thinker allowed the controversial proposal on retrospective tax in the 2012 budget and Nair replied that the PM perhaps couldn’t tell Mukherjee anything considering the latter’s stature and experience. There was an effort to make him the President in 2007. The Congress proposed the names of Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and Sushil Kumar Shinde to allies as possible presidential candidate. But there was no replacement for Mukherjee in the government in the early years of the UPA, and the party decided it couldn’t afford to lose him. Finally, in 2012, the chance came again. The party still wanted him, but eventually Sonia Gandhi, the party president had little option but to back Mukherjee; any other candidate would have meant a contest. In a farewell function for him, Gandhi quipped that she would miss Mukherjee’s tantrums. Pranab Mukherjee went to Rashtrapati Bhavan, a graceful exit from active politics. But soon, the customary equation between the President and the PM in the republic’s inner circle took a new turn when Narendra Modi, a man straight from state politics, met Mukherjee, a perpetual national player. Their bond grew quickly. The President often advised the PM on foreign affairs and other issues. Modi has publicly acknowledged Mukherjee’s contributions saying, “He held my hand in my initial days in Delhi.” The equation didn’t suffer in Mukherjee’s post-retirement life. Senior NDA ministers regularly queued up at Rajaji Marg for his counsel. A party colleague once described Mukherjee as the Shashi Kapoor of politics— always under the shadow of the bigger stars (PMs). But Mukherjee didn’t breathe his last as a loser. He didn’t have a godfather, yet he made it to the very top. From an ordinary background, he became a towering figure of contemporary politics. He wanted to be a teacher but life brought him to politics. He walked the long walk from Mirati village to corridors of power in Delhi, or from his first certificate of victory in Rajya Sabha in 1960s to the Bharat Ratna. Till days before his hospitalisation, he diligently maintained his diary, as he did for the last 50 years. What tales it can tell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-towering-figure-of-indian-politics-leaves-behind-an-unmatched-legacy/story-ltVQ5OuxBmsYmpwEYFmUGP.html

Additionally, steps such as monthly payments to the contractors were taken. Such moderations saw an encouraged participation from the bidders resulting in spiraling effect on the growth of the road sector.

However, the movement in passenger vehicles is yet to recover fully and is still hovering at 60% of their pre-Covid-19 levels, it said in a report last week, adding that if the pace of recovery continues and holds, the year-on-year fall in toll collections can be limited to under 10%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-highway-length-in-3-years-awarded-during-covid-19-pandemic-nhai/story-GbAe3xmkZQs9TNT2IWnIBM.html
01-09-2020||India||Had Pranabda become PM in 2012, political events post 2014 would have been different: Venu Rajamony||Venu Rajamony – Ambassador of India to the Netherlands, who was Pranab Mukherjee’s Press Secretary for five years at the President House, remembers him as a leader who was not only an authority on parliamentary procedures and history but was also the principal troubleshooter for Congress during UPA I and II. During his presidency, Rajamony says, he believed defending the Constitution was his prime responsibility. Rajamony adds that one of Pranab Mukherjee’s most important reforms was to open up the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the public and make it a democratic institution. “He strongly believed that Rashtrapati Bhavan belongs to the nation and there should be greater participation by ordinary Indians in its activities. This is when regular tours of the public were started at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and its libraries and archives were thrown open to scholars,” Rajamony told HT over the phone from Netherlands. ALSO READ | Pranab Mukherjee dies: A look at his illustrious political career“This legacy of Pranab Da should be safeguarded and protected,” Rajamony adds. A scholar of politics, economics and foreign affairs, Pranab Mukherjee was admired by all, across political parties for his knowledge, experience and wisdom. “He was capable of uniting different political parties and finding common ground,” the Ambassador says. His first and last love, Rajamony describes, was Parliament. “It is in the Parliament that he was most happy and he believed it was the Parliament which made him who he was. On many occasions during his tenure as President, Pranabda would sit with longing in front of the television watching debates in Parliament and say, ‘I miss being in the House. I wish I was there, participating in those debates’,” Rajamony told HT. Recalling the former President’s sharp memory, Rajamony said, “He could remember events, dates and numbers and was considered a walking encyclopedia.” “Senior officials who had to brief him would do so with fear because he would always know more than them. Pranabda could easily cite budget figures going back to the earliest budget presented in Parliament after independence,” he adds. ALSO READ | Pranab Mukherjee: The vice-captain who went on to be refereeAsserting that the former President was “old-fashioned”, Rajamony said he believed that much of what he knew and had seen would die with him. “(The Then PM) Indira Gandhi once remarked that if anyone tried to make Pranabda cough up secrets, only smoke would come out.” “Pranabda maintained copious diaries throughout his life but was not interested in them seeing the light of the day for as long as he was alive,” the Ambassador added. The Indian Foreign Service officer, who also served with Pranab Mukherjee for two years in the finance ministry, said that Pranab Da deserved more. If Pranab Da had become the Prime Minister and Dr Manmohan Singh had moved to Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2012, political events post 2014 would perhaps have been very different, Rajamony adds. Paying tribute to Pranab Da, the Ambassador added that “his life and memory will inspire others in public life to emulate him and live up to his high standards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-pranab-da-become-pm-in-2012-political-events-post-2014-would-have-been-different-venu-rajamony/story-4mFuWqBKtiHsSg7kWXmUaM.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee was always ready and never said no to the party||I was elected in 1977 and met Pranab da within the first year of coming to Parliament. For 43 years, we were in touch constantly, and became especially close when I served as parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. That was an eventful time; Pranab da had started a new party in Bengal and then later became the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief. I was junior to him but he’d always treat me like a colleague or even a younger brother.As PCC chief of Bengal, he had to handle several agitations. I remember once we visited the hospital to see those who were injured in one. Suddenly, things became quite tense. The thing that I most clearly remember about that incident is that he didn’t abandon me . He braved the stone-throwing to ensure that I sat in the car with him. He was known to be a tough person but whenever I called him for anything, he wouldn’t just hear me out, but get it done. I think it was either in the Bangalore plenary session or in Faizabad one that one minister who was supposed to address the party said that he wouldn’t be able to speak. I just asked Pranab da to give the speech ; with 10 minutes’ notice he spoke very well. He was always ready and never said no to the party.We then worked together in the time of Sitaram Kesri. Whether it was on Kesri’s appointment as the Congress president or his resignation, we worked together. Of course, he went on to play a major role in government. I remember during the vote on the Indo-US Nuclear deal (2008), we worked very closely to ensure that the vote of confidence went off very smoothly. That’s the reason we got exactly the kind of result that we wanted from it. In core group meetings, where we again worked together, he would often be stern with some minister or member; if they said anything wrong, he’d immediately respond. This was typical of him.The unusual thing about our meetings was that they were mostly held at night. I was usually his last visitor, dropping in at 11:30 pm or midnight or even later at least twice or thrice a week. He would finish that meeting, then shower and eat his dinner. Late night was the best time to talk to him, and it’s these exchanges where I got the best kind of guidance from him. He was an encyclopaedia of Indian politics and was well aware of all that was happening across the world. So, you’d always gain from these exchanges. Of course, I had a way of gauging his mood during these visits. If he said`Heralal, chai lao” (Bring some tea)’, then I’d know that he was in a good mood. If he simply said “Baithiye” (Sit)’ then I’d know that he was busy. This continued even when he took up a constitutional role.When he was chosen to become President, I was the one who went to inform him of the clearance of his name. He was very happy and immediately thanked Soniaji (Sonia Gandhi) and others. Yes, he had arguments with people and differences of opinion but when he was informed of the PM’s decision or Soniaji’s, he would accept it. This despite the fact that he couldn’t become the Prime Minister, and that regret stayed with him. He never said it openly and it wasn’t that huge a source of bitterness for him. His goal didn’t stop him from doing a stellar job as a cabinet minister or the other assignments that he was given. For instance, when the United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2004, he wanted to be home minister. However, that wasn’t to be and he really worked hard at the defence portfolio. My visits to him as President weren’t just official ones. When he was writing his book or even otherwise, if we didn’t meet each other for a week or 10 days, he’d call me and ask where I was and that I should drop in. When he was invited to visit the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarter in Nagpur, he took a long time to decide if he should go. He told me, “If I don’t go, then it will be a problem ; if I go, it will be a problem. It’s better that I go there and give my message.’’ And that’s what he did.He had a big heart. I remember that I wanted him to inaugurate a hospital in my constituency. It wasn’t a big hospital at all but just because I asked him, he came all the way to Gujarat for its opening. I just think that I’m very lucky to have had the opportunity to have worked with him so closely. He taught me all the things I couldn’t learn from books-- history of the party, what happened when the Congress split twice.... He was very clear in his mind about what was right and he followed his principles. He said whatever was in his heart. He shared so much with me but some of them are things that I will never share with others. These are things that went with him and will also go with me to my grave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-da-was-always-ready-and-never-said-no-to-the-party/story-Dmo3nltnNuKkZQgV90QAkN.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee was a workhorse who excelled at different roles||Pranab Mukherjee faced and triumphed over several challenges during his eventful five decades in public life. His passing has left a void in our public life; he was a consummate politician with multifaceted contributions to his credit. Pranab da is entitled to a certain space in the history of post-Independence India.After he laid down the highest office of our country in 2017, I had a few meetings with Pranab da. Though I had a fairly good idea of his multifaceted personality, my personal interactions revealed much more than I knew of him. His deep understanding of our country, including its history and evolution and the current and future challenges, was amazing. At the end of every meeting, I used to walk away with an impression that he was nothing short of an encyclopedia. His number crunching ability and sharp memory at his age was bewildering. In his death, the country has lost a statesman at a critical time. On a couple of times, when I had run into tough situations presiding over the Rajya Sabha, he called to put me at ease. His thoughtful gestures were comforting and useful. His sage words will remain in my memory. I often quoted him in the House, urging members to “debate, discuss and decide” and not disrupt proceedings. Pranab da had the rare honour being the Leader of the House both in the Rajya Sabha and in the Lok Sabha, a distriction he shared with Lal Bahadur Shastri and VP Singh. As his colleague in the Rajya Sabha, I was witness to the seriousness with which he took his role. He had a thorough grip of the rules and procedures of the House. On a few occasions, he used to get worked up. When Shri LK Advani, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, raised an issue, Pranab da was harsh on him. Soon thereafter, I walked up to him and politely submitted that he should not have dealt with Shri Advani the way he did. Pranab da quickly realised it and met Shri Advani to make amends. He even thanked me for bringing it to his attention. It was this rare quality that endeared him to all across the political spectrum. Since entering the Rajya Sabha in 1969 and becoming member of the council of ministers in 1973 and demitting office of the President of India in 2017, Pranab Da had been a part of the journey and transformation of our country. He played an important role as a politician, legislator, negotiator and administrator, leaving a mark of his own. His meteoric rise from a clerk to the highest office of India was not fortuitous. It was a natural culmination of sustained manifestation of his deep reserves of knowledge, wisdom, ability and understanding of the men and women around. He proved himself to be a useful and reliable aide to all his benefactors whenever needed. His deep understanding of the contours, the fault lines and functioning of our polity lent solidity to his inputs and advice. Pranab da was a relentless workhorse. The number of groups of ministers and empowered groups of ministers he chaired during 2004-14 speaks eloquently of his wide acceptance and ability to reconcile differences. I used to wonder about his stamina and capacity to take so much of a workload upon him and do justice to every job he handled. Pranab Mukherjee held about a dozen ministerial assignments for about 25 years, handling about 10 ministries besides being the vice chairman of the Planning Commission. While the sheer scale and range of such important responsibilities do speak for the ability of the man, his contributions do so even more. Pranab da had a deep understanding of the pitfalls and challenges facing our society but also the limitations of the finances of the country. As the minister of finance for the first time in 1980, he proved to be an early reformer and worked hard to improve the financials of the country and introduced fiscal deficit targeting. As defence minister, he signed Indo-US defence framework deal in 2005 and scripted the first anti-terror games with Russia in the same year. India became a full dialogue partner of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in 1996, when he was the external affairs minister. As talented as he was, he nursed the ambition of, and even came close to, becoming the Prime Minister twice but missed out. He handled these misses in his own way. His actions during the Emergency also came under scrutiny. I hold Pranab da in the highest esteem for his sweep of knowledge, including the cultural traditions and ethos of our society and the nationalist philosophy of our motherland. He had an abiding faith in the pluralism and diversity of our country. Much against the advice of many, Pranab da, as the former President of India, addressed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s training camp at Nagpur in 2018. When he spoke there, he did so for India ,outlining its core philosophy of inclusivity, peace and harmony. He stressed that our nationalism flows from our Constitution and it is neither exclusive nor aggressive nor destructive. That is what statesmen are made of. The five-decade-long public life and journey of Pranab da ran parallel to the transformation of our country. He had his own role to play in it. The passing of such a legend is an irreparable loss to the nation. My tributes to this great son of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-was-a-workforce-who-excelled-at-different-roles/story-QvrNIstGPoddCa8Gqt4thN.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee: A gentleman who had the memory of an elephant||With the death of Pranab Mukherjee, Pranab da as we all addressed him, India and Indian politics are left with a void. He served the Indian parliament and many Indian governments in leading positions in his five-decade-long political life. He entered the Rajya Sabha when I was still in school. Despite his seniority, he never treated people like me in a condescending manner. As far as I am concerned, he had always treated me as an equal, never expressing any acrimony over our differences.Right from the 1970s, there were occasions when l had to confront Pranabda, as Indra Gandhi’s trusted cabinet colleague, during the Emergency. Differences continued all through my association with him for nearly four decades. Though not in parliament, in various political delegations I had to confront him when he, as the commerce minister, was negotiating the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and drawing India into supporting the Dunkel Draft. We were protesting on the streets of Delhi while Pranabda was presiding over India’s role in the WTO’s formation.However, it was during the period of the Vajpayee government and the efforts for uniting the secular opposition parties to defeat that government in the 2004 general elections that I had the opportunity to interact with him closely. During these discussions, particularly concerning the simultaneous assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh over seat adjustments, Pranabda was leading the Congress delegation. During the course of one of these often contentious discussions, he suddenly took me aside to ask my opinion on whether he should contest the Lok Sabha election. He had never entered the Lok Sabha as an elected MP till then. I recollect telling him that I am too junior to give someone like him any advice and refused. He, however, insisted. I told him that he should contest only if he was more than confident of victory. In those crucial elections, when we were working for the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Pranabda losing would send a very wrong signal. Eventually, he contested and won from Jangipur and then emerged as the main pointsman of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the coalition government that was formed. He was indispensable for the UPA government, serving on every committee with the coalition partners, particularly, UPA-Left coordination committee.He had always insisted that I should come to parliament. When the Party told me to, I entered the Rajya Sabha in 2005 and felt very touched by the manner Pranabda received me, giving me valuable tips about something that I had very little knowledge of, i.e. parliamentary proceedings. All through those years, till he was elected President of India, we had been having almost daily interactions. On one occasion, claiming success for insulating India from the 2008 global financial meltdown, Pranabda told the Rajya Sabha that the Indian banking and financial system was spared thanks to Indira Gandhi’s bank nationalisation. This was soon after the Left withdrew its support from the UPA in 2008 following the disagreements over the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. I recollect my interrupting him and urging him to yield to allow me to make a point which he graciously did. Such parliamentary decorum and dignity has now become a thing of the past. I had then told the house that bank nationalisation was one of the conditions that the Left parties had then put before Indira Gandhi in return for their support to her presidential candidate V.V. Giri. In addition, the Left had also asked for coal nationalisation. Pranabda had a memory of an elephant. He recalled the details of the talks, of which I knew very little, and went on to say that one more demand was the abolition of privy purses. I was till then under the impression that this demand was raised by others whom Indira Gandhi had approached for support. Nonetheless, I recollect saying then that whenever the Congress Party heeded the advice of the Left, it not only helped its government but, importantly, benefited the country. However, unfortunately, this is not being followed with regard to the Indo-US nuclear deal. There was the usual merriment and interruptions in the proceedings but not for a minute did Pranabda lose his cool, having to contend with a person very junior to him in politics. He maintained that decorum of treating everyone on an equal footing, giving the highest priority to the culture of debate, discussion and decision in parliamentary proceedings. The first official visit Pranabda undertook after becoming the President of India was to Bangladesh. He received a rousing welcome as the son-in-law of Bangladesh as his wife Surva migrated from this part of undivided Bengal. His knowledge of Bengal, its culture, the partition, the agonies and tribulations was phenomenal. He was a person who was deeply engrossed in the culture and life of the Bengalis. All this was magnified, peppered with nostalgia, when we had visited Shilaidaha, the ancestral home of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. He would regale us with many an anecdote and stories about Tagore’s life and work which I had never known before.  I can go on narrating many such personal experiences, but these shall be cherished for a future occasion. Pranab da will be missed. My heartfelt condolences to his son Abhijit and daughter Sharmishta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-gentleman-who-had-the-memory-of-an-elephant-yechury-on-pranab/story-WybLXArrlOdVpfLTI1EUqO.html
01-09-2020||India||Congress’s troubleshooter whose mark was on every UPA policy||Two senior ministers had taken exactly opposite stands amid a looming economic crisis. It was 2008 and the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh quickly formed a group of ministers—the UPA era’s favourite tool of settling policy troubles—to suggest a solution. At the GoM meeting, one minister maintained that the Indian corporate sector must be given some relief. The other and more powerful one took a stand that the government must not intervene in matters of private business. Mukherjee finally intervened and declared that the government has to take a “political decision” and not an “economic one”. A few days later, India announced its first stimulus package to tackle the global slowdown triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US. In 2004, when the UPA came to power, Mukherjee had initially hoped for the home ministry portfolio. He even started brushing up the standing committee reports on home, the panel which he headed for a long time. But less than an hour before the swearing-in function, he was asked to take over the defence portfolio. The home portfolio went to Shivraj Patil. Mukherjee initially felt somewhat sidelined in the stiff hierarchy of power but soon he would assume immense power—only next to the Prime Minister in the government--thanks to his towering presence in nearly all groups of ministers. Between 2004 and 2012, every major policy of the UPA government had the imprint of Pranab Mukherjee as he headed dozens of GoMs or Manmohan Singh’s kitchen cabinets.“Between 2004-2012, Shri Mukherjee was instrumental in spearheading critical decisions of the Government on a range of issues such as Administrative reforms, Right to Information, Right to Employment, Food Security, Energy Security, Information Technology and telecommunication, setting up of UIDAI, Metro Rail, etc through Chairmanship of over 95 Groups of Ministers constituted for the purpose,” reads his official profile in the Rashtrapati Bhavan archive. He got so engrossed in shaping India’s policies and the GoMs got such prominence that many people started lovingly calling Pradeep Gupta, a fine, upright officer entrusted with his GoM files, as “GoM Gupta”. And it was these GoMs that highlighted his prowess to solve intricate problems and structural issues and help him consolidate his brand as an ace troubleshooter for the UPA. He was entrusted with delicate political situations—the demand for Telangana in the early UPA years, the threat of a DMK withdrawal, Anna Hazare’s movement for a Lokpal—and critical policy issues such as financing Air India, setting up a Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism framework and many pieces of rights-based legislation, which would ultimately become the hallmark of the UPA’s success story.It was not an easy task. He handled conflicting views, diverse interests and major ego trips before a GoM or an empowered group of ministers would arrive at a decision. Things would often get out of hand. During a GoM meeting on Air India, a furious minister stood up and announced his resignation, leaving everyone in the room speechless. Mukherjee held the minister’s hand and announced a break for 15 minutes. After the meeting reassembled, the proceedings went on smoothly. To be sure, there is an indelible imprint of Pranab Mukherjee in the world’s largest unique identity programme, the Aadhaar framework. Even as UIDAI chief Nandan Nilekani enjoyed excellent rapport with both Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, it was Mukherjee who gave him the crucial administrative and policy backing in the UIDAI versus NPR tussle. Mukherjee never learnt how to use a computer but he had the vision of a technology-driven unique identity network that would one day change the landscape of India’s targeted welfare programmes and a large part of income tax and other financial structures. Manmohan Singh’s success as the finance minister had much to do with the political support of PV Narasimha Rao. As Prime Minister, many of his flagship programmes and policies found administrative and political backing of Pranab Mukherjee. Mukherjee got so used to spending hours browsing files that after he was nominated as President, P Chidambaram rightly predicted that he would get bored in the highest office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-cong-s-troubleshooter-whose-mark-was-on-every-upa-policy/story-hB2N47NVZ6aC5dGR0wQU3M.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee: Intergenerational mentor in politics||Pranab Mukherjee was a unique entity in our political firmament. In a sense, he was an intergenerational link. He never allowed the present to become hostage to the past or the vision of the future to be blurred by the complexities of today when he had said, “As Indians, we must of course learn from the past; but we must remain focused on the future.”I first came in contact with Pranab da, as he was affectionately called, when I was working as special assistant to Professor DP Chattopadhyaya (1973-1981). I had no inkling at that time that political fortunes would take a full turn and I would be working as his special assistant too (1980-1981).He had a memory which could challenge any modern computer and leave the listener dumbstruck by its phenomenal precision. He was often described as a living computer. This always gave him a vantage position in public life, for political entities are invariably short on memory and ensuing political dynamics.While his contemporaries had strayed into different configurations, he remained fiercely loyal to Indira Gandhi. Her unquestioned dependence on Pranab da and his advice had made him an unofficial major power centre and held many in awe. When he asked me for the names of people who could possibly be appointed as Mrs Gandhi’s principal secretary, I had given a panel of names which included Dr PC Alexander. His advice was finally accepted in selecting Alexander as the new principal secretary.In recognition of his ability, he assumed the office of the finance minister (1982-1984). Our paths would cross again during this period when I was posted to Japan as minister, economic and commerce (1981-1984) and we were seeking access to the borrowings from the Asian Development Bank and securing the iconic Maruti-Suzuki agreement.Pranab was an early liberaliser. While holding the dual responsibilities of deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (1991-1996) and commerce minister (1993-1995), he recognised that the Licence Raj had done India enormous economic harm. The early efforts at trade liberalisation were initiated by him. His audacious step to have the first large aluminium project as a joint venture with Aluminium Pechiney took place when he was serving dual responsibilities of minister, commerce, and minister, steel and mines. Subsequently, he served a second stint as finance minister (2009-2012) under Manmohan Singh. In his second stint, Pranab undertook the bold decision for the first time to explicitly cut public debt as a proportion of the GDP. During this period in 1984, Pranab was rated as the best finance minister in the world according to a survey by Euromoney, and, subsequently in 2010, he was also awarded “Finance Minister of the Year for Asia” by Emerging Markets. When I was a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha (2008-2014), Pranab was the finance minister. I sometimes excited the jealousy of my colleagues that he would entertain my comments out of his affection and generosity.Many names were under consideration as to who would be Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam’s successor. He had expressed some disappointment to me in passing that he must exit from North Block and clearly since there was no room in South Block, he would certainly hope and wish to occupy the Raisina Hills. I could not do much, except that perhaps I did speak to one of the important partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nitish Kumar, who had a great liking for Pranab da, given his dignity and equanimity in conducting multiple public offices.During his presidential swearing-in speech, he had remarked that, “I have seen vast, perhaps unbelievable, changes during the journey that has brought me from the flicker of a lamp in a small Bengal village to the chandeliers of Delhi.” He brought dignity, grace and decorum to the President’s office. He was unswerving in the emphasis that India’s destiny lay in its innovative capabilities and had remarked, “For us, democracy is not a gift, but a sacred trust.” He was respected across the political spectrum for his fair, rational and appropriate advice. Given his strong cultural interests, his late wife Suvra Mukherjee was a vibrant person in Delhi circles, organising lessons in Indian classical music and dance; these values have been inculcated in his children, Abhijit and Sharmistha.For a long time, he was inseparable from a pipe and had perhaps the most treasured pipe collection anybody could dream of.Pranab Babu was a prolific reader and writer. When he was working on his own autobiography, published in several volumes, he had told me that he could do so with felicity because he had kept a detailed diary of events. Even though some parts of it were lost, this did not deter him in any way given his memory recall. Pranab da consented to write a foreword to my autobiography. When the release had been planned before it got delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, he had kindly consented to grace the occasion for a few minutes and speak about the Indian economic growth process. While his foreword would remain as a coveted piece, I would greatly miss the supreme privilege of having him as the guest of honour.NK Singh is the chairperson of the 15th Finance Commission and a former Member of Parliament||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intergenerational-mentor-in-politics-nk-singh-on-pranab/story-8zAYKUKHj9J7xDHg4zOaiP.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee: Master of anecdotes, both in their creating and retelling||New Delhi: Chaudhary Charan Singh brandished sheets of paper in the Lok Sabha, read out what he termed the forthcoming Union budget speech and accused then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of leaking the sovereign document to the International Monetary Fund (a three-letter abbreviation but a four-letter word back at the time). This was 1983. Gandhi panicked momentarily and summoned her finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the other House of Parliament. Mukherjee came, heard Singh for a few seconds and turned to Gandhi to reassure her that things were under control. After Singh’s tirade ended, Pranab spoke briefly: “What you read is correct, but you didn’t see the date of the speech. It is my last year’s speech,” the young finance minister quipped and the Congress benches erupted into laughter.Mukherjee, India’s politician for all seasons was close to Gandhi, but his decision to contest the 1980 Lok Sabha polls irked her. After the results came out (and Mukherjee lost miserably) a furious Indira Gandhi dialled him at Kolkata to say, “Everyone knew that you will lose. Even Geeta (as friends called Mukherjee’s wife) knew it. But still you went ahead and created trouble for me.”Two days later, another call came. This time, Sanjay Gandhi spoke: “Mummy is very angry with you. But she also said, ‘There can’t be any cabinet without Pranab’. Take a flight for Delhi tomorrow.”In later years, when the rest of Lutyens’ Delhi was asleep, Mukherjee would narrate these stories -- immaculate portraits of his past with minute details (he even remembered what Gandhi ate when she met Margaret Thatcher for the first time).Gandhi, Mukherjee’s political mentor, also told him to appoint a teacher to improve his English accent. He refused saying, “Madam, what is done cannot be undone. Don’t try to make a square out of a circle.” His Hindi was worse, even after spending five decades in Delhi. Mukherjee’s adversaries in Congress once approached then PM Narsimha Rao to shunt him to a gubernatorial role in UP. Rao told them, “As it is half of our vote base has gone to Mulayam Singh Yadav. If Pranab goes to UP, the remaining voters will also run away when they hear his Hindi.”An avid reader, and history lover (World War 2 was his favourite part of history), Mukherjee was a foodie till he turned 40 and resorted to a diet -- chapatis that were only slightly larger than drink coasters.But when then railway minister Lalu Prasad boasted about the mangoes and lychees of Muzaffarpur at a UPA cabinet meeting, Mukherjee couldn’t remain silent. “You are wrong. The best mango and lychee are found in my electoral district of Murshidabad,” he announced. And as proof of the pudding, he started gifting specially packed mangoes and lychees to all his ministerial colleagues, allies— even key opposition leaders—every year to build a consensus on Murshidabad mangos.In the Congress, his favourite juniors were Shashi Tharoor, Kapil Sibal, Jairam Ramesh, Kamal Nath and Ghulam Nabi Azad. When Tharoor landed in trouble over his “holy cow” tweet, Mukherjee came to his rescue but also cautioned him : “This is the Congress party, not circus party”. He disliked socializing in the Delhi circuit and listed that he had attended just one personal dinner in Delhi -- hosted by Sibal. He backed Kamal Nath on several key issues but when Nath argued for almost 15 minutes at a cabinet meeting for adding Chhindwara to the Aspirational Districts’ list, an exasperated Mukherjee stopped him, “Kamal, this is the Union cabinet, not your gram panchayat meeting.” He called Ramesh “Joyram” and Pawan Bansal, his junior minister in finance, as “a boy”.For the chief trouble-shooter of the party, number 13 was, surprisingly, a lucky number. He got married on July 13; both his residence at Talkatora Road and parliament office were number 13; and he was the 13th person to become the President of India.Mukherjee’s wife put her foot down to proposals to shift home after he became defence minister. But the small bungalow at 13, Talkatora Road was the big world of strategies and policies. Left-UPA meetings on the Indo-US Nuclear Deal, phone calls with world leaders, interacting with top industrialists and even drafting key party documents like amendments of the Congress’s Constitution—all happened in that bungalow. Mukherjee was famous for working till late at night, but once told Montek Singh Ahluwalia, “I can read files till 2 am but as soon as I start reading Planning Commission reports, I fall asleep.”Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was once his next-door neighbour when they both lived near Safdarjung Road. In an interview to HT after Vajpayee’s death, Mukherjee described how Vajpayee asked his late wife, Suvra Mukherjee, to oversee all preparations for Vajpayee’s foster daughter Namita’s marriage. The late Biju Patnaik would at times drop in to relish Hilsa fish at the Mukherjee household and even offered a recipe for Hilsa. Pranabda couldn’t use a computer. His pastime revolved around books. And Aamir Khan’s Rang de Basanti was the first Hindi film he watched. Then censor board chief Sharmila Tagore was hesitant as the film involves revenge on India’s defence minister. She wanted Mukherjee to watch it first.Mukherjee, then defence minister, watched the first half and left the Mahadev Road theatre, telling a bewildered Khan and Tagore: “My job is to protect the country, not give censor certificate to films.”The next, and possibly his last, Hindi film was Piku. He invited Lal Krishna Advani, a film buff, to Rashtrapati Bhavan to watch the film that revolved around the relationship between an aged father and his daughter—a theme that played out in both the leaders’ daily lives too. Over 18 years since this writer’s first meeting with Pranab babu, he was the source of many everlasting memories, some avuncular raps on the knuckles, and a witness to a deeply embarrassing moment — the rendition of a lesser-known Rabindra Sangeet by the author mid-air in the Presidential flight. Always eager to pursue knowledge, Pranab Mukherjee called this writer to his suite on the return flight and announced that he had got someone to download the song so that he could memorize its lyrics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-master-of-anecdotes-both-in-their-creating-and-retelling/story-PjiyHsixMFafCchS3cTnRP.html
01-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand tells power companies to repair cables after death of 2 elephants||The Uttarakhand forest department will write to all power companies asking them to tighten suspension of high tension cables after two elephants died of suspected electrocution in the state in the past 10 days failing which action will be taken against them, forest officials said.The state forest department will give one month’s time to the companies for the repair work.JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department said that as per norms the height of the wires should be checked every year, which is not being done due to which sagging cables touch the bodies of the elephants. “Organisations like Power Transmission Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (PTCUL) are supposed to check the height of high-tension wires passing through forest areas every year. The suspension of the wires changes over time and it lowers due to which it touches the elephants and other animals passing through those areas, leading to electrocution of the animals,” said Suhag. He added that the state forest department will give one month’s time to the industries to repair the wires after which action will be taken against them. “In the past ten days, two elephants have died likely due to electrocution. The post mortem reports are still awaited. But many such cases have been reported in the past three years,” added the chief wildlife warden. An elephant was found dead in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar forest division on Sunday. This was the seventh elephant death to be reported from the state in the last nearly three months. The chief wildlife warden on Sunday had said that it appeared that the elephant “died due to a natural cause or could have been electrocuted as a high-tension wire is passing through that area”. In the third week of August (August 20 and August 19), two elephants were reported dead from Lansdowne forest division of Uttarakhand within 24 hours. Sant Ram, divisional forest officer for Lansdowne forest division had said that both the elephants were adolescents and the deaths were reported from Kotdwar and Laldhang regions. Of these two elephants, officials had informed that one could have died due to electrocution as a high tension line goes through the place where its carcass was found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-tells-power-companies-to-repair-cables-after-death-of-2-elephants/story-AY0ymQeBXmUTPhHI7sSInM.html
01-09-2020||India||Indian economy sees a record fall||The Indian economy declined by a record 23.9% in the first quarter of 2020-21 (April-June), reflecting the economic cost of the complete lockdown imposed to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) that was in place in April and May, the first two months of the period. The contraction, the worst on record, was sharper than estimated by economists and could mean that the full year gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020-21 contracts by around 10%. That’s because most experts expect the GDP numbers to be revised downwards as more data from smaller companies, hit hard by the pandemic, and, eventually, data on the informal sector are factored in. Gross Value Added, which measures the value of production minus taxes, declined 22.6%. “With nominal GDP also showing a negative growth of about -23% in the quarter, tax revenues are likely to contract sharply in the year,” said DK Srivastava, chief policy adviser, EY India. However, Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the chief economic adviser, claimed that “India is experiencing a V-shaped recovery after the unlocks have been announced”, citing the declining trend in core sector contraction, freight traffic growth (6% higher in the first 26 days of August compared to a year ago), and power consumption and E-Way bills (almost at last year’s levels) to buttress his point. “We should expect better performance in subsequent quarters,” he said. Other data released on Monday showed that the core sector shrank by 9.6% in July, better than the 12.9% decline in June. Still, the number marked the fifth straight month of decline for eight core industry sectors. The sharp fall in growth could encourage the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), currently holding interest rates, to consider a rate cut when it meets in October, although high inflation may hold its hand. “The RBI still has its focus on growth. This slightly improves chances of a rate cut in October. Unless the inflation comes below 5% in the next reading, RBI might still postpone the rate cut to December,” Reuters quoted L&T’s chief economist Rupa Rege Nitsure as saying.Among sectors, construction was hit the hardest, contracting by 50.3%, matched only by the trade, hotel, transport and communication sector, which declined 47%. Manufacturing contracted 39.3%. The agriculture sector provided the only silver lining, growing by 3.4%. Private consumption as well as investments fell, indicating the hit on both the supply and demand side. Private consumption fell 26.7% and gross fixed capital formation, 47.1%. Government consumption, which grew 16.4%, the highest in five quarters, prevented a sharper fall. Still, the government, which announced a ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus and relief package in May, which also included credit guarantees and liquidity enhancing measures, will have to do more, experts said. “The Indian economy has clearly landed in a severe vicious cycle with the need for stimulating demand becoming paramount while the capacity to support demand by the government is at its weakest,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-sees-a-record-fall/story-VjgOVaM42tHqzccwXqKh1I.html
01-09-2020||India||China provokes again, tries to alter status quo||India said on Monday that it had pre-empted “provocative military movements” by China to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, a development that widened the trust deficit between the two sides and dealt a blow to efforts to reduce tensions.The incident followed the lack of forward movement in the disengagement and de-escalation process even after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. India has insisted that China should deliver on agreed actions for redeploying troops towards their regular posts along the LAC. China has been obdurate about this. People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops violated the consensus reached during military and diplomatic engagements and “carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo” on the night of August 29-30, Indian Army spokesperson Col Aman Anand said in a statement. “Indian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground,” he said, without elaborating on the nature of the Chinese provocation and how Indian soldiers blocked PLA’s actions. More than 200 Chinese soldiers were involved in the attempt to occupy Indian territory on the lake’s southern bank but sufficient number of Indian troops — armed with accurate intelligence about PLA movements in the sector — were able to thwart the threat, officials familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity. The confrontation didn’t escalate into a physical clash, they said. Until now, tensions in this sector were confined to the Finger Area on Pangong Lake’s northern bank.The movement of Chinese troops from their base towards Indian territory on the lake’s southern bank was detected at around midnight on August 29, said one of the officials cited above. Indian troops at forward positions on the LAC have been in the highest state of alert since tensions erupted in early May to deal with any adventurism by PLA. “Inputs provided by intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms made it clear the Chinese troops were on their way to occupy strategic heights on our side of the LAC. We had no doubts about their intention and were fully prepared,” said a second official. As soon as the Chinese movement was detected, Indian commanders ordered their troops to deploy to the heights from where the Chinese soldiers were planning to make ingress into Indian territory. “We took the heights before the Chinese could reach them. Our presence there pre-empted the PLA from coming in. China is now claiming the heights are on their side of the LAC. We are still holding those heights, which are on our side of the LAC,” the first official said. The multiple heights that the army is now holding on the lake’s southern bank will allow the army to dominate the area, officials said. Senior colonel Zhang Shuili, spokesperson of China’s western theatre command, claimed in a statement that the Indian Army “broke the consensus” reached at talks and “illegally crossed the line again near the south bank of Pangong Lake and Reqin Pass, making a blatant provocation and causing tension”. The Indian move “violates China’s territorial sovereignty, seriously undermines peace and stability” in border areas, he said in the statement issued in Mandarin. “We solemnly request the Indian side to immediately withdraw its illegal occupation and control forces, strictly control and restrain its frontline troops, earnestly abide by its commitments and avoid further escalation of the situation,” he added. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a news briefing: “Chinese border troops always strictly abide by the LAC. They never cross the line. Border troops on the two sides have been in close communication regarding the issues on the ground.” A flag meeting of brigade commanders was held at Chushul to resolve the issue but its outcome was not immediately known. “The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity,” Col Anand said. People familiar with developments said PLA’s latest action amounted to a serious transgression, especially in light of India’s repeated assertions that there should be no attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC while the two countries worked on disengagement. “Our side was prepared and took care of things, but this is a serious development,” said one of the people cited above. Experts said the military and diplomatic talks or economic measures against China haven’t led to any change in PLA’s behaviour in the Ladakh sector. Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “[This is] the new normal. The good news is Indian forces seem to be able to stop the bleeding with a deterrent force and manoeuvres. The bad news is the Chinese are still there and show no signs of leaving, and India still has few good options to reverse the initial faits accomplis. “The fact that China attempted to keep poking suggests that their long-term strategy may, in fact, be to force India to commit a large number of forces to the LAC to defend large swathes of land at all times, at great cost to the Indian Army.” But Hu Xijin, editor of state-run Global Times, contended on Twitter that Indian troops had “again pulled a stunt at [the] border” while thinking “China will make concessions to provocative actions”. He added, “Don’t misjudge the situation anymore. If there is a conflict in Pangong Lake, it will only end in new defeat of Indian Army.”In another tweet, he said, “The south bank of Pangong Lake is under actual control of China. In 1962, the Chinese army beat the Indian Army there. This time it is the Indian Army that tried to break the status quo. I hope India will not make the same mistake.”In an interview to HT, chief of defence staff Gen Bipin Rawat said earlier this month that a military option to deal with PLA’s transgressions was on the table, but it would be exercised only if diplomatic and military talks were unproductive.The gap between the situation all along the LAC and a skirmish confined to Ladakh sector appears to be closing, said former Northern Army commander Lt Gen (retired) BS Jaswal. “We need to stay prepared for an intense skirmish that could lead to a limited war. China’s actions are a part of its strategy to retain escalation dominance,” he said. Former army vice chief Lt Gen (retired) AS Lamba said: “China’s intention to escalate the situation from denial to confrontation to attempting to change the status quo is unmissable.” While the army can work for peace on the border, a military option — as mentioned by Gen Rawat — may emerge as the plausible new strategy to guide future posturing in the Ladakh sector, Lamba said. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains an area of key concern for the Indian Army. The Finger Area — a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking Pangong — has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process. Disengagement has progressed somewhat smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace remains sluggish in Gogra area. The overall ground situation remains unchanged in the Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. Last week, India pulled out of a multilateral military exercise being hosted next month by Russia in which around 20 countries, including China, are expected to take part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-provokes-again-tries-to-alter-status-quo/story-48uZYMNv24NKd0YhVfKGVK.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab da, Bharat’s bipartisan Ratna||Former president Pranab Mukherjee, a recipient of the country’s highest civilian award and a towering statesman admired across party lines, died at a hospital in Delhi on Monday, leaving behind a rich legacy he built in a five-decade-long public life that has cemented his place as a doyen of Indian politics and a troubleshooter par excellence for the Congress in its prime.Mukherjee, 84, died of multiple organ failure after he was admitted to New Delhi’s Army Hospital Research and Referral three weeks ago. He slipped into coma after an emergency surgery for a blood clot in his brain on August 10, having also tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). His health deteriorated after a lung infection resulted in septic shock.Doctors said the seven-time parliamentarian died of a cardiac arrest at 4.30pm. His family announced his death in the evening, triggering an outpouring of grief across the political spectrum. Mukherjee, who received the Bharat Ratna in 2019, is survived by two sons and a daughter; his wife died in 2015. “During his political career that spanned decades, Shri Pranab Mukherjee made long-lasting contributions in key economic and strategic ministries. He was an outstanding Parliamentarian, always well-prepared, extremely articulate as well as witty,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter, mourning Mukherjee’s death. “As India’s President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee made Rashtrapati Bhavan even more accessible to common citizens. He made the President’s house a centre of learning, innovation, culture, science and literature. His wise counsel on key policy matters will never be forgotten by me,” Modi said in a series of tweets.The government announced seven days of state mourning for Mukherjee. “During the period... the national flag will fly at half-mast on all buildings throughout India, where it is flown regularly, and there will be no official entertainment,” a home ministry statement said.President Ram Nath Kovind, who succeeded Mukherjee, said his death is the passing of an era. “...A colossus in public life, he served Mother India with the spirit of a sage. The nation mourns losing one of its worthiest sons. Condolences to his family, friends & all citizens,” Kovind tweeted.The Congress parliamentary party, too, offered its condolences to Mukherjee’s family. “Pranabda (as he was fondly called) had been such an integral and prominent part of national life, the Congress party and the central government for over five decades, it is hard to imagine how we can do without his wisdom, experience, sage advice and deep understanding of so many subjects,” a statement signed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi said.“...His life over the past 50 years mirrored 50 years of the history of India, for he played a crucial role both in shaping the course of events as well as actively participating in them...,” it added.Born in Mirati, a village in undivided Bengal, on December 11, 1935, Mukherjee entered Parliament in 1969. A former college teacher with degrees in political science and history (a Masters) and law, he became a protege of the then PM, Indira Gandhi, and remained loyal to her — even during the Emergency (1975-77).He lost the finance portfolio after Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and her son, Rajiv Gandhi, took over as the PM. He formed his own party but returned to the Congress in 1989 after reconciliation with Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991. Mukherjee joined the cabinets of his successors in the Congress party, PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh, and emerged as a consensus builder.Between 1973 and 2012, Mukherjee held the portfolios of external affairs, defence and finance, among other departments, for three PMs and also helped the Congress navigate the tricky corridors of coalition politics. From 2012-2017, he served as the 13th President of India. Mukherjee served in the Rajya Sabha for five terms and in the Lok Sabha for two terms. He was India’s only non-Prime Minister who was the leader of the Lok Sabha for eight years. He was the leader of the Rajya Sabha from 1980-85.Before he became the President in 2012, Mukherjee, who is credited with having a sharp memory and deep intellect, was heading 24 of 39 GOMs (groups of ministers) in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime, an indication of his importance. While Mukherjee himself said the country’s prime ministership was not for him, it was widely believed that it was his biggest ambition. It remained a dream in the end, but he finally got a tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan, from where he often acted as a conscience keeper of national polity. In 2018, a year after Mukherjee demitted the office of President, his visit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in Nagpur — a testimony to his bipartisanship — triggered a row with a section of Congress leaders questioning the move. At that June event, Mukherjee talked about the celebration of diversity and tolerance, and underlined how India’s identity had taken shape after a “long-drawn process of confluence, assimilation and co-existence”. The speech eventually drew praises from all quarters. On Monday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat described Mukherjee as a “guide” for the Sangh who didn’t believe in political untouchability. ‘Citizen Mukherjee’, as his Twitter profile described him, did not lose touch with his roots despite his long walk through the alleys of power and prominence. Every year, he would visit his ancestral home during Durga Puja and perform prayers in traditional attire. “In his death, our country has lost one of its greatest leaders of Independent India... I depended on him a great deal for his wisdom, vast knowledge and experience of public affairs,” former PM Manmohan Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-da-bharat-s-bipartisan-ratna/story-m4saOyxtIzLmhXxtvaWqeP.html
01-09-2020||India||In 2019, a person died by suicide every four minutes: NCRB data||Last year, 139,123 people died by suicide and 421,104 were killed in accidents in India, according to the Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India report for 2019 released by the National Crime Records Bureau on Monday. Between 2018 and 2019, the number of people dying in accidents increased by 2.3% while for suicides, this number was 3.4%. Traffic accidents were the single-biggest contributor to accidental deaths in India, amounting to 43% of all such fatalities. Sudden deaths, drowning and poisoning were other major causes of accidental deaths. These together led to 24% of accidental deaths. Forces of nature, such as natural disasters, killed 8,000 people, or 2% of all accidental deaths. Eighty-five percent of deaths caused in traffic accidents were reported in road accidents while railway accidents and accidents at railway crossings caused the remaining 15% of these deaths.Road accidents kill even those not travelling in a vehicle. Of nearly 155,000 people who died in road accidents, nearly 12,000 or 7.7% were pedestrians. Among motorised vehicles, two-wheelers were the deadliest with nearly 59,000 or 38% of all deaths being of those who were on a motorcycle or a scooter.One in every three of the 140,000 people who died of suicide in 2019 took the step due to family problems. Being ill, and substance abuse were the other major known causes (together accounting for 23%). Bankruptcy or indebtedness, unemployment and poverty led to at least 11,500 suicides, about 8.2% of all such fatalities.The report added that 10,281 farmers – cultivators and farm labourers – committed suicide in 2019, only 68 less than the number of farmers who committed suicide in 2018. Farmers comprise 7.4% of all people who died due to suicide in India. Suicides among daily wage earners was higher — about 32,500. They comprised 23% of those who died due to suicide.The NCRB has not been publishing reason of suicides among farmers since 2015, when it last showed economic distress to be the biggest factor in most states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-2019-a-person-died-by-suicide-every-four-minutes-ncrb-data/story-UIHU9FXeRmk0OlYWjUASfM.html
01-09-2020||India||China opens new front along LAC amid de-escalation talks||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has opened a new front along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with its “provocative military movements” on the southern bank of Pangong Lake to alter the status quo in the area, people familiar with developments said on Monday. So far, Chinese aggression in this sector in eastern Ladakh was confined to the lake’s northern bank – the Finger Area that has emerged as the toughest part of the disengagement process. “The PLA’s intentions stand exposed. Instead of carrying out disengagement and restoring status quo ante in the existing friction areas, China is bent on changing the status quo in new areas,” one of the officials cited above said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a statement on the latest Chinese provocation, the Indian Army said PLA has violated the consensus reached during military and diplomatic talks to reduce tension in eastern Ladakh, where the two sides have been locked in a tense confrontation since early May. Experts concurred that PLA was attempting to change the status quo in new areas and stressed that India has to stay prepared to thwart such moves. “While there are areas on the northern bank where the Indian Army only carries out patrolling, the southern bank is strongly held by us. The PLA is fully conscious of it. Any transgression by the PLA in this area is a clear indication that China is trying to change the status quo and open a new front,” said former Northern Army commander Lt Gen (retired) DS Hooda. The lake’s northern bank has been at the centre of the current border tensions, as PLA has refused to withdraw from the Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking the lake. Before PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, overlooking Indian deployments, the Indian Army would patrol up to Finger 8, which New Delhi considers an integral part of its territory. The new positions held by PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. PLA is likely to intrude into other areas to exert pressure on the Indian Army and build its bargaining power, and the Depsang sector is one such vulnerable area, said Lt Gen (retired) BS Jaswal, also a former Northern Army commander. PLA’s forward deployments in Depsang have hindered the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A 12 and 13. The military buildup in this sector includes the deployment of tanks and artillery by the two sides. The Indian Army has to keep a strict vigil all along the disputed border with China – from Ladakh and Uttarakhand to Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, said Lt Gen (retired) Rakesh Sharma, a former commander of Leh-based 14 Corps headquarters. “China is flexing its military muscles to show it can do whatever it wants and not expecting any reaction. But our troops were fully prepared on Pangong Lake’s southern bank and reacted promptly,” Sharma said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-opens-new-front-along-lac-amid-de-escalation-talks/story-LgfHYPIwQIdRicZfLWCFHM.html
01-09-2020||India||GDP estimates a matter of shame for Modi government, says Chidambaram||Former finance minister P Chidambaram on Monday said the GDP estimates should be a matter of “surprise and shame” to the government that was seeing ‘green shoots’ on several days during the first quarter and did nothing to cushion the fall by taking suitable fiscal and welfare measures. “But we know that the Modi government has no shame and will not acknowledge its mistakes. All these had been anticipated,” Chidambaram said, addressing a joint virtual press conference with party colleague Supriya Shrinate after the provisional estimates of GDP were released for the quarter April-June 2020.  India’s GDP shrank by the steepest ever 23.9% in the April-June period as the coronavirus-induced lockdowns battered an already slowing economy, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSP). ALSO READ | India’s economy contracts by 23.9%, worst in decadesChidambaram said the Congress and other opposition parties had warned and urged the government to take preventive and pre-emptive measures. “Our pleas fell on deaf ears. The country, as a whole, is paying a heavy price, the poor and the vulnerable are in despair. It is only the Modi government that was nonchalant and uncaring. The government peddled a fake narrative, but that narrative has been exploded today by the estimates,” he added. The senior Congress leader said the GDP in the first quarter has declined by a whopping 23.9%. “That means, about one quarter of the gross domestic output as on June 30, 2019 has been wiped out in the last 12 months. Another way of looking at it is, since the end of 2019-20, the gross domestic output has fallen by about 20%.” Chidambaram said the only sector that has grown is agriculture, forestry and fishing at 3.4%. “The Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) who blamed an ‘Act of God’ for the economic decline should be grateful to the farmers and the gods who blessed the farmers,” he said. Chidambaram said every other sector of the economy has declined sharply, some precipitously as manufacturing is down 39.3%; construction by 50.3%; and trade, hotels, transport and communications by 47.0%. “The estimates do not come as a surprise to us. They should be a matter of surprise to the government that was seeing ‘green shoots’ on several days during the first quarter. They should also be a matter of shame to the government that did nothing — literally nothing — to cushion the fall by taking suitable fiscal and welfare measures,” he said. Chidambaram said the “economic tragedy” was foretold by many close observers of the Indian economy, most recently by the RBI in its annual report released a few days ago. RBI had pointed out the contraction in the first half of 2020 is widely regarded as deeper and more destructive than the Great Depression and the Global Financial Crisis (of 2008), he added. “Turning to India, high frequency indicators that have arrived so far point to a retrenchment in activity that is unprecedented in history; the total stimulus package (liquidity and fiscal measures) for G-20 countries averaged 12.1% of GDP (5.1% of GDP for EMEs and 19.8% of GDP for AES); the shock to consumption is severe, and it will take quite some time to mend and regain the pre-Covid-19 momentum; and a majority of respondents reported pessimism relating to the general economic situation, employment, inflation and income,” he said. “Let me say with regret: it will take many months before the economy turns the corner and registers positive growth. The inaction and ineptitude of the government gives us no hope that we will see light at the end of the tunnel at any time soon,” Chidambaram further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gdp-estimates-a-matter-of-shame-for-modi-government-says-chidambaram/story-mpPiVVE3Zc4YgD2OENFThK.html
01-09-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee: The vice-captain who went on to be referee||India’s former President, Bharat Ratna Pranab Mukherjee, whose public life spanned more than 5 decades, died after battling a brain surgery at the Army Research and Referral Hospital on August 31, leaving behind a rich legacy of old-school politics, three children, countless friends across parties and a diary—the only chronicle of his life from a nondescript village in undivided Bengal to the ultimate edifices of federal power. He held ten ministerial portfolios, signed historic agreements such as GATT and Indo-US Nuclear treaty, positioned himself as a trusted support system to at least three Congress presidents and a reliable vice-captain to as many Prime Ministers. Then, as the country’s first citizen, he had a vantage view of politics at the highest level from Rashtrapati Bhavan and often acted as a conscience keeper of national polity. Also read| ‘Passing of an era’: President Kovind condoles Pranab Mukherjee’s deathHis death elicited an outpouring of grief across the political spectrum, a reminder of Pranab Mukherjee’s brand of politics that puts a premium on personal equations—the reason why everyone called him Pranab da and not the distant Pranab babu.Mukherjee was born in Mirati, a nondescript village in undivided Bengal on December 11, 1935. His father Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, involved in India’s struggle for independence, would go on to serve in the West Bengal Legislative Council between 1952 and 1964 from Congress. Senior Mukherjee was also a member of the All India Congress Committee. Pranab has spoken of how, as a young boy, he had to walk for miles, and during the monsoon swim across an overflowing river, to reach school. But he doggedly pursued education. For him, India’s Independence in 1947 meant simple dreams; a footbridge across the river and better food. From the archives | Pranab Mukherjee recalls how Rajiv Gandhi became PM after Indira’s deathBy 1963, with degrees in political science and history (a Masters) and law, Mukherjee was teaching political science at Vidyanagar College and Howrah Chaitanya College in West Bengal. The young boy from Mirati might have thought he had arrived – but in truth, he was just getting started.In 1969, he was involved in V K Krishna Menon’s successful run in the Midnapore Lok Sabha constituency (Menon was contesting as an independent). The same year, Bangla Congress, a regional offshoot of the Indira Gandhi-led Congress, sent him to the Rajya Sabha (Two years later, it merged with the main party). He had four more terms in the Rajya Sabha (1975, 1981, 1993, and 1999) before he won 2004 Lok Sabha election in Jangipur. He retained his seat in 2009 and after three years, he became President of India. Through these four decades, he was a key player in the political mainstream, expect for the period between 1984 and 1989, when he was sidelined by the late Rajiv Gandhi, who considered Mukherjee a rival for the PM’s post after Indira Gandhi’s assassination. In 1986, he even formed his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress in West Bengal, but merged it with the Congress, after making up with Rajiv Gandhi, in 1989. While Mukherjee himself has said the Prime Minister’s office was not for him, it was widely believed that his biggest ambition was the Prime Minister’s office in the leafy corner of the South Block. It remained a distant dream, but he did ascend Raisina Hill, occupied various other corners of North and South Block, and finally settled for a tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan. His first PM, of course, was Indira Gandhi. He was a junior minister of industry in her 1973 cabinet. In 1982, he rose to be finance minister in her government. Then came his brief stint in the wilderness. But he was soon back.Jairam Ramesh’s semi-autobiographical book “To the Brink and Back” narrates how Mukherjee prepared a draft roadmap of the new government and its economic priorities in 1991 before P V Narasimha Rao became the PM. Mukherjee was the chief architect behind India’s accession to the WTO in January 1995.While the prospects of India acceding to an all-encompassing multilateral trade regime met with strong domestic opposition, Mukherjee convinced Rao and later signed the WTO Trade Agreement. And a year later, when Rao—sidelined into oblivion—needed a Delhi resident to support his bail application, Mukherjee’s wife (she owned a house in GK 2) signed the documents in the police station. FROM THE ARCHIVES | ‘Pranab, I know of the consequences’: Indira on storming Golden TempleMukherjee’s relationship with Manmohan Singh was perhaps the most complex and, at the same time, most rewarding. Having served under Mukherjee in various capacities, Singh initially continued to call his former boss “sir”, much to the latter’s discomfort. Finally, when Mukherjee announced it was untenable to be addressed as sir by his boss, Singh resorted to Pranab ji while the adamant Bengali called him Dr. Singh.He worked hard under Singh, but like most members of the UPA cabinet, his loyalty was tilted towards Sonia Gandhi. Mukherjee enjoyed unbridled power, led the defence, finance and foreign affairs ministries, headed more than 100 groups of ministers (GoMs; the UPA’s preferred tool for policy-making and trouble shooting) and had a say in every policy, right from the creation of an anti corruption ombudsman to the stimulus package of 2008 which saved India from economic ruin.To be sure, Singh and Mukherjee differed on quite a few issues. There was exasperation in the PMO at the way some Mukherjee aides tried to run the show in the ministry. But Singh, never missed seeking out Mukherjee’s counsel on key issues of economy and foreign policy. When the Pakistan PM said he would come to Mohali to watch the world cup match between the two countries in 2011with Singh, the latter asked Mukherjee what he should discuss. Mukherjee retorted, “anything under the sun except serious bilateral issues.” (The finance minister had little idea about one-day cricket. Later he would praise Singh’s patience for spending a whole day in a stadium) Days after Singh’s retirement in 2014, this writer asked his principal secretary TKA Nair, why the PM, a progressive economic thinker allowed the controversial proposal on retrospective tax in the 2012 budget (a budget is always approved by the PM days before introduction), and Nair replied that the PM perhaps couldn’t tell Mukherjee anything considering the latter’s stature and experience. There was an effort to make him the President in 2007. The Congress proposed the names of Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and Sushil Kumar Shinde to allies as possible presidential candidate. But there was no replacement for Mukherjee in the government in the early years of the UPA, and the party decided it couldn’t afford to lose him. Finally, in 2012, the chance came again. The party still wanted him, but eventually Sonia Gandhi, the party president had little option but to back Mukherjee; any other candidate would have meant a contest. In a farewell function for him, Gandhi quipped that she would miss Mukherjee’s tantrums.Pranab Mukherjee went to Rashtrapati Bhavan, a graceful exit from active politics. But soon, the customary equation between the President and the PM in the republic’s inner circle took a new turn when Narendra Modi, a man straight from state politics, met Mukherjee, a perpetual national player. Their bond grew quickly. The President often advised the PM on foreign affairs and other issues. Modi has publicly acknowledged Mukherjee’s contributions saying, “he held my hand in my initial days in Delhi.” The equation didn’t suffer in Mukherjee’s post-retirement life. Senior NDA ministers regularly queued up at Rajaji Marg for his counsel. A party colleague once described Mukherjee as the Shashi Kapoor of politics— always under the shadow of the bigger stars (PMs). But Pranab Mukherjee didn’t breathe his last as a loser. He didn’t have a godfather, yet he made it to the very top. From an ordinary background, he became a towering figure of contemporary politics. He wanted to be a teacher but life brought him to politics. It’s been a long walk from Mirati village to corridors of power in Delhi, or from his first certificate of victory in Rajya Sabha in 1960s to the Bharat Ratna. Till a few days before he went to hospital for the final time, he diligently maintained his diary, as he did for the last 50 years. What tales it can tell now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-the-vice-captain-who-went-on-to-be-referee/story-6FcWin4MbTt2iD2qv1WY9J.html
01-09-2020||India||Kolkata lockdown enters last day, over 4,000 arrested past week for violating norms||The West Bengal government is enforcing the sixth and last day of complete state-wide lockdown this month in a bid to break the chain of Covid-19 that has already infected nearly 1.6 lakh people till date in the state.Even though the Mamata Banerjee-led administration had announced three lockdown days in September - 7, 11 and 12 of the month - the ‘unlock 4’ guidelines released by the union government says that states will have to consult the centre before enforcing such lockdown restrictions. “We will discuss the matter with the union government. The state had declared the lockdown days before the ‘unlock 4’ guidelines were released,” said a senior state government official. The state government had been enforcing biweekly lockdown since July. In August, five state-wide complete lockdown days have been enforced and the sixth and last one was being enforced on Monday. The government had changed the dates multiple times and had even reduced the number of days from nine to six. More than 4000 people have been arrested in Kolkata alone in the last five lockdown days for violating restrictions, while over 2,500 people were booked for not wearing masks. Also read: Uttar Pradesh’s ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines - What’s new and what remains unchanged“If arrest figures, over the five lockdown days, are considered, Kolkatans seem to be showing no restraint on lockdown days. On every lockdown day, the number of people arrested for violating lockdown numbers varied between 700 and 900, while the number of persons booked for not wearing masks varied between 350 and 500,” said a senior police officer.Since Monday, morning police barricades have been put up on roads across the city, naka checking was being done, vehicle owners were being checked and people were being questioned and either sent back home or arrested if they failed to provide valid reasons for being on the roads. Kolkata has registered around 40,000 Covid-19 cases - highest among all districts in West Bengal. North 24 Parganas has reported around 33,000 cases. The city has registered 1,280 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-lockdown-enters-last-day-over-4-000-arrested-past-week-for-violating-norms/story-VvMHk4MwBuWlwqbpYCZARL.html
01-09-2020||India||“He asked me to strip, said that’s the only way to get modelling assignments”||In a shocking case, National Commission for Women recently sent out notices to celebrities such as Mahesh Bhatt, Urvashi Rautela, Rannvijay Sangha, Esha Gupta, Mouni Roy and Prince Narula in connection with an alleged sexual assault case against Sunny Verma, promoter of IMG Ventures, a modelling agency. After several girls including minors asked activist Yogita Bhayana for help, Bhayana approached National Commission for Women with her complaint. When summoned by NCW, the celebs clarified that they were unaware about Sunny Verma’s alleged criminal background. “Verma used to ask girls for completely nude pictures and videos. He threatened them to submit to his sexual desires. After establishing physical relationship, he used to blackmail girls for regular sexual favours. What is most appalling is that Verma used the name of known actors and filmmaker to trap aspirants. Famous faces were seen promoting his company. A simple Google search on this person should have alarmed them as this person has been arrested in a molestation case in the past,” says Bhayana, founder, People against Rapes in India.Rekha Sharma, chairperson, NCW urges young people to be vigilant. “Modelling aspirants must do a thorough background check of the agency they desire to work with. In this case, many got fooled because Sunny Verma used top names to promote himself,” she says.Sharma also says that the onus lies on public figures to not promote racketeers. “These celebrities seemed to be only concerned with money. People look up to them and such conduct on their part leaves one aghast. One of the Bollywood celebrities that endorsed Verma’s show told me that she had not taken any money to promote Verma while Verma produced evidence before the commission — records of paying her an amount of Rs 8 lakhs.” Sharma says that this case also involves minor girls and the agency got no NOC signed by their parents.“There was no written permission from the parent of these 15-16 year old girls,” she says. Now, the commission is preparing a report for the police to take further action. “We had no idea about such activities”The celebs who had been seen promoting Verma’s event have said that they themselves were taken for a ride by Sunny Verma. Filmmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said in a Tweet, “I have neither entered into any agreement or received any monetary considerations for the event. Unfortunately, my name and images were picked up from social media and misused in relation to the event without my consent and authority. When I confronted them on this, they have apologised profusely and withdrew all my images in association of the event. As a father of three girls, I have the highest regard for the cause taken up by Ms Yogita and NCW,” said Mahesh Bhatt in a tweet.Actor Urvashi Rautela denied on social media any collaboration with Sunny Verma. “My official association with the client was purely centered on rendering my services towards the on-ground finale event happening in November as the scope of a celebrity jury. I was in no capacity involved with the selection process, operations of the event, and neither is the knowledge of the same. Owing to the collaboration of many of our respected industry friends with this event, my business manager took the plunge and went ahead with the association. We are saddened to learn about the allegations made on the ownership of the event that surfaced recently on social media and was highly condemned for such inhumane acts and behavior,” she says.However, Bhayana says that such carelessness if the parts of public figures is not done. “They have a full fledged team to handle collaborations and endorsements. I just don’t understand how could Bollywood stars be so careless to promote someone without verification. Due to the use of such big names by Verma, so many gullible girls fell into his trap and were exploited by him. I am glad that at least they have realised where the lapse happened and they are cooperating now. I hope these girls get justice” It’s so easy to lay a trapCon men, smooth-talking fraudsters , social media-savvy racketeers, lecherous agents - the glamour world is brimming with them. Starry-eyed small towners desperate to make it big are their perfect victim. Abroad, while you have regulatory bodies such as MAMA (Managers And Models Association), there’s no such body in India, which makes it easy for criminals to operate.Rate kya hai tumhara?Model Renee Kujur recalls the time when she came to Delhi from Chhattisgarh at the age of 19. “Agents asked, what’s my rate for one night. When I got upset, they said, ‘All models sell their bodies. Some charge ₹500, some charge ₹2 lakh. That’s how they achieve success,” she shares. Shattered, Renee gave up her modelling dreams until she met genuine agents that got her shoots for reputed brands.Shockingly, even today agents demand a nude web chat in return for work. “They make you believe that sleeping for work is the norm, this is how the industry works. They say when big names can compromise, what’s your problem.”Sir ke saath room mein chali jaanaModel Devika Das, a print model based in the Capital says agents and clients often expect sexual favours and they don’t hesitate from propositioning even established models. “Once an agent called me home for a meeting. When he offered me wine, I refused. He then went inside his room and closed the door. His associate told me, ‘sir ke saath room mein chali jao.” I understood what was the purpose of this meeting. I immediately left from there and blocked their numbers,” says Das.“He asked for nudes, said that’s the only way to enter the industry”I saw an ad for a beauty pageant on Facebook. I paid ₹2950 as fees to participate. The organizers told me I was among the 8000 girls shortlisted from across India. I was added to a Whatsapp group that had about 200 girls from Bangalore. We were not supposed to talk to each other. Soon, online auditions began. There was a category called ‘Bold’. I was told by the organiser that if I don’t share fully exposing pictures, I won’t qualify. When I protested, he threatened me. He said he had big contacts and the police won’t take any action against him. I quit the competition, broken. Later, I reported the matter to the police when I got to know that this man was pressurizing many other girls into sending nudes, including minors. I hope the authorities take strict actions against him, or else he will go on destroying lives. Dhanya Kurup, 24, Kerala (name changed to protect privacy)“He groped me, I felt so helpless and scared”In October, I came across a Facebook ad for wild card entries in a reality show called Survivors. The organiser claimed it was to be aired on a leading TV channel. I paid an entry fees of ₹40,000 to take part in the show. There were about 65 participants - 6-7 girls and the rest, guys. We went to a village called Nanauta in Saharanpur, UP where the shooting started. We were given tasks such as walking through mud and cow dung, our feet tied with rope. A very well known TV star attended the finale of the show. The organizer made me pay ₹58 k to fly the celeb.There was a party in the night and everyone had drinks. I was not feeling well, so I went to the girls room to rest. The organizer followed me and started forcing me to join the party. He tried groping me and he was so aggressive that it left marks on my arms when he pulled me. In the morning, he started forcing me to come along with him in his car, but I refused. I somehow escaped with the help of a few guys. It has been two years and the show has not been aired anywhere. I have been duped. I never suspected anything fishy because the organizer seemed to be associated with big names from the world of entertainment. I wish I knew that it was all a sham.  Parmita Thanvi, 23, Gwalior (name changed to protect privacy)Red flags to watch out forFake agencies make it clear that no work can happen without “compromise”. Genuine agencies never make such offers. Fake agencies ask you to provide bold, revealing pictures. They insist that skin show is in demand. Genuine agencies do not ask you to get deliberately provocative pictures clicked.Fake agencies ask you to pay for auditions. Genuine agencies arrange for auditions and take care of the expenses involved.Fake agencies tell you to pay for model/artist card. They also ask for registration/membership fees which could be anywhere between ₹ 2,000-50,000. Genuine modelling agencies do not ask for any fees. They take a percentage from your payment after you get some work.Fake agencies take names of successful films and serials where they have placed their artists but have no proofs.

01-09-2020||India||‘No human being can be a do-gooder always…’||Actor Sanjay Gagnani is enjoying the moment he waited for months that is to get back to the sets of his show. “What a relief it has been to be back to work. For me work is worship. I have reached here with a lot of effort as acting is and has been my passion. Lockdown was a blessing in disguise in a way as I got ample time to spend with my family after so many years. Also, we shot a few episodes from our respective homes and that truly gave all the actors a confidence that the work can be done this way too. I was thrilled when informed the we will now shoot on sets,” he said.Talking about the new normal on the shoot location, Sanjay said, “As an actor it’s our job to entertain people so we had to go back to work. With new normal, things are very different with regular sanitization of sets. Of course, each and every one on the sets are undergoing certain measures to make sure we are virus free. These steps make you much confident to freely work on sets. Also, I have been a person who loves to keep fit and maintain my immunity. I have been into sports since my school days so this has again helped me to maintain my fitness and health, as that’s important for us to keep this virus at bay. It is high time that we need to take chances as none of us can just sit at home forever. I feel if we fear anything it does affect our performance and it will show on our face so that needs to be kept in check.”Sanjay had his fair share of struggle and is finally getting the recognition he always wanted. “Born and brought up in Gujarat I loved to act and play sports. Later I moved on to Mumbai, I tried modelling, featuring in numerous shows to finally playing a character whom most TV audience love to hate. I remember when I got this show, ‘Kundali Bhagya,’ it was a cameo role that was supposed to go on for two-three months but the way it shaped up was unbelievable, it has been three years now and I am the negative lead now. I’m enjoying playing a baddie on prime-time show that has been getting high TRP ratings,” said Sanjay during his webinar interaction in Lucknow.The young actor has been part of the shows like ‘Bairi Piya,’ ‘Hamari Devrani,’ ‘Encounter,’ ‘Veera,’ ‘Pyaar Ka the End,’ and films like ‘Rakhtbeej’ and ‘Heroine.’ He is open to roles that are thrilling and at the same time has number of emotions to portray. “I love doing characters with different shades as no human being can be do-gooder always so it’s natural to be good and bad in the same life. So, I awaiting for more such roles coming my way across mediums.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/no-human-being-can-be-a-do-gooder-always/story-CaVHW5DfBbTWSuPZOCw6DM.html
01-09-2020||Today's||Bhushan case: SC sets a wrong precedent||After holding advocate-activist Prashant Bhushan in contempt, the Supreme Court (SC), on Monday, imposed a ₹1 fine on Mr Bhushan as punishment — the failure to deposit the token fine would have resulted in Mr Bhushan being imprisoned for three months, and being debarred from practising law in the SC for three years. Mr Bhushan has accepted the verdict and will pay the fine. To many who believed that the SC made a mistake in interpreting criticism as contempt, the mild nature of the sentence is an acknowledgement by the court that what it saw as an offence did not merit strict punishment. But the text of the order sentencing Mr Bhushan throws up a more disturbing picture. The SC bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, has unequivocally said that Mr Bhushan made “reckless allegations”, capable of “shaking the very edifice of the judicial administration”. It has limited the boundaries of free speech, saying that criticism of the judiciary must be “measured, strictly rational, sober and proceed from the highest motives without being coloured by partisan spirit or pressure tactics or intimidatory attitude”. These are all subjective terms which can be interpreted in ways to quell criticism. The sentence does not, in any way, mitigate the original order, through which the court has restricted the space for criticism. A victory for those who believe in free speech would have been a review of the order itself. The judiciary must be open to feedback from citizens, even as citizens accept its supremacy. The Bhushan case represented an opportunity to set right the contempt jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the court had ended up setting a wrong precedent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/bhushan-case-sc-sets-a-wrong-precedent/story-VZxBPzTBO7POEzuDsdYf1O.html
01-09-2020||Editorials||Resisting China in Ladakh | HT Editorial||The end of August brought a reminder that the border standoff between India and China is far from being resolved. On the military front, both countries have significantly increased deployment along the Line of Actual Control (most recently, on August 29, when India moved fast to scotch another adventurist foray by China) and their soldiers are eye-ball to eye-ball — a far cry from the disenga-gement and de-escalation that military commanders continue to discuss. On the diplomatic front, India has pulled out of a Shanghai Cooperation Organi-sation exercise rather than have its soldiers stand side-by-side with Chinese troops while a foreign-ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue has been fast-tracked. The economic relationship is also slowly disintegrating. India has rightly said that the changes in the territorial status quo must be reversed. China has said the two sides should accept the present ground reality, move on and think of the future. Beijing’s position is absurd. With wars of conquest largely history, Beijing’s preferred model is to impose political humiliation through symbolically powerful victories designed to make the other side look weak. While there is a debate as to what motivates Beijing, there can be little doubt as to what would happen if New Delhi gave in — the perception of subordination of India to its northern neighbour in the eyes of citizens as well as other countries. Which is why the present situation is unacceptable and which is why the border will remain on a hair-trigger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/resisting-china-in-ladakh/story-FZ3aDpmyR1BuK662DpW57O.html
01-09-2020||Editorials||Staggering contraction: Announce a fiscal stimulus, resolve the GST dispute||According to data released by the National Statistical Office on Monday, India’s GDP contracted by a staggering 23.9% in the April-June quarter. The contraction is larger than the 19.2% figure projected by a Bloomberg poll of economists. And it shows that the nation-wide lockdown, which was in place in April and May, has taken a heavy toll on economic activity. An examin-ation of Gross Value Added (GVA) figures, which is GDP minus taxes, shows that the non-farm economy has suffered a contraction, including public admini-stration, defence and other services. In an unusual development, the GDP growth numbers are lower than GVA, which means that taxes have also contracted. Experts believe that the first estimates could see further downward revision as informal sector numbers become available at a later stage. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) to the ministry of finance, while reacting to the numbers, said that they reflected the exogenous economic shock of the pandemic. He claimed that the economy was already in the process of achieving a V-shaped recovery. High frequency indicators for August do suggest that things are improving. However, it is important to differentiate between a sequential and annual recovery. The real question is not whether the subsequent GDP numbers show a smaller contraction than 23.9%. What matters is a return to pre-pandemic income levels. Most experts believe that this is not likely in the next few quarters, maybe even years. The government must adopt a two-pronged approach immediately. One, as this newspaper has argued, it must announce a second fiscal stimulus — and soon — for that is the only way to spur demand. This deployment of additional public resources must be done smartly. For instance, the government’s own survey suggests that at least three-fourths of micro, small and medium enterprises were using less than half of their productive capacity as on August 1. Can the stimulus be geared towards boosting this sector? Or would a direct cash transfer to citizens work better? Two, as Covid-19 cases continue to increase, even the ongoing sequential recovery may get jeopardised. India’s battle against Covid-19 is critically dependent on how state governments handle the challenge. They need resources to perform on this front. This is why it is necessary that the Centre resolves the ongoing Goods and Service Tax compensation payment dispute with the states in an amicable manner. Till India gets its post-pandemic economy right, its developmental and global ambitions will remain unmet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/staggering-contraction-announce-a-fiscal-stimulus-resolve-the-gst-dispute/story-BbzpYvQQ4dogRm7xlAi7FO.html
