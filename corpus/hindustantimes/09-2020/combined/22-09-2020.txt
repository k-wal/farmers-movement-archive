The bid, which closes on October 30, is expected to be postponed again. The restrictive terms have scared away buyers each time. The government believed buyers would line up despite the huge liabilities. Every year of delay will only make AI less attractive to any potential buyer. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri was candid enough to admit in Parliament: “With Rs 60,000 crores debt, the choice is not between privatisation and non- privatisation...but between privatisation and closing down.” In the new terms proposed, the government wants to offer 100% equity for sale of the airline and has wisely bundled Air India Express (the low-cost carrier unit) along with engineering and other subsidiaries — including its stake in joint ventures in catering, cargo, ground handling and other operations. It has excluded all real estate assets across the country, including the AI building in Mumbai.But there’s still an astronomical debt of around Rs 23,000 crore that is part of the bid. The ostensible logic here is that the assets are also of an equal amount. And therein lies the rub. While the debts are determinate, the assets are not. Most aircraft are on lease. Other high-value assets, including planes, which have been purchased over the years, and contracts will be of questionable value. There are allegations of corruption, and investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and other agencies are in full swing.It is impossible for bidders to complete due diligence in such a short time-frame to get a realistic asset value to be able to make a bid. The lease rentals earlier negotiated may also have to be renegotiated. The government cannot deny these apprehensions as it has itself initiated enquiries and is keen to press charges.Closing the airline cannot be an option. That will mean wilfully absorbing all the liabilities while losing the best value that could be realised via a thought-through transparent bidding process in a timely manner. That is feasible only if AI is sold as a going concern. Though it has lost its sheen, it is still a much-loved brand, and has huge potential that can be unlocked by the right strategic investor, provided the government makes comprehensive changes in the terms. AI has a vast domestic and global network to key destinations, assured time slots and space in prized airports with airside access, hangars, engineering backbone, infrastructure, trained engineers and flight crew, bilateral rights, assurance of continued protection of those rights, huge aircraft orders with delivery timelines, and revenue of around Rs 25,000 crore, which can be doubled with better management in a short period. All these can ratchet up its valuation to about Rs 50,000 crore, comparable to rival carrier Indigo, by listing it after three to four years with the right restructuring, management and leadership. Offering AI as a zero-debt company will enable quicker and easier due diligence by bidders. In turn, they will gain confidence in what they are buying because it’s not easy to assess the huge inventory of aviation assets and numerous complex contracts. The failed bid of Jet Airways should be an eye-opener. Here are a few more suggestions that may attract more bidders. First, the bidding process must be a global, open, transparent electronic tender. The shortlisted bidders must first deposit the reserve price in an escrow and the bidding must commence and end within six to eight hours. It must not be a closed “sealed envelope” bid, as is often the practice which, apart from being vulnerable to malpractice, won’t get the best price. It should be an open auction where each bidder can increase the bid price after viewing the offer price of other bidders. But to get the highest valuation possible, the government must hold pre-tender meetings and understand bidder apprehensions before tender documents are finalised. This is key to attracting the highest number of bidders. The employees’ question may be the biggest deal-breaker. AI is overstaffed — its staff strength is over 30,000 if all contracted employees are included. The new owner must be allowed to retain only the minimum number of employees per aircraft. The staff strength per aircraft in Indigo is around 70 compared with about 470 in AI, and to be fair, the government must settle laid-off employees through an attractive voluntary retirement scheme by selling some of the airline’s real estate assets. AI’s trained and skilled manpower of pilots, engineers and cabin crew will definitely be needed by the new management. But the latter must have total freedom on this decision.This will facilitate a competitive playing field so that the company that wins can focus on the airline. The successful bidder should mandatorily be made to list AI on the stock exchange within 36 months of the takeover, prescribing minimum levels of Indian public holding of the stock so that it continues being looked up to as a national carrier. If the auction is marketed and managed well, AI will entice many buyers. Those managing the bid must do things differently. It may be pertinent to recall what Albert Einstein said: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”.

22-09-2020||News||India must take the lead in devising bio-defences||Although China may not have deliberately created Covid-19, it is possible that its release was the result of a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has been doing “gain-of-function” research on bat coronaviruses. Such research modifies a virus to make it deadlier or more transmissible — specifically, transmissible between species. We may never know the truth of the virus’s origin. But, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown the Chinese government what is possible: To decimate global economies without inviting a significant economic or geopolitical toll itself. So there are new dangers.Gene editing has now made it possible to engineer viruses whose effects range from Covid-19 to the bubonic plague. And the danger comes not only from governments: Rogue scientists and bio-hackers have access to the same tools. This is why India must take the lead in developing bio-defences. In my book, The Driver in the Driverless Car, I warned about the dangers of gene editing, forecasting that, in an era of bio-ethicists and bio-hackers, we will have to make difficult choices about whether to restrict the synthetic-biology technologies making the manufacture of these viruses possible. The danger is acute, the book explains, because in the near future, we will routinely have our genetic material analysed. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) and genomic data, scientists will decipher the complex relationships between DNA and biological processes and find treatments for diseases. Later in this decade, we will be able to download and “print” at home medicines, tissues, and bacteria custom-designed to suit our DNA and keep us healthy.As we are seeing with the development of vaccines for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, accelerated research and development is possible. In the past, the creation and testing of vaccine candidates against pathogens have taken decades. Now, we are on track to do it within months. There are several companies using genomic blueprints made of DNA or ribonucleic acid (RNA) to teach the body how to defend itself from Covid-19. By injecting these into human cells, they cause them to produce virus antigens — which the immune system reacts to. The Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidates, now in phase-three clinical trials, were developed in weeks; it is conceivable that the same could be done in hours once the technologies are perfected.In the updated Indian edition of The Driver in the Driverless Car, I included details of a cancer-cure plan that I presented to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi at Kevadia, Gujarat, last October, a plan predicated on India’s readiness to embrace advancing technologies. With these, India has the potential not only to provide its people with the most-advanced medical care but also to cure cancer itself. It can lead the world in research and innovation and lay the foundation for a trillion-dollar medical industry. I proposed that in order to achieve this, India launch the largest clinical trial in world history and use technologies such as genomics, synthetic biology, sensors, 3D printing, and AI to analyse data and develop treatments. Not only will this provide direct benefit to cancer patients; the discoveries will lead to the creation of hundreds of start-ups in India and fuel innovation in the medical sciences. This is the type of initiative that India must launch in preparation for the next pandemic.India could also accelerate the process of testing vaccines — which has become the slowest part of the development cycle. In testing cancer drugs, for example, labs all over the world are creating three-dimensional cell cultures, “patient-derived organoids”, from a tumour biopsy. The leading company in this field, SEngine Precision Medicine, is able to test more than 100 cancer drugs on organoids, using the tumours rather than human subjects as guinea pigs. Researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute announced in January that they had developed the first human “organ-on-a-chip” model of the lung that accurately recapitulates human physiology and pathophysiology at organ sophistication. Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers have been developing a microfluidic platform that connects engineered tissues from up to 10 organs, allowing the replication of human-organ interactions for weeks at a time and measurement of the effects of drugs on different body parts. Many more such systems are in development that could accelerate testing and treatment; and these are the missing component of bio-defence testing.All of these technologies can be designed and developed in India, with an investment comparable to the cost of the Mangalyaan and Chandrayaan-2 missions. In my conversation with him, I found PM Modi to be brilliant in understanding technologies and their potential. He was excited about having India take the global leader in medical research, and asked his chief scientific adviser, K Vijay Raghavan, to present him with a proposal to implement it by February. Then Covid-19 happened and all efforts were put on hold. It is time for India to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by the coronavirus — and to implement the grand plans to build its bio-defences and benefit the world by curing disease.Vivek Wadhwa is a distinguished fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program of Harvard Law School and the author of The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Our Technology Choices Will Create the Future The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-take-the-lead-in-devising-bio-defences/story-ihNHSOmvUytCH9D9ASA5hM.html
22-09-2020||News||Devise a new labour law regime for gig economy workers||The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed multiple fault-lines in India’s economy and labour market. One prominent fault-line is visible in the domain of what is popularly known as the “gig economy”, or — more accurately — the platform economy. Earlier this summer, there were reports of a significant number of Ola drivers finding themselves unable to make ends meet because of the fall in revenue during the lockdown. More recently, there have been nationwide protests by Swiggy delivery workers, against their wage and working conditions. The root of the problem lies in an outdated labour law regime. Traditional labour law draws a distinction between employees or workmen, and independent contractors. The former enter into a defined relationship with their employer, characterised by features such as pre-set working hours, fixed wages, employer supervision, and so on. The latter, on the other hand, are deemed to negotiate their own terms with anyone willing to hire them. Under labour law, only the first category of workers is entitled to access the entire range of labour rights — from the right to a minimum wage, health and safety conditions and the right to collective bargaining. The employee/contractor binary, however, is based upon an outdated vision of work, where the factory or the shop floor was the predominant site of “work”. The platform economy is nothing of the sort. Thus, platform giants such as Uber, Ola and Swiggy invoke the fact that there are no fixed hours of work, that workers can log in and log out as they please, and there is no physical workplace. These platforms then claim an effective exemption from having to adhere to labour laws. This account, however, is a flawed account of the platform economy. In particular, it occludes how forms of physical control in the workplace have shifted to forms of digital control in the modern economy. Central to this is the app through which platforms function. In the case of Uber, for example, the app plays a central role: It serves as a gateway into the labour market; it is used to set prices over which drivers have no control; it is also used to award “ratings”, and the consequences of having one’s “rating” downgraded below a certain point can result in less lucrative work, or losing access to the app. It is clear that platforms retain significant amounts of control over workers (in some cases, through digital surveillance, even more control than traditional workspaces), and are in positions of power and dominance. From this perspective, there appears to be no justification in granting them immunity from following basic labour laws. However, for all these reasons, platform work remains very different from older forms of mainstream employment. Traditional tests of employment, therefore, are no longer enough. This has been recognised by courts all over the world, that have — while adjudicating “misclassification lawsuits” (ie, cases brought by platform workers arguing that the platform has wrongly classified them as independent contractors), found it difficult to employ traditional labour law frameworks, and have exhorted legislatures to develop new laws to deal with new forms of digital work. India’s draft labour codes do not yet address this issue, other than a few isolated provisions. This must change. It is vital that the law recognise platform workers as workers who are entitled to the full panoply of rights that labour laws accord to all workers, in the traditional sense. Efforts to this end are on in various jurisdictions — most notably in California. This endeavour is particularly urgent, as in its absence, platforms continue to take advantage of the regulatory vacuum, and exploit their workers. Carefully-drafted laws that recognise the reality of platform work, and guarantee to platform workers both procedural rights (such as collective bargaining) and substantive rights (such as minimum wages and safe working conditions) are the only solution to this problem.

22-09-2020||News||The dangers of genetic engineering | Opinion||United States (US) President Donald Trump has said that Covid-19 either was intentionally engineered or resulted from a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. He may be right about it having been a lab accident, and China bears responsibility for the carnage occurring worldwide. But the virus likely wasn’t deliberately engineered — despite recent reports.A research report in Nature Medicine contradicts the likelihood of intentional engineering of a pathogen for military use, on the basis that Sars-CoV-2 isn’t a mishmash of known viruses as the authors would expect of an engineered virus. “If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,” the researchers said.But genetic engineering could well be the cause of the next pandemic — and India needs to be as prepared for this. Covid-19 has brought India’s economy to its knees even as it left China practically unscathed. This has undoubtedly brought home to the Communist Party of China (CPC) that biological pathogens can be as destructive as nuclear missiles — and have almost no geopolitical repercussions.What is worse, it isn’t just China. The technologies have democratised to such a degree that any country can engineer viruses. To start with, a lab would need to obtain the genetic information of viruses. The first genetic sequencing of the bacterium Escherichia coli was in the 1990s, when sequencing the bacterium’s four-and-a-half million base pairs took weeks of effort and tens of millions of dollars. Today, to spell out the three billion base pairs that dictate the construction and maintenance of a human being costs about $1,000 in the US and can be done in hours.The next step in engineering a virus is to modify the genome of the existing pathogen to change its effects. One technology in particular makes it almost as easy to engineer life forms as it is to edit Microsoft Word documents. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) gene editing, developed only a few years ago, deploys the same natural mechanism that bacteria use to trim pieces of genetic information from one genome and insert it into another. This mechanism, which bacteria developed over millennia to defend themselves from viruses, has been turned into a cheap, simple, quick way to edit the DNA of any organism in the lab.To set up a CRISPR editing capability, the experimenter need only order a fragment of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and purchase off-the-shelf chemicals and enzymes on the Internet. Because it’s so cheap and easy to use, thousands of scientists all over the world are experimenting with CRISPR-based gene editing projects. Very little of this research is limited by regulations.China, having taken the lead because it puts technological progress ahead of all other concerns, including safety and ethics, has made the most astonishing breakthroughs.In 2014, Chinese scientists announced they had successfully produced monkeys that had been genetically modified at the embryonic stage. In April 2015, another group of researchers in China published a paper detailing the first-ever effort to edit the genes of a human embryo. The attempt failed, but it shocked the world: This wasn’t supposed to happen so soon. And then, in April 2016, another group of Chinese researchers reported having succeeded in modifying the genome of a human embryo not brought to term, in an effort to make it resistant to HIV infection. In November 2018, Chinese researcher He Jiankui announced that he had created the first “CRISPR babies” — infants whose genomes had been edited before birth. There was a global uproar, and this led the Chinese authorities — who, Jiankui claims, had supported his efforts — to jail him. But the Rubicon of biomedical science had been crossed. CRISPR isn’t the only genetic technology we need to worry about. A broader field, “synthetic biology”, is making the tools for genetic engineering widely available.Using brute-force DNA-manipulation methods, researchers have demonstrated that they can recreate deadly viruses such as that of smallpox, which took humanity decades to eradicate, and specimens of which are kept under high security in government labs in the US and Russia. In 2017, a research team at the University of Alberta in Canada created from scratch an extinct relative of smallpox, horsepox, by stitching together fragments of mail-order DNA. This took six months and cost about $100,000. Once the researchers had assembled the genome and introduced it into cells infected by another type of poxvirus, the cells began to produce infectious particles.Horsepox is not known to harm humans, but could be used to recreate smallpox — for a fraction of the cost the Alberta researchers expended — if edited with CRISPR.There should have been international treaties to prevent the use of CRISPR for gene-editing humans or animals; governments should have placed restrictions on labs doing the type of research that the University of Alberta and Wuhan Institute of Virology (among others) did. But there have been no checks or balances, and it is too late to stop the global spread of these technologies. The genie is out of the bottle. The only solution, now, is to accelerate the good side of these technologies and build defences. In the second part of this article tomorrow, I will explain the types of bio-defences that India can and must build.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-dangers-of-genetic-engineering-opinion/story-i1syP6tiQAg16EQ5A7jLSL.html

The victim, Rajesh Kumar, was on his way to deposit the money in an SBI bank branch near Kharar bus stand around 9.15am, when four masked men turned up on two Royal Enfield motorcycles and one of them hit him with a stick. The incident took place near gurdwara Akali Daftar, the police said. Rajesh, who was on a Honda Activa, tried to resist, but the robbers overpowered him and snatched his bag containing the cash.Kharar station house officer (SHO) Bhagwant Singh said when Rajesh reached a narrow lane near the gurdwara, he was stopped by two bike-borne men. “Two other persons, meanwhile, were following him on another motorcycle,” he added. He said two of the accused have been caught on the surveillance cameras installed near the crime scene. Registration number of one of the motorcycles is also partially visible, the SHO added. Rajesh, who has injured his hand, was working for Baljinder Singh, the liquor contractor. Baljinder had been running his office from a house, where other staff members were also present. The police are exploring all angles while investigating this case and have reportedly questioned at least 20 people so far.As per the police, the stolen cash was the payment received in the last three days, which Rajesh was going to deposit in the bank.An FIR has been registered against the unidentified accused, the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharar-liquor-vend-cashier-robbed-of-rs-15-lakh-in-broad-daylight/story-6vNXJvtamGKUxO1GOZ0W7I.html

This led to the structure weakening, and one day a portion collapsed. It has been 45 days now and remains unrepaired leaving the society exposed,” said Kunal Zutshi, a resident.He said that the open boundary has becomes a security concern for the residents.“We had to ask one of our regular guards to keep guard at the open portion. This is just cutting into our already feeble resources. We don’t want to wait for a major security issue to happen and have been requesting the builder to repair it as soon as possible,” said Zutshi.The residents also had to move their vehicles parked in that stretch of the society and place them elsewhere.“Over time we have had several maintenance related concerns. Our basements are water logged every monsoon. But nothing is as urgent as the broken boundary wall. Anyone can come in and go without being monitored. It is leaving us in a vulnerable position and their has been no response to our requests to repair the damaged wall. Such a negligence is specially catastrophic during the current pandemic,” said Mohit Khullar, general secretary, Apartment Owners Association.The estate manager said that the design for the wall has been approved.“The collapse happened a month back and getting architectural approval for the design too some time. But we are working on it and it should be repaired soon,” said Pawan Kaliwal, the estate manager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/broken-boundary-wall-has-residents-concerned-about-their-safety/story-6N6Ozcugfe6ooXc9Kd2w7O.html
22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Fake call centre racket targeting senior citizens busted, 6 arrested||Six persons were arrested on Monday for running a fake call centre racket in Zirakpur in which mainly senior citizens were targeted and defrauded of cash after being made to pay a “fee” to get their hands on what was claimed to be the maturity amount from insurance policies.Rs 4 lakh and about 30 mobile phones were recovered from Yogesh Verma (38) of Dhakoli; Pranav of Ambala Cantonment; Manish Kumar Rai of Dera Bassi; Subham Bhardwaj of Sunny Enclave; Arjun Yadav of Sector-17, Panchkula; and Rakesh Kumar of Dera Bassi.  SIM cards of different service providers and 10 registers and diaries were also seized. The call centres were busted after Nirmal Singh (83) of Sector 44 complained to the police that he had been cheated of Rs 16.54 lakh by fraudsters who promised to send him Rs 25 lakh that they claimed was the maturity amount of his insurance policy. Nirmal Singh said he had received a mobile phone call in June 2020 and was told about an old insurance policy of Rs 25 lakh that was maturing and that he had to deposit a fee and documents for the funds to be released.Taken in by them, and after receiving several mobile phone calls, Nirmal Singh ended up paying Rs 16.54 lakh to the fraudsters.A similar complaint was lodged later by Ajudhya Dass Rajpoot of Sector 42, who lost Rs 2 lakh to fraudsters who promised to pay him the maturity amount of his Reliance Nippon insurance policy maturity. Police said Yogesh Verma and Manish Kumar Rai were the masterminds of the operations and had set up the call centre. The other men were hired by them and given mobile phones to make the calls. They targeted senior citizens who had purchased insurance policies from different companies and lured them to deposit the money to get a huge amount supposedly after their insurance policies matured. The accused were produced in court on Tuesday and remanded to three-day police custody. A case under section 419, 420 and 120B of IPC was registered in police station 34, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fake-call-centre-racket-targeting-senior-citizens-busted-6-arrested/story-vAJnFLj5Kdq1j6Bc848a3K.html
22-09-2020||City||Water supply to Gaur City high-rise halted, two maintenance agency officials booked||A group of high-rise residents on Monday evening protested against the society’s maintenance agency for allegedly stopping water supply for more than five hours.Residents of Avenue 6 in Gaur City alleged that the agency arbitrarily increased the maintenance fee by nearly 60% on Monday and when the residents objected to the hike, the staff allegedly stopped the water supply to high-rise which is home to nearly 1,100 families.Amarjeet Rathore, an Avenue 6 resident, said that agency responsible for the maintenance of the high-rise increased the rate of upkeep charges from ₹1.25 to ₹2 per square feet, without discussing the hike with the flat owners. “Notices mentioning the new rates, applicable from October 1, surfaced on the notice boards on Monday. When the residents objected to the hike, the maintenance agency removed security guards from the society and also stopped the water supply,” he said.Rathore said residents of the high-rise, where a few Covid-19 patients are also under home isolation, faced a lot of problems and gathered together in protest around 6pm on Monday evening. A team from Bisrakh police station soon reached the spot to resolve the issue. The police said the called independent plumbers who restored the water supply late in the evening.Another resident of the high-rise, Brijwasi Singh, filed a complaint with the police against two officials of the maintenance agency – RK Maurya and Ashish Nirula – alleging that essential services to had been stopped due to which the residents especially children, women, and elderly people were troubled. “The maintenance fee should have been increased after due deliberation. In wake of the pandemic, we feel that this is not the right time to increase the fee,” Singh said.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said, based on Singh’s complaint, a case has been registered against the two agency officials under sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life),188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of Epidemic Act.Ashish Narula, deputy general manager of the maintenance agency said that it was disheartening to see that the residents had filed an FIR against him and Maurya even as “they tirelessly worked to provide best of services even during the pandemic risking their lives”. “The residents have ignored the fact that we charge barely ₹1.25 ft for maintenance services. The charges have not been increased since inception of the society in 2014. The residents have stalled efforts to increase the charges of 15% every year, a clause which is already there in the agreement,” Narula added. He further said that the current maintenance fee is too little and cannot meet the expenses including the salaries of the maintenance staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/water-supply-to-gaur-city-high-rise-halted-two-maintenance-agency-officials-booked/story-VR12FgU9zRVjV0E9vJe5HN.html
22-09-2020||City||Sub Lieutenant Kumudini Tyagi: The engineer who chose the ocean over office||Sub Lieutenant Kumudini Tyagi has been to her home in Ghaziabad just once in the last two years, ever since she joined the Indian Navy.When they heard of her achievement of being one of the first women to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels, her parents Pravesh and Manjula Tyagi were elated.“It is a moment of pride for all of us. We could not attend the ceremony on Monday due to the pandemic. But, all of us at home are eagerly waiting for her to arrive home as we have been able to meet her only once ever since she joined the Navy. But, of course, service comes first,” said Pravesh. Sub Lieutenant Kumudini joined as ‘Observers’ (Airborne Tacticians) in the helicopter stream, along with Sub Lieutenant Riti Singh. They are the only women are among the 17 officers who were awarded “wings” on graduating at a ceremony held at INS Garuda, Kochi on Monday. They were trained for a variety of roles, including navigation, flying procedures, tactics employed in air warfare, anti-submarine warfare and airborne avionics systems. The family is native of Kharkhauda in Meerut and shifted to Ghaziabad in 1983. Kumudini, her parents said, completed her schooling from St Paul’s Academy and later from Ch. Chhabil Dass Public School in Ghaziabad. She then joined ABES engineering college in Ghaziabad where she achieved a BTech in computer science. In 2018, she She is the first from her family to join the military.“She did not join the company which selected her as part of the college placement and neither did she attend other interviews. During her schooling and college, she had deep interest in the defence forces. We never stopped her from pursuing her dreams and she has shown us that she achieved what she aimed for,” said Pravesh. Her grandmother, Rajesh Kumari, said that she was overjoyed with her achievement. “I am feeling jubilant and she has made us all proud,” she said. The living room of the Tyagi house has photographs of her in uniform and her mother, Manjula, who was eager to speak about her feats while undergoing training before she got commissioned. “She was a driven child and she put in about 10-12 hours each day into her studies. She would run across the residential block for hours with earphones on. Her determination got her selected in the third attempt,” she said. Tyagi’s brother Apoorv had also cleared the written examination of the combined defence services. “He is aiming to join the Indian Army. Even as we know about the situations developing at our borders nowadays, we don’t mind our daughter going in for a combat role. It is part of her job and I know she will be ready for it,” said Parvesh. With their induction, warships will no longer be no-go zone for women naval aviators. Earlier, entry of women was restricted to the fixed wing aircraft that took off and landed ashore.“She has made us all proud and has also made name for the city. The Ghaziabad district administration will be eager to felicitate her whenever she comes back home from her duty. Her achievement is also a big motivation for other youngsters who wish to join defence forces,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sub-lieutenant-kumudini-tyagi-the-engineer-who-chose-the-ocean-over-office/story-Z9PGEJ5kt4rU7AFqfI4NBM.html

Artists from the tricity and Punjab have come forward to contribute what they can and form a transparent group to help those in need.“I have a private job,” says Shekhupuria, “but I am doing what I can to help artists and will continue to do so. I have been a freelance artist and I know the trials and tribulations one has to go through for sheer survival.” Gurdeep Dhiman, who does have a government job to support his creative endeavours, feels, “this is a time when all should come together as a community to help one another without prejudice.”Most artists have decided to come together for the cause instead of approaching art bodies, which many feel promote a few select names for workshops and sponsorships. Some have even questioned their alma mater in not empowering the students with skills and modern facilities to be able to survive in the competitive art market. Senior sculptor Jaswinder Singh, an awardee of the Punjab Lalit Kala Akademi and a master’s in fine arts degree holder draws attention to the problem, saying: “All my degrees are for sale as I have no other means of survival!” However, as he is 50 and experienced, Jaswinder Singh is confident of managing on his own. But he wonders what youngsters graduating from art colleges now will do after being “disheartened in the world outside.”There are very few opportunities for freelancers in the city right now with some of them saying they were disenchanted with the functioning of the North Zone Cultural Centre which in a camp before the Covid-19 outbreak ignored talented freelance artists and got students from the college at daily wages. When asked what could be done to help young artists, Bheem Malhotra, chairman,Chandigarh Lalit Kala Akademy, says: “The administration has promised us partial interim financial grants and we will try to help artists through workshops. At a personal level, I have been helping some artists get paid work outside.”Two young sculptors, well appreciated for their works, have decided to support themselves with daily needs shops. The road is tough but well-known photographer Randeep Maddoke, lauding Shekhupuria’s initiative, says: “These are hard times, but we must make a sincere attempt to overcome and help the artists in crises in these Covid times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/brush-with-generosity-tricity-artists-get-together-to-help-freelancers-hit-by-covid-crisis/story-dZmDITQbaXBso3o08qPSXN.html

22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Road-widening project at Ludhiana village: SGPC refuses acquiring of gurdwara land||Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority’s (GLADA) road- widening project in Ayali Kalan village might have hit a roadblock with Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) refusing to give consent for acquiring its land which is in the name of Gurdwara Sri Thada Sahib. A board has been installed at the said land worth crores by the gurdwara management opposing the acquisition. Earlier, residents of Ayali Kalan had opposed the road widening project stating that around 6 acre (out of 32 acre) of SGPC land is being acquired for the benefit of a private contractor in the area. The width of the road has to be increased from around 20 to 100 feet. The residents had also submitted a complaint with the SGPC and chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh stating that the land was initially allotted for construction of a hospital, college etc. Following this, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal had also written to the CM on September 17 to demanding that the land not be acquired. Villagers Kulwant Kaur and Gurpreet Singh said, “The land cannot be acquired as it is on the name of the gurdwara and was allotted for construction of hospital and college decades back. It is a conspiracy to benefit a private contractor. If a road has to be widened, then land on both sides of the road has to be acquired equally, but here the authorities are only acquiring land at one side. We have also submitted a memorandum with GLADA authorities and gurdwara management has also installed a board at the site against land acquisition.” GLADA additional chief administrator (ACA) Bhupinder Singh said, “The road has to be widened and land will be acquired for the same in exchange of the award amount. Few residents have approached us with their demand that the gurudwara land should not be acquired. Till now, we have not received any directions from the state government to stop the project and we will forward the proposal to acquire the land to the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/road-widening-project-at-ludhiana-village-sgpc-refuses-acquiring-of-gurdwara-land/story-b2fQiebMDtRBbSIWNLLWzN.html

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government promises Maratha community reservation under EWS||After the Supreme Court stayed reservation to the Maratha community in government jobs and educational institutes, the state government on Tuesday decided to extend the reservation meant for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) to the community. The EWS category will now get a share of social-economic schemes outlined for the Maratha community.After the uproar among the community members that led to the statewide protests in the backdrop of the Apex court decision on September 9, the state cabinet discussed the issue in its marathon meeting on Tuesday. The cabinet decided to extend the 10% reservation meant for the EWS to the Maratha community to safeguard the quota in jobs and college admissions. The community has also been assured to simplify the process to secure the quota after the shuffle in the category. The EWS quota is meant for the people with the annual family income below ₹8 lakh. The three-judge bench of the Apex court, on September 9, stayed the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education for 2020-21, while transferring the case to a five-judge constitutional bench. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act 2018, gives reservation of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions respectively, to the community members. The decision taken by the state cabinet on Tuesday allows the Maratha community to seek the benefit in 10% reservation given to the EWS by the Central government last year.Public works minister Ashok Chavan who heads the cabinet sub-committee on reservation announced the decision after the cabinet meeting. “We will ensure that the certificates needed for the EWS quota are issued and the legal issues involved are resolved at the earliest. The state government will try to safeguard the interest of the Maratha community even while abiding by the interim stay given by the Apex court. On the other hand, we have also approached the court for the vacation of the stay,” he said.Chavan said that the schemes formulated for the Maratha youths to enable them to appear for competitive exams, extend capital investment for enterprising youths and hostels for the students will now be made available for the entire EWS category. “We have made a financial outlay of ₹600 crore for the scholarships for higher education, ₹130 crore for SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute), the institute established for educational, social and financial development of the community, ₹400 crore for the Annasaheb Patil Financial Backward Development Corporation funding enterprising youths from the community. All these schemes will continue to cater to the community as they have been extended to EWS category. If needed the state government would not hesitate to make additional provision for these schemes,” he said.Chavan also announced that the criminal cases registered against the Maratha protesters will be withdrawn in the next one month. He said that barring 26 cases which are of the serious nature, other cases have been withdrawn and the remaining will be decided upon immediately. He said that the process of guaranteeing jobs to the legal heirs of the protestors, who lost their lives in Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) will be completed immediately. Maratha community leaders, however, have said that this could not be an alternative. “The decision has raised more questions. First of all, we have been made to compete with other open categories in the quota with a lesser per cent of reservation. Secondly, how is the government going to assure that the students, who have already secured the admissions or jobs under SEBC will be accommodated under EWS with the same documents submitted? How can this be legally tenable? The government has been boasting about the financial assistance under various schemes, but many of them are in shambles and we had to protest for their effective implementations in the last couple of years,” said Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha. Earlier, the state government had clarified that the Marathas seeking the reservation under SEBC, will not be entitled to the quota in EWS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-promises-maratha-community-reservation-under-ews/story-N1Q97vliOCvb4LOgENjCMJ.html

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s 21-40 age group most exposed to Covid-19 antibodies: Private lab||A sero-survey by a private laboratory in the city has found that those between 21 to 40 registered the highest positivity rate of antibodies. Metropolis Laboratory conducted a sero-survey based on samples collected between June and August. The high positivity rate suggests those in the age group of 21-40 comprise the majority of those who have recovered from Covid-19 in Mumbai. Metropolis’s data also suggests more women in the 21-30 age group contracted Covid-19 and men aged between 31-40 were most affected by the infection. For its sero-survey, Metropolis studied 16,697 random samples collected between June 26 and August 17. Of these, 11,623 samples were from men and 5,074 were from women. The overall positivity rate for antibodies was 33%. These recovered people are now potential donors of plasma as studies suggest antibodies decay after three to four months. The sero-survey also noted differences in positivity rates between age groups and genders. While 31.8% of the samples from men aged between 31-40 tested positive for antibodies, the percentage dipped to 23.9% for those aged between 21 to 30. Those between 41-50 years and 51-60 years recorded 21.4% and 11.6% positivity rates respectively. Of the samples collected from women, those between 21-30 years recorded a positivity rate of 27.4%, followed by 23.2% for those aged between 31 to 40 years. Those between 41-50 years recorded 19.2% positivity while those in the 51 to 60 age group recorded 13.3%.The survey also found some samples did not test positive for antibodies despite having tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Nilesh Shah of Metropolis Laboratory said, “The data indicates that immunity for everybody is different as 20% of the 167 samples who had previous history of Covid-19 tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. Also, in case of age wise data, the positivity rate is higher in the younger age group because they probably have more exposure outside when compared to the older age group.” Subhasree Ray, clinical nutritionist and public health professional, also said men and women in 21-40 years’ age group are likely to be the most exposed to the infection. Geographically, the highest positivity rates in the city were in Parel (44%), Borivli (W; 39%), Sion (39%), Saki Naka (38%), Khar (38%), Mulund (37%), Malabar Hill (35%) and Worli (33%).The lowest positivity rates were in Kandivli (19%), JB Nagar (18%), IIT-Bombay (17%), Grant Road (17%) and Churchgate (17%).A survey carried out in the city by private laboratory Thyrocare, using 8,376 samples collected between July 3 and August 7, found a positivity rate of 28.89% . High positivity rates were recorded in areas that were Covid hotspots, including Govandi (57%), Dharavi (54%), Worli (42%), Chembur Extension (48%) and Mazgaon (40%). The results of the second phase of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) sero-surveillance, which is being carried out in three wards, is expected this week. The first phase found 57% from slums and 16% from other residential areas had been exposed to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-21-40-age-group-most-exposed-to-covid-19-antibodies-private-lab/story-D41A8c8lYl3j1wUB4Ezd1I.html

The civic body disconnected the power and water supply to the buildings. Pankaj Ashiya, BNCMC commissioner, said, “These three buildings are in extremely dangerous condition. Those who were homeless were sent to the nearest community hall and school temporarily, till they find a permanent place.” Most of the residents went to their friends’ or relatives’ houses, with some even spending the night on the road. “We were asked to move out and also informed that they will cut the power and water supply. We rushed out immediately. We have nowhere to go, I am an autorickshaw driver and my earning is badly hit due to the lockdown,” said Noor Mohammad Momin, 50, a resident of one of the three buildings. BNCMC chief on Tuesday ordered ward officers and assistant municipal commissioners to check dangerous structures in other parts of the city and conduct structural audits of such buildings. “In the wake of the incident, we have again asked the officers concerned to check the extremely dangerous buildings and get their audit done at the earliest. Our team has also started serving notices to such buildings all over again,” said Ashiya. Some of the survivors from Jilani building, too, were struggling to find a shelter for the night. “I lost my two kids in the incident. My wife, sister-in-law and 12-year-old son were rescued. I spent my entire night at the spot, as I have no place to go. My wife and sister-in-law went to her mother’s place with my son. I also tried searching for some of our belongings, but they were fully damaged,” said Abidh Mohammad Ansari, 40. Khalim Ansari, 57, who was away at the time of the incident, said, “My wife and son were home, but they had a narrow escape. My belongings are gone. My family is staying at a relative’s place, but I am clueless about where to shift in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-40-families-from-neighbouring-3-buildings-evacuated-overnight/story-6hYmW6ITY3LyxtDFd8AR6N.html

22-09-2020||Mumbai||South Mumbai surpasses 3,000-mm mark, highest seasonal rain in a decade||South Mumbai has set a rain record this year with the highest seasonal rainfall in 10 years (2011-2020) and this is only the fifth time in 119 years that over 3,000mm rain was recorded. The weather observatory at Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, surpassed the 3,000mm mark with light to moderate rain between Monday and Tuesday. Moderate showers were recorded through the day in Mumbai on Tuesday. Between 8.30am and 8.30pm, Colaba recorded 50.4mm rain while 21.6mm was recorded at Santacruz, representative of the suburbs. Intense heavy showers were recorded late Tuesday evening post 8.30 pm across isolated areas in south Mumbai. South Mumbai has recorded 3,050.9mm rain between June and September 22, 8.30pm. Seasonal rainfall is representative of the quantum of rain recorded between June and September, the duration of the southwest monsoon in India. According to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this is the first time in 10 years (2011-2020) that the weather station recorded over 3,000-mm rain. In 2010, Colaba had recorded 3,169.1 mm but thereafter the highest seasonal rainfall was recorded in 2011 (2,878.8mm) followed by 2019 (2,732.4mm). Over the past decade, the lowest rainfall was recorded in 2012 at 1,433.9mm. Over the past 119 years (1901-2020), IMD data showed Colaba recorded its highest all-time seasonal rainfall in 1954 at 3,423.1mm while its lowest all-time rainfall was recorded in 1918 at 584.4mm. In 1958 and 1983, Colaba had recorded 3,382.4mm and 3,329.8mm, making it a total five such years (including 2020) in over a century that 3,000mm rain was recorded. “Generally the trend shows Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs, receives much more rain than Colaba, but 2020 has been an exceptionally good monsoon year for entire Mumbai and Maharashtra,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD. The average seasonal rainfall for Colaba is 2,066mm and it was surpassed on August 5. The weather station recorded 524.5 mm rain in June, 1,229.5 mm rain in July, and 1,132.7mm rain in August, which included the exceptionally heavy rainfall recorded between August 4 and 5 of 331.8 mm rain over 24 hours. “There have been seven low-pressure weather systems so far this monsoon and the most recent one allowing moderate rain over Mumbai currently. These systems kept weather systems active along the west coast leading to intense rainfall activity witnessed especially during the month of August when the low-pressure system was active 27 days out of 31 days of the month,” said Mohapatra. In September so far, south Mumbai has recorded 165.4 mm rain against the monthly average of 330.4mm while the suburbs recorded 145.2 mm rain against the mean for the month at 341.4mm. Between June and September so far, the suburbs recorded 3,306.3mm rain, the second wettest monsoon in 10 years. Meanwhile, the weather bureau has predicted heavy to very heavy rain across isolated areas between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning and a yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) for Wednesday. “Under the impact of the low-pressure weather system over the northeast Bay of Bengal, lower level southwesterly winds brought moisture over the Konkan coast leading to cloud bans moving from south to north over Konkan from the Arabian Sea with cloud height varying from 5 to 10km from the surface leading to active monsoon conditions,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. South Mumbai and the suburbs both have witnessed 55% excess rainfall through the season so far, with over a week still to go. Maharashtra has recorded 17% excess rainfall.

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department orders inspection of four private schools in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai over fee hike||A few days after the state education department formed committees to address complaints concerning fee hikes in private schools, it has now ordered an inspection of four such schools in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. In a circular issued by the office of the deputy director on September 16, two committees of department officials have been formed to look into the complaints of parents from different schools. Officials appointed by the department will inspect the documents of St Josephs’ School in Panvel, Euro school in Thane, Universal School in Ghatkopar and Bright Start Fellowship International School in Grant Road pertaining to the last seven years. While Euro School did not respond to requests for a comment, Universal School said that it would respond after “taking legal opinion”. A spokesperson from the Xaviers’ Group which runs St Joseph School said, “The concerned education official has issued a letter to the school on September 10 and the same has been replied to.” Officials at Bright Start Fellowship School could not be reached for comment. “Private schools have the power to fix their own fees as per the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2011. However, the Act has set some rules regarding a cap on the percentage fee hike, duration after which it can be imposed and has also laid down the procedure for its approval by the Parent Teachers Association. However, some parents have alleged that schools are not following these norms. We have thus asked for an inspection of such schools to verify their documents,” said a senior official from the department. Last week, several parents of students from different schools in the city met Bacchu Kadu, state minister for school education. Jayant Jain, president of the Forum for Fairness in Education coordinated with the delegation of parents from around 35 schools. In the days to come, the department plans to inspect more schools. “We are doing it in phases as we are short-staffed due to Covid-19 restrictions,” added the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-orders-inspection-of-four-private-schools-in-mumbai-thane-navi-mumbai-over-fee-hike/story-FvaPvDRkfD2i0IJM9h1qSJ.html

The arrested accused Vinayak Upadhyay had threatened the victim stating that he would register a complaint under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act for allegedly molesting his daughter in 2012.Sujitkumar Gunjkar, assistant police inspector said, “The accused threatened complainant stating that he had molested his daughter in the year 2012 for which he was now planning to file a police complaint against him. The accused asked the victim to pay ₹65 lakh to avoid a police complaint.”The complainant who works as a manager at a multinational company told police in his statement that on September 16, Upadhyay met him and told him that in 2012 he had molested his daughter and that time she was a minor. He threatened that he will file a police complaint against me.”The next day Upadhyay gave me a complaint letter which contained a fake story of molestation. The complainant told his wife about Upadhyay’s letter after which the complainant’s wife visited Upadhyay and asked him the reason behind such a fake letter. Upadhyay later emailed her explaining what he exactly wants from them. Upadhyay wrote in an email that he wanted ₹65 lakh of which ₹62 lakh should be in cash all in ₹500 denomination and said he wanted ₹2.80 lakh as tax. “The accused sent the content of that email on her WhatsApp too. The family then decided to file a police complaint and they approached us and gave a written complaint,” said Gunjkar.A case under sections 384 (Punishment for extortion), 385 (Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 389 (Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), 503 (Criminal intimidation) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code.

22-09-2020||City||Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut to be added as party in Kangana Ranaut’s plea in Bombay HC||Mumbai The Bombay high court on Tuesday asked actor Kangana Ranaut to implead Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut in her petition for threatening her with ‘Ukhad diya’ – the title of an article in Sena mouthpiece Saamana – after the demolition and the designated officer of H-West ward for alleged illegal demolition of some parts of her Pali Hill bungalow on September 9. Raut will have to be impleaded by Wednesday and appear before the court through a lawyer the same day.When Ranaut’s petition came up for hearing before a division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla, senior advocate Aspi Chinoi along with advocate Joel Carlos representing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the bench that the rejoinder filed by the actor to the BMC affidavit had some new allegations and hence the civic corporation required time to respond to them, which the court allowed. Ranaut’s advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, who was led by senior counsel Birendra Saraf, however, objected to the extension sought by BMC, alleging the civic authority was resorting to delaying tactics to deviate the case. He further submitted that the officers concerned who were involved in the demolition work had provided them with additional photographs of the alleged unauthorized alterations and additions on Tuesday. In her rejoinder, Ranaut had pointed out that BMC in its notice had provided only one photograph of the alleged ongoing illegal work in the bungalow which proved that the BMC’s allegation against her was false. After hearing the submissions the bench had queries to both Ranaut and BMC. While referring to the evidence of verbal abuse by Raut, which Ranaut had submitted to the court, Kathawalla sought to know whether she wanted to implead him in the petition as well. While initially Saraf sought time and was reluctant to implead Raut, stating that he would argue on the aspect of malice in law, on the insistence of the court, as to giving Raut a chance to defend himself in the face of allegations made against him by Ranaut, Saraf acceded. Similarly, the court also directed the impleadment of officer Bhagyawant Late who had filed the affidavit on behalf of BMC. The court then asked BMC to explain the applicability of the 2012 circular in the demolition of parts of Ranaut’s bungalow. The circular has warranted demolition within 24-hour notice in the event of any danger to life of the occupier or any other person. In light of this, the court sought to know as to whose life was in danger which prompted BMC officers to carry out the demolition on September 9 after serving a notice on September 8. The court also wanted to know the status of the notice issued to designer Manish Malhotra who was also served a notice under 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act on the same day as Ranaut. Ranaut had mentioned that while Malhotra was given a seven-day period to respond to the notice, she was not afforded the same which showed malice and malafide in BMC action. The court while posting the hearing for impleadment of Raut and Late on Wednesday, directed BMC to file its response to Ranaut’s rejoinder by Thursday and posted the petition for hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut-to-be-added-as-party-in-kangana-ranaut-s-plea-in-bombay-hc/story-wsMQ6V8dmoOg9548Zpnm6N.html

He also criticised Harivansh Singh the deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha, saying that his behaviour was objectionable and does not suit the reputation of the Upper House. “I have decided not to have meals today to express my support to the eight members of the Rajya Sabha. The members wanted a proper discussion on the farm bills but the deputy chairman chose to pass them without discussion and that too with a voice vote. His [Harivansh] actions do not suit the reputation of the House. He should have at least allowed the members to speak,” said Pawar while interacting with reporters at YB Chavan Centre, Nariman Point on Tuesday.Pawar also questioned the intention of the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi-led government over clearing three farm bills in haste that aim to bring reforms in the agriculture sector.The eight MPs were suspended for the remaining part of the current monsoon session by Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu for their “unruly behaviour” with the deputy chairperson on Sunday. The MPs began a fast late on Monday against their suspension. On Tuesday morning, Singh met the protesting MPs and offered them tea but they refused.“I’m happy that they didn’t touch the tea offered by the deputy chairman and continued their fast..,” Pawar added.“I have never seen such behaviour by a presiding officer in any of the Houses where I was a member, in the last 50 years,” he said.The ideas of Gandhi were never destroyed like this in the country before, Pawar said.He also said the NCP didn’t support the bills. “Supriya Sule in Lok Sabha and Praful Patel in Rajya Sabha have clearly expressed the party’s stand on the bills. We have also opposed them but that didn’t make much difference,” Pawar said.He also expressed support for the nationwide agitation organised by farmers’ organisations on September 25. Questioning the intention of the Centre regarding the farm bills, Pawar said there was no reason to clear the bills in haste. “Parliamentarians doubt the Centre’s intention because the government is claiming to make the market free for all and also boasts that farmers can sell their produce wherever they want to in the country. At the same time, the government imposes a ban on the export of onions. There is a contradiction in what it is saying and doing,” the former Union agriculture minister pointed out.The NCP leader also clarified that he could not attend the proceedings of the Upper House yesterday as he stayed in Mumbai to discuss the Maratha reservation issue following the stay on its implementation by the Supreme Court (SC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-observes-one-day-fast-in-support-of-eight-suspended-rajya-sabha-mps/story-9pTCiPsTxERurszJPkCIAL.html

Ameya Khopkar, president of the association said, “Some producers, in order to cut costs, are not following the protocols issued by the government in view of the Covid-19 threat. They are putting the lives of the actors and the technicians at risk. I am warning that if we find any such case, we will crack down on such elements and stop their shoots.”Wabgaonkar, 79, was a well-known actor who had worked in over 100 Marathi and Hindi films like Woh Saat Din, Ankush and Namak Halal. She reportedly got infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, on the sets of a Marathi serial she was shooting at Satara. She was admitted to a private hospital where she succumbed to the virus.The Maharashtra government, as the part of its Mission Begin Again, had permitted film shootings to take place from June 1 but framed various guidelines. These included social distancing, shooting in secured premises and restrictions on crowds.Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal (ABMCM), an association of Marathi filmmakers agreed that the protocols need to be followed strictly. “We have formed a flying squad which will pay visits to the various sets and check whether they are following the guidelines. We will even complain to the police if we find any lethargy on this issue,” said Meghraj Rajebhosle, president, ABMCM. However, he said that MNS should not forcibly stop the shootings. “The MNS can check but forcibly stopping the shoot is wrong. They should follow the due process of law,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mns-warns-filmmakers-in-maharashtra-of-forcibly-stopping-shootings-if-covid-19-protocols-flouted/story-5t0HL4dHUhfJJW12xY9twM.html

According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are approximately 72 million deaf people worldwide, with more than 80% living in developing countries. Atulyakala, a Delhi-based social enterprise founded by Smriti Nagpal, is empowering the community through various design-led initiatives. Explaining how they work, she says, “The most important part for our enterprise was to get as many persons from the deaf community involved in ideation and creation.Our ratio is 80-20; most of our team members are hearing-impaired. All the channels, from designing to social media management, sales and marketing, are handled by them.” A part of the proceeds from the sales goes towards the education of hearing-impaired children. “We have tied up with two schools, in Jaipur and in Maharashtra. We help get them more Sign Language teachers,” she says.   #Atulyakala #Humansofsign #Deafcommunity #ISL #Signlanguage #Hands #learning #education #Travel #igtv #YouTube #youtuber #youtubevideos #instagood #bloggers #interesting #love #happy #art #communityfirst #awareness #signlanguagelove #isign #deafness #lockdown #together #quarantine #deafculture #india #artistsA post shared by  Atulyakala (@atulyakala) on Apr 1, 2020 at 7:43am PDTSmriti has two elder siblings who are hearing-impaired, so Sign Language became a naturally-acquired skill. Her journey as a Sign language interpreter began when she was working with Doordarshan. And as she forayed further, she started finding gaps. “In India, there was not a formal Signing code for a long time. We used to follow American Sign Language, which has cultural differences. Words as simple as mother and women differ in the way they are Signed. Now that we have Indian Sign Language (ISL), it has become more standardised,” she explains.  Final out come of all the hard work gone into the making of one art that defies all odds - the art of deaf. . . . #Heartproject #Atulyakala #Humansofsign #Deafcommunity #events #artistsofig #art #abstractart #painting #workshops #socialevents #foracause #ifoundawesome #sodelhi #delhigram #trending #february #instagood #instadaily #instagram #indianartists #DilliA post shared by  Atulyakala (@atulyakala) on Feb 22, 2020 at 4:30am PSTInteraction with other hearing-impaired persons who wanted to lead a life of dignity in a profession of their inclination was what birthed Atulyakala. “I soon saw that there were so many such people who were into arts, photography and design. I started interacting with students at Delhi College of Art as they have a reservation for hearing-impaired persons,” she says. But there was a catch – despite having a reserved category, these schools and colleges didn’t have teachers well-versed with Sign Language. And that’s how teaching the language became an integral part of what she does professionally. “I don’t expect everyone to learn it, but at least they should not be surprised about its existence,” she says.  An ensemble of all cheerful faces comprising the team, without a slightest trace of draining energies poses for the last photo of the day! . . #Atulyakala #Heartproject #Humansofsign #happyfaces #cheerful #socialevents #art #artistsofig #signlangauge #trending #delhigram #workshops #goodvibesA post shared by  Atulyakala (@atulyakala) on Feb 22, 2020 at 5:22am PSTIn the course of this telephonic interaction, Smriti helps us get insights into the lives of some of her team members.

The Pathari Seva Sangh, a representative body of the fashion street hawkers led by its president MV Akolkar, says it has suffered a loss of approximately six crore due to the lockdown.A few days ago, some hawkers with shops located at the entrance of the market restarted their business without permission and faced action by the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) authorities and the cantonment police for violation of the Epidemic and Disaster Management Act. Hawkers cite tough financial conditions, including serious survival issues, as the reason behind their demand to reopen the market, which has been under lockdown for the past six months. The MG road hawkers and Pathari Seva Sangh has demanded that the market, which has an approximate annual turnover of 12 crore, be reopened at the earliest wherein norms like social distancing, extensive usage of sanitisers and mandatory wearing of masks will be followed. The PCB administration, meanwhile, has scheduled the matter to be heard before the board members and a final decision is awaited. PCB chief executive board Amit Kumar, said, “We have received representation from the hawkers’ association seeking to restart their business. We have heard their grievances and the final decision will be taken only after the matter is discussed in the next board meeting. We have also written to the Pune police regarding opening of stalls at Fashion Street and Khadda Market without board permission. This step has been taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the area.”Hawkers union president Akolkar, said, “We had demanded reopening of Fashion Street. Social distancing and all other health-related guidelines will be followed. We had suggested reopening the market on alternate days, but the board has not given permission to us till date. The lockdown has affected the hawkers and their families and they are being reduced to penury due to the longstanding shutdown.”Yusuf Osman Khan, vice-president of the association, said, “The market needs to be reopened at the earliest. When markets under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC ), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and other areas are being given permission to operate, then why are we not permitted to restart our business?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/locked-down-fashion-street-hawkers-seek-reopening-of-market/story-pVdXtmnpoNjomZNqKjwUsI.html

They were to be moved to a jail in Haridwar on Tuesday morning.“As soon as the incident came to light, police reached the makeshift prison about 15 km from Haridwar city and took stock of the situation,” said Kamlesh Upadhyay, Superintendent of Police, Haridwar (city).“Whole area was cordoned off. Search teams were immediately deployed in the area to find them. All the police stations in the district were put on high alert. Till evening, with the efforts in place, police succeeded in nabbing four of them who are now being interrogated to know the whereabouts of the remaining four,” said Upadhyay. The officer informed that a hunt is still on to find the remaining four escapees and they are scanning the CCTV camera footage of the area. Lakhpat Butola, station house officer, SIDCUL police station, who is involved in the hunt, said, “The escapees were identified as Sagar Chauhan, Nishant Verma and Nishu Verma, all residents of Roorkee, and Wajid, resident of Haridwar; Rajat, resident of Chamoli; Shubham Pawar, resident of Dehradun; Vipul resident of Manglaur and Bittu Kumar from Saharanpur are others.”Butola added, “Among those who escaped, five belong to the notorious Kaleem and Narendra Valmiki gang.”Following the incident, AP Anshuman, inspector general (jail), has asked all the jail superintendents in the state to “assess the security arrangements of their jails”.“The incident happened in the shelter for beggars which falls under the monitoring of the district magistrate and not the jail department. Hence, the security arrangement was the responsibility of the district administration. But, we have directed all the jail superintendents of the state to assess the security in their jails and submit a report in the next few days,” said Anshuman. He said, “Based on the report, necessary steps would be taken to ensure that such an incident is not repeated in future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/8-undertrials-escape-from-makeshift-prison-in-uttarakhand-4-caught/story-8m0hLPSx1Z8nFuoQRew7bO.html
22-09-2020||City||Covid situation: Pune administration cites manpower shortage as main hurdle||PUNE: The district administration on Tuesday admitted that trained medical manpower is a major challenge before government and private hospitals to address the Covid-19 situation in Pune.Addressing a press meet, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said that steps are being taken to recruit more medical staff.“Along with health infrastructure, the main challenge is trained manpower shortage. To address the issue, the administration has been holding meetings with various organisations. With Covid cases increasing in Pune, Pimpri- Chinchwad and Pune rural areas, the state government’s health department predicts shortage of beds by October 2. We conducted meetings with private hospitals to address this issue.”The divisional commissioner said that private hospitals are facing trained manpower shortage. “Private hospitals are ready to increase their bed count, but are unable to do it due to manpower shortage. We have assured them to provide adequate staff. The government machinery will take steps to utilise all its available trained medical manpower. We have reached out to private medical staff, but some are not willing to accept our offer citing personal reasons. We are providing various options like working in government hospitals, private hospitals, managing telecommunication and other sectors related to Covid care to private doctors,” Rao said.Kumar said, “The civic administration called a meeting with various doctor organisations on September 18. Discussions are on and we hope that many doctors who are into private practice and other medical manpower would come forward to address the pandemic issue.”Rao said, “We will increase the bed capacity in Sassoon General Hospital by adding 300 beds. The government hospital is also facing manpower shortage. I have instructed the management to hire any agency that is willing to provide required staff. Even medical college students are also hired by the hospital.”The divisional commissioner said that the administration is not planning to seek help of doctors from other states as Pune has adequate resources. “We are requesting organisations working in medical sector to come forward and join us. About 50 per cent of nursing staff working in Pune is from Kerala.”‘Convert 1,700 beds into oxygenated beds’Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has instructed private hospitals to convert its non-oxygenated beds into oxygenated facility by September 30. The administration said that around 1,700 oxygenated beds will be available from private hospitals.“These beds come under the 80 per cent reservation for government purposes, but they are non-oxygenated. We have assured private hospitals help to convert beds into oxygenated beds. Private hospitals will also be provided assistance to streamline oxygen supply and sort out manpower issue,” Rao said.Centre stops PPE, testing kit supplyDivisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the central government has stopped providing personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing kits for Maharashtra. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is going to raise the issue with the Centre. Even the Lok Sabha MPs are following it.” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-situation-pune-administration-cites-manpower-shortage-as-main-hurdle/story-nGzqdmsSBcvNcglGMT0NPO.html

22-09-2020||Election:||3 lakh returnee migrant workers added to voters’ list in Bihar||The Election Commission has enrolled around 6.5 lakh new voters over the last six months, among them an estimated 3 lakh migrant labourers who returned home during the Covid-19 lockdown, as part of the ongoing updation of the voters’ list ahead of the assembly polls due in October-November.The voters can apply online or through physical mode for inclusion and deletion of names.“Our assessment is that out of the 30 lakh migrant returnees, 10-12 % had no voter card. They were enrolled in the electoral rolls at the quarantine centres opened to lodge them upon their return from various states during the nationwide lockdown in April-May. By that calculation, the number of migrant returnees in the revised voters’ list would be around 3 lakh,’’ said an election officer, seeking anonymity.Another EC official said reports from districts suggest that 85-87% of migrant labourers already had voter cards though a large section usually did not vote in elections as they were not able to come to their native villages during elections because of work.A large number of migrant labourers has stayed put in their native villages after returning from various states during the lockdown and officials say they could exercise their voting right this time.The EC is expected to release the updated voters’ list in coming weeks after the announcement of assembly polls.As per the final publication of electoral rolls published on February 7, 2020, the number of voters in Bihar stood at 7,18, 22,450 out of which 3,79,12,127 are men and 3,39,07,979 women. The number of third gender voters stood at 2,344.Bihar’s additional chief electoral officer Ranjita said the exercise of revising the voters’ list was still going on.Meanwhile, there are reports that a full EC team, led by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, may visit the state soon to assess the poll preparedness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/3-lakh-migrant-worker-returnees-added-to-voters-list-in-bihar/story-CXjD4gEzHG1wNRTBaLi9vO.html
22-09-2020||City||Capt to take up medical oxygen supply issue with PM today||Chandigarh As Covid-19 cases continue to surge in Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ordered ramping up of facilities in the 13 districts with the maximum case fatality rate (CFR) and augmentation of medical oxygen supplies from within and outside the state to ensure that there is no shortfall. Amarinder said he will also raise the issue of augmentation of oxygen supplies from other states with the Prime Minister in Wednesday’s virtual conference. “I will urge the Prime Minister to issue the necessary directions to these states (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand), which are currently Punjab’s main source of medical oxygen,” he said in a statement after a review meeting of the Covid situation in the state. The chief minister said though the CFR, currently at 2.89%, has been progressively coming down, it is still higher than the national average, with 13 districts reporting the highest figures. Nine of these districts account for the maximum CFR, requiring urgent upgrade of their Level-3 facilities in both government and private sectors, he said. These are Kapurthala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Sangrur, Tarn Taran, Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Moga, SBS Nagar and Ferozepur. Most of the deaths are occurring in hospitals, with nearly half being reported from private tertiary care hospitals. Need for optimum use of resources: TalwarExpressing concern over the state’s high CFR, Dr KK Talwar also underlined the need to ensure optimum use of resources across the state, with adequate manpower and facilities as required in various districts. The chief minister asked the departments to work towards bringing the death rate in these GMCs to below 10% at the earliest. The CM was informed that the ICU occupancy in these GMCs is currently at 212 out of the total availability of 283. He was apprised by medical education secretary DK Tiwari that while there was no shortage of oxygen in the state at present, if occupancy goes up to 100%, more supplies would be needed. “Nodal officers deputed to monitor the supplies from the three units in Himachal, Haryana and Uttarakhand are keeping the supplies streamlined,” the CM was told. Cabinet Ministers Balbir Sidhu and OP Soni stressed that oxygen should be diverted from industry if required, while chief secretary Vini Mahajan informed the meeting that so far 10 medical oxygen generation licences have been issued to industrial oxygen units in Punjab, in addition to 14 medical oxygen repackaging licences. She said that efforts are on to also procure oxygen from Rourkela. ‘Covid Fateh Kit’ launched for patients Chandigarh Capt Amarinder on Tuesday launched the ‘Corona Fateh Kits’ for distribution among all Covid patients in isolation, whether at home or in hospitals. An official spokesperson said that 5,000 of the 50,000 kits ordered by the state government have already been received and the remaining supplies are expected within a week. Amarinder, while launching the kit, directed the DCs to ensure that the deliveries are prioritised and all the 18,000 active patients in isolation receive the kits within the next one week. The kit consists of 18 items, including pulse oximeter, digital thermometer, essential medicines and Kaadha, among others, along with educational material and instructions on use of medicines. Instructions for patients and care givers are provided in the kit, which also contains a self-monitoring log chart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-to-take-up-medical-oxygen-supply-issue-with-pm-today/story-HkacMTSiMU5kvy1ncwzqhI.html

22-09-2020||City||Sukhbir asks Capt to call special session to revoke amended State APMC Act||Chandigarh Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to hold a special assembly session immediately to revoke the amended State Agriculture Produce Markets Committee (APMC) Act of 2017. In a statement, Sukhbir asked the chief minister not to practise deceit with farmers by shedding crocodile tears at their fate as he (Amarinder) was the author of a similar legislation in Punjab and continued to stand by his own anti-farmer Act. The SAD chief said the chief minister could not run with the hare and hunt with the hound, asking him to tell the farmers and ‘khet mazdoors’ why he was refusing to rescind the State APMC Act, 2017, which he implemented in Punjab as the chief minister. Sukhbir asked Amarinder if he could show the moral courage to disassociate himself from the Congress manifesto of 2019 which called for removing the APMC Act altogether. He also said that the chief minister should apologise to the farming community for encouraging corporatisation of the farm sector by accepting the Montek Singh Ahluwalia committee report which calls for reducing procurement of foodgrain. “The CM should scrap the committee and reject its report,” he said, calling it (report) a death warrant for Punjab farmers. On the three agriculture marketing bills passed by both Houses of Parliament, the SAD president said the special assembly session should also discuss the Congress party’s role in framing of the ordinances which later became bills. The CM was a member of the high-powered committee which framed the ordinances and even sent finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal to participate in a meeting of the committee in Mumbai, he claimed, adding that subsequently the Congress government even sent a note to the Centre agreeing with many of the provisions of the ordinances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-asks-capt-to-call-special-session-to-revoke-amended-state-apmc-act/story-b2mUgoCFGAFkglVli9FwXO.html
22-09-2020||City||ED launches parallel probe into multi-crore GST evasion racket||Patiala The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started a parallel probe into the multi-crore GST evasion racket, taking note of the inter-state links. The Punjab Vigilance Bureau has already arrested around 12 tax officials and the role of as many is under scanner for their collusion in letting transporters evade taxes in lieu of bribes. The ED is already probing the illegal liquor scam. Now, the ED has written to Punjab Vigilance Bureau and GST department, seeking information on the companies and officials involved in the scam, it is learnt. “GST is a major source of government revenue for Centre as well for states, and it’s being siphoned through a nexus between officials and traders. Vigilance bureau probe has found fake bills generated by Ranchi-based firms and GST input tax credit taken in Punjab and Haryana. Some Delhi-based people are also involved. While Haryana GST collection has increased, Punjab has not seen any substantial hike, which hints at evasions. The ED has decided to launch a probe to look deeper into the racket,” said an ED official of Delhi, requesting anonymity. He said ED’s Jalandhar office has been given a go ahead to start the probe. Assistant director, ED, Ritesh Srivastava, confirmed that he has sought details, but refused to share information. As per sources, Jalandhar ED office on September 8, through Srivastava, sought details from the vigilance bureau about the FIRs, modus-operandi and the disproportionate assets amassed by the GST officials. Later assistant director Deepak Rajpoot sent another reminder to the vigilance bureau. The VB officials confirmed ED communications. “We will keep probing our angle, as state government has given clear instruction that tax evaders will have to face the music,” said an official. Meanwhile, the Punjab and Haryana high court has rejected anticipatory bail application of two GST officials who are on the run after being named by the VB in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-launches-parallel-probe-into-multi-crore-gst-evasion-racket/story-HST5qXIT18ltpH7k0cVrWJ.html

22-09-2020||City||Haryana farmers unhappy over Centre’s MSP hike||A day after the Union government hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat by ₹50 per quintal, an increase of just 2.6%, along with other Rabi crops, farmers in Haryana are not happy with the decision.The MSP of wheat has been increased from last year’s ₹1,925 to ₹1,975. As per the data, the percentage of hike in MSP for wheat has been reducing since 2018-19. In 2018-19, the MSP of wheat was ₹1,735 (6.8% hike from 2017-18), ₹1,840 (6.1% hike in 2019-20), ₹ 1,925 (4.6% hike in 2020-21) and ₹1,975 (2.6%) this year.Dayanand Punia, secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, said the BJP had promised to provide ₹2,100 per quintal for wheat crop ahead of 2014 state assembly elections but farmers are yet to get that price. “The BJP leaders had been protesting across the state against the then Hooda government for failing to address the farmers’ issue. Now, even they have failed to do so after coming to power.”He said, “The BJP has been in power for the last six years but we have not got MSP of ₹2,100 for wheat crop as promised. The new MSP is just an eyewash as the Centre announced it on A2+ FL (family labour) not on C2 formula, which farmers have been demanding.”Another farm leader, Ramandeep Singh Mann, said the input cost of farming has been increasing but the Centre has been reducing the percentage of MSP rise every year for wheat since 2019. “As per Centre’s data, the composite input price index (CPI) which includes human labour, machine labour, seeds, fertilisers, manures, insecticides and irrigation charges has been increased by 6.6% from last year but the increase in MSP of wheat is only by 2.6%,” he said.“The centre has announced MSP for wheat at ₹225.50 per quintal less than the actual figures as per C2 formula,” Mann said, adding that the government’s new MSP hike will drag farmers into poverty.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said the Centre has given a reply to the opposition, who have been accusing the government of ending the MSP and mandi system by introducing the farm bills. “The hiked prices for Rabi crops will help in doubling farmers income,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-unhappy-over-centre-s-msp-hike/story-nmMqp44VdQFlHY8w8XHFyO.html

The gang used to target people wearing kurta-pyjama as it was easy to take out cash and valuables from their pockets. Police have recovered 12 stolen mobile phones and three auto rickshaws used in the crime from their possession. The accused have been identified as Sanjeev Sharma, 28, of Shimlapuri, Rakesh Kumar, 25, Aatma Ram, 27, Karan Kumar, 30, and Amarjeet Singh, 34, all residents of Pratap Nagar area.Joint commissioner of police, Bhagirath Singh Meena said the accused used to target people on the route between bus stand, Clock Tower and Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, as they assumed that people going to the hospital and markets near Clock Tower carried large sums of money.The accused were arrested from the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Interstate Bus Terminal following a tip-off. The Joint CP revealed that three of the accused already have cases of snatching and thefts registered against them and had come out on bail recently.

The chief minister approved deletion of clause 12 (j) of the CMP for this purpose. The clause deals with those millers who are also commission agents/arhtiyas and, under existing rules, were not allowed to be allotted to the agency for which they were operating as commission agents, according to an official spokesperson. The decision was taken by the chief minister on the basis of a proposal of the food and civil supplies department, after examining the concerns raised by the Punjab Rice Industry Association. The CM has also given the nod for other amendments in the CMP provisions, including restoration of the bank guarantee clause and sale of existing mills. With the go-ahead to restoration of the bank guarantee clause included in CMP 2020-21 to the previous year’s provisions, the required bank deposit percentage will come down to 5% from the existing 10%. Under the amended rules, the miller shall now have to submit a bank guarantee to the agency concerned before the actual storage of paddy in his/her premises, equal to the value of 5% of acquisition cost of free paddy above 5,000 MT. The bank guarantee shall be released on delivery of due rice to Food Corporation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-allows-use-of-miller-premises-for-staggered-paddy-procurement-amid-covid-19/story-Bh9PlKdzFj1SufxGVCA96I.html
22-09-2020||Pune||BJP backs rent waiver on PMC-owned properties||Two elected members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have demanded the waiver of rent on properties owned by the civic body during the lockdown period. BJP elected members Mahesh Wabale and Ajay Khedekar have placed a proposal before the standing committee, demanding waiver off the rent on PMC owned properties which have been leased out. Wable said, “PMC owns many properties mainly sports complexes, vegetable markets and various stalls in the city. During lockdown, these establishments did not generate any income. Many of them are not in a position to pay the rent. Considering the situation, the PMC should waive off their rent for the period of lockdown.” The proposal was put forward to the civic body’s standing committee for approval. BJP is the ruling party in the PMC and the proposal has raised eyebrows at a time when the civic body is finding different ways to generate revenue. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “PMC itself is struggling to get revenue and to manage its expenditure. It would be wrong to waive the rent completely. I personally do not want to a waiver since PMC did not ask them for additional rent during the good times.” According to Rasne, the committee will discuss the proposal and will take a decision on it. “It is true that all commercial establishments have received a setback but PMC requires more money to give proper health service to the citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/amid-cash-crunch-bjp-members-demand-rent-waiver/story-LYm3R6nwHA94EcXi4aqutN.html

But neither acting of any BJP actors nor any of their dialogues are turning out to be useful. The BJP movie has turned out to be a flop show. The film will soon be off-screen because those who made the real picture have been booked in advance,” he tweeted in Hindi.The SP leader hinted in his tweet that his party would come back to power and the ruling BJP would be dislodged in the 2022 assembly polls. Last Friday, the CM had announced his plan to set up “the biggest and the most beautiful film city of the country” in Noida.During a meeting to review development works in the Meerut division on Friday night, he had asked state government officials to find a suitable plot of land in or around Noida for setting up the film city.On Saturday, actor-director Kangana Ranaut and singer Anup Jalota had praised the CM for the announcement.Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar called on the CM at his official residence in Lucknow the following day to discuss the project.On Tuesday, many personalities related to the film and entertainment industry, including Kailash Kher, Udit Narayan, Anup Jalota and Nitin Desai, are slated to reach the CM’s residence to participate in the meeting.Anupam Kher, Bhushan Kumar, Vivek Agnihotri, Ravina Tandon, Priyadarshan, Murad Ali Khan, Manoj Muntazir are among the 24 film personalities, who are scheduled to attend the meeting via a video-conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/akhilesh-flays-up-govt-over-film-city-calls-it-sp-project/story-ZJ8kDR2ljHlRxtkxVgnuLK.html
22-09-2020||Pune||Property tax amnesty: decision likely today||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is likely to offer an amnesty for property tax defaulters in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “Against the background of Covid-19, many people lost their jobs and income. Even commercial establishments are facing problems and are not able to pay the property tax. To facilitate them and get more revenue to the PMC, we are thinking of approving an amnesty scheme for property tax.” The proposal would likely come before the standing committee on Tuesday and a decision will be taken, Rasne said. The administration has also prepared a proposal to waive off fines for defaulters. BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik said, “I had a meeting with the BJP’s office-bearers and we decided to bring in an amnesty scheme for property tax to bring some relief to citizens.” Mulik said, “Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne and leader of the house Dheeraj Ghate were present at the meeting. We discussed the proposal.” BOX ₹4,700 crore in duesBJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik said, “PMC has ₹4,700 crore in dues of property tax. Of the ₹4,700 crore dues, ₹2,100 crore is the basic amount and ₹2,500 crore is fines. If the PMC gives some relief in fines, it would help the citizens, and defaulters would come forward to repay their tax bills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/decision-on-pmc-amnesty-scheme-for-property-tax-defaulters-today/story-1jpL5EjDd1J8KA8AKCytFJ.html
22-09-2020||Patna||Over 90 child labourers rescued from Rajasthan brought back to Bihar’s Gaya||Over 90 child labourers from Bihar were rescued and brought back from Rajasthan on Tuesday. Earlier, 141 child labourers from Bihar were rescued by the anti-human trafficking squad of the Rajasthan government a couple of weeks ago. Some of these children were rescued from bangle and jewellery factories located in various districts of Rajasthan. Around 40 children from Bihar were rescued from a bus, which was about to enter Jaipur.Out of the 141 rescued children, 94 arrived in Gaya on Tuesday.While among the rest of the 47 children, some have reportedly tested Covid-19 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive in Jaipur and some are awaiting their test reports of the viral infection. The 94 children, who came back to Bihar, will be quarantined for the next 14 days. These children belong to Gaya, Jehanabad, Nawada, Rohtas, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Madhubani and Katihar districts.“Gaya has been made the transit point for these rescued children, who belong to various districts of Bihar. Officials from different district protection units have been asked to reach Gaya to receive the children,” said Rakesh Ranjan, chairman, child welfare committee, Gaya.Initially, these children would be produced before the child welfare committee and later they would be handed over to the child protection units of the respective districts, he added.“They will stay in Gaya at a dedicated state government-run Covid-19 care centre (CCC) on Tuesday. We have arranged separate accommodation facilities for them in a bid to avoid the spread of the viral infection. Three buses have been arranged to send them back to their respective native places on Wednesday,” said Dibyesh Sharma, who heads the child protection unit in Gaya district.Before handing over these children, their parents or guardians would be asked to give a written assurance that they would be quarantined at home for the next 14 days, he added.Suresh Kumar, a social activist, said it is believed that some of these rescued children belong to the migrant workers, who had returned to Bihar during the 68-day nationwide Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions. These children must have again gone back to Rajasthan to earn their livelihood, he added.“Buses from states such as Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu have been seen at various locations in Bihar over the past few weeks. Employers from these states seem to be looking for their workers and have been sending vehicles to ferry the labourers back to their workplaces,” he said. Ranjan attributed lack of awareness and education to the social problem. “In many cases, it was noticed that children were sent by their parents to work in factories to earn money. They considered these children as a medium to earn money,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/over-90-child-labourers-rescued-from-rajasthan-brought-back-to-bihar-s-gaya/story-LgRlWpg8BqZtgdhKHvaEhP.html

22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt cuts market, rural development fee for basmati to 1% each||The Punjab government on Tuesday announced reduction in the market development fee (MDF) and rural development fee (RDF) rates from 2% to 1% each to provide a level playing field for basmati traders and millers from within and outside Punjab, particularly in the light of the provisions of the new farm bills. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh made the announcement. The move will help keep Punjab basmati competitive in the international market and provide relief of Rs 100 crore to basmati traders/millers, according to an official spokesperson. The change comes with the caveat that no refund of any fee will be allowed to any paddy/rice dealer/miller/trader for the export of the basmati paddy/rice to other countries from the state. The chief minister’s announcements came in response to a proposal of the Punjab Mandi Board, made after examination of the representations received from the Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association and the Punjab Basmati Rice Millers and Exporter Association. The basmati exporters and millers had petitioned the state government to charge a lumpsum cess of 1% in place of all other levies. The association had submitted that with the farm ordinances coming into force, the disparity in fee and other charges among the basmati producing states would be around 4%, making the rice industry in Punjab economically unviable as it would be unable to compete with rice exporters in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, which had exempted market fee from agricultural produce. They had also pleaded that Punjab-based exporters would not be able to cover the additional cost of taxes, which is 4% plus, making it difficult for them to remain in business. This trend may force them to purchase paddy from other states to remain in competition with their counterparts in Haryana, UP and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-cuts-market-rural-development-fee-for-basmati-to-1-each/story-5J3hV0XhadnjMI8rgah3sK.html

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court tells BMC to seal unauthorised Wadala temple, stops its demolition||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities to seal an unauthorised temple at Wadala and stayed its demolition until further order. The court while hearing a contempt petition was informed that though a May 19 order of the HC had ordered the demolition of the temple and restricted any religious activity, recent Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations were still organised there.The court refused to grant permission to the BMC authorities to demolish the temple on Wednesday.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing the contempt petition filed by Fletcher Patel through advocate BG Tangsali was informed that in May the BMC had assured the court that the temple would be demolished after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions were relaxed. In light of the assurance, the court had directed the civic body to ensure that there was no access to the temple. However, the order was violated as religious activities were held, including the recent Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Tangsali submitted that this was a blatant violation of the court order and, as a result, the contempt petition was valid. The advocate, who represented the BMC, admitted that religious activities were performed in the temple. He apologised on behalf of the civic authorities for their failure to comply with the court order and assured that the demolition of the temple would be carried out on Wednesday.The court heard the submissions and observed that prima facie there was contempt of its May 19 order. It directed the petitioner and the BMC to ensure that the contemnors -- those responsible for the rebuilding of the temple – appear before the court on September 29 when the plea would be heard next. The bench also directed the BMC to file an affidavit along with an apology before September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-demolish-wadala-temple-before-we-hear-contemnors-hc-to-bmc/story-bMZIgMkRZSiL7UKjhKjb6I.html

They said they had booked three rooms in advance ahead of their visit to Kolkata for some official work at the state education department.Sadek Ali, the headmaster of Krishnapur Madrasa Education Centre, told reporters that he has never faced such humiliation in his long career as a teacher. Ali and his colleagues, in their police complaint, said when they reached the guest house on Monday morning after travelling overnight from Malda, they were told that no room was available and were sent to another guest house.

22-09-2020||Lucknow||Saubhagya scheme for electrification: 82% rural power bills unpaid in UP since April||The Saubhagya scheme of universal household electrification appears to be turning into a major financial worry for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government-owned power distribution companies (discoms). The scheme was launched in the state on October 11, 2017. A majority of the consumers are not paying bills for their power consumption. Data showed that 82.27% of rural consumers have not paid even a single electricity bill during the current financial year since April. While around 17% among the over two crore rural consumers have paid their bills at least once in the current financial year.Arvind Kumar, additional chief secretary (ACS) (energy) and the chairman of UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL), pointed out to the sorry state of affairs via a few tweets on Sunday. ‘We drew a lot of flak over power supply issues. The attached figures indicate that 17.73% or 36.98 lakhs of our rural consumers have paid at least once since April 1. While 171.64 lakhs, out of the total 208.62 lakh consumers, have not paid even once,” he tweeted without referring to the Saubhagya scheme.“Though the situation is slightly better in Paschimanchal at 28.26%, it is worse in Purvanchal at only 12.51%,” he cited in another tweet. “The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has also led to a downturn of 2%, as compared to last year. Consumers need to pay up if we want to move towards a 24-hour uninterrupted power supply mechanism,” Kumar said. He put out a break-up of figures of various discoms. Of the total 2,086,16,63 rural consumers, 36,98,0,60 paid at least one bill between April and August.Data showed that 21.26% consumers paid their bills in Agra discom during this period, Lucknow discom (14.32%), Meerut discom (28.26%) and Varanasi discom (12.51%), which brought out the rear. The Varanasi discom has been in the news for a possible privatisation bid.The situation in urban areas across UP is relatively better. However, the proportion of urban consumers paying their bills has come down from 81.68% in 2019 to 72.49% to date. “Purvanchal is lagging far behind other discoms,” Kumar pointed out. Of the total 3,76,55,707 households in UP, only 2,2487,787 had electricity connections as on October 10, 2017. The remaining 1,51,67,920 households did not have electricity when the Saubhagya scheme was launched in the state on October 11, 2017. Of the total unelectrified households, over one crore were in the rural areas alone.Many rural consumers are not paying their electricity bills out of bad habit. But several others have defaulted because they either did not receive their bills or got inflated ones, said people who are familiar with the matter. “Around 80 lakh rural consumers were indulging in pilferage before the Saubhagya scheme was rolled out. Most of these consumers are reluctant to pay their bills after they were provided electricity connections,” they said. “We are determined to improve our response to your problems and to move towards a 24-hour supply of electricity in rural areas. However, our consumers will need to cooperate by clearing their bills on a monthly basis. Together, only we can achieve the target of 24x7 power supply,” Kumar appealed to the rural consumers through another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/saubhagya-scheme-for-electrification-82-rural-power-bills-unpaid-in-up-since-april/story-BbrmWOEb2zuN4KxXPvTkNM.html

22-09-2020||City||Goa to approach SC to modify Tarun Tejpal trial timelines in view of Covid-19||The Goa government will approach the Supreme Court to seek an extension in the timelines that the apex court had set for the completing the trial of disgraced former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal. With the trial court under instructions to complete the case by December this year and keen to secure the presence of the complainant whose inability to be present in Court for cross examination is holding up the progress of the trial, the court had issued a bailable warrant to secure her presence in court. The victim then approached the High Court seeking the suspension of the warrant, which was granted as interim relief. “Unless the petitioner approaches the Apex Court and seeks extension of time fixed earlier, there is nothing much either this Court or the trial Court could do,” the High Court observed. The prosecutor assured the Court that the State has been making all efforts to approach the Apex Court and get the time frame relaxed or refixed—at the earliest.“As seen from the record, the trial Court is in a predicament. It has been tasked with completing the trial in this case in a time-frame: by December 2020. And that time-frame was fixed by the SupremeCourt. So we cannot blame the trial Court for the procedure it has adopted and the directions it issued to secure the presence of the petitioner—the victim and principal witness,” the High Court single bench of Justice Dama Seshadri Naidu said. The victim has been facing problems to come down to Goa from Delhi during the pandemic. She has also pleaded that she has been suffering from a respiratory infection and is very prone to any health hazards if she undertakes the journey under these circumstances. The victim had earlier approached the court seeking cancellation of the bailable warrant citing health as her reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-to-approach-sc-to-modify-tarun-tejpal-trial-timelines-in-view-of-covid-19/story-VTopS0qcwRv8r5W9oxC2mO.html
22-09-2020||Chandigarh||No Covid relief, hospitality sector in Punjab to observe black evening today||The hospitality sector in Punjab will observe a ‘black evening’ on Tuesday against the state government’s “indecisiveness” in extending relief to them during the Covid-19 crisis.Satish Arora, state president of the Punjab Hotel, Restaurant and Resorts Association, said all hotels and restaurants will switch off lights from 8 pm to 8.30 pm as a mark of protest.Arora said the state authorities had backtracked on their assurance to support the industry which has suspended work since the lockdown was imposed in March.“Since bars are closed, we expect exemption on annual license renewal fees from April to September. As there was no business done due to the lockdown, we demand permission to clear electricity bills and property tax in instalments. But the government is indifferent to our legitimate demands,” he added. Earlier, assurances of help had come from a group of ministers (GoM) from Punjab, including finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, cabinet ministers Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria. They, along with excise department officials, held a meeting with a delegation of the association in Chandigarh and said they would recommend to chief minister Amarinder Singh the waiver of annual license fee for bars for the year 2020-21 from April to September, in view of the losses suffered due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Also, representatives of the state hospitality industry were assured that quarterly assessed fee levied on bars for the first two quarters, ie, April to June and July to September, 2020, would be waived.On August 14, the Punjab excise and taxation department had started renewing the annual licences for pubs and bars even as these outlets remained closed due to restrictions on serving alcoholic beverages.“Our ‘halla bol’ campaign is aimed at exposing the shallow assurances given by the GoM. As the government has not notified any relief to the hospitality sector, the state excise department has started mounting pressure on us to deposit the fee, or else licenses would be cancelled. The hospitality industry contributes significantly to the GDP, but during the crisis we are not getting support from the government,” said Arora.Meanwhile, assistant excise and taxation commissioner (Bathinda) Sukhwinder Singh said on Tuesday that the state government had not taken a decision on the license fee waiver.“The bar owners are required to submit an undertaking that they will pay the fee from April to June if the state government does not give any rebate for the three-month period. There is no deadline for renewal,” he said.There are 1,500 bars and over 500 pubs in various districts. Hardly anyone has applied for licence renewal across the state, say sources in the excise department and hospitality sector.Excise licences for liquor vends, pubs, bars and restaurants are renewed annually by March-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-covid-relief-hospitality-sector-in-punjab-to-observe-black-evening-today/story-xHkbfEbnrA5oDYk4aCQp9J.html
22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Commission agents end strike as Haryana govt bows to demands||Thousands of paddy growers in Haryana heaved a sigh of relief as commission agents ended their strike, resuming procurement operations in most mandis. The strike ended after a delegation of commission agents met with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala late Monday, and procurement operations resumed early Tuesday.Under fire due to the strike the Haryana government on Monday night announced that the market fee and rural development fee on cotton and Barik Dhan (a paddy variety) will be reduced from 2% each to half a percent. An official spokesperson said the dues for luster loss and other outstanding payments to be made to the commission agents will also be released soon. Also Read: Farm bills, sifting the grain from the chaffTalking to Hindustan Times, Ashok Gupta, the president of Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiya Association said, “We have ended the strike as the government has agreed to accept most of the demands and resumed procurement on Tuesday morning.”Gupta said that the government’s decision to reduce the market fee and rural development fee has come as a big relief to the commission agents, traders and the farmers, as this will ensure that most of the produce is procured inside the mandi. However, procurement operations did not resume in several grain markets as commission agents said that they needed written assurance from the government to end the confusion. “Procurement could not be resumed as the traders did not come to procure paddy (Basmati) by Tuesday evening. It will take a day or two to resume procurement in all mandis in the state,” said Naresh Kumar, a commission agent who works at the Kurukshetra grain market.Also Read: Haryana to sell farm produce at 1 per cent in market: Dushyant ChautalaBut officials of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing department said that they have released the payments of the deductions made from the commission of the ahrtias (commission agents) for luster loss during wheat procurement season. “The meeting (with ahrtias and rice mill owners) ended on a positive note.

The mob went on rampage in DJ Halli, KG Halli and Pulakeshi Nagar and attacked the DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations and vandalised the property of police stations including government and private vehicles parked in the police stations.The mob also attacked the house of the MLA and Naveen before attacking the police stations, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bengaluru-riots-nia-formally-takes-over-probe-in-two-cases/story-SrV9G2u0oyMay2vIL7TfjK.html

Also read: Official probing Sopore man’s death asks family, public to record statementsPakistan, which is desperate to fuel terrorism in the UT, has adopted the latest modus operandi of using drones to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money.A J&K Police official said that a Pakistani drone dropped arms and ammunition at Sohal Khad -- a dry rivulet -- in Pallanwala, which is located about 12 kilometres (km) from the Akhnoor sector. The arms and ammunition were dropped in the rivulet and the drone flew back into Pakistani territory, he added. He said the area was located at a crucial intersection of the LoC and the International Border (IB).“We have recovered a packed bag that contained two AK-47 assault rifles, three AK magazines, 90 AK bullets, measuring 7.62 millimetres (mm), two pistols and pistol magazines along with bullets,” he added.

The deployment data related to the violence-hit areas cited in one of the charge sheets filed in connection shows how police were unprepared or had not anticipated the scale of the clashes. The Delhi police have been criticised for not anticipating the scale of the riots despite multiple intelligence warnings of a major communal flare-up. At least 53 people died while 400 others were injured in the riots.On February 23, when the first incidents of violence were reported from Jafrabad, there were only 1,393 police personnel deployed.

22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC stays AAP govt decision to reserve 80% ICU beds in private hospitals for Covid-19||The Delhi high court on Tuesday stayed an order of the Delhi government reserving 80% of the ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, saying that prima facie, the order appeared to be “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and in violation of the fundamental rights of an individual.Justice Navin Chawla, while seeking the response of the Delhi government, said that the September 12 order reserving 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients was in violation of the fundamental rights. The court said that the state cannot discriminate between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.“At the time of the emergency, a patient cannot be told to run around from one hospital to another. The disease itself cannot be the ground for discrimination,” the court said in its oral order.Also read: Covid-19: PM Modi to meet CMs of 7 worst-hit states on WednesdayDuring the hearing, the court also remarked angrily that it would not let a single person die because of this order. “You are missing what is for the good. I will not let even one patient die due to this. Has the government considered that we are talking about ICU beds…The question is about reservation and a patient being turned away because you are keeping this bed for Covid-19. Place the deliberation as to how and what factors were taken into account before passing the order,” the court said.The court’s decision comes on a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers, alleging that such reserving of beds is also exposing non-Covid-19 patients to the risk of Covid-19 and that the order has been issued without any prior discussion with private hospitals and without understanding the current demand-supply situation of critical care beds.In its plea, filed through advocates Sanyam Khetarpal and Nitesh Goyal, the petitioners had sought quashing of the order.On Tuesday, appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Maninder Singh told the court that the order discriminates between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, even though both require ICU treatment. He said the hospital cannot keep beds empty while denying them to non-Covid patients. He contended that none of the factors was taken into account before passing the order.Appearing for the Delhi government, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain told that the order was issued keeping in view the sudden surge of patients requiring intensive care. He said the situation is dynamic and requires urgent decisions.He said the 33 hospitals have not challenged the order and hence the plea should be dismissed. The petitioner’s counsel said all the 33 hospitals were members of the petitioner association and he would file an affidavit in this regard.After hearing the arguments, the judge said such an order would “prima facie” lead to a situation where a patient who is suffering from a disease other than Covid-19 is denied admission to an ICU bed. The court also said that it is not apparent as to what decision-making process and data was taken into consideration before passing such an order.It asked the Delhi government to disclose the factors on which the decision to reserve ICU beds for Covid-19 patients was taken, and stayed the order till October 13Meanwhile, reacting to the order, the Delhi government, in a statement, said, “It is extremely important to reserve ICU beds in private hospitals to deal with increasing corona cases. We will challenge this order tomorrow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-stays-delhi-govt-decision-to-reserve-80-icu-beds-in-33-pvt-hospitals-for-covid-19-patients/story-fQ6ON3tTS7kVxv0AeNItII.html

He added: “Anything that I can see, all parties before me are entitled to see. That is all there is to it. This is the only method that I know of to ensure an open and transparent decision-making process. Those details will, therefore, need to be set on affidavit.

It has a purpose, one that it serves. I cannot and will not curtail the rights of the free press at the instance of this or that party. I refuse to proceed on the basis that the press is always irresponsible. There will be no gag orders here.”Patel said that it was up to Anugarh to submit details of the material in the sealed cover in an affidavit and serve it on all petitioners or face the consequences and posted the petitions for hearing on October 5.Around 65 petitions have accused Anugrah of luring investors, taking large sums, effecting some trades but also carrying out unauthorised and illicit transactions and causing the petitioners losses.

The educational institutions reopened on Monday with students of Classes 9 to 12 coming to school with written consent of parents to seek guidance. While most schools opened without students, at some places a large number of students gathered at the institutions and even classes were held, forcing the authorities to revise the guidelines. According to the new guidelines, not more than five students of any class should be called for guidance. The heads of the institutions have been asked to ensure that mechanisms should be developed by the educational institution concerned, to maintain social distancing and to avoid any gathering. The campus will be sanitised after school hours daily and all precautions for cleanliness and hygiene are to be taken. At the entry gate of educational institutions, provision shall be made for washing or sanitising hands. Signages and posters shall be displayed at schools to raise awareness about prevention of Covid-19 and parents will be asked their wards come to school with masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-pradesh-govt-modifies-guidelines-for-schools-after-social-distancing-rule-broken-on-day-1-of-reopening/story-bGxD9G2VOsn3DhGOQEOLCO.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Two women held for issuing fake vehicle insurance||Two women have been arrested for running an alleged racket of selling fake vehicle insurance policies to residents of Delhi-national capital region (NCR), the Delhi Police said.The crime was unearthed last week when a truck owner, Avdhesh Yadav, complained to the Delhi Police’s cyber branch of the north-west district after he was issued two fake vehicle insurance policies. “Yadav told us that he knows a man named Mukeem, who installs global positioning system (GPS)-enabled devices in vehicles near Jahangirpuri. Yadav had told Mukeem that he needed to renew his truck’s insurance policy following which the latter asked him to transfer Rs 34,000 to a bank account,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), (north-west), Delhi Police.Soon, Yadav received a copy of the insurance policy, which in face value appeared to be issued by a prominent insurance firm.“Yadav figured out that the policy details were fake after he checked on the firm’s website. Mukeem shared some phone numbers and asked Yadav to sort out the issue about the forged document,’ the DCP said.Yadav was issued another insurance policy, which was in the name of a separate prominent company. But that document also proved to be counterfeit. Police started their probe by checking the details of the bank account in which the money was deposited. “It belonged to a woman called Paramjeet Kaur (36). Kaur revealed that she was running this racket with her accomplice, Ritu (44). Both Kaur and Ritu have been arrested,” the DCP added.The official said that the two women used to work for an insurance firm in Moti Nagar. “One of their associates used to routinely share a list of people, whose vehicle insurance policies were up for renewal. The duo would call these people offering to renew their insurance policies. At times, their contacts would bring them prospective clients,” the official added. “The two arrested accused would design fake insurance policies and issue them to their unsuspecting clients,” he added.Police have also arrested Deepak Bansal (22), an undergraduate student of commerce, on charges of letting the arrested accused use his account of an e-commerce payment system for the alleged crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-women-held-for-issuing-fake-vehicle-insurance/story-DKoP12keQd1QZeu8mv21GM.html

The victim filed a complaint at Mulund police station on September 19 after she found out that Kapoor was an imposter. The victim, who works for a private company, in her statement told the police that she had got in touch with the accused through a matrimonial website in February. Soon, they decided to get married. Kapoor claimed to the victim that he was an undercover officer with the NIA and he had also worked for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), said an officer from Mulund police station. “The accused told the victim that he wanted to meet her before their marriage. He arrived in Mumbai in July claiming that he was on an official trip on some secret operation. He told the victim that his agency (NIA) has booked a hotel for his stay in Mumbai but due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, it was not safe to stay there and instead stayed in her apartment,” he said.“Kapoor stayed for over two months with the victim. He had a physical relationship with her after promising that he would marry her,” he added. “He borrowed Rs 3 lakh from the victim in three instalments on the pretext of his ongoing secret operation. He promised to repay her the borrowed sum. However, the victim started doubting him after two months when he refused to show his identity (NIA) card and also did not return to Delhi,” said Pradeep Vani, an inspector of Mulund police station. “The accused’s cover was blown after the victim demanded the money from him. She filed a case against the accused at Mulund police station on September 19. Though the victim had alleged that the accused was carrying a revolver on him, a police team recovered a gun-shaped lighter from him following his arrest,” Vani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-resident-who-posed-as-nia-officer-arrested-for-rape-cheating-by-mumbai-police/story-RHZm1jZmcU5wrvh1xsMM4N.html

The CPI (ML) agreed to join the GA after their representatives, led by Dhirendra Jha, met state chief of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Jagadanand Singh and party senior Bhola Yadav on Monday evening. While other Left parties like the CPI and the CPI (Marxist) have already announced their decision to fight the upcoming assembly polls under the GA banner, the CPI (ML) demonstrated frayed tempers and threatened to contest alone after its talk with the RJD failed to reach any logical conclusion last week. RJD leader Bhola Yadav said that some minor issues, which remained unresolved so far, would be sorted out in the next round of meeting. Also read: Congress to boycott session, says Opposition’s views not accommodatedThe CPI (ML) has been asking for around two dozen seats to contest under the GA, much to the chagrin of other constituents including the RJD and the Congress. The party currently has three MLAs, having got 1.5 percent of the total votes polled in the 2015 assembly polls. Jha said that his party had reinitiated talks with the RJD for a broader Left unity to defeat the BJP-JD(U) alliance. “We have stipulated our conditions for joining the GA formation with a hope of getting an agreeable deal,” said the CPI(ML) leader after the talks. In the 2019 parliamentary polls, the ML had extended support to GA candidates, including the RJD nominees, at four places, where they polled more than 4 lakh votes. Meanwhile, RJD leader and opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has decided to meet Congress leaders in Delhi and join the final negotiation for seats among the GA allies in a day or two. The RJD wants to contest about 150 seats out of 243, while the Congress is adamant on contesting around 80 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-polls-cpi-ml-resumes-seat-sharing-talks-with-grand-alliance/story-BnlgIHM5i4wgSCDRk5wOXJ.html

This is not happening at the moment,” said Annasaheb Misal, commissioner, Konkan, and also chairman of the HC-appointed panel. “All DCs and other departments have been asked to re-examine the exercise to come up with a fresh list for notification and an overall protection of sites,” he added.In 2014, the HC had banned reclamation and construction on wetlands in Maharashtra after Vanashakti, a Mumbai based environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO), had filed a petition to protect them. The plea had led to the formation of the HC-appointed panel. In September 2017, the Union Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) notified new Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2017, replacing its 2010 version. The new rules left out wetlands protected under forest and wildlife laws and under the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) and also the human-made water bodies and all salt pans. The MoEFCC directed all states to prepare a fresh wetland inventory. Maharashtra environment department submitted a list of wetlands to each district in the Konkan region in early 2019 to verify and submit their status.Misal said based on the submissions by the districts in the Konkan region, it was observed that the number of wetlands proposed versus those verified for the final notification were too few and far between. For example, though initially, the number of wetlands identified as per the NWIA, Mahrashtra, for Mumbai was 475, later it was watered down to 59, and only a single declared area in Powai, measuring up to 181.9 hectares (ha), was submitted for the final notification. In Thane, the NWIA, Maharashtra, had identified 1,895 wetlands, which was whittled down to 132 potential sites. Later, eight wetlands were sent for the final notification. “A similar situation was observed in Palghar district, where out of 86 potential sites, six have been proposed for the final notification,” said Misal.“We need to ensure that not a single area is left out that may have the slightest features of what constitutes a wetland, or has already been identified under the NWIA, Maharashtra,” he added. Neenu Somraj, member secretary of the HC-appointed panel, said the committee has received 77 and 11 complaints regarding destruction of mangroves and wetlands, respectively.“The Konkan commissioner has directed collectors, civic chiefs, police personnel and other state agencies to follow up on all pending complaints and submit status reports within the next 15 days before the next meeting of the panel,” said Somraj.“DCs need to follow the recent decision by the MoEFCC to handover all mangrove areas to the state forest department within the next two months,” he added.Nidhi Chaudhari, DC, Raigad, has told the committee that first information reports (FIRs) were filed against the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) for damaging Pagote and Bhendkhal wetlands in Uran.Misal said state bodies were directed to take strict action against any form of debris dumping or encroachments at wetlands and mangroves.Maharashtra Police authorities were told to file charge sheets in cases, where FIRs were filed.“A status report has been asked from them. Complaints need to be monitored closely at the level of DC and municipal commissioner. In many cases, complaints have not been attended to properly. This should not happen,” he said. Other members of the HC-appointed panel said all wetlands in the Atlas must be documented and protected. “The new commissioner has taken the issue of wetland conservation seriously. He has directed DCs to give a report on wetlands in their jurisdiction. He has upheld the mandate of the committee as instructed by the HC. It is high time the importance of all wetlands in the NWIA is recognised and a comprehensive inventory is prepared,” said Stalin D, a member of the HC-appointed panel.Shift dumping ground out of mangroves in Uran: HC panelThe HC-appointed panel on Monday also directed that a dumping ground in Uran be shifted out at the earliest. The committee directed the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) to issue a no-objection certificate (NoC) to shift the dumping ground to the new location identified by the Raigad district administration and the local civic body. “Land has been identified, but the civic body needs the NoC from Cidco since it is a notified area under the planning agency. Cidco should not have any problem in issuing the NoC since dumping garbage on mangroves is a violation of the law and needs to be stopped at the earliest,” said Misal.The dumping ground, measuring two ha, is located between Bori Pakhadi and Hanuman Koliwada villages in Uran. it has been receiving three tonnes of mostly dry waste daily since 2007. A residential colony is located less than 100 metres (m) from the landfill site on the one end, while dense mangrove vegetation is situated on the other side. Environmentalists have cited a growing health hazard and submitted a list of grievances to the HC-appointed panel that sewage was entering the wetland while the stench and insect menace was leading to several infectious diseases among local residents. “Latest decisions indicate that our complaints have been noted and this ecologically-sensitive site can be protected,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, one of the complainants.However, Cidco authorities said the new landfill site, which is located at Mulekhand, around 15 kilometres (km) south-east from the existing one, also had a residential area close to it. “Residents have objected to the proposed landfill site. Our planning department is trying to resolve the impasse. However, obtaining an NOC will take time,” said a Cidco official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/re-verify-status-of-wetlands-in-maharashtra-ordrers-bombay-high-court-panel/story-zuEWh3pMIegIWaTw0RSAeJ.html

22-09-2020||City||Maharashtra chief wildlife warden permits capture of Yavatmal tigress||The Maharashtra principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF-wildlife) issued orders on Monday evening to capture a tigress involved in man-animal conflict in Yavatmal district.The decision comes two days after a woman (60) was mauled to death by the tigress at an agricultural field near Andharwadi and Pattanbori villages, which are located adjacent to Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. State forest department officials said the tigress was being routinely spotted through camera trap images moving across villages such as Andharwadi, Koparmandvi, Vasari, and Kobai in Pandharkawada Forest Reserve. The animal’s movement has sparked panic and fear among villagers. On September 4, the tigress had attacked a farmer, but he luckily escaped with injuries.The Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972, stipulates that the chief wildlife warden or PCCF of a state can declare a wild animal protected under Schedule 1 of the WLPA a threat or danger to human life by invoking section 11 (1) (a) of the Act.Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF-wildlife, Maharashtra, said, “I have issued an order for the capture of the tigress. The tigress (T2C1) has been identified as one of the cubs of dominant female T2, a resident tigress of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary.”The tigress has been spotted near these villages since July and also seen multiple times in areas with human habitation, mostly in agricultural fields, said Kakodkar. “The tigress has been involved in two conflict incidents with humans and at least six livestock (cattle and goats) have been killed in the past two months,” he said.“We have deployed teams from the Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF), who were sent from Melghat Tiger Reserve. Rapid rescue units and five range officers are also monitoring the situation. Villages have been advised not to venture close to forest areas or send their cattle for grazing until the tigress is captured.”The first attack by the tigress was reported on September 4. A group of local villagers met state forest minister Sanjay Rathore requesting him for the animal’s immediate capture. Later, the minister directed the officials to initiate necessary measures to curb further incidents of a man-animal conflict.SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forest (CCF) (Yavatmal), said, “We have been communicated verbally about the PCCF’s approval. We are awaiting the official letter before commencing the operation to capture the animal. The operation is limited to a radius of up to five kilometres (km) and the animal is regularly observed in our camera traps laid out across the area.” The latest incident has been reported in Ralegaon-Pandharkawada district, where tigress T1 or Avni was killed in 2018 under questionable circumstances by two private hunters hired by the state forest department after the animal was said to have killed 13 people.This is the sixth order to capture a tiger involved in human-animal conflict in Maharashtra this year, of which four have been captured to date.The first incident was reported in May when a tiger from Brahmapuri was captured in Gondia district. The animal was said to have killed four persons across two forest divisions. The next two cases were recorded in June where a sub-adult male tiger had killed five people since February. The tiger was captured from the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. While an adult tigress that had entered a house in Nagbhid range of Brahmapuri was captured on June 22. Both these captured tigers died at Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur due to old age and septicaemia. On July 19, a three-year-old male tiger (NT-1) was tranquilised and captured by the state forest department authorities at Talodi range in Chandrapur district’s Bramhapuri forest division. The officials said the tiger was responsible for the death of three persons in June and was also sent to Gorewada rescue centre. In January, Kakodkar had issued an order to capture a tiger involved in a conflict at the Chandrapur Thermal Power Station (CTPS). Though the order lapsed, it was not extended because the tiger had moved away from the area, the PCCF said.“Operations are underway to capture another tiger (RT1) at Rajura in Central Chanda division since February. The tiger is said to have killed six villagers. The consent for capture has been renewed, but the tiger has managed to elude our trapping efforts so far,” said Kakodkar.Maharashtra has reported 47 human deaths due to wild animal attacks this year, including 29 because of conflict with tigers , the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-chief-wildlife-warden-permits-capture-of-yavatmal-tigress/story-PIqEuwZPihYnV0vCSOvlmK.html

Haryana Mandi Arhtiya Association Ashok Gupta said, “We have ended the strike as the government agreed to accept most of our demands. Procurement resumed on Tuesday morning.” A delegation of commission agents met chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala on Monday evening after which the government announced that the market fee and rural development fee on cotton and barik dhan, a paddy variety, will be reduced from 2% each to 0.5%. An official spokesperson said the dues for lustre loss and other outstanding payments will be made to the commission agents soon. Gupta said the decision to reduce the market fee and rural development fee has come as a relief to commission agents, traders and the farmers as this will ensure that most of the produce is procured inside mandis. He said this will help private traders procure basmati varieties from farmers in the mandis with the help of arhtiyas who will get the commission and will also be able to get payment from buyers according to the traditional system. AGENTS AWAIT WRITTEN WORDHowever, procurement did not resume in several grain markets as commission agents insisted on a written communication from the government to end the confusion. “Procurement could not be resumed at some places as the traders did not come to buy basmati till Tuesday evening, It will take a day or two to resume operations in all mandis of the state,” said Naresh Kumar, a commission agent in the Kurukshetra grain market. State agriculture marketing officials said they have released payments of deductions made from the commission of the arhtiyas for lustre loss in the wheat procurement season. “The meeting (with arhtiyas and rice mill owners) ended on a positive note and all issues were resolved. Both have agreed to end their protest but the written notification will be issued by Tuesday evening,” said a senior officer of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commission-agents-end-strike-resume-paddy-procurement-after-haryana-govt-accepts-demands/story-TsEUqAMbQEqMrdKezVgcrN.html

22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Missing the city’s atmospheric chai||Lallan has returned. The man had virtually vanished for many months.His tea stall in Old Delhi was among the city’s most atmospheric chai places, and looked like it had been here forever—though founded only four years ago. The stall consisted of an arched niche scooped into the outer wall of a dilapidated building in Galli Choori Wallan street. This sublime niche was the best part of the stall.In his late 20s, Lallan would walk to this spot every morning from his room in the vicinity, which he shared with half-a-dozen brick-layers. Within minutes, he would set up the stall consisting of a stove, a kettle, a steel tray, boxes of sugar and chai patti (tea leaves), stacks of plastic glasses, a pan of milk, strainers, and a few tea snacks such as the flaky fen, made in the neighbourhood bakeries. He carried the entire paraphernalia in a rusty metal trunk that the customers would use as bench.In the morning, the space around the picturesque niche teemed with tea drinkers. They would be busy in their chai, gossip and newspapers, totally oblivious to the beautiful setting.Suddenly, early last year, the stall vanished. The niche lost its life, although meantime it was whitewashed and made to look new by the building owner. Save for some ominous rumours, nobody around had a clue on what had become of Lallan.Now, Lallan has resurfaced. This morning he is casually sitting inside that same niche, but without the tea things. Carefree and maskless, he says, “I’d gone back to my des (he means his village).” He’s from a village in Bahraich, UP—home to his parents, wife and four kids. Lallan left the city “because I was bored,” he admits shyly, shrugging his shoulders. He didn’t experience the city during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. But why be back in such a challenging time?“Because I must restart working... I’ll do something new, maybe become a brick layer.”While his beautiful chai stall is not likely to be back, at least our city has regained its Lallan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/missing-the-city-s-atmospheric-chai/story-QoMRGsxBJR3xEfgysD6mqM.html

The victim, Balraj Deshwal, was shot in his face from a “very close range” and died on the spot. The alleged accused, Pradeep Khokar, is absconding, said Santosh Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (Dwarka), Delhi Police. “Gehlan Apartment, where the murder took place, was constructed by Deshwal and his three business partners. Khokar had purchased one of the flats and was staying in Gehlan Apartment. We have learnt that Khokar was to pay an outstanding amount of Rs 5 lakh to Deshwal. It’s not yet clear whether the murder took place because of a dispute over the payment,” said DCP Meena. The crime occurred place at around 8:30 pm, when Deshwal and one of his business partners were sitting in the parking space on the ground floor of the building. Khokar entered building while having an argument with a person over the phone, one of Deshwal’s partners told the police in his statement. “One of Deshwal’s partners told us that Khokar looked angry and was abusing the person on the phone. Soon, Khokar disconnected the call and got into an altercation with Deshwal without any provocation. During the argument, he whipped out a pistol and fired at Deshwal’s face from a very close range. Deshwal died on the spot,” said the DCP. Khokar fled the crime scene and Deshwal was rushed to an adjacent hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.

Two fire tenders and a rescue team from the Delhi Fire Services were rushed to the site for rescue operation. The injured person was rushed to a nearby hospital by the locals before the rescuers could reach the site, said fire services department chief Atul Garg. “The person has received minor injuries.

The process of constructing the roof the second floor was going on and construction materials for the same was being arranged when the entire building collapsed, said Shukla. Municipal officials have been informed about the incident and they have been asked to find out if the building was being constructed illegally or the contractor had been flouting rules after obtaining permission for it.

22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Provide list of those with security cover but hold no public office: High court to Punjab govt||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Punjab government to provide the list of those having security cover but are not holding any public office. Also, the bench of Justice Jaishree Thakur directed the government to provide the number of people given security beyond the State Security Policy, 2013. The directions came on a petition filed by former Punjab deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh who has challenged the state government’s move to withdraw his security cover on June 23. As an interim measure, the court has asked state to provide him two security personnel. In the plea filed on August 25, Devinder had told the court that despite having been provided security since 2018, his cover was withdrawn completely in a unilateral manner even as former MLAs are provided a minimum of two security personnel.He informed the court that he was placed under high-risk category in 1983 and survived an attack in 1991 in Fatehgarh Sahib. In 2010, his complete security cover was withdrawn but it was restored after the high court’s intervention, he added. The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government withdrew four of his gunmen in March 2018 and with the fresh order he was left with no security cover and was told to get the same on payment basis, he had said. The move, he claimed, was aimed at settling political scores as he had been critical of the present dispensation as part of his public duty. The government had responded by stating that he is not entitled to security cover as an ex MLA as per the policy. To counter the claim, Devinder had submitted details of some former MLAs who have been provided security cover by the state. The matter has been posted for further hearing on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/provide-list-of-those-with-security-cover-but-hold-no-public-office-hc-to-punjab/story-Zbbd88FJrPIeL2DLcNWHSL.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) attributed this dip in CFR to weekly monitoring at private and municipal hospitals as part of its ‘Mission Save Lives’ launched in June. CFR is deaths due to Covid-19 as a per cent of the total cases reported. “We have started monitoring weekly fatality rate, every Monday morning, at all public and private hospitals. This has resulted in drastic fall in the fatality rate. We are striving to bring the average fatality rate per day further down in the next 30 days,” said BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. On June 30, the civic body launched a nine-point strategy called ‘Mission Save Lives’ after the city’s fatality rate had touched 5.8% on June 29. The plan included audit of every death, video surveillance of every critical and serious case, and mandatory video conferencing or telephonic meeting twice a day to review every serious case at the hands of senior doctors, among other things. HT had reported on August 15 that May had reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths at 2,269, followed by June at 1,922 deaths, and July at 1,773 deaths. In August, the city recorded 1,260 fatalities due to Covid-19, and until September 20, Mumbai has reported 776 deaths.Meanwhile, on Monday, the city reported 1,837 new cases and 36 deaths, taking the city’s tally and toll to 186,276 and 8,505, respectively. While the number of recovered patients in the city stands at 150,535, Mumbai currently has 26,858 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-case-fatality-rate-down-to-4-5-as-bmc-ups-monitoring/story-X0ykH1a3b1IyKy59KANXrI.html
22-09-2020||City||Hoshiarpur distiller brewed liquor with fake export permits, faces FIR||A Hoshiarpur-based distillery, Lloyd Bottling and Blending, faces a criminal case after it was found producing liquor on the basis of a fake export permit for Bhutan and was to sell the alcoholic beverage illegally in the local market. The state excise department has written to the Hoshiarpur police to register an FIR against firm owner Jagmeet Singh Bhatia, a resident of Chauni Kalan in the district. In a note to the state excise commissioner, the assistant excise commissioner (Hoshiarpur) said the department conducted a surprise checking on September 12 at Lloyd Bottling and Blending at Chauni Kalan. During the raid, the team found 700 boxes of Lion 13 whisky allegedly prepared for export to Bhutan. It recovered 197 boxes of liquor with bottles without any brand logo besides 59,400 cap seals without brand logo. The firm representatives showed the excise officials three import permits purportedly issued by the Bhutanese authorities on July 31. Smelling a rat, the district excise officials wrote to the Bhutanese embassy in New Delhi to check whether the permits were genuine.

22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid losses: Major cuts expected in Panjab University’s revised budget for 2020-21||Expecting a loss in revenue this year due to the pandemic, Panjab University (PU) is planning to cut its expenses in the revised budget for 2020-21 for which preparations have already started.Already, the annual fee hike was put on hold this year and a concession of 5% in semester fee for all students meant losses to the tune of ₹2 crore. Not expecting to earn any revenue from the usual sources, including hostels, amid the pandemic, the university had even constituted a panel for austerity measures.The panel has now recommended budget cuts under various heads and the recommendations made by the panel are likely to be incorporated in PU’s revised budget for 2020-21.PU’s finance and development officer (FDO) Vikram Nayyar said, “As the university is in the process of preparing the revised budget for this year, the recommendations made by the panel will be first taken up by the budget estimates committee.”Meanwhile, an online meeting of the budget estimates committee was also held on Monday. A member who attended the meeting, seeking anonymity, said, “The recommended cuts have been accepted and they will be incorporated in the revised budget after a review.”As per last year’s estimates, the total revenue receipts were pegged at around ₹300 crore with an additional ₹247 crore grant from the University Grants Commission (UGC). The total revenue expenditure for 2020-21 was estimated at over ₹586 crore.Austerity committee’s recommendationsAs PU is grappling with dwindling finances, the panel has recommended various austerity measures, which include suspension of budget under leave travel concession (LTC) and budget for seminar and field work.A 20% cut in office and other general administration expenditure and 10% cut in repair, maintenance and minor improvements have also been recommended.Further, a 40% cut in the budget provision for hostels (other than salary) and 40% cut in budget provisions meant for sports activities have been recommended. Also, no new building or major renovation should take place this year, as per the committee.The varsity has already suspended the financial subsidy for employees and teachers for attending conferences within India and abroad for 2020-21. According to sources in the university, the PU administration wrote to the government last month seeking a special relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-losses-major-cuts-expected-in-panjab-university-s-revised-budget-for-2020-21/story-Pmk5I09SzuDFv2EMD3ekKJ.html
22-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi building collapses: 16 killed and 20 injured||Sixteen people, including seven children, were killed, 20 were injured, while some were still feared trapped under the debris at the time of going to press after a major portion of a 36-year-old ground-plus-three storey residential building collapsed in Bhiwandi, around 35km from Mumbai, around 3.30am on Monday. The cause of the pre-dawn accident was not immediately known, however, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) chief Pankaj Ashiya said Jilani building in Dhamankar Naka was illegal and notices had been sent to residents to vacate.Rescue operations were on in the night as teams cleared debris and searched for survivors in the structure located amid a cluster of buildings and surrounded by narrow lanes. According to the BNCMC, 24 of the total 48 flats of the building collapsed in the incident, while the portion that did not collapse had a power loom on the ground floor. The injured were rushed to the Indira Gandhi Memorial (IGM) hospital. A seven-year- old boy, Ayaan Shaikh Ibrahim, who was trapped for nine hours along with his family of five, had a miraculous escape with no injuries. Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) regional disaster management cell, the fire brigade and the disaster cell of BNCMC were part of the rescue operations, along with locals.“As soon as the incident took place, residents living near the area rushed to the spot and started pulling people from under the rubble. It was very painful to hear people’s cries for help. My relatives lived in this building,” said Khalid Abdullah Khan, 28, who lived in the building one year ago and has now shifted to another building nearby. Before the NDRF team reached the spot, 21 people were rescued by locals and the Bhiwandi and Thane rescue teams. The NDRF teams used a canine squad to search for people trapped under the debris. Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant of NDRF, said, “Since the incident took place during the time when most residents were asleep, we emphasised on searching bedrooms and living rooms. There was also a fear that the remaining portion of the building would collapse, too, as it was also tilting. We focused on canine search operations as we could not use equipment, fearing vibrations that could lead to collapse of the remaining portion.” As a precautionary measure, power supply to the area has been snapped. “As soon as the incident took place, I received a call and alerted the fire brigade team to reach the spot. Around 5.30am, the NDRF team took over rescue operations and managed to pull out residents from under the debris,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner , BNCMC. Ashiya claimed that the building was built in 1984 during the Gram Panchayat rule and hence it is an illegal structure with no permission from the civic body. Also, he said that the civic body had sent notices to the residents to vacate the building. “The building is illegal and also very old and we have served notices to the residents and owner to vacate it. If any sort of negligence has led to the incident, legal action will be taken,” he added. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray postponed the e-opening of the Mankoli flyover in suburban Mumbai on Monday after the building collapse. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolence to the families of the victims and assured that all necessary help was being given to the affected. “Saddened by the building collapse in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra. Condolences to the bereaved families. Praying for a quick recovery of those injured. Rescue operations are underway and all possible assistance is being provided to the affected,” PM Modi tweeted. President Ram Nath Kovind also expressed grief over incident. In a statement issued by Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde, he announced a compensation of Rs5 lakhs to the victim’s kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapses-16-killed-and-20-injured/story-oQ6Ru87j2JoVIlyZDw5XWL.html

However, the context in which their names were taken is not clear yet. “Their roles can’t be given right now,” Malhotra said.Rhea, who is presently lodged in Byculla Jail, had, however, retracted her statements.

22-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 15,737 more Covid-19 cases, tally jumps to 1,224,380||A day after crossing the grim mark of 1.2 million Covid-19 infections, the state reported its lowest one-day spike in the past three weeks with an addition of 15,737 cases on Monday, pushing the tally to 1,224,380. Significantly, the decline on Monday was owing to fewer tests over the weekend, from the daily average of around 90,000 tests to just 40,017 tests in the past 24 hours. The positivity rate on Monday, however, jumped to 39.32%, which hovered around 24% over the past few days. The high positivity rate could be a concern for state authorities. With 344 more fatalities, the state’s death toll has touched 33,015, which included 8,505 in Mumbai after the addition of 36 fatalities.Monday saw double the patients being discharged than new admissions as 32,007 patients, highest ever in a day, were discharged. With the fourth straight day of more discharges than new cases, the total of the recovered patients reached 9,16,348, pushing the recovery rate to 74.84%, from 73.17% on Sunday. Maharashtra now has 2,74,623 active patients. The state saw the addition of 431,839 cases in September with a daily average of 20,563 cases. Delay in the test reports and updating the records of new infections and deaths has led to the decline in numbers, according to officials from the health department. Among the 344 fatalities reported on Monday,200 were reported in the past two days, 81 were over the past week, while 63 deaths were from the period before it. In some of the districts, the rise in cases is much more rapid than the state average over the past two weeks between September 6 and 20. Experts, however, expressed unhappiness over the shortage of medicines, oxygen and state machinery’s failure in tracing high-low risk contacts. “We have only 60% oxygen available than its requirement, while shortage of medicines in some parts of the state a matter of serious concern. Though the state government has launched the drive ‘My family My responsibility’ the tracing of the suspected contacts is poor. This has been leading to rise in the number of cases and high CFR,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, Maharashtra president of the Indian Medical Association. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said that by the end of October, there could be decline in cases. “Offset of the monsoon could prove a great respite as we can expect the surge to subside. Even today, about many Covid-19 cases are also with coexistence of monsoon-related ailments like dengue, malaria, leptospirosis. We can expect declines in these cases, too, after monsoon. We are expecting Covid-19 cases to recede between the end of October and mid-November. We expect our mortality rate to decline in the near future too. Our weekly mortality rate in September ranges between 1.74 and 1.9%, though the cumulative rate is 2.7%. Even the recovery rate is much higher than mentioned in the report as many discharges are not being reported properly, especially related to the people in home isolation,” he said.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task for the clinical management of critical patients, said that they can expect decline in daily cases by a month. “With Chase The Virus drive being implemented effectively, and if the people followed the protocol of social distancing and personal hygiene, we can expect the decline in the cases. The current rise in the cases, which is part of the first wave, is owing to the increased number of cases and unlocking rolled out by the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-15-737-more-covid-19-cases-tally-jumps-to-1-224-380/story-0Y1cz90xXf4rZKz9SgoCUL.html
22-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi building collapse: Narrow lanes, clusters make rescue tougher||Congested narrow lanes and a thick cluster of buildings through which rescue vehicles couldn’t pass forced the National Disaster Response Force team to help out those stranded under the debris of the Jilani building in Bhiwandi, a part of which collapsed early on Monday, manually, with some help from the canine squad and local residents. The ground-plus-three structure, which is surrounded by buildings on all four sides, had 48 flats, housing 62 residents. The two fire tenders, which first reached the spot, had to be parked on main road, around 500m away from the collapse site. Nine NDRF vehicles, too, couldn’t enter the lanes. NDRF team then studied the remaining structure to understand the layout of the one room-kitchen flats. They also consulted the local engineers for an idea about the structure. As per NDRF, initially, the rescue operations took time as the remaining portion of the building was tilted. Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant, NDRF, said, “Owing to the narrow lanes, we could not bring our vehicles which had all the equipment and necessary material. Locals helped us carry the equipment. Their role was very crucial in the operation.” Elaborating on it, Kumar said, “We spoke to the engineer of the local municipal body to get an idea of the structure and also studied the remaining portion of the building to know the location of each flat and its layout. We also clicked pictures and videos for the detailing. We decided to give priority to the living room area as most of them were asleep at the time of the incident. We then drew a line and initiated a canine search, which is the best way to find those who are alive. Our team also managed to balance the structure by placing bamboos to hold the third floor that came crashing on the first floor. Most residents were trapped in the ground, first and second floor of the building, while those from the third floor managed to escape.” “Taking the victims to the hospital too was a task,” said Rajesh Pawar, chief fire officer, BNCMC. Sameer Khan, 29, a resident of a building in the vicinity, said, “One of my friends was rescued after the dogs managed to trace him. Locals helped move the debris for the search.”Bhiwandi’s narrow lanes house many such buildings with no access roads, which even come up in less than a year. A local engineer, Kamankar Dhurraaj, who also reached the spot, claimed, “Such structures are built with sub-standard material.” 7-year-old rescued unhurt after nine hoursStuck in the pile of debris for nine hours, Ayaan Shaikh Ibrahim, 7, and his family had a miraculous escape. While Ayaan was unhurt when he was pulled out at 1.30pm, his two sisters, elder brother and parents suffered minor injuries. The Ibrahims, who worked as an electrician in a powerloom, stayed on the first floor of the building. Muskaan Shaikh Ibrahim, 16, his sister, said, “All of us were sleeping in the living room when the incident took place. When I opened my eyes something heavy had fallen on my hand and I was in terrible pain. Ayaan was cushioned between us and was unhurt. After calling out for help for hours the rescuers heard us and pulled us out. Ayaan hasn’t spoken a word since being rescued and is in shock.” ‘Part of bldg outside my door was not there’ Khan Tariq Khalim, 34, woke up on Monday hearing a loud thud. “I tried to open the door to check the source of the noise, but it was jammed. It took me some time to manage to break it open. I was shocked to see nothing outside the door, as the portion of the building on the opposite side of my flat had collapsed. I woke my wife and two children and managed to reach the stairs from the small portion of ground still left outside our door.” Khalim, who works as a contractor, said they were unaware that the building was dangerous as they had repaired it five years ago. “The plaster of the building fell off several times, so we had repaired it by pooling in money.” Woman awaits news on daughter for 12 hrs Zulekha Mohammad Ali Shaikh, 52, was heading to use the washroom when a pile of debris came crashing down on her. She was awake and saved her head from injury, with only her feet being caught. However, her 28-year-old daughter remains stuck in the rubble. “My elder daughter and husband died few years ago, my younger daughter Shabnam, 28, was sleeping when the incident took place. They rescued me immediately after the incident, however, my daughter is still missing. It has been over 12 hours,” said Shaikh who lived on the third floor. 10 youngsters help rescue operation A group of 10 youngsters, including National Cadet Corps and those in the service of Indian Army, helped the NDRF team with the rescue operation. The group, known as ‘Young Warriors’ in Bhiwandi, often helps residents. Dipesh Patil, 24, a member said, “One of our other members saw an NDRF vehicle passing through the area and inquired about the incident. He called all of us and we immediately reached the spot. Some of us are NCC volunteers, while few also serve in the Army and are home on leave. We rescued four people, including a child from the debris.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-narrow-lanes-clusters-make-rescue-tougher/story-nEnGaxL5yTDgmW5bTT5rCM.html
22-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi building collapse: Structure was issued notices twice, says civic body||The Narpoli police on Monday booked the land owner and builder of Bhiwandi’s Jilani building, a part of which collapsed leading to at least 16 deaths, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, claiming “neither did he take efforts to repair the building’s broken pillar, nor did he convince people to vacate the building”. Maloji Shinde, senior police inspector, Narpolice police station, said, “Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) officials registered the case against the owner. BNCMC stated that since February 2020, they have sent three notices to the owner and residents, but they refused to accept them. The notice was stuck on the building gate by the civic officials. The owner was informed about the dilapidated condition of the building in February, but he ignored all warnings.” The owner, Sayyed Ahmed Jilani, has not been arrested as he is absconding, said police. He has been booked under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 (whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Two BNCMC officials – assistant municipal commissioner Sudam Jadhav and Dudhnath Yadav, junior engineer, town planning department – have also been suspended for their failure to vacate residents from the building, despite serving notices to them earlier this year. As per the suspension directions by BNCMC chief Pankaj Ashiya, although the officers served notices twice to the residents to vacate the building, they failed to get the structure evicted. “Two officials have been suspended for failing to take necessary measures as per the law. During the suspension, a proper inquiry will be carried out in this matter,” said Ashiya. BNCMC has also formed a committee under a deputy commissioner and assistant town planner to probe the incident further. Contrary to the civic body’s claims that notices were served to the owner in February and April, residents said they did not receive any notice.Ajay Sawant, deputy municipal commissioner, BNCMC, said, “The residents were reluctant to vacate the building. They were not ready to take the notice so we stuck it on the structure.” Local residents, however, claimed the 36-year-old building was repaired five years ago, after several incidents of plaster damage. “As the plaster started to peel off and the building developed cracks, we decided to repair it. We also informed the civic body. We never received any notice from the civic body,” said Khan Tariq Khalim, 34, who managed to escape from the building with his family. Recently, after the Mahad building collapse in August, BNCMC conducted a review of all dangerous buildings in its vicinity. The officials identified 25 extremely dangerous structures, of which eight were demolished. Meanwhile, chief minister Thackeray on Monday asked MMRDA officials to throw open the Bhiwandi flyover for traffic and not wait for an official inauguration, which was cancelled in the wake of the collapse. “Motorists should not be inconvenienced just because the flyover has not been officially inaugurated,” the CM is said to have said as per a statement released by his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-structure-was-issued-notices-twice-says-civic-body/story-RzI4MiGVy7QnENkBdo5TIJ.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots charge sheet details money trail, accused deny allegations||In its charge sheet related to the alleged conspiracy behind the north-east Delhi communal riots, the Delhi Police special cell has said that five accused in the case got Rs 1.61 crore in cash and through banking transactions for allegedly “managing” the sites for anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests and “execute the conspiracy” for riots.The police, in the charge sheet, a copy of which was given to the lawyers of the accused persons on Monday, also said that former councillor Ishrat Jahan, activist Khalid Saifi, suspended municipal councillor Tahir Hussain, Shifa-Ur-Rehman and Jamia Milla Islamia student Meeran Haider withdrew Rs 1.48 crore in cash on separate occasions to implement their plans. Rizwan, counsel for Tahir Hussain, denied all the allegations and said that no money was used to fund the anti- CAA/NRC protest by his client.Saifi’s lawyer Harsh Bohra said, “This charge sheet is completely rubbish. We deny it.”Advocate Amit Bhalla, counsel for Shifa ur Rehman, said that it was a voluminous charge sheet. “I am yet to read the document because it is not possible to read it in such a short time.”Advocate Saransh Gupta, for Meeran Haider, refused to comment.In the specific case against Ishrat, police claimed Rs. 4 lakh were transferred in her bank account from a Corporation Bank account in Maharashtra. The money was transferred by a man who worked as a driver for Samir Abdul Sai in Sindhudurg Maharashtra. Sai, who has recorded his statement before a judge, alleged that he was conned into sending the money by his business partner, who was allegedly funding the anti-CAA protests.Pradeep Teotia, lawyer for Ishrat Jahan, said, “This is a case of fundamental rights and there is not an iota of evidence against my client. The allegations about funding are all concoctated facts and there is nothing in the charge sheet to prove the same.” The name of Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav has also been mentioned in the charge sheet in the context of anti-CAA protests. However, he has not been named as an accused or charged with any offence. He was also not named in any case related to the riots. The police have attached a photo of Yadav showing him in a meeting with Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others, which purportedly was held on December 8, 2019 in Jangpura Extension. Khalid and Imam have been charged as the main conspirators. In the charge sheet, police claim that the meeting was held to discuss road blockades in Jamia area.“I have not seen the photograph Delhi Police seems to have filed. But as I said in a news report two weeks ago, yes, there was a meeting and it did take place on December 8 at the office of NAPM in Jangpura, where movement groups normally hold their meetings. It was not any hidden, conspiratorial place. Several meetings took place at that venue before and after CAA was passed. The meeting on December 8 turned out to be a non starter as most of the people invited did not turn up due to short notice” Yadav said.“I have not seen the charge sheet, so I can’t say what Delhi Police is reading into it. But t is laughable to imagine that any conspiracy was hatched in the meeting on December 8 that did not even begin,” the Swaraj Abhiyan leader said.Delhi police have said that the riots in north-east Delhi, was planned by some anti-CAA protesters who blocked roads to inconvenience people, make inflammatory speeches and orchestrate the people. But many activists and anti-CAA protesters have denied the charges ad accused police of launching witch hunt against anti-government voices letting off the hook ruling party leaders such as Kapil Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-charge-sheet-details-money-trail-accused-deny-allegations/story-ww64TFM1UOPModQ7qmyXNN.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Subsidies for electric vehicles likely from next week, says transport minister Gahlot||As many as 1,280 new electric vehicles (EVs) have been registered in the national capital since the notification of the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy, 2020, on August 7, but these vehicle owners are yet to get the subsidy promised to them by the policy.This is because the Delhi government is yet to set up the state EV fund and transport minister Kailash Gahlot said subsidies and other benefits such as a waiver on road tax and registration fee are likely to be launched next week.The government had announced a subsidy of ₹1.5 lakh (₹10,000 per kWh of battery capacity) for the first 1,000 electric four-wheelers. A subsidy of up to ₹30,000 (₹5,000 per kWh of battery capacity) was to be given on the purchase of each electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicle. Also, those buying electric vehicles are to be exempted from paying road tax and registration fee. At present, road tax ranges from 4% to 10% of the cost of the vehicle, while the registration fee is about ₹3,000 per vehicle.However, the government is still undecided on whether these benefits would be extended to those who already bought EVs after August 7. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, said subsidies and tax waivers would require a separate notification from the transport department, which has not been issued yet.“It is yet to be decided whether those who bought EVs after August 7 would be eligible or not. If they are, then the transport department will simply have to notify the cut-off date as August 7 or so, for the purchase of the EV, so that new owners can also avail of the benefits,” the official quoted above said.When asked about the delay in notifying the waivers and subsidy, Gahlot said building the software for disbursal of subsidies took time. “Now that the software is ready, I have issued directions to make the software undergo rigorous testing. Once the testing is done, all subsidies shall be launched.We are expecting it to start sometime next week. We were planning for this week, but some work is still left with regard to the registration fee waiver,” Gahlot said.As per the scheme, the subsidy will be paid to eligible buyers within two days, a second transport official, on condition of anonymity, said.“The vehicle dealers will access the software and fill the details of the electric vehicle and buyer at the time of sale. Within 48 hours, a subsidy amount will be credited to the bank account of the buyer after verification by motor licensing officials,” the official said. The vehicle dealers will have to self-register with the transport department to be able to process the subsidy at the time of sale, the official said.According to the national dashboard of car registrations, Delhi registered 1,287 EVs between August 7 and September 21. This means at least 1,000 EVs were bought post the EV policy notification, but no government benefit was extended to these owners. A senior government official said the state EV fund will be established soon and it is likely to start with a seed money of ₹20 crore that will be diverted from the existing air ambience fund of the Delhi government. To persuade people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the shift from petrol and diesel vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/subsidies-for-electric-vehicles-likely-from-next-week-says-transport-minister-gahlot/story-Tc2FibGZQ3AVZZ9fRImXJP.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Traffic diversions in place at Ashram junction, Sarai Kale Khan flyover||With work on the underpass connecting the Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and the busy Ashram intersection in south Delhi picking up pace, the Delhi traffic police on Monday released an elaborate vehicular diversion plan to accommodate the construction and the traffic volume. This traffic plan accommodates the ongoing repair work on the one-way flyover in front of the Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, traffic police said. According to the traffic police advisory, the construction work would affect traffic movement between east Delhi, south Delhi, Faridabad and Noida for at least a year.  The 750-metre underpass, which was conceived in December 2015, aims to provide a signal-free ride between Nizamuddin and New Friends Colony on Mathura Road. This is much needed as the Ashram intersection is an important link connecting central and south Delhi and also the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. The intersection, one of the busiest in the national capital, connects Mathura Road, National Highway-2 and the Ring Road (linking the flyovers of Lajpat Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan with the DND Flyway). Data released by the traffic department shows that after the easing of lockdown restrictions, when construction work on the stretch was resumed with preliminary diversions, the intersection saw 2.8 lakh vehicles a day, or about 11,600 vehicles an hour. While releasing the traffic diversion plan for the Ashram intersection, traffic police advised commuters to avoid the intersection altogether, if possible, in view of the ongoing construction work. Under the new traffic management plan, all vehicles on Ring Road -- going towards Sarita Vihar, Badarpur, Faridabad and approaching the Ashram Chowk from Moolchand -- can take a right onto Captain Gaur Marg from under the Lajpat Nagar flyover or take the left loop across the Modi Mill flyover and descend on to Mathura Road near Sukhdev Vihar for their onward journey. Cars and two-wheelers approaching Ashram Chowk from Sarai Kale Khan and Noida -- going towards SaritaVihar, Badarpur and Faridabad -- can take a left on CV Raman Marg. They can then take a right either at Mata Mandir Marg or Johar Marg to reach Mathura Road. Additional CP (traffic) SD Mishra said this plan will first be implemented on a trial basis to acclimatise commuters to the new routes. He also said with the public works department (PWD) also carrying out emergency repair work on the Sarai Kale Khan flyover, traffic movement is expected to remain heavy in the area. “PWD is carrying out emergency repairs on the Sarai Kale Khan flyover. This is expected to continue for another two weeks. As the work is being carried out in parts, only one carriageway of the flyover is available for traffic going towards Raj Ghat. This has resulted in congestion near the flyover,” Mishra said. To manage the traffic load, all vehicles approaching the Sarai Kale Khan flyover from Ashram or from Barapullah flyover will be restricted to the left carriageway of the Sarai Kale Khan flyover. “All traffic bound for National Highway-24, east Delhi and Ghaziabad -- descending from Barapullah flyover and approaching Sarai Kale Khan -- can opt to go straight ahead and take Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway. They can also take a left towards Mayur Vihar Pusta Road and rejoin NH-24 or Vikas Marg,” the traffic plan read. Traffic department said ample signboards will be put up to direct commuters towards the new routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-diversions-in-place-at-ashram-junction-sarai-kale-khan-flyover/story-qZM6tdtSuqL3h9Ry1gDrzL.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||DMRC fines 2,214 passengers in 9 days for not wearing masks||Two weeks after resuming services — after a pause of five-and-a-half months — the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has fined more than 2,000 people for not wearing masks in the station premises and inside trains. According to DMRC data, from September 11 — when the rail corporation started imposing fines for mask violations — till September 20, at least 2,214 commuters had been fined for not wearing masks. Apart from this,DMRC teams had counselled, but not fined, more than 5,000 people, in an attempt to ensure that the new travel guidelines are followed. Four days after its graded resumption of services, the DMRC had formed a special flying squad for each of its nine operational corridors to ensure that commuters wear masks inside the Metro network at all times and abide by social distancing norms.  These teams move in and out of trains and stations in the lines assigned to them and if any passenger is found to be violating the rules, they counsel them. If a commuter still refuses to fall in line and wear a mask, then they fined under Section 59 of Delhi Metro’s Operations and Maintenance Act. Under this section, violators can be imposed a fine of R200 for creating public nuisance. Records show that the most number of fines were issued on the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-Huda City Centre), where as many as 724 commuters were penalised for not wearing or improperly wearing masks in stations and inside trains. This was followed by the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh Ballabhgarh), where 580 fines were issued and the Blue Line (Dwarka Sec-21 to Noida Electronic City/Vaishali) where 545 people were challaned. In the Red Line, connecting Rithala and Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda, the DMRC has so far issued 134 challans for mask violations, while on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden) and Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) 109 and 79 fines were issued, respectively. On the Green Line (Kirti Nagar/Inderlok -Brigadier Hoshiar Singh Bahadurgarh) 26 commuters were fined and on the Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh) 17 people were fined. Because of the low ridership on the Airport Express Line, no fines were issued on the corridor.“DMRC’s objective is primarily to advise and counsel erring passengers to follow laid down norms for everyone’s safety and this is being done with a positive attitude rather than to punish people. So far, DMRC has counselled around 5,000 passengers in the 10-day drive undertaken so far. The overall behaviour of passengers have been found praiseworthy in terms of following new norms of travel due to the pandemic,” DMRC said in an email response to Hindustan Times. The rail corporation said that fines were being issued only in limited cases, where passengers were not heeding to counselling and creating nuisance even after being called out for not wearing masks properly. The Metro has also gone cashless in its operations to control the spread of the infection. DMRC data shows that since tokens have been discontinued temporarily in the system, between September 7 and September 20, on an average around 9,277 smart cards are being issued daily. The Delhi Metro resumed services on September 7 in a graded manner after being forced shut on March 22 to control the spread of Covid-19. From September 12, all the corridors of the Metro have been fully functional, with the corporation continuing with crowd-control measures and social distancing inside its network. Sumitra Srivastava, a regular Metro user, who travels from Dwarka to Noida, said that it was important to create a deterrence among people so that they wear masks for their own safety and for the safety of fellow passengers. “There are so many people who pull down their masks once they get into trains thinking no one is watching them now. You might be fit and healthy, but travelling in a mass transit system you have to be considerate towards other passengers too. In a city like Delhi, fining people is the only way to get people to follow rules,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dmrc-fines-2-214-passengers-in-9-days-for-not-wearing-masks/story-VRWsWy8Su3aHG9khdB6mFL.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi deaths hit 5,000; India sees 100k daily recoveries||With 32 new deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported on Monday, the total number of people who have died from the viral infection in Delhi crossed the 5,000 mark as the resurgence of the infections in city continued.According to Monday’s government health bulletin, 2,548 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of infections in the Capital to 249,259. The infection has killed a total of 5,014 people till Sunday, while 213,304 people have recovered.At an average, 35 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 every day in the past week. This is the highest the seven-day average of deaths has been in two months (since July 21). The highest number of deaths reported in a day during the September resurgence in cases was 38 (on September 17 and 19). This was the highest number of deaths reported in 24-hours in over two months.Delhi’s case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of confirmed cases that have died due to the disease — is 2.0%, much higher than the national CFR of 1.6%.The Delhi government officials, however, said they have been able to control deaths better in the recent resurgence of cases than they did in the initial surge in June. “Very few deaths are being reported right now in comparison to the number of cases. Death is always seen as a percentage,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.“A person who gets diagnosed today will not die on day 1, they might die on day 4 or day 6 so we need to look at the trend of deaths over some time,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital. “With Covid-19 beds filling up in bigger hospitals, many patients may go to smaller centres that may not be equipped to handle complicated Covid-19 cases,” he said.With the increase in the number of hospitalisations – over 7,000 reported on Saturday and Sunday – hospitals have been slowly filling up in the Capital. Delhi currently has 3,081 ICU (intensive care unit) beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients. Of these, 67.4% are already occupied, according to Delhi corona app. The occupancy, however, is much higher at the big multi-speciality private hospitals.“The occupancy is higher in big private hospitals of the city because many patients from outside Delhi know of these hospitals and come there specifically for treatment. Nearly 30% of all admitted Covid-19 patients in Delhi are from other states. But, there are still about 1,000 ICU beds vacant and hospitals are working on increasing beds,” Jain said, adding that over 1,500 beds were added for Covid-19 treatment over the last 10 days, of which 500 were ICU beds.The city again saw a dip in the number of tests and cases over the weekend. Only 33,733 samples were tested in the last 24 hours against an average of around 58,000 daily tests over the past week. With fewer tests, the positivity rate – fraction of people who test positive among those tested – also went up slightly to 7.6%. Experts say that a positivity rate of below 5% over two weeks ideally indicates that the outbreak is in control.“Although, the sero surveillance has shown about 30% presence of antibodies infections are still being reported from areas where fewer infections were reported during June. Now, Delhi needs to focus on keeping the mortality low by keeping close watch on the old and those with comorbidities,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-deaths-hit-5-000-india-sees-100k-daily-recoveries/story-velkm71WR0eYFBzjRYGcTP.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Patients flouting home isolation rules to be shifted to Covid centres||The Delhi government Monday asked district commissioners (DCs) to mandatorily shift any Covid-19 patient, being treated under home isolation, to institutional quarantine if the person is found violating Covid-19 protocols, said senior health officials.Delhi government reports show that in 20 days, the number of Covid-19 patients under home isolation has increased by 133% -- from 8,119 on September 1 to 18,910 on September 20 (Sunday). Active cases in the city during the same period have increased by 102% -- from 15,870 to 32,097.The directive was issued by special secretary (health and family welfare) Udit Prakash Rai after lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, who is also the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, on Friday asked the government to explore an alternative strategy for Covid-19 control in the city, including revising the containment zone policy.“All DCs may kindly ensure that in all such cases where the home isolation criteria are not being fulfilled by the positive patients, they must be shifted to CCC/Covid Health Centre/ Covid Hospitals as per their health condition without fail starting today (Monday). There should not be any laxity shown in adherence to the protocol of home isolation,” Rai said in his directive to all 11 districts in the city.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain’s office said field teams have been told to remain in frequent contact with neighbours of Covid-19 patients under home isolation to verify if these patients or families are violating protocols.“We are also deputing additional trained civil defence volunteers to conduct inspections. Those who do not want to isolate at home, to avoid putting their family members at risk, may opt for the Delhi government facilities for free. For a more premium experience, two private hospitals – Max Saket Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital – have paid quarantine facilities,” the government spokesperson said.A senior health official said nearly 2,000 homes are visited daily by field teams to check on people under home isolation. “Until last week, around 10 to 20 patients were being shifted to Covid Care Centres or hospitals every day. Now, with stricter enforcement and surveillance, this number is likely to increase,” the official said.The health department clarified that each district has been specifically asked to check and ensure that only the patient who fulfils the laid down criteria for home isolation is allowed to get treated at home.As per the protocol laid down by the Centre, which is being followed by Delhi, a Covid-19 patient under home isolation is considered discharged after 10 days of the onset of symptoms,if the person has no fever for three consecutive days. Thereafter, the patient is advised to isolate at home and self-monitor for seven more days. There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over, but every discharged person must receive a fitness certificate from the district officials, state the guidelines issued by the Union health ministry on July 2.In a special session of the Delhi Assembly on September 14, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had informed the House that around 96,000 people have recovered from Covid-19 under home isolation and that only 30 deaths were reported from among such patients. Calling Delhi’s home isolation strategy a “model” for other states, he said providing pulse oximeters to such patients was the key to its “success” in addition to its tele counselling initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/patients-flouting-home-isolation-rules-to-be-shifted-to-covid-centres/story-9Fc1vneL5TGFB5lnhKvkuO.html

According to the jail authorities, the garden, labour of more than eight months, was developed to create a space for inmates where they could relax and calm their nerves.Vipin Mishra, superintendent, Luksar jail said the “meditation garden”, developed by the inmates, offers an environment to the prisoners where their feelings of fatigue, anxiety can be soothed. “Apart from its green field, the garden has a pond with a few ducks and a statue of Gautama Buddha. The serene environment of the garden, inspired by the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha, has created a space for the inmates where they can meditate in peace. This, in turn, can help in reducing their psychological distress and trauma. This meditation garden is also aiding the spiritual well-being of the prisoners,” he said.The superintendent said that the idea of the garden was conceived by jailor Satya Prakash and him in January. “We discussed the idea with the inmates. Surprisingly, some convicts came forward to support it, and later put their wholehearted efforts into developing the garden. We along with other jail staff guided them, and took care of the expenses from our own pockets, ” Mishra said.Work on the garden inside Luksar jail, which houses 2,738 inmates, started in the first week of January and the garden was completed earlier this month.An undertrial prisoner said that sitting and meditating in the garden, christened as an ‘ashram (monastery)’ has had a positive impact on his health. “Now, I don’t have problems like headache and stomach ache. I feel that by sitting there, I’ve become more honest, and speaking the truth gives me satisfaction,” he said.Similar experiences were shared by other inmates who often meditate in the garden. “I suffer less stress now. A sense of benevolence and compassion has come in me towards my co-inmates and jail officials too,” said another undertrial, who did not wish to be named.The garden has more than 50 trees and shrubs of pomegranate, neem, amla, plums, papayas, guava among others apart from different varieties of flowers.Jailor Satya Prakash said, “I regularly spend a few hours in the garden. It has increased my dedication to my duty. We have seen positive changes in the behaviour of many inmates, and we feel more compassion towards them now. After all, the concept of jail is to reinforce corrective behaviour in inmates,” he said.The Luksar jail, which has two wings named after Gandhi and Buddha, also houses a library for inmates apart from training institutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/luksar-jail-inmates-get-a-garden-for-meditation/story-dfcTlVelPm467ohb4bk4PK.html
22-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi University and Delhi govt again spar over funding of state colleges||The Delhi University (DU) administration on Monday alleged that the Delhi government is yet to respond to requests for an appointment to discuss and resolve funding-related issues in the state-funded colleges. The Delhi government denied the allegations, saying the DU vice-chancellor never sought an appointment but said it was willing to discuss the matter with the university.The DU administration informed its executive council (EC) on Monday that it had written to the offices of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and education minister Manish Sisodia in the last few weeks, seeking an appointment to discuss the ‘fund crisis’ in 12 colleges in DU fully funded by the Delhi government. Rajesh Jha, a member of the EC -- the university’s highest decision-making body -- said, “We strongly opposed the Delhi government withholding funds of its 12 colleges for the last five months, which left thousands of teachers and employees without any salary. We asked the DU administration what they are doing to resolve the matter. The acting vice-chancellor (Pro-VC) informed us that the administration has been trying to seek an appointment from the Delhi government to discuss the matter but have not received any response despite several requests.”Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said he has also written to the offices of the chief minister and education minister, requesting them to meet and resolve the issue. “We had written to the union education ministry and they have responded and even called us to discuss the matter. But we have not received any response from the Delhi government despite several attempts in the last few weeks.Besides, DU Pro-VC’s office (officiating VC ), the office of dean of Colleges and dean of South campus have also sought an appointment from the Delhi government. The university is very keen to meet the CM and the education minister to resolve this issue at the earliest,” he said.In a statement issued on Monday, Delhi government said, “This (allegation) is completely false. DU V-C has not sought any meeting appointment from either the CM or Deputy CM. In fact, deputy CM had called a meeting with the DU V-C to discuss this matter before ordering an independent audit and wrote several letters to him too. He refused to attend the meeting and did not even bother responding to letters from the deputy CM and Education Minister. If he’s still willing, he’s welcome to meet and discuss this issue in the next 2-3 days.”In response, Pani said, “The vice-chancellor is on leave since July. The acting VC and Dean of Colleges have been trying to meet the Delhi government over the issue. Why can’t they give us an appointment and respond to our requests?”The Delhi government has been at the loggerheads with 12 DU colleges, which it fully funds, over the release of grants for the last six months. While the principals allege they have not been able to pay their staff since May as grants have not been issued, the Delhi government says with enough funds have been provided in the present academic year. The government has also ordered an independent audit in six of the 12 colleges over “misappropriation” of funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-and-delhi-govt-again-spar-over-funding-of-state-colleges/story-PYJVBRcC1jOzdfu2xsLjGI.html

He said since police custody remand was extraordinarily long, he should not be deprived of meeting his family or friends. The application had sought permission to let Khalid to meet his family on at least two days for 30 minutes every day.The investigating officer (IO) in his reply to the application said that as per the court’s directions, Khalid has been allowed to meet his counsel every day.He claimed Khalid was non-cooperative during the interrogation. He said letting him to meet his family members may influence the interrogation and could be a hindrance. The court said Khalid’s counsel sought permission to meet him during police custody, which was being allowed everyday for 30 minutes. “In the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, I see no merit in the application, and accordingly, the application is dismissed,” the judge said in his order on September 19.Khalid was arrested on September 13 for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khalid-plea-to-meet-family-rejected/story-nIv90l5NNXwzhZUzNEGPZJ.html

Also Read: Delhi’s AQI hits 148 as pollution begins to riseThe statement said that last year, a large number of such illegal units were shut down in Mayapuri, but reports were received that these units had reappeared. The board has issued hefty fines on the owners of these units.“All these units have been promptly been sealed and equipment such as gas cutters, grinders, welding machines have been confiscated. It has been decided to impose heavy penalties and launch prosecution so as to dissuade such type of illegal activities being carried out in Delhi,” the statement added.Senior DPCC officials said licensed units, with adequate area for operation, proper equipment and waste processing facilities, are operating in NCR regions such as Greater Noida and Sonepat. They said the mushrooming of such illegal units could be controlled with more such legal units being made operational in and around the city, to provide an environmental friendly facility to dismantle old vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-polluting-vehicle-scrapping-units-shut-down-in-delhi/story-dJObau1vM8aKp6XQFPFT5K.html
22-09-2020||Chandigarh||Multani disappearance case: Transfer of FIR to CBI will result in protracted delay, says HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that the transfer of the FIR registered in the case of the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani in 1991 from Mohali to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any other agency outside the state will result in protracted delay in completing the probe. The high court judgment has come on the plea of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, who had in August approached the court seeking quashing of the FIR or transfer of probe to the CBI or any other agency. The high court bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh on September 8 had dismissed this plea along with his anticipatory bail petition. This detailed judgment, however, was released on Monday. Subsequently, Saini was granted anticipatory bail by the Supreme Court on September 15. Saini had argued that the FIR is the result of mala fide act by the Congress government and further that the apex court in 2008 had quashed an FIR against him in this case. The court while dismissing the plea observed that the victim side, due to deficiency of resources, may be prejudiced in pursuing the matter, if it is transferred. Also, the investigating agency is collecting evidence which is only available in Punjab and it is easier even for the witnesses to get themselves examined before the SIT, the bench said, adding, “The transfer would also result in protracted delay which suits the petitioner at this game of wits who since 1991 has managed to keep the law at bay.” It observed that a serious and heinous crime has come about which has its repercussions on the society at large. “The first FIR was not quashed on merits but on grounds of misdemeanour”, it said, adding that the question of quashing the present FIR is too preposterous as the probe has just begun. “What has come across to this court from the records depict depravity of mind and for which the petitioner deserves no compassion,” it added. As of political victimisation and his heroic acts, the bench added that the same does not come to his aid to “wash off the blood” of the crime from his smudged hands. He has panicked over the law coming close on his heels and thus he is raking up this ‘subterfuge’ of political victimisation to get undue sympathies of the court, the bench said. SIT summons Saini on Sept 23 Mohali: Six days after the Supreme Court directed the former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini to join investigations in the 1991 murder case of Balwant Singh Multani, the special investigating team (SIT) on Monday summoned him to join probe on September 23. After it didn’t find Saini at his residence in Sector 20, Chandigarh, the SIT pasted the notice outside the house and also gave copies to his counsel, Himmat Singh Deol, HS Dhanoa and Misha Rohtagi. According to the notice, Saini has been asked to reach Mataur police station in Mohali at 11am on September 23.Saini was given relief by the SC on September 15 through interim stay on his arrest and directed him to co-operate and join investigations.Multani, a junior engineer with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation, was allegedly picked up by the police in December 1991 after a terror attack on Saini in which three policemen were killed. Saini was injured in the attack. HTC||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-transfer-of-fir-to-cbi-will-result-in-protracted-delay-says-hc/story-N5NPjHrLmhj8GmiqmhM46M.html

22-09-2020||Pune||Covid situation: Maharashtra govt, doctors’ body engage in blame game||Pune: Series of decisions by the Maharashtra government in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic has upset the doctors, who are now blaming those is power responsible for deteriorating health situation in the state. The accusation by doctors came after Jayant Patil, state water resources minister, blamed doctors for not properly treating patients while stressing for need to audit work of medical staff. The latest blame game has worsened the relationship between doctors and the government when the state is worst affected across the country with a total of 1,208,642 Covid cases and 32,671 fatalities as of September 21. “Maharashtra government says private doctors are unnecessarily admitting patients. The same government was earlier issuing legal notices to doctors for not admitting patients. It’s not the doctors, but you (government) are responsible for failure to control Covid pandemic in the state,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter. According to Patil, fatalities are increasing as a result of lack of treatment from doctors. “Because of Covid fear, patients are not being able to get proper treatment from doctors. This has resulted in rising fatality rate. If the situation continues, we will have to audit doctors’ work along with bills,” Patil had said in Sangli. Bhondwe criticised Patil’s remarks saying the government “must first audit all the work that it has done” for the past 73 years for the health infrastructure in this country. During the interview to HT on September 1, state health minister Rajesh Tope had blamed doctors for not doing enough. Tope had said, “Doctors should not just treat patients for the sake of treatment. It should come from the heart. We are witnessing that at some places, doctors are not treating patients properly may be because they are scared. There is human touch required while treating patients.” In addition to the resistance by the doctors’ body to cap prices of treatment for Covid-19, taking over beds and strict action against doctors and hospitals, it has now come out in strong opposition against the government circular to regulate the use of oxygen for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The circular has faced opposition from the state task force too which called it impractical and suicidal for some patients who might need oxygen way above prescribed by the government. After much resistance the government is now underway to withdraw the circular and instead ask for “judicious” use of oxygen for the treatment of patients. “After much resistance from the doctors’ body and even doctors from the state’s task force, the government is likely to withdraw the circular. The circular asked regularised use of oxygen at 7 litres/ minute for the oxygen beds and 12 litres per minute for ICU. The circular also hints that doctors from private hospitals in Maharashtra overuse oxygen,” said Bhondwe. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra Covid-19 task force said, “The circular is now being withdrawn after we criticised the decision. Doctors have now been asked to judiciously use oxygen supply.” The continuous spat between the doctors’ body and the government is out in the open as the government seeks to conduct an audit of private hospitals. The IMA challenges that the government must first audit its own expenditure on the health sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-criticism-to-blame-game-relationship-between-doctors-and-government-worsens/story-X4uTszIaaUKVlIirU8rlUI.html
22-09-2020||Pune||Students claim luggage missing after their Pune hostel was turned into Covid centre||Many students, who were staying at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hostel and left for their hometowns after the Covid-19 restrictions, claim that they are unable to find their belongings and luggage at their rooms on their return. They blame the civic body for not taking care of their belongings after the hostel was converted into a Covid care centre (CCC) for isolation of positive patients. Some students, who have returned from their native places for admissions and examination purposes, are shocked to see their luggage lying in a damaged condition. Around 400 students used to stay at the hostel located at Ghole road prior to the lockdown. Students from various colleges in the city who had taken admission at the hostel had to rushed to their villages after the city saw a rise in Covid cases and many hostels were asked to be vacated. Many claim that they were unable to take their luggage, books and other belongings. Later, PMC converted the hostel into a quarantine centre. Kuldeep Ambekar, a hosteller, said, “The luggage of students was were dumped in one of the rooms of Ghole Road ward office and some of it were damaged. Many of us had our original certificates and marksheets, important study materials in our luggage. When I told one of my friends to collect my luggage, he told me it is damaged and many of my belongings are missing. We have registered a complaint with PMC demanding compensation for the damaged and missing luggage.” Anuj Sangave, another hosteller who returned from his Jalgaon home to collect luggage, said, “When I came to collect my luggage I was shocked to see the damaged condition of my bags and files. Some of my study material is missing. We are aware that due to Covid pandemic there is a crisis situation in Pune, but that doesn’t mean PMC should dump our luggage anywhere.” Sunil Indalkar, PMC deputy commissioner (social welfare) said, “As there was an urgent need of space to quarantine Covid positive patients, this hostel was taken up by PMC. The luggage of students was properly shifted to Ghole Road ward office. The entire process of transferring luggage, from packaging to keeping it in boxes, is videographed. Students facing any issue in locating their belongings can contact us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-claim-luggage-missing-after-their-pune-hostel-was-turned-into-covid-centre/story-dzGT5hjeGrpY2mjw4UDPHN.html

Samaira Khanna, a nine-year-old is living proof. She has been conducting virtual storytelling sessions, and using that money to help frontline workers and the underprivileged during the pandemic. “The idea of virtual storytelling struck when the lockdown was announced. The outbreak of coronavirus was unprecedented and I was absorbing information about the same and its impact. I was aware about the plight of the migrants and other not-so-fortunate people in our country,” says Khanna who got deeply concerned for them. “As my summer vacations began, I discussed various possibilities of helping people during these times with my parents, using my skills and abilities,” adds the youngster.A student of The Shri Ram School in Aravali, Gurugram, Khanna is charging a nominal fee of ₹50 per session, and recently she donated PPE kits and other useful things to the corona warriors. “I conduct these sessions for 3 to 7 year old children and donate all my earnings to the people who need it the most at this time, during the pandemic. This experience has been extremely gratifying for me and I derive a deep sense of happiness. When I see these children feeling happy and enjoying my stories, I feel on top of the world! I’m happy that my small efforts are bringing a positive impact,” shares Khanna. Khanna’s parents feel proud that their daughter is doing her bit for the society at such a young age. “She is growing up well as an independent and responsible citizen of this country. We are proud that she is respectful towards the society and the environment. Even her story sessions have a message for other children, and we are happy that she is contributing in the best possible way,” says Richa Khanna, her mother.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/corona-tales-meet-the-nine-year-old-kindness-warrior/story-FBwZlk3QbywnrdxJCku1XO.html

Both measures are intended to ensure American workers were not displaced or denied jobs because of cheaper foreign workers. Critics of the H-1B programme argue that US companies are hiring foreign workers to displace American ones, and that they are not highly skilled as they ought to be. More than 70% of these H-1B visas go to Indians hired by US companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, and US subsidiaries of Indian IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS.Office of Management and Budget of the White House has posted a notice on its website saying a review was under way of H-1B and other visas, but no details were available.White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Reuters news agency that these measures will be “utterly transformative” and will ensure there is “no market for someone to drive back down wages on H-1Bs to displace American workers”.The administration would expect to have them in place for maximum impact before elections on November 3. Reuters reported that these measures were being fast-tracked and the final bunch of orders could also include restriction on international students.The H-1B visa programme has been on the crosshairs of the Trump administration from the beginning and it has been changed and altered incrementally since, through executive orders. It was suspended temporarily in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs that were becoming available from the lockdown. The president has also suspended all immigration till December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-set-to-make-it-tough-for-cos-to-hire-h-1b-visa-holders/story-kOoWvLwYlpzcX6s8NtVr3O.html
22-09-2020||World||UN chief slams countries for making Covid-19 vaccination ‘side deals’ for their own population||With the Covid-19 pandemic soon reaching the grim milestone of a million deaths, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday chided those countries who are making “side deals” to have vaccine exclusively for their own populations, saying such “vaccinationalism” is “self-defeating.” “We are working to advance treatments and therapies as a global public good – and backing efforts for a people’s vaccine available and affordable everywhere. Yet some countries are reportedly making side deals exclusively for their own populations,” Guterres said.“Such ‘vaccinationalism’ is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe, until all of us are safe. Likewise, economies cannot run with a runaway pandemic,” he said in his address to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly that commenced on Tuesday in the shadow of the devastating and still raging Covid-19 pandemic.Global organisation Oxfam has warned that wealthy nations representing just 13 per cent of the world’s population have already cornered more than half (51 per cent) of the promised doses of leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Oxfam said the efforts of rich countries, especially the US, to adopt a “me first” nationalistic approach prevents coordination and could prevent or delay the vaccine from reaching people who are at most risk, both living in developing countries and here at home.The Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected over 30 million people and more than 958,000 people have died. The US, with 6.7 million infections, crossed the grim milestone of 200,000 deaths.Guterres said that since the beginning of the pandemic, the UN has pushed for a massive rescue package worth at least 10 per cent of the global economy. “Developed countries have provided enormous relief for their own economies. They can afford it. But we need to ensure that the developing world does not fall into financial ruin, escalating poverty and debt crises. We need a collective commitment to avoid a downward spiral,” he said. The UN system, led by the World Health Organisation, has supported governments — particularly in the developing world — to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, he said.“Our global supply chains have helped to provide personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to more than 130 countries,” Guterres said, adding that the UN has has extended life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable countries and people through a Global Humanitarian Response Plan.The UN’s ‘Verified’ campaign is also fighting misinformation online — in and of itself a toxic virus shaking the democratic underpinnings in many countries, he said.Guterres also gave a clarion call for an inclusive and effective multilateralism that meets the test of the 21st century, cautioning that countries cannot respond to the crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic by “withdrawing into national shells.” “More than seven decades on, multilateral institutions need an upgrade to more equitably represent all the people of the world, rather than giving disproportionate power to some and limiting the voice of others,” he said.“We don’t need new bureaucracies. We need a multilateral system that constantly innovates, delivers for people, and protects our planet,” he added. He underscored that 21st century multilateralism must be networked - linking global institutions across sectors and geographies, from development banks to regional organizations and trade alliances.“To overcome today’s fragilities and challenges we need more international cooperation - not less; strengthened multilateral institutions - not a retreat from them; better global governance - not a chaotic free-for-all,” he said.Calling on nations to stand united and act in solidarity in the hour of the global crisis, Guterres said, “when countries go in their own direction, the virus goes in every direction.” He also urged countries to be guided by science and tethered to reality in combating this pandemic.The UN chief said that in order to truly reduce fragilities and risks, and to more effectively solve shared problems, “we need a corresponding New Global Deal at the international level.” He said this New Global Deal is about ensuring that the global political and economic systems deliver on critical global public goods, as he noted with concern that today that is simply not happening.“We have huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks. To close these gaps, we need to ensure that power, wealth and opportunities are broadly and fairly shared,” he said.He underlined that the New Global Deal must address historical injustices in global power structures.Guterres also strongly asserted that special focus has to be put on women and girls as the world strives to recover from the pandemic and build back better.He said women do most of the unpaid care work generated by the pandemic and women have fewer economic resources to fall back on, because their wages are lower, and they have less access to benefits.The UN chief warned that unless “we act now, gender equality could be set back by decades.” He called on nations to stamp out the horrifying increase in violence against women and girls during the pandemic, from domestic violence to sexual abuse, online harassment and femicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-slams-countries-for-making-covid-19-vaccination-side-deals-for-their-own-population/story-z0N5JD3053hvSx8fDulZfN.html
22-09-2020||World||No guarantee any Covid-19 vaccine in development will work, says WHO chief||World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said that the health organisation has no guarantee whether any vaccine in development for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will work.“We have no guarantee that any vaccine in development will work.The more candidates we test, the higher the chance we will have for a safe and efficacious vaccine,” the WHO chief said during a virtual press briefing.He said that almost 200 vaccine candidates are being developed to tackle the disease. “Almost 200 vaccine for Covid-19 are currently in clinical and preclinical testing. The history of vaccine development tells us some will fail and some will succeed,” Tedros added.The WHO, in coordination with global vaccine alliance group Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), has created a mechanism to enable equal distribution of any Covid vaccines among countries in the future .“The Covax facility enables governments to spread their reach of vaccine development and ensure their population can have early access to effective vaccines. Even more importantly, the Covax facility is the mechanism that will enable a globally coordinated roll out for the greatest possible impact,” the health organisation chief said. ‘Race for vaccine a collaboration, not a contest’Reminding the countries that the race to find a cure for Covid-19 is a collaboration and not a competition, Ghebreyesus said, “The Covax facility will help bring the pandemic under control, save lives and escalate the economic recovery, and ensure that the race for Covid-19 vaccine is a collaboration, not a contest.”‘Not charity’As the countries move ahead in their quest to find a vaccine for coronavirus, the WHO chief urged nations to work together, pointing out that it was in every country’s best interest to find vaccine for Covid-19.“This is not charity. It is in every country’s best interest. We sink or we swim together. The fastest route to end the pandemic and accelerating the global economic recovery is to ensure some people are vaccinate in all countries, not all people in some countries,” the chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-guarantee-any-covid-19-vaccine-in-development-will-work-says-who-chief/story-1vXtwsHNzKmYLpBF2DWckK.html
22-09-2020||World||US, China clash over Covid, trade, human rights at UNGA||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday asked the United Nations to hold China “accountable” for the Covid-19 pandemic, describing it as the “China virus”, and China hit back urging nations to reject any attempt to politicise the health crisis or stigmatise it and said the world must fight it together.“The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions,” Trump said in a pre-recorded address to the UN General Assembly, as the world body is marking 75 years of its founding.The US president accused China of unleashing “this plague” on the world and then concealing early evidence that the deadly pathogen can be transmitted human-to-human and by asymptomatic people.“In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world,” Trump said.“China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes.”Trump’s attack on China at the UN followed a narrative that he has often used domestically to fend off criticism of his own handling of the worst public health crisis the country has faced in 100 years, with the toll infections crossing 200,000 on Tuesday.The pandemic, which has killed 965,000 and infected more than 31 millions worldwide, has overshadowed the UN meetings this year. Leaders are participating virtually, through pre-recorded speeches, with introductions from their respective representatives. In an unmistakable reference to the US-China trade war, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier talked about the need to prevent a “new cold war”.  Nevertheless, the US and China brought their battle to the General Assembly undeterred. After slamming China over the Covid-19 pandemic, the US president attacked China over environment and trade.Also read | Hold China accountable for unleashing Covid-19 plague onto world: Trump at UNGA“Every year China dumps millions and millions of tonnes of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries’ waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world,” he said, adding, “China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has, and it’s rising fast.”President Trump went on to accuse China of “trade abuses” and claimed credit for standing up to it, triggering a trade war that soon engulfed the whole world. While he won some minor concessions from China in an interim deal, the larger issues that he had cited as his reasons remain unresolved.The American leader told the United Nations that if it intended to be effective, it “must focus on the real problems of the world”: terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labour, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.China first hit back against Trump briefly in remarks by its ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun. He said, while introducing President Xi Jinping, that China rejects “baseless accusation” and opposes “political virus”.President Xi followed up with a direct rebuke of Trump’s pre-recorded speech with his own.Also read | Don’t want to fight hot or cold war with any country: What Xi Jinping said at UNGA“Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get through this together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization,” Xi said, adding, “Any attempt of politicising the issue or stigmatisation must be rejected.” The Chinese president called for the world to combat the health crisis unitedly. “We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,” Xi said in his pre-recorded speech.Xi went on to propose four measures for the world to combat the crisis: put people and life first, enhance solidarity, adopt comprehensive and long-term control measures, and, finally, show concern for and accommodate the need of developing countries, especially African countries, according Xinhua news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-clash-over-covid-trade-human-rights-at-unga/story-IyXfQyRNoMilYKv3aKxSxK.html

We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy-- the China virus, which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries,” he said.He further said, “As we pursue a bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world-- China. In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China & infect the world.”He also slammed the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for falsely declaring that there is no evidence of human to human transmission of coronavirus.“Chinese government and WHO, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human to human transmission. Later they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease. UN must hold China accountable for their actions,” he said.On the US’ contribution amid the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, “In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilisation since the Second World War. We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe.”Speaking on the environment, the US President said, “Every year China dumps millions and millions of tonnes of plastic and trash into the oceans over other country’s waters destroying vast swathes of coral reef and emitting more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world.”“China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has, and it’s rising fast. By contrast, after I withdrew from the one sided Paris Climate accord, last year America reduces carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement. Those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s ramping pollution, are not interested in the environment,” he said.Trump urged the United Nations to be an effective organisation by focusing on the real problems of the world including terrorism, oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human sex trafficking, religious persecution and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/75-years-after-world-war-ii-world-is-again-engaged-in-a-great-global-struggle-donald-trump-at-unga/story-1DJFmU0pz0IsXDDl1lDcAM.html

We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,” Xi said in a pre-recorded video statement to the annual gathering of world leaders, conducted virtually this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China hit boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing’s bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington’s traditional leadership.The coronavirus emerged in China late last year and Washington accuses Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the outbreak. China denies the U.S. assertions.In what appeared to be a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump, though both leaders’ speeches were pre-recorded, Xi called for a global response to the virus and giving the World Health Organization a leading role.Trump has announced plans for the United States to leave the Geneva-based WHO, accusing the agency of being a puppet of China, a claim the WHO denied.“Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get through this together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization,” Xi said. “Any attempt of politicizing the issue or stigmatization must be rejected.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 193-member General Assembly earlier on Tuesday that everything must be done to avoid a new Cold War, warning that “we are moving in a very dangerous direction.”“Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture,” he said. “A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geo-strategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-un-china-s-xi-jinping-says-no-intention-to-fight-a-cold-war-or-hot-one-with-any-country/story-V7B7OzhcdqTFrIV3v4KVGP.html

22-09-2020||World||Sign-up delays for global Covid-19 vaccine plan are procedural: WHO||More countries will sign up to a global vaccination plan and some of the delays were due to procedural issues rather than doubts about the scheme, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Tuesday. The Geneva-based body has said that 156 nations have joined the so-called COVAX plan to deliver some 2 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of next year but big countries such as China, Russia and the United States are missing.About 64 wealthy nations have signed up and more are expected despite missing an official deadline. However, some of those supporting the plan such as France are reluctant to use it to secure vaccines and have instead struck separate supply deals. “What we’ve announced is the beginning. It’s going to continue,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, calling the number of sign-ups to date “brilliant”. “We all need to be in this together in order to finish this pandemic.”She declined to comment on specific countries and said discussions were ongoing.Asked to elaborate on delays to joining, Harris said some were due to paperwork and the need for parliamentary approval. Other countries, however, appear to have no intention of signing up.A Russian government source told Reuters there was no need for his country to take part in the programme since it was developing and producing its own vaccine.“Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that our vaccine will in future be offered to participants of COVAX,” the source said.The Russian health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.“China will continue to work with WHO, Gavi and relevant countries on vaccine development,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing on Tuesday.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, asked whether he knew why China had not yet joined the COVAX scheme, told Reuters he hoped China and the other 37 countries that have not signed up would still do so.“They may have their own reasons to take some time until they decide,” Tedros said in Oslo after receiving an award for fostering international cooperation from a Norwegian association.“I am not really sure what is preventing them from joining. But we hope they will join,” he added via video link.In Geneva, at the briefing, Harris said the WHO would make public a WHO internal app giving information on the pandemic which would include comprehensive global and regional overviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sign-up-delays-for-global-covid-19-vaccine-plan-are-procedural-who/story-tpM2R5vUy9rSBkgm4K0pwO.html
22-09-2020||World||Chinese court sends Xi critic and former tycoon to 18 years in jail||A court in China on Tuesday sentenced a former real estate tycoon and vocal critic of President Xi Jinping to 18 years in prison for corruption. “Former property mogul Ren Zhiqiang was sentenced to 18 years and fined 4.2 million yuan ($620,000) for corruption, bribery, embezzlement of public funds, and abuse of power as state-owned company personnel,” state media quoted a Beijing court as ruling on Tuesday.Ren, 69, reportedly confessed “voluntarily” to all charges and will not appeal against the decision.The former chairperson of Huayuan Properties, a real estate development company, was detained in March after writing an essay criticising China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Ren did not name Xi in the essay but it was widely believed the critique was about the powerful Chinese leader; Ren even used the word “clown” in his essay. In July, Ren was expelled from the Communist Party of China for “seriously” violating the “party’s political, organisational, integrity, work and life disciplines”.Ren had a massive following on China’s social media and was known as “cannon” for his outspoken and controversial views.In early 2016, Ren was banned from Chinese social media after he criticised a much-publicised Xi speech on how the media should serve the CPC.According to Chinese state media, Ren also suggested controversial ideas like the “…poor young migrant workers who cannot afford apartments in cities should return to the countryside.”According to report and translation of his March essay, Ren is said to have written: He did not directly refer to Mr Xi in his essay, but according to a report in the China Digital Times, said: “I too am curiously and conscientiously studying [Xi’s teleconferenced February 23] speech, but what I saw in it was the complete opposite of the ‘importance’ reported by all types of media and online.”“I saw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his “new clothes,” but a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing being emperor.” “I was unable to cheer for the February 23 speech, because in it I saw a bigger crisis, one that ferments even faster in [the context of] that speech and the cheers it won. When shameless and ignorant people attempt to resign themselves to the stupidity of the great leader, society becomes a mob that is hard to develop and sustain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-sends-xi-critic-and-former-tycoon-to-18-years-in-jail/story-WFxFi44qiURo25uCm06LsM.html

Also on deck are President Xi Jinping of China, where the virus originated, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which has raised international eyebrows with its rapid vaccine development.After Monday’s introductory session marking the UN’s 75th anniversary, the meeting’s central event — speeches from each of its 193 member nations — start Tuesday. They traditionally serve as a platform for countries to tout accomplishments, seek support, stoke rivalries and express views on global priorities.This year, the platform is online, and there is a pressing new priority in the pandemic that has killed over 960,000 people worldwide.“When we met in New York a year ago, no one could have imagined that 2020 would arrange such a powerful crash test for our world,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remarked in his video speech for Monday’s anniversary commemoration.By custom, Brazil speaks first and the US second as the host country in the annual meeting’s “general debate,” which is generally less a dialogue than a series of declarations.The coronavirus has inflicted heavy tolls on both countries, close to 200,000 people in the US and over 136,000 in Brazil, according to statistics collected by Johns Hopkins University.Both Bolsonaro and Trump have been at odds, at least at times, with governors and health experts over the pandemic and have emphasized the economic consequences of shutdowns.Both also are contending with plenty of other issues that command world attention, including Bolsonaro’s plans to develop the Amazon and Trump’s 2018 decision to pull the US out of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Washington took a further step this weekend with a unilateral, and disputed, declaration that all U.N. penalties eased under the 2015 nuclear deal had been restored, setting up a likely showdown at the assembly — where Iran’s speech is also scheduled Tuesday.So is Turkey’s, a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the UN has “flunked during the pandemic.” The virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, late last year. After building field hospitals and imposing a draconian 76-day lockdown to battle the virus there, China has said of late that it is seeing relatively few cases, mostly among people arriving from other countries. China, the world’s most populous nation, has reported over 4,700 deaths.Russia, where the death toll is over 19,000, last month became the first country to approve a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus. Russian President Vladimir Putin trumpeted the development, saying one of his adult daughters had already been inoculated. But international health experts have expressed caution about the vaccine’s effectiveness and safety because of the small study sample and other limitations.A record number of heads of states and governments are due to speak at the virtual meeting, rather than sending ministers or diplomats. That’s a good thing, “but the idea that prime ministers and presidents are going to be sitting at home with a bucket of popcorn watching each other’s televised speeches is a bit silly,” said Richard Gowan, who oversees UN issues for Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.Still, German UN Ambassador Christoph Heusgen sees the assembly as a chance for a global meeting of minds when it’s needed more than ever.“Even in a digital format, UNGA-75 is an opportunity — especially in the face of international conflicts and dramatic challenges such as climate change or COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-powers-take-the-stage-virtually-at-un-debate/story-7QFpgmIqBgnqHxUDGAq5WK.html
22-09-2020||World||UK PM launches new Covid restrictions that may last six months||Rattled by a surge of new Covid-19 cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday outlined more restrictions short of a full lockdown that would perhaps last for six months, insisting that his government is “acting on the principle of a stitch in time saves nine.”Presenting new data in the House of Commons, Johnson said that in the last fortnight, hospital admissions in England had more than doubled, adding that new cases are growing fastest among those aged 20-29. The cumulative figure of cases in the UK on Tuesday crossed 4 lakhs, with nearly 42,000 deaths based on incidence in hospitals and care homes.The government, Johnson said, would use the military, if need be, to enforce the new restrictions and fines of up to 10,000 pounds on those breaching self-isolation. It also had the “right to deploy greater firepower” if things did not improve.“Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act. And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter,” he said.The curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres, which has further unnerved the industry struggling to balance the books in recent months. New fines of up to 10,000 pounds and compulsory wearing of masks are among the new steps.Another key advice was to ‘work from home’, a reversal of the recent ‘back to work’ advice when new cases were in the hundreds. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.The new advice to last “perhaps six months” also means Johnson has dropped his earlier optimism of a return to normal by Christmas. He went on to caution people against complacency, highlighting the range of new fines to those who breach self-isolation or restrictions.On Monday evening, the Joint Biosecurity Centre of the British government raised the national Covid-19 alert level from three to four, which means the epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is “high or rising exponentially”.The alert level was reduced from level four to three on June 19. The centre has five alert levels; the highest refers to a stage of outbreak in which there is a risk of health services being overwhelmed.Johnson said: “We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave, with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing”.“So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-launches-new-covid-restrictions-that-may-last-six-months/story-i1kuL0BHx8ElDncbFpl14L.html
22-09-2020||World||Global MPs’ group seeks UN probe into Xinjiang-style forced labour in Tibet||A global group of parliamentarians on Tuesday asked the United Nations to install a special rapporteur to investigate reports of ethnic persecution by China after evidence emerged of forced labour in Tibet.Releasing a report on Xinjiang-style forced labour in Tibet by academic Adrian Zenz, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China said governments should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible.The report from the Jamestown Foundation said Tibet has since last year introduced policies promoting “the systematic, centralised, and large-scale training and transfer of ‘rural surplus labourers’” to other parts of Tibet and other regions. More than half a million labourers went through the programme in the first seven months of this year, according to the report. The 58 MPs from 16 parliaments said in a statement that governments should urgently revise their risk advice to their companies currently sourcing from areas affected by Tibetan and other Chinese forced labour schemes “to keep goods and services purchased in our respective jurisdictions from being tainted by Tibetan forced labour.”The 17 British MPs among signatories include former leader of the Conservative party, Iain Duncan-Smith, and senior leader David Davis. Other signatories include those from the US, Australia, Canada, European Union, Italy, Germany, France, New Zealand and Switzerland.Zenz’s report raises concerns about a large-scale mandatory ‘vocational training’ programme, enlisting over 500,000 labourers in the region, together with accounts of enforced indoctrination, intrusive surveillance, military-style enforcement, and harsh punishments for those who fail to meet labour transfer quotas, the MPs noted. “The programme appears disturbingly reminiscent of coercive vocational training and mass labour transfers imposed by the Chinese authorities in the Uighur region,” they said.“We stand united in unequivocal condemnation of these practices and call upon the Chinese government to halt these atrocities immediately”, the statement added.They said the report is the latest in a mounting body of evidence documenting “egregious human rights abuses in Tibet” where the situation surrounding religious freedoms, political persecution and cultural assimilation of the indigenous Tibetan people has been deteriorating for decades.“Following on from the global outcry in the wake of revelations of ‘vocational training’ programmes in the Uighur region, this report shows that the current leadership of the People’s Republic of China remains undeterred in its refusal to respect basic human rights standards, and unswayed by criticism from the international community, including from the United Nations, in which China claims a leading role”, the statement said.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-mps-group-seeks-un-probe-into-xinjiang-style-forced-labour-in-tibet/story-ynxO1YjAWeTnIUIdJYtFgN.html

22-09-2020||World||Nepal halts distribution of new text book with revised map incorporating Indian areas: Report||Nepal has stopped the distribution of a new text book that includes the country’s revised political map showing three strategically-important Indian areas as part of its territory, saying there were a number of factual errors in it, according to a media report on Tuesday. India has already termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal after its Parliament unanimously approved the new political map of the country featuring Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belongs to it. A Cabinet meeting on Tuesday instructed the ministry of Education not to distribute and print any more copies of the text book meant for class IXth to XIIth as there were some reservations from the ministry of Land Management and Cooperatives and the ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Kathmandu Post reported. “The ministry of Education does not have the authority to change Nepal’s geographical area and there are faults in the book,” said spokesperson for the ministry of Land Reform and Cooperatives Janak Raj Joshi. There are errors in the book prepared by the ministry of Education on a subject it has no expertise, he said, adding that the higher authorities have been asked to take corrective measures. The concerned body of the Nepal government is yet to officially declare the revised geographical area of the country. “The Department of Survey, which is the official agency that declares the total area of the country, however, hasn’t made any decision on the area,” Joshi said. Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel on September 15 released the 110-page book titled, Self Study Material on Nepal’s Territory and Border which dwells around historical facts about the country’s territory and its border dispute mainly with India. The book states Nepal’s new area to be 147,641.28 square kilometers including the 460.28 sq km area of the Kalapani area which was included in Nepal’s political map on May 20 by the Cabinet. Minister for Education Pokharel has written a six-page preface for the book in which he has mentioned about Nepal’s border disputes and other related issues. He said that he had launched a campaign to protect the Nepalese territory, including the areas of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. However, Pokharel told The Kathmandu Post that the distribution of the book has been halted for now. After Nepal’s Parliament approved the revised political map comprising Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas, the Cabinet had endorsed the new map and decided to use it in government offices and print school text books with the new map. Nepal in May released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the three strategically important areas in Uttarakhand, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019. Following the endorsement of the new map by the Nepal Cabinet, then government spokesperson and Finance Minister Yuvaraj Khatiwada told the media that the government had decided to update the schedule of the Constitution and school curriculum incorporating the new political map. India in its response said that it had already made its position clear on it. “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” the ministry of External Affairs had said. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-halts-distribution-of-new-text-book-with-revised-map-incorporating-indian-areas-report/story-sCeF9eGFp4YniwydPGF9tJ.html

Some 14,000 disinfected polling stations were set up across the country, where people voted after having their hands sanitised and temperatures checked at a safe distance from each other.By April, South Korea had begun to successfully deal with the pandemic without major disruptions through an extensive testing and contact tracing campaign. This was reflected in the voter turnout, which at 66.2% was the highest since 1992. Even around 2,800 Covid-19 patients were allowed to vote by mail or at special booths as 30 million people overall cast their ballots.Also Read: Seoul schools resume in-person classes as South Korea coronavirus cases dipSouth Korea’s National Election Commission (NEC) officials shared the success story at a webinar that the Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB) held on Monday. The Election Commission of India (ECI) presided over the event.The South Korean officials explained how they implemented a three-phase voting protocol for Covid-19 patients under quarantine and ensured home voting for those, who had tested positive for the disease in the run-up to the polls.The webinar was held ahead of the elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly due in November when around 70 million voters are expected to vote. The Bihar polls will be the first major election since the pandemic hit India. There have been polls to Rajya Sabha and legislative council seats, but they involved a limited number of voters. The ECI is planning to allow physical rallies, but with a limited public presence. Online filing of nomination forms is also expected along with limited door-to-door campaigning and a reduced number of people at polling booths and counting halls.Also Read: Taiwan president says has no plans to talk to Japan’s new PMChief election commissioner Sunil Arora, election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar, and ECI secretary-general Umesh Sinha spoke at the webinar, where a presentation was also made about the preparedness for the Bihar polls. “The measures taken to ensure the safety of the voters during the Rajya Sabha elections were also highlighted. There is a global consensus that the safety of the voter has to be ensured. Voters should feel safe while voting. This is the basic tenet of democracy,” said a person who attended the webinar.Officials emphasised the importance of communication as the participants from 45 countries and several international election bodies shared relevant learning outcomes and likely solutions for electoral processes amid the pandemic.According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, at least 69 countries and territories across the globe have postponed national and sub-national elections due to the pandemic until August 11. At least 53 countries and territories have decided to hold national or sub-national elections as originally planned despite concerns related to Covid-19. Officials from Taiwan’s Central Election Commission, which has held polls as scheduled, said they formulated the preventive measures during by-elections in February.Taiwanese authorities released videos to create awareness about the virus, its prevention and also set up a webpage to ensure transparency about the polling process.Bangladeshi officials, who have conducted three parliamentary by-elections with a 65% voter turnout, shared alternative mechanisms of campaigning. Bangladesh Election Commission encouraged candidates to use social media, television, radio, newspapers, banners for canvassing instead of physical campaigning.Indonesia, which is likely to hold local body elections on December 9 with an electorate of 270 million, has made additional budgetary allocations for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/home-voting-ppe-suits-how-south-korea-taiwan-held-polls-during-pandemic/story-hXH5w95bg6PD0fb7e4EAvK.html
22-09-2020||World||UK’s National Trust acknowledges colonial links to its properties||Large country houses in UK built with money looted or fortunes earned in colonial India are the focus of a new report by the National Trust, which owns and manages hundreds of historic houses, forts, castles and sylvan public spaces. At least 50 such properties in England and Wales are linked to the East India Company, whose employees earned fortunes in India and returned home to build large houses and live in splendour. Such returning wealthy individuals were called ‘nabobs’, who also wielded political power in Westminster in the 18th and 19th centuries.The trust has identified 93 properties linked to slavery and colonialism during the British Empire. The research is part of historical reviews initiated by several government departments and organisations in the wake of the Black Lives Matter campaign.The National Trust’s properties are a popular tourist attraction, with tens of thousands of domestic and international visitors flocking its castles, forts, archaeological and industrial monuments and parks, but this is the first time it has acknowledged their links to slavery and colonialism.Among the India-linked properties are two associated with Robert Clive, the first governor of Bengal presidency: his house in Claremont, Sussex, purchased from wealth he made in India and the Powis Castle in Wales, which has a large collection of Indian items.Writes Lucy Porten of the National Trust: “At Claremont, purchased with the wealth he (Clive) had made in India, he built a new house, intended to be his main residence and to display the treasures he had amassed. In the early 1770s, Clive had begun acquiring Old Master pictures, which were intended for the Great Room at Claremont”. “At the time of his death, the house, unfinished and unfurnished, was a repository for his various collections, including that of ‘Indian Curiosities’ (still unpacked at that point). Robert’s son, Edward (1754–1839), would become 1st Earl of Powis, following his marriage to Lady Henrietta Herbert (1758–1830) in 1784, and Governor of Madras in 1798”. “Their amalgamated collections, containing some 1,000 objects from about 1600 to the 1830s, are now displayed at Powis Castle and include ivories, textiles, statues of Hindu gods, ornamental silver and gold, weapons and ceremonial armour from India and East Asia.”Other India-linked properties include Lord Curzon’s Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire; former governor of Madras Ronald d’Arcy Fife’s Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire; the home of Francis Syke (one of the ‘nabobs’), Basildon Park, Berkshire; and Rudyard Kipling’s home Bateman’s in east Sussex. The trust said the research is part of its commitment to ensuring links to colonialism and historic slavery are properly represented, shared and interpreted as part of a broader narrative at relevant places it owns and manages. Tarnya Cooper, the trust’s curatorial and collections director, said: “The buildings in the care of the National Trust reflect many different periods and a range of British and global histories- social, industrial, political and cultural.” “A significant number of those in our care have links to the colonisation of different parts of the world, and some to historic slavery. Colonialism and slavery were central to the national economy from the 17th to the 19th centuries”. One of the largest landowners in Britain, the National Trust was founded in 1895. It acquired its holdings by various means, including gifts from former owners. Engaged in heritage conservation, its work is underpinned by the National Trust Act of 1907.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-country-houses-properties-linked-to-colonial-india-under-new-scrutiny/story-2tvOAb06FXp9U0cxoqII5N.html
22-09-2020||World||China sharply expands mass labor program in Tibet||China is pushing growing numbers of Tibetan rural laborers off the land and into recently built military-style training centers where they are turned into factory workers, mirroring a program in the western Xinjiang region that rights groups have branded coercive labor.Beijing has set quotas for the mass transfer of rural laborers within Tibet and to other parts of China, according to over a hundred state media reports, policy documents from government bureaus in Tibet and procurement requests released between 2016-2020 and reviewed by Reuters. The quota effort marks a rapid expansion of an initiative designed to provide loyal workers for Chinese industry.A notice posted to the website of Tibet’s regional government website last month said over half a million people were trained as part of the project in the first seven months of 2020 - around 15% of the region’s population. Of this total, almost 50,000 have been transferred into jobs within Tibet, and several thousand have been sent to other parts of China. Many end up in low paid work, including textile manufacturing, construction and agriculture.“This is now, in my opinion, the strongest, most clear and targeted attack on traditional Tibetan livelihoods that we have seen almost since the Cultural Revolution” of 1966 to 1976, said Adrian Zenz, an independent Tibet and Xinjiang researcher, who compiled the core findings about the program. These are detailed in a report released this week by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based institute that focuses on policy issues of strategic importance to the U.S. “It’s a coercive lifestyle change from nomadism and farming to wage labor.”Reuters corroborated Zenz’s findings and found additional policy documents, company reports, procurement filings and state media reports that describe the program.In a statement to Reuters, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly denied the involvement of forced labor, and said China is a country with rule of law and that workers are voluntary and properly compensated.“What these people with ulterior motives are calling ‘forced labor’ simply does not exist. We hope the international community will distinguish right from wrong, respect facts, and not be fooled by lies,” it said.Moving surplus rural labor into industry is a key part of China’s drive to boost the economy and reduce poverty. But in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet, with large ethnic populations and a history of unrest, rights groups say the programs include an outsized emphasis on ideological training. And the government quotas and military-style management, they say, suggest the transfers have coercive elements.China seized control of Tibet after Chinese troops entered the region in 1950, in what Beijing calls a “peaceful liberation.” Tibet has since become one of the most restricted and sensitive areas in the country.The Tibetan program is expanding as international pressure is growing over similar projects in Xinjiang, some of which have been linked to mass detention centers. A United Nations report has estimated that around one million people in Xinjiang, mostly ethnic Uighurs, were detained in camps and subjected to ideological education. China initially denied the existence of the camps, but has since said they are vocational and education centers, and that all the people have “graduated.”Reuters was unable to ascertain the conditions of the transferred Tibetan workers. Foreign journalists are not permitted to enter the region, and other foreign citizens are only permitted on government-approved tours.In recent years, Xinjiang and Tibet have been the target of harsh policies in pursuit of what Chinese authorities call “stability maintenance.” These policies are broadly aimed at quelling dissent, unrest or separatism and include restricting the travel of ethnic citizens to other parts of China and abroad, and tightening control over religious activities.In August, President Xi Jinping said China will again step up efforts against separatism in Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up around 90% of the population, according to census data. Critics, spearheaded by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, accuse the Chinese authorities of carrying out “cultural genocide” in the region. The 85-year-old Nobel Laureate has been based in Dharamsala, India, since he fled China in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese authorities.Eliminate ‘lazy people’While there has been some evidence of military-style training and labor transfers in Tibet in the past, this new, enlarged program represents the first on a mass scale and the first to openly set quotas for transfers outside the region.A key element, described in multiple regional policy documents, involves sending officials into villages and townships to gather data on rural laborers and conduct education activities, aimed at building loyalty.State media described one such operation in villages near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Officials carried out over a thousand anti-separatism education sessions, according to the state media report, “allowing the people of all ethnic groups to feel the care and concern of the Party Central Committee,” referring to China’s ruling Communist Party.The report said the sessions included songs, dances and sketches in “easy to understand language.” Such “education” work took place prior to the rollout of the wider transfers this year.The model is similar to Xinjiang, and researchers say a key link between the two is the former Tibet Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who took over the same post in Xinjiang in 2016 and spearheaded the development of Xinjiang’s camp system. The Xinjiang government, where Chen remains Party boss, did not respond to a request for comment.“In Tibet, he was doing a slightly lower level, under the radar, version of what was implemented in Xinjiang,” said Allen Carlson, Associate Professor in Cornell University’s Government Department.Around 70% of Tibet’s population is classified as rural, according to 2018 figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics. This includes a large proportion of subsistence farmers, posing a challenge for China’s poverty alleviation program, which measures its success on levels of basic income. China has pledged to eradicate rural poverty in the country by the end of 2020.“In order to cope with the increasing downward economic pressure on the employment income of rural workers, we will now increase the intensity of precision skills training ... and carry out organized and large-scale transfer of employment across provinces, regions and cities,” said a working plan released by Tibet’s Human Resources and Social Security Department in July. The plan included 2020 quotas for the program in different areas.Some of the policy documents and state media reports reviewed by Reuters make reference to unspecified punishments for officials who fail to meet their quotas. One prefecture level implementation plan called for “strict reward and punishment measures” for officials.As in Xinjiang, private intermediaries, such as agents and companies, that organize transfers can receive subsidies set at 500 yuan ($74) for each laborer moved out of the region and 300 yuan ($44) for those placed within Tibet, according to regional and prefecture level notices.Officials have previously said that labor transfer programs in other parts of China are voluntary, and many of the Tibetan government documents also mention mechanisms to ensure laborers’ rights, but they don’t provide details. Advocates, rights groups and researchers say it’s unlikely laborers are able to decline work placements, though they acknowledge that some may be voluntary.“These recent announcements dramatically and dangerously expand these programs, including ‘thought training’ with the government’s coordination, and represent a dangerous escalation,” said Matteo Mecacci, president of U.S. based advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet.The government documents reviewed by Reuters put a strong emphasis on ideological education to correct the “thinking concepts” of laborers. “There is the assertion that minorities are low in discipline, that their minds must be changed, that they must be convinced to participate,” said Zenz, the Tibet-Xinjiang researcher based in Minnesota.One policy document, posted on the website of the Nagqu City government in Tibet’s east in December 2018, reveals early goals for the plan and sheds light on the approach. It describes how officials visited villages to collect data on 57,800 laborers. Their aim was to tackle “can’t do, don’t want to do and don’t dare to do” attitudes toward work, the document says. It calls for unspecified measures to “effectively eliminate ‘lazy people.’“A report released in January by the Tibetan arm of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a high-profile advisory body to the government, describes internal discussions on strategies to tackle the “mental poverty” of rural laborers, including sending teams of officials into villages to carry out education and “guide the masses to create a happy life with their hardworking hands.”Military drills and uniformsRural workers who are moved into vocational training centers receive ideological education - what China calls “military-style” training - according to multiple Tibetan regional and district-level policy documents describing the program in late 2019 and 2020. The training emphasises strict discipline, and participants are required to perform military drills and dress in uniforms.It is not clear what proportion of participants in the labor transfer program undergo such military-style training. But policy documents from Ngari, Xigatze and Shannan, three districts which account for around a third of Tibet’s population, call for the “vigorous promotion of military-style training.” Region-wide policy notices also make reference to this training method.Small-scale versions of similar military-style training initiatives have existed in the region for over a decade, but construction of new facilities increased sharply in 2016, and recent policy documents call for more investment in such sites. A review of satellite imagery and documents relating to over a dozen facilities in different districts in Tibet shows that some are built near to or within existing vocational centers.The policy documents describe a teaching program that combines skills education, legal education and “gratitude education,” designed to boost loyalty to the Party.James Leibold, professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who specializes in Tibet and Xinjiang, says there are different levels of military-style training, with some less restrictive than others, but that there is a focus on conformity.“Tibetans are seen as lazy, backward, slow or dirty, and so what they want to do is to get them marching to the same beat... That’s a big part of this type of military-style education.”In eastern Tibet’s Chamdo district, where some of the earliest military-style training programs emerged, state media images from 2016 show laborers lining up in drill formation in military fatigues. In images published by state media in July this year, waitresses in military clothing are seen training at a vocational facility in the same district. Pictures posted online from the “Chamdo Golden Sunshine Vocational Training School” show rows of basic white shed-like accommodation with blue roofs. In one image, banners hanging on the wall behind a row of graduates say the labor transfer project is overseen by the local Human Resources and Social Security Department.The vocational skills learned by trainees include textiles, construction, agriculture and ethnic handicrafts. One vocational center describes elements of training including “Mandarin language, legal training and political education.” A separate regional policy document says the goal is to “gradually realize the transition from ‘I must work’ to ‘I want to work.’“Regional and prefecture level policy documents place an emphasis on training batches of workers for specific companies or projects. Rights groups say this on-demand approach increases the likelihood that the programs are coercive.Supply ChainWorkers transferred under the programs can be difficult to trace, particularly those sent to other parts of China. In similar mass transfers of Uighur people from Xinjiang, workers were discovered in the supply chains of 83 global brands, according to a report released by the The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).Researchers and rights groups say transfers from these regions pose a challenge because without access they can’t assess whether the practice constitutes forced labor, and transferred workers often work alongside non-transferred counterparts.Tibetan state media reports in July say that in 2020 some of the workers transferred outside of Tibet were sent to construction projects in Qinghai and Sichuan. Others transferred within Tibet were trained in textiles, security and agricultural production work.Regional Tibetan government policy notices and prefecture implementation plans provide local government offices with quotas for 2020, including for Tibetan workers sent to other parts of China. Larger districts are expected to supply more workers to other areas of the country - 1,000 from the Tibetan capital Lhasa, 1,400 from Xigaze, and 800 from Shannan.Reuters reviewed policy notices put out by Tibet and a dozen other provinces that have accepted Tibetan laborers. These documents reveal that workers are often moved in groups and stay in collective accommodation.Local government documents inside Tibet and in three other provinces say workers remain in centralised accommodation after they are transferred, separated from other workers and under supervision. One state media document, describing a transfer within the region, referred to it as a “point to point ‘nanny’ service.”The Tibetan Human Resources and Social Security Department noted in July that people are grouped into teams of 10 to 30.

Its purity in Europe is increasing and more people are going into treatment, though cocaine seizures by authorities reached a record 181 metric tons in 2018, the agency said.Last year witnessed an increase in synthetic drug production on the continent, the appearance of new synthetic opioids and ecstasy tablets containing high levels of MDMA, the Lisbon, Portugal-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction said in its annual report.The Covid-19 pandemic doesn’t appear to have had any significant impact on EU drug production, the agency said, though restrictions on movement have made drug delivery methods to consumers more unpredictable.The agency noted that some drug-taking behaviour, such as sharing cannabis joints or crack pipes, carries a high risk of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-finds-abundant-supply-of-illicit-drugs-in-european-union/story-eBlReQFnUlrOjRVY1JofTO.html

The clear drop in new deaths in the region were driven mainly by decreases in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Bolivia.The United States, which is the world’s worst-hit country, and Brazil, the second-worst hit, continued to report the highest number of deaths, each reporting over 5,000 new deaths in the past week.Europe, some of which is experiencing a second wave of infections, meanwhile saw its new death count shoot up to over 4,000 for the seven-day period, a 27-percent-hike compared to a week earlier.In Europe, France, Russia, Spain and Britain reported the highest number of new cases in the past week, while Hungary and Denmark reported the highest relative increase in deaths. Britain continues to count the highest number of cumulative deaths on the continent at nearly 42,000 since the beginning of the pandemic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-sees-record-weekly-number-of-covid-19-cases-deaths-down-who/story-Hs7Axvqy1jiaMjX33DBiLI.html

Late-stage trials, involving at least 40,000 people, are ongoing. Russia approves first Covid-19 prescription drug for sale in pharmaciesRussia has approved R-Pharm’s Coronavir treatment for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections and the antiviral drug could be rolled out to pharmacies in the country as soon as next week, the company said on Friday.Coronavir’s approval as a prescription drug follows the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May. Both are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for viral treatments.R-Pharm’s announcement is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race against the virus. It is already exporting its Covid-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine. R-Pharm said it received approval for Coronavir after Phase III clinical trials involving 168 patients with Covid-19. The drug was first approved for in-hospital use to treat Covid-19 in July, a government register showed. Coronavir’s trial was comparatively small. The European health regulator on Friday endorsed the use of the steroid dexamethasone in the treatment of Covid-19 patients after a study by UK researchers on several thousand patients.R-Pharm has started talks with pharmacies about orders, the company’s spokeswoman said, with Coronavir supplies expected to be rolled out in the near future, possibly as soon as next week. Coronavir is made at R-Pharm’s facility in Yaroslavl, about 300 km (186 miles) northeast of Moscow. Avifavir has been available in hospitals since June but has yet to be supplied to pharmacies. Both are based on the active ingredient favipiravir, which is also the key component in Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s antiviral drug Avigan, approved in Japan as an emergency influenza treatment in 2014.Trials to test it against Covid-19 are ongoing around the world. Results of a Japanese study in July were inconclusive.It is produced by various Indian generic drugmakers including Lupin, Cipla and Dr Reddy’s for use against Covid-19 in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-register-second-covid-19-vaccine-by-october-15/story-FhEHjCSmIrnC4DA9WAvZnM.html

22-09-2020||World||As rich nations struggle, Africa’s coronavirus response is praised||At a lecture to peers this month, John Nkengasong showed images that once dogged Africa, with a magazine cover declaring it “The Hopeless Continent.” Then he quoted Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah: “It is clear that we must find an African solution to our problems, and that this can only be found in African unity.”The coronavirus pandemic has fractured global relationships. But as director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nkengasong has helped to steer Africa’s 54 countries into an alliance praised as responding better than some richer countries, including the United States.A former US CDC official, he modeled Africa’s version after his ex-employer. Nkengasong is pained to see the US agency struggle. In an interview with The Associated Press, he didn’t name U.S President Donald Trump but cited “factors we all know.”While the US nears 200,000 Covid-19 deaths and the world approaches 1 million, Africa’s surge has been leveling off. Its 1.4 million confirmed cases are far from the horrors predicted. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 34,000 deaths are confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.“Africa is doing a lot of things right the rest of the world isn’t,” said Gayle Smith, a former administrator with the US Agency for International Development. She’s watched in astonishment as Washington looks inward instead of leading the world. But Africa “is a great story and one that needs to be told.”Nkengasong, whom the Gates Foundation honors Tuesday with its Global Goalkeeper Award as a “relentless proponent of global collaboration,” is the continent’s most visible narrator. The Cameroon-born virologist insists that Africa can stand up to Covid-19 if given a fighting chance.Early modeling assumed “a large number of Africans would just die,” Nkengasong said. The Africa CDC decided not to issue projections. “When I looked at the data and the assumptions, I wasn’t convinced,” he said.Health experts point to Africa’s youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 hasn’t taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.“Be patient,” Nkengasong said. “There’s a lot we still don’t know.”He warns against complacency, saying a single case can spark a new surge.As Africa’s top public health official, leading an agency launched only three years ago, he plunged into the race for medical supplies and now a vaccine. At first, it was a shock.“The collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have shoved Africa out of the diagnostics market,” Nkengasong wrote in the journal Nature in April. “If Africa loses, the world loses.”Supplies slowly improved, and African countries have conducted 13 million tests, enough to cover 1% of the continent’s population. But the ideal is 13 million tests per month, Nkengasong said.He and other African leaders are haunted by the memories of 12 million Africans dying during the decade it took for affordable HIV drugs to reach the continent. That must not happen again, he said.This week, more world leaders than ever are gathering online for the biggest global endeavor since Covid-19 appeared, the United Nations General Assembly. If Nkengasong could address them, he would say this: “We should be very careful that history doesn’t record us on the wrong side of it.”African leaders are expected to say much the same. “The Covid-19 pandemic has shown we have no option but to depend on each other,” Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, told the gathering on Monday.Nkengasong urges African countries not to wait for help and rejects the image of the continent holding a begging bowl. The money is there, he said.Acting on that idea, Africa’s public and private sectors created an online purchasing platform to focus their negotiating power, launched by the African Union to buy directly from manufacturers. Governments can browse and buy rapid testing kits, N95 masks and ventilators, some now manufactured in Africa in another campaign endorsed by heads of state.Impressed, Caribbean countries have signed on.“It’s the only part of the world I’m aware of that actually built a supply chain,” said Smith, the former USAID chief.When the pandemic began, just two African countries could test for the coronavirus. Now all can. Nkengasong was struck by how much information “doesn’t get translated” to member states, so the Africa CDC holds online training on everything from safely handling bodies to genomic surveillance.“I look at Africa and I look at the US, and I’m more optimistic about Africa, to be honest, because of the leadership there and doing their best despite limited resources,” said Sema Sgaier, director of the Surgo Foundation, which produced a Covid-19 vulnerability index for each region. She spoke even as Africa’s cases were surging weeks ago.With Covid-19 vaccines the next urgent issue, African countries held a conference to insist on equitable access and explore manufacturing to end their almost complete reliance on the outside world. They began securing the late-stage clinical trials that long have been held outside the continent, aiming to land 10 as soon as possible.Nkengasong said Africa needs at least 1.5 billion vaccine doses, enough to cover 60% of the population for “herd immunity” with the two likely required doses. That will cost about $10 billion.The World Health Organization says Africa should receive at least 220 million doses through an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine known as COVAX.That’s welcome but not enough, Nkengasong said.His next hurdle is how to deliver doses throughout the vast continent with the world’s worst infrastructure. Less than half of Africa’s countries have access to modern health care facilities, he said.Covid-19’s effects are “devastating” for Africa, from education to economies to the fight against other diseases. Nkengasong plans a major conference next year to press countries to significantly increase health spending ahead of the next pandemic.“If we do not,” he said, “something is terribly wrong with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-rich-nations-struggle-africa-s-coronavirus-response-is-praised/story-4g2vLyRA1MY1eCyOAtOERK.html

China’s foreign ministry has called them “separatists.”Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was asked at her weekly news conference if she could ensure that the 12 would be afforded human rights safeguards such as presumption of innocence, fair trial and legal representation.“We do not have the legal basis to do the things that you want us to do,” she said.Mainland authorities have said the legitimate rights of the 12 were being protected according to the law.China’s legal system is controlled by and loyal to the ruling Communist Party, meaning courts do not usually challenge party or government accusations.Lam said the 12 would have to face the law in mainland China before they could return to Hong Kong to face justice for any crimes committed at home.All 12 were suspected of crimes in Hong Kong related to anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged, released on bail and not allowed to leave the city. They are being detained in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen.Their fate is being closely watched in Hong Kong amid apprehension about Beijing’s greater control over the city especially since it imposed a national security law in June.Beijing and Hong Kong government say the law is aimed at tackling subversion, separatism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say it undermines the special status the city was guaranteed when Britain handed it over to China under “one country, two systems” formula in 1997.Supporters of the law say it will bring stability and safeguard prosperity after a year of unrest.

It had planned to start free inoculation on Tuesday for some 19 million eligible people.The head of South Korea’s disease prevention agency said on Tuesday that some doses of the vaccine, which need to be refrigerated, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported to a medical facility.It was not immediately known how many doses were affected, and authorities are looking into the entire batch of five million doses that were scheduled for distribution on Tuesday.“I want to make it clear that the problem is not with the manufacturer’s vaccine production, rather it is an issue raised about the refrigerated temperature maintenance in the distribution process,” Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters.So far 118,000 have been inoculated with flu shots and no adverse affects were reported from the vaccination, said Jeong.Some Asian countries have rolled out early and more aggressive influenza vaccination programmes this year to reduce the potential of people contracting the flu and Covid-19 simultaneously, which would cripple the load on healthcare.KDCA reported 61 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Monday, taking the national tally to 23,106 infections with 388 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-suspends-flu-shots-in-setback-for-winter-covid-19-preparations/story-v8E0kgvY7jSN8sz4uBJ0WL.html

He will also order all pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues across England to start closing at 10 p.m. from Thursday.“One of the things we are going to emphasise is that if it is possible for people to work from home, we are going to encourage them to do so,” Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove told Sky News TV. “There is going to be a shift in emphasis.”“They are reluctant steps that we’re taking, but they’re absolutely necessary because as we were reminded yesterday and as you’ve been reporting the rate of infection is increasing, the number of people going to hospital is increasing, therefore we need to act,” Gove said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/work-from-home-johnson-starts-to-shut-down-the-uk-again-as-covid-19-spreads/story-tv6yOnlwSLz8IevkHg0hMP.html
22-09-2020||World||FinCEN leaks push US lawmakers to press for strict laws to stop money-laundering||Advocates of legislation to beef up the US fight against money laundering made a fresh push on Monday to get Congress to act, after new revelations that some leading global banks have been processing payments linked to alleged illicit funds.A broad, bipartisan group of US lawmakers already support the proposed law, which would rework how financial firms keep an eye out for illegal activity. Banks, law enforcement groups and human rights advocates support it as well.But the legislation has stalled in Congress amid other priorities.A series of articles called the “FinCEN Files,” launched on Sunday by Buzzfeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), detailed how several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds for decades despite red flags. The series sent bank stocks tumbling on Monday and prompted new calls for legislative reform. “The Buzzfeed story makes clear we need to strengthen, reform and update our nation’s anti-money laundering laws,” Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. “This action is long overdue.”Policymakers, regulators and banks have long acknowledged fundamental flaws in the anti-money laundering system, which relies on banks to file suspicious activity reports, or SARs, when they notice something unusual in a transaction. Those SARs are sent to the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN.However, the rules around what is deemed “suspicious” can be vague, which leads some banks to send too many reports and others to send too few. And the enforcement group is understaffed to handle the millions of SARs that need to be analyzed to determine whether a crime has been committed.The proposed legislation would make it easier for banks to share information to identify bad actors, let them use technology to help detect suspicious activity more efficiently without breaching privacy laws and require companies to disclose who actually owns them.The House of Representatives already approved one such bill, another version of which enjoys broad support in the Senate.Proponents hope the FinCEN Files will spur Congress to pass something before the end of the year.“This story is a major boost in ensuring that people understand how critical it is that we get to the bottom of who’s behind these anonymous shell companies and who’s laundering money through our financial system,” said Clark Gascoigne, the interim executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition, a liberal tax activist group.Widespread criticism of anti-money laundering rules first kicked off in 2016, after another set of leaked documents known as the Panama Papers came to light.Since then, bank regulators have tried to streamline their own systems and penalized banks that were not doing enough to comply with existing rules. Banks have said they spent billions of dollars improving technology and scouring customer lists to remove potential risks.In recent months, regulators also issued industry guidance about monitoring. For example, a group of regulators told banks in August that they would typically face penalties if they are found to have pervasive issues monitoring money laundering, rather than for isolated or technical errors.The guidance came after industry complaints that existing rules create a heavy workload and expense without much to show for it. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents larger banks, found that only 4% of SARs filed in 2017 merited follow-up from law enforcement.“There has long been a shared view ... that the (anti-money laundering) framework needs to be modernized,” said Mike Lee, BPI’s chief lobbyist.

Ajay Jain Bhutoria, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council and National Finance Committee member of the Biden campaign, said: “By leveraging technology and the reach of our partners, we educate South Asian Americans about how to register, sign up for election reminders, request mail-in ballots, learn about early voting options and go Vote for Biden-Haaris”. “’Chale Chalo Biden ko vote do’ (Let’s go vote for Biden) musical video was viral, superhit with the community and this new series of graphics ‘Jaago America, Jaago, Bhul Na Jaana Biden-Haaris ko Vote Dena’ (Wake up America, wake up, don’t forget to vote for Biden-Harris) is a step forward in this series of outreach in 14 plus languages,” he said. He said that people connect with music, food, language, and culture. Bhutoria said there is huge enthusiasm in the Indian-American community to elect Biden as the next president and Kamala Harris as the first Indian-origin vice president. Earlier this year, California-based Bhutoria launched an outreach to the Indian community in 14 Indian Languages. “’America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho, Joe Biden Jaisa Ho’ (How should be America’s leader, just like Joe Biden). This was translated into 14 Indian languages and the graphics went viral on social media,” he said. The Democratic Party, he said, has been working with various grassroot organisations to get Indo-Americans and the greater South Asian community registered to vote, phone bank, and text bank in 14 distinct South Asian languages. The digital graphics in multiple languages are to inspire the South Asian voters, he added. US President Donald Trump, 74, is seeking re-election against Biden, 77, who scripted history by selecting Senator Kamala Harris, 55, as his running mate for November 3 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-release-digital-ads-in-14-indian-languages-to-woo-south-asian-voters-in-us/story-rAd3uThJLH1QXE6Yls6eYK.html
22-09-2020||World||Pakistan looks to ally China for support at FATF plenary||Pakistan is again looking to China, Malaysia and Turkey to help it get off lightly for failing to fully implement an action plan to tackle terror funding when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) assesses its case in October, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday. Ahead of FATF’s working group and plenary meetings between October 18 and 23, the Asia-Pacific Group (APG), a regional affiliate of the multilateral watchdog, reviewed Pakistan’s actions to counter-terror financing and money laundering at a virtual meeting on September 15 and 16. Also read: Ahead of crucial FATF meet, Pakistan continues to treat 21 dreaded terrorists as VIPsAt the virtual meeting, China expectedly backed Pakistan’s actions to counter-terror financing, despite the fact that it is yet to fully deliver on 13 of the 27 points in the action plan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. When Yao Jing, China’s outgoing ambassador to Pakistan, made a farewell call on the de facto finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh in Islamabad on September 17 – a day after the APG meeting – he was quoted in an official statement as expressing “his confidence that FATF’s October review will go well for Pakistan”. ALSO WATCH | Like China, talk to Pakistan: J&K ex-CM’s advice on border skirmishes “Pakistan will again be looking at China, Malaysia and Turkey to back it at the FATF plenary meeting as the support of only three members is enough to thwart any planned action,” said one of the people cited above. Malaysia was appointed co-chair of APG in July, while Australia is the permanent co-chair and host country for the regional body. While relations between India and Malaysia had soured under former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, the new government formed after his resignation has been working quietly to improve ties with New Delhi, the people noted. Ahead of the FATF plenary meeting, Pakistan will have to submit a progress report by September 30. But on July 28, Pakistan’s Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) director-general Lubna Farooq told a parliamentary standing committee on finance and revenue that the country had complied with only 14 of the 27 points in the action plan while stakeholders “were working on the remaining 13 action points”. The people further noted that Pakistan had resorted to its usual tactic of some high-profile actions in the run-up to the FATF plenary to create the impression that it was delivering on its counter-terror financing commitments. For instance, an anti-terror court in Lahore indicted four leaders of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), including Hafiz Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rahman Makki, in four more cases last week. A joint session of Pakistan’s Parliament also passed three bills aimed at implementing commitments made to FATF last week, while it tightened curbs on eight Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leaders, including Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim by taking steps in August to enforce United Nations’ (UN) sanctions against them. As things stand now, the people said, Pakistan is unlikely to be moved from FATF’s “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or the so-called “grey list” to the “high-risk jurisdiction subject to a call of action” or “black list”, despite mounting frustration among the watchdog’s members over its repeated failure to deliver on the action plan, the people said. This frustration was reflected in the statement issued after FATF’s plenary in February: “All deadlines in [Pakistan’s] action plan have expired. While noting recent and notable improvements, the FATF again expresses concerns given Pakistan’s failure to complete its action plan in line with the agreed timelines and in light of the [terror financing] risks emanating from the jurisdiction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-looks-to-ally-china-for-support-at-fatf-plenary/story-bo9Te1RfOiHNNEm2z80ItI.html
22-09-2020||World||Pak globally-recognised epicenter of terrorism: India at UN||In a scathing attack on Pakistan, India has said that if there is an “unfinished agenda” at the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism and the country, a globally-recognised epicenter of the menace, which harbours and trains terrorists and hails them as martyrs. Exercising India’s right to reply on Monday, First Secretary in the country’s Permanent Mission to the UN Vidisha Maitra said: “Pakistan is a country which is globally recognised as the epicenter of terrorism, which by its own admission harbours and trains terrorists, and hails them as martyrs and consistently persecutes its ethnic and religious minorities”. She was referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks in the country’s Parliament where he had termed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden as a “martyr”. “We reject the malicious reference made to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. If there is an item that is unfinished on the agenda of the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism,” Maitra said. As the UN member states marked 75 years of the United Nations in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his address to the high-level meeting on the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the world organisation. Qureshi said Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine were the UN’s “most glaring and long-standing disputes” and the people of Jammu and Kashmir still await the fulfillment of the commitment made to them by the UN to grant them their “right to self-determination.” With Pakistan yet again raising the Kashmir issue at a UN platform, Maitra said India had hoped that during this solemn commemoration of a shared global milestone, the General Assembly would be “spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods that have now become a trademark of Pakistan’s interventions on such platforms”. “However, for a nation that is bereft of milestones, one can only expect a stonewalled and stymied approach to reason, diplomacy and dialogue. “What we heard today is the never-ending fabricated narrative presented by the Pakistani representative about the internal affairs of India,” she said.

India has sought a permanent seat in a reformed and expanded UN Security Council.The prime minister was participating in a virtual high-level meeting of the UN general assembly to mark the 75th anniversary of the global body. He is scheduled to deliver his speech at the High-Level General Debate of the assembly on Saturday, as the opening speaker of the day.“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” Modi said in a short address in English. “Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stake holders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.”He recounted that India was a founding signatory of the UN that was born out of the “horrors” of World War II and shared India’s own “philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’”, which states the whole world is one family.“Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations,” Modi said. “We pay tribute to all those who have advanced the cause of peace and development under the UN flag, including in UN peacekeeping missions, where India had been a leading contributor.”But, he added, “while much has been achieved, the original mission remains incomplete”, which was to be reflected in the declaration of the General Assembly, to be adopted at the end of the one-day commemorative meeting.It would argue that more is needed to be done towards preventing conflict, ensuring development, addressing climate change, reducing inequality and leveraging digital technologies.It would also acknowledge “need for reform of the United Nations itself”, Modi added.India and many other countries have called for reforming the UN, arguing it must reflect the changing world order and accommodate the aspirations of emerging powers. Several countries including India have sought permanent membership in the Security Council, the world’s most exclusive club of nations, as part of a larger overhaul. The United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia — four of the five permanent members of the Security Council — have endorsed India, but there has been no real progress in the process, called the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN), which has been on for a long time.India has “accorded the highest priority to permanent membership”, the ministry of external affairs said on Monday in a parliamentary reply. And it has pursed it on both bilateral and multilateral platforms, especially in concert with other aspirants such as G-4 partners Japan, Germany and Brazil and the trilateral IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa).IBSA foreign ministers met last week virtually for their annual meeting around the UN general assembly sessions, and expressed “frustration with the slow pace of progress” on Security Council reforms in the IGN process which, they complained, “lacked transparency in its working methods”.“We insist that the time has come to move towards a result-oriented process, with provision for substantive negotiations based on a single comprehensive text, in a formal setting,” they said in a joint statement, underscoring the need for some form of a document that can be negotiated, modified or rejected.India will begin a two-year term on the Security Council coming January as a non-permanent member, for the eighth time. It hopes to use the opportunity to further burnish its credentials for a seat as a permanent member. Its previous non-permanent terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-facing-crisis-of-confidence-says-modi-in-pitch-for-reform/story-0Q5uE0zOEfKmtCDiSDGmMJ.html
22-09-2020||World||Trump aims to use UN address to send strong message to China||President Donald Trump, who prefers speaking to boisterous crowds, is set to give a pre-recorded address to the U.N. General Assembly as he grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, chilly relations between the US and China and ongoing threats from North Korea and Iran — all during a heated campaign for re-election.Trump told reporters Monday that he’d have a “strong message” for China, where the first cases of Covid-19 were reported, but he didn’t elaborate ahead of the Tuesday address. Earlier in his administration, Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida club, but now the two leaders are exchanging angry words over trade.The administration has been slamming the Chinese Communist Party for its handling of Covid-19, election meddling, espionage in the United States and influence peddling across the world.Trump is not popular at the United Nations and his speech this year comes at a time when UN members are pushing back against Washington. On Monday, Trump declared that all UN sanctions against Iran have been reimposed, a move that most of the rest of the world rejects as illegal.Trump’s statement came shortly after he signed an executive order spelling out how the US will enforce the “snapback” of sanctions. “My actions today send a clear message to the Iranian regime and those in the international community who refuse to stand up to Iran,” he said.The US said it was reimposing sanctions on Iran for being in non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers. But Trump in 2018 pulled out of the deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief.Few UN member states believe the US has the legal standing to restore the sanctions because Trump withdrew from the agreement. The US argues it retains the right to do so as an original participant in the deal and a member of the council.The White House has not previewed his UN speech, but Trump was expected to highlight agreements the US brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The historic agreements come as relations between the Jewish state and Arab nations are thawing as a pushback against Iran.The president likely will take credit for brokering economic cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo and for pressuring NATO nations to meet their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on their own defenses to lessen the burden on the alliance.He might also have words for North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. In 2017, Trump told the UN he was bringing a “message of peace,” but then said that if the US was forced to defend itself against Kim, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” He called Kim “rocket man,” but has since met with him three times, although North Korea has not made a move to give up its nuclear weapons.Trump’s has tussled with multilateral organizations throughout his presidency, although his aides say he is not against all multilateral groups, only the ones that aren’t effective. After Covid-19 took hold, Trump yanked support from the UN’s World Health Organization, saying it was too beholden to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-aims-to-use-un-address-to-send-strong-message-to-china/story-vccEExpTIrwM5XUgyUynUK.html
22-09-2020||World||Biden, Trump campaign in US Midwest as Supreme Court fight looms||Donald Trump and his rival for the White House, Joe Biden, were campaigning on Monday in two US battleground states that could decide the November election as they sparred over the president’s plan to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat.A Republican seeking re-election on Nov. 3, Trump will hold campaign events in Ohio, a state some Democrats once saw as a lock for Trump, while Biden, the Democratic former vice president, makes his second trip of the month to Wisconsin.Each is reckoning with a presidential contest that was upended by Friday’s death of the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Trump’s intention to appoint a replacement before the election, which would cement a 6-3 conservative majority, has angered Democrats and shifted the campaign’s focus away from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Biden on Sunday said the winner of the election should pick the person who fills Ginsburg’s seat. He called Trump’s planned appointment an “exercise of raw political power” after Republican senators refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016, citing that year’s presidential election.In a Fox News interview on Monday, Trump said he will name his choice to replace Ginsburg by Friday or Saturday, after mourners pay their respects.Ginsburg’s body will lay in repose at the court on Wednesday and Thursday before she lies in state at the US Capitol on Friday.Ohio and Wisconsin are hotly contested because their population can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.In his last visit to Wisconsin, Biden went to Kenosha and spoke with Jacob Blake, the Black man whose shooting by police prompted widespread unrest.This time, Biden will visit largely white Manitowoc County, which supported the former vice president and President Barack Obama when they ran on the Democratic ticket in 2008. The county backed Trump in 2016, helping deliver the state to a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 1984.Trump’s campaign has also prioritized the state after winning it in 2016 by less than 1% of the vote. Trump visited Wisconsin last week, announcing a new round of coronavirus pandemic assistance to farmers of about $13 billion.Opinion polls show Biden leading by several points in Wisconsin, mirroring his overall lead nationwide.Biden has built a formidable financial advantage for the campaign’s final stretch after a massive fundraising haul in August. The campaign and its party allies will report having $466 million in cash at the end of August, while Trump’s war chest stood at $325 million, according to officials from both sides.Early voting, both in-person and by mail, has already begun in a handful of states.The use of absentee ballots is expected to skyrocket this fall amid the pandemic. Trump has repeatedly asserted without evidence that voting by mail is subject to fraud, while Democrats raised alarm when Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump ally, implemented cost-cutting measures amid delivery delays. DeJoy has since said he will pause some of the changes.A federal judge in New York on Monday ordered the US Postal Service to expedite all mail ballots and ensure that postal workers are able to work overtime to ensure votes are processed. Last week, another judge issued an injunction freezing operational changes DeJoy had made. In Ohio, Trump is expected to speak about “fighting for the American worker,” with a focus on the economic themes that dominated his re-election pitch prior to Ginsburg’s death, before attending a rally.Earlier in the race, many Democrats had privately written Ohio off, seeing it as firmly in Trump’s grasp. But polls show a tight contest, and Biden’s campaign is now pursuing wins in an expanded set of states.On Monday, Biden’s campaign said it would add Georgia and Iowa to a list of 10 other states where it is running paid advertisements. Meanwhile, campaign finance filings on Sunday showed the national Republican Party transferred $1.3 million in August to the coffers of the state party in Texas, a longtime Republican stronghold that Democrats also hope to make competitive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-trump-campaign-in-us-midwest-as-supreme-court-fight-looms/story-CT7Mmmd2euWRUbY6dx1NiJ.html
22-09-2020||World||Beijing unlikely to approve ByteDance’s TikTok deal with Oracle: Report||A deal China’s ByteDance has struck with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc over the future of its video-streaming app TikTok is unlikely to receive Chinese government approval, state-backed newspaper Global Times said in an editorial.ByteDance has said it will create a US subsidiary, TikTok Global, that will be part-owned by Oracle and Walmart - which in turn said TikTok Global’s board would comprise mainly Americans - to pacify the administration of US President Donald Trump which had planned to ban TikTok on security grounds.“It is clear that these articles (terms) extensively show Washington’s bullying style and hooligan logic. They hurt China’s national security, interests and dignity,” said the English version of the editorial published late on Monday and which was also carried in the newspaper’s Chinese edition.The unidentified author objected to a requirement that four of the five board seats of TikTok Global be occupied by Americans and only one reserved for a Chinese national, as well as the inclusion of a U.S-approved “national security director”.It also denounced a requirement that ByteDance reveal TikTok’s source code to Oracle as part of the latter’s stake purchase, as well as the separate management of TikTok from Chinese equivalent Douyin.“As TikTok and Douyin should have the same source code, this means the US can get to know the operations of Douyin,” the editorial continued.“If the reorganization of TikTok under US manipulation becomes a model, it means once any successful Chinese company expands its business to the US and becomes competitive, it will be targeted by the US and turned into a US-controlled company via trickery and coercion, which eventually serves only US interests,” the author wrote.The Global Times is a tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government unlike its parent publication.Over the weekend, ByteDance and Oracle announced they had reached a deal that would satisfy Trump’s call for TikTok to be sold to an American buyer or face shutdown in the United States.However, both sides have framed the deal differently in public statements.ByteDance has said TikTok Global will be its subsidiary of which it will own 80%.Oracle has said ByteDance’s ownership would be distributed to ByteDance’s investors, many of which are US-based and that the Beijing-based firm itself would have no stake in TikTok Global.The deal requires approval from regulators in both Beijing and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-unlikely-to-approve-bytedance-s-tiktok-deal-with-oracle-report/story-uxzK0SSC4hqyrEToWcDPaL.html
22-09-2020||World||Barbara Lagoa, Amy C Barrett frontrunners to fill Ginsburg’s seat at US Supreme Court||President Donald Trump raced on Monday to cement a conservative majority on the US Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election, telling reporters he planned by Saturday to reveal his pick to succeed liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Democrats’ hope of keeping the seat empty faded when two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Cory Gardner, signaled their support for moving forward quickly.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he was zeroing in on one or two candidates among five who are under consideration. He called on the Senate, controlled by his fellow Republicans, to vote on confirmation before the election in which he is seeking a second term.“I’d much rather have a vote before the election,” he said. “We have plenty of time to do it.”Two federal appeals court judges appointed by Trump are clear front-runners: Amy Coney Barrett of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals and Barbara Lagoa of the Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump met with Barrett at the White House on Monday, according to a source familiar with the situation.Ginsburg died on Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer at age 87.Trump’s announcement would come before Ginsburg is due to be buried privately at Arlington National Cemetery next week.Officials have arranged for a public viewing of her body outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday and inside the US Capitol on Friday.Ginsburg’s death gives Trump and his party an opportunity to establish a 6-3 conservative majority on a court whose decisions influence many spheres of American life including abortion, healthcare, gun rights, voting access, presidential powers and the death penalty.With Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the Senate, it would require at least four of them to break ranks to stop the nomination from going through. Two Republican senators - Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski - said over the weekend that the chamber should not move forward with a Trump nominee before the election.Democrats had hoped to get similar support from Gardner, who faces a tough re-election race in Colorado, and Grassley. But both men said on Monday they would vote to confirm a qualified Trump pick.Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump and is seen by Democrats as a potential holdout, avoided questions about the Supreme Court seat on Monday.“Before I have any comment, I’m going to meet with my colleagues, which I’ll be doing tomorrow,” Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, told reporters.Democrats have accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of hypocrisy for being eager to bring a Trump nominee to a confirmation vote. In 2016, he refused even to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill a vacancy on the court left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, saying it would be inappropriate to do so during an election year. McConnell, who has prioritized confirming Trump’s judicial appointments, said he would usher through a vote this year, although he did not say exactly when. “The Senate has more than sufficient time to process a nomination. History and precedent make that perfectly clear,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. A new Congress will not be sworn in until Jan. 3. Democrats are hoping to win control of the Senate in the election.Trump has already named two conservative justices to the high court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.‘Ginsburg’s dying wish’Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said any vote should take place next year. “That was Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish. And it may be the Senate’s only, last hope,” Schumer said. Trump said without evidence that he did not believe the National Public Radio report that Ginsburg had told her granddaughter she did not want the Senate to consider a successor until next year, when either Trump will begin a second term or Democratic rival Joe Biden, who leads in opinion polls, will take office. “It was just too convenient,” Trump said.Speaking of the possible candidates, Trump said: “They’re all outstanding but I have one or two that I have in mind.” He called Barrett “very respected.”He said he might meet with Lagoa in Miami later this week, adding: “I don’t know her but I hear she’s outstanding.” Obstacles loom for either candidate in the bitterly divided Senate. Barrett could face opposition from Collins and Murkowski over concerns that she would roll back abortion rights, said a source familiar with the confirmation process who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lagoa, a Cuban American from the battleground state of Florida, is not as well known, which could slow down the confirmation process.White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, are leading the selection process, the source said. Outside of White House officials, Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, is playing a central advisory role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barbara-lagoa-amy-c-barrett-frontrunners-to-fill-ginsburg-s-seat-at-us-supreme-court/story-HgNaktaau9LbgPSkXeh8FO.html

The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, has lived in exile since 1959.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-police-officer-charged-with-spying-for-china/story-AmTLUriL4m37DGv8SnssHN.html

He was addressing the High-Level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to mark 75 years of the global body.‘The declaration acknowledges the need for reform in the United Nation itself. You cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” the Prime Minister said.Marking 75 years of the @UN. https://t.co/2j7HPYjEGAPM Modi also said that the UN needs to address the crisis of confidence it currently faces. ‘Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities,” he said.Speaking about organisations like the UN Security Council, he said the UN needs to adapt in order to address contemporary challenges which a structure set up in 1945 may not be able to do.PM Modi while supporting the reforms undertaken by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “We support ongoing reforms by the Secretary-General…We reiterate our call for reforms of three of the principal organs of the UN. We commit to instil new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalise the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council.”PM Modi highlighted that India’s own philosophies align with the goals of the United Nations. He said work still needs to be done towards reducing inequality, mitigating conflicts and addressing the threat of climate change.He also highlighted that India is one of the largest contributors to the UN Peacekeeping Missions.

22-09-2020||World||Former Wisconsin police chief to review Jacob Blake’s shooting||Wisconsin’s attorney general announced Monday that he has selected a former Madison police chief to serve as an independent consultant for prosecutors weighing whether to file charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake, a Black man who was left paralyzed from the waist down.The shooting of Blake on Aug. 23 by a white Kenosha police officer made Wisconsin the epicenter of the nation’s ongoing debate over police violence and racial injustice. It came three months after the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.Noble Wray, the expert who will review the file, is Black. Following his retirement as Madison’s chief in 2013, Wray has become a national leader in working on police reform, fighting racism and educating about implicit bias. Wray was chief for nine years and worked 30 years as a police officer, experience that Attorney General Josh Kaul and Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Gravely said would be crucial when reviewing the file.Gravely said he requested the consultant but that he asked the Department of Justice to choose.Kaul said his department’s investigation of the shooting is in its final stages. When it’s done, he will turn it over to Wray for review and an analysis. It will then be up to Gravely about whether to file charges. Gravely said Monday that he had not made any decision about filing charges yet.Gravely said Wray would bring “diverse” and “abundant” perspectives to the case.Wray said he will provide insight and perspective to the case but not prejudge it. Wray said he will complete his review as quickly as possible, but he has not been given a timeline once he receives the investigative file.“I have not prejudged the case,” Wray said.Blake was shot in the back seven times after walking away from the officer and two others who were trying to arrest him. The officer, Rusten Sheskey, shot Blake after Blake opened an SUV’s driver-side door and leaned into the vehicle. Three of Blake’s children were in the back seat. The shooting was captured on video and circulated quickly online, fueling protests hours later.The state Justice Department has said a knife was recovered from Blake’s vehicle, but it has not said whether he was holding it when officers tried to arrest him.Blake’s attorney, Ben Crump, has said that Blake was only trying to break up a domestic dispute and did nothing to provoke police. Crump has called for the arrest of Sheskey, the officer who shot Blake, and for the two other officers involved in the shooting to be fired.Sheskey and the other officers who were at the scene — Vincent Arenas and Brittany Meronek — were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. None of them have been charged.The Kenosha police union has said that officers were dispatched on Aug. 23 because of a complaint that Blake was attempting to steal the caller’s keys and vehicle. Union attorney Brendan Matthews said officers were aware that Blake had an open warrant for felony sexual assault before they arrived.Blake pleaded not guilty on Sept. 4 to charges accusing him of sexually assaulting a woman in May. A trial date was set for Nov. 9.Kenosha is a city of about 100,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan midway between Milwaukee and Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-wisconsin-police-chief-to-review-jacob-blake-s-shooting/story-0Ep52ZlvIxBwk4VN3wJdMP.html

The missile sequences were plucked from three Hollywood movies, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Rock and Hurt Locker. “It turned out that our dream of great power was pieced together by editing American film clips,” said one user.“We promote the domestic military aircraft using US Hollywood movie clips, why bother?” added another, while a third said, “It’s our nation’s promotional video, why don’t we use our own images?”China’s foreign ministry ramped up its rhetoric over the self-ruled island of Taiwan on Monday, describing any support for its independence as “doomed to fail”, and threatened retaliation against US diplomatic visits to the island.Meanwhile, Taiwan said it scrambled fighters and deployed anti-missile systems on Monday after Chinese military jets entered its air defence zone for the fourth time in five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-airforce-uses-hollywood-film-clips-in-propaganda-video/story-wocx6pLKEd4BMKQqng7ThO.html
22-09-2020||World||UK raises Covid-19 alert to second highest level||The Joint Biosecurity Centre of the British government on Monday raised the national Covid-19 alert level from three to four – the second highest – after new cases doubling every week prompted experts to envisage a scenario of 50,000 daily cases by mid-October.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to make a statement in parliament on Tuesday to announce new measures to deal with the virus, seeking to strike a balance between ensuring public health and preventing further blows to Britain’s battered economy.Before the statement, Johnson is expected to hold a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee. A range of options have been discussed over the weekend with experts and ministers, with consensus reportedly veering towards more curbs instead of another national lockdown.The alert level was reduced from level four to three on June 19, when new cases on successive days and weeks were recorded in the hundreds. They rose in the thousands in September, with 4,368 recorded on Monday evening.The centre has five alert levels; the highest refers to a stage of outbreak in which there is a risk of health services being overwhelmed. The new current level four means the epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is “high or rising exponentially”.The new level was agreed by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who said in a statement: “After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations”.“If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the National Health Service and other health services over the autumn and winter, everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly”.“We know this will be a concerning news for many people. Please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this”, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-raises-covid-19-alert-to-second-highest-level/story-6TtMmSjEH65IAw8JehkiGP.html
22-09-2020||World||Leaders observe 75 years of UN at virtual event||World leaders came together, virtually, on Monday to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, as the deadly coronavirus pandemic challenges the effectiveness and solidarity of the 193-member world body.As Covid-19, which emerged in China late last year, began to spread around the world, forcing millions of people to shelter at home and dealing a devastating economic blow, countries turned inward and diplomats say the United Nations struggled to assert itself.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told Reuters that the pandemic has exposed the world’s fragilities. He told world leaders on Monday that they need to work together at a time when there is a surplus of multilateral challenges and deficit of solutions. The 15-member Security Council took months to back a call by Guterres for a global ceasefire - to allow countries to focus on fighting Covid-19 - due to bickering between the world’s biggest powers: China and the United States.The 193-member UN General Assembly only adopted an omnibus resolution on a “comprehensive and coordinated response” to the pandemic earlier this month, and it was not by consensus. The US and Israel voted no.A $10.3 billion UN appeal to fund fighting the pandemic in vulnerable and low-income countries is only a quarter funded. Guterres now has taken a lead in pushing to make sure any vaccine for the coronavirus is made available to everyone globally. A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the General Assembly should have acted months ago, but “we were all hampered by, and hit, by the Covid-19”. After New York was hit hard by the coronavirus, UN member states had to decide how to work virtually, which they did for several months before resuming some in-person meetings. “We all suffered from the fact that we couldn’t meet... A lot of attention was paid to process more than substance unfortunately,” said the European diplomat. “I wouldn’t put the blame on the UN, it’s the member states that have to be more positive.” Monday’s event comes ahead of the annual meeting of world leaders at the UN, which starts on Tuesday with no presidents or PMs physically present in New York. All statements have been pre-recorded and will be broadcast in the General Assembly hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-observe-75-years-of-un-at-virtual-event/story-OHmwdP7Jbh6n7M2GL5otiK.html

Cool the flames that have engulfed our country.”Jamming the nomination through, Biden said, would amount to an “abuse of power”.The sudden vacancy is reshaping the presidential race, which to this point has been largely a referendum on how Trump had managed the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking on Fox News on Monday, Trump said he would put forward his nominee on Friday or Saturday and called upon the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on confirmation ahead of the election. “We have the presidency and the Senate and we have plenty of time,” Trump said, dismissing demands for making the nomination after the election. “I think that would be good for the Republican Party and I think it would be good for everybody to get it over with.”Trump said he had a list of five finalists, “probably four”. He has mentioned two women as possible candidates: federal appellate judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa. He appointed both to their current posts.Ginsburg died on Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer at age 87. She is to lie in repose for public viewing at the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday.

The ministers tweeted about contracting the viral infection.With these two ministers, at least 12 ministers of Chouhan’s cabinet including health minister Dr Prabhuram Chaudhary besides the Madhya Pradesh CM himself have tested positive for coronavirus so far since July 22. There are 34 ministers in the cabinet including the chief minister. Most of the ministers have recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospitals. On Tuesday, minister for rural development and panchayat Mahendra Singh Sisodia and minister for new and renewable energy Hardip Singh Dang tweeted about their being infected with the disease and being admitted to Chirayu Hospital in Bhopal. Both the ministers will face by-elections to retain their position as ministers as they are not members of the legislative assembly. The two along with 20 other Congress MLAs had resigned from the state assembly and Congress to later join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in March this year in an act of rebellion against then chief minister Kamal Nath. Sisodia tweeted, “During a test there were symptoms of Covid-19 in me and I am getting treatment at Chirayu Hospital. Those who came in contact with me should go for a Covid-19 test. The ensuing by-election is the election of the party workers and I have belief that we will definitely succeed.” Hardeep Singh Dang posted a video on his Twitter page in which he is seen on oxygen support. Addressing party workers and others in the video clip he said, “My Covid-19 test conducted in Chirayu Hospital came positive today and I am hospitalised for treatment. I am under observation of doctors and you all please take care of yourself. For the next few days I would not be able to meet you. My mobile phone too will remain switched off.” As per the health department’s bulletin released on Tuesday night the Covid-19 tally in Madhya Pradesh rose to 1,10,711 with 2,544 new cases identified in the past 24 hours. So far, 2,035 Covid-19 patients have died including 28 who died during the past 24 hours. Till date, 86,030 patients have recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospitals across the state. There were 22,646 active cases as on Tuesday. With 17,698 Covid-19 tests conducted in the past 24 hours the number of such tests conducted so far stands at 1861778, as per the bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-ministers-of-shivraj-singh-chouhan-s-cabinet-test-covid-19-positive/story-NLfla309juNBj0B4ytujvN.html
22-09-2020||India||Govt drafts 5-point plan to check oxygen shortage||The Centre has drafted a five-point agenda to address reports of shortage of medical oxygen — used in the treatment of moderate and severe Covid-19 patients — including setting up a 24x7 hindrance-free corridor for transport, and creating a control room to monitor demand and supply on a real-time basis.Rajesh Bhushan, secretary at the Union health ministry, said in a briefing on Tuesday that while there is “sufficient” supply of medical oxygen at the moment, “we are thinking ahead”.The five measures are: a 24x7 green corridor for movement of liquid medical oxygen tankers within and outside a state; scrapping time restrictions for trucks carrying oxygen cylinders to enter city limits; creation of an interministerial control group to monitor oxygen supply and demand in real-time; creation of a micro-level management system to monitor the upkeep of oxygen pipelines, cryogenic tanks etc; and stricter checks in states on hoarding and black marketing of oxygen.The measures come in the background of reports on a shortage of medical oxygen in some parts of the country.“States have also been asked to create a mini-control room for monitoring oxygen demand and supply similar to what Centre is doing... Even though there is sufficient headroom at the moment, we are thinking ahead,” Bhushan said.Some states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and Assam, earlier this month reported the shortage of oxygen supply to hospitals. On September 11, the Union health ministry has issue an advisory asking states not to impose restrictions on interstate transport of oxygen and on its production. The Union health ministry the following week asked states to press more tankers into action, re-purpose vehicles to carry oxygen, and take steps to reduce their turnaround time.India has the capacity to manufacture 6,900 metric tonnes of medical oxygen on a daily basis, and around 2,800 metric tonnes of oxygen is required for both Covid-19 and non-Covid health use.“Around 2,200 metric tonnes is consumed for industrial purposes; therefore, at the national level there is no shortage of oxygen. In fact, there is generally a surplus of about 1,500-1,900 metric tonnes of oxygen,” health ministry officials had said during last week’s Covid-19 press briefing.About 6% of Covid-19 patients require oxygen support at any given time across the country. “Even though there is no overall shortage in oxygen supply, the problem arises when there is no oxygen inventory management and when there is lack of alert generation mechanism at the hospital levels,” Bhushan said on Tuesday, adding that inventory planning is crucial to dealing with this localised shortage.An interministerial empowered committee has been set up to ensure there is no shortage, and has held three meetings with the states over the past week.Critical care specialists treating Covid-19 patients in the National Capital Region say while there is no shortage currently, it is crucial to ensure that abundant oxygen supply is maintained. “We haven’t faced any shortages but its unhindered oxygen supply is critical in saving lives. In moderate to severe Covid-19 cases the lung cells don’t participate in normal functioning that results in lungs failing to take up oxygen from the blood and also not being able to remove carbon dioxide from the blood. It leads to oxygen levels dropping in the blood for which oxygen support is given externally to compensate for the impaired lung function,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-drafts-5-pt-plan-to-check-oxygen-shortage/story-drV8tQm80HmaJGfaFj8c9K.html

This can be used as a target for evaluation of various Missile systems. Congratulations to @DRDO_India & other stakeholders for this achievement,” he tweeted.During the trial on Tuesday, two demonstrator vehicles were successfully test-flown, DRDO sources said.ABHYAS has been designed and developed by the Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) of the DRDO.The air vehicle is launched using twin underslung boosters. It is powered by a small gas turbine engine and has an Inertial Navigation System (INS) along with a Flight Control Computer (FCC) for guidance and control.The vehicle has been programmed for fully autonomous flight. The check out of the vehicle is done using laptop- based Ground Control Station (GCS), a defence statement said.During the test campaign, the user requirement of 5 km flying altitude, vehicle speed of 0.5 mach, endurance of 30 minutes and 2g turn capability of the test vehicle were successfully achieved, it said.“It proved its performance in a fully autonomous waypoint navigation mode,” a DRDO source added.

22-09-2020||India||What the FCRA amendments mean||The Lok Sabha passed The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment (FCRA) Bill, 2020 on Sept. 21, amid concerns by voluntary organisations that the new changes will further tighten channels of funding from abroad.Minister of state for home Nityanand Rai, during a discussion in the Lower House, argued that the law needed to be updated further to “prevent the misuse of foreign funds” by those who receive it. The Bill amends the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010 (FCRA 2010) to make several new provisions. The FCRA 2010 has already been amended twice. The first amendment was made by Section 236 of the Finance Act, 2016 and the second by Section 220 of the Finance Act, 2018. Here’s the context of why the new changes are important and the backdrop in which they have been made. The annual inflow of foreign contributions has nearly doubled between 2010 and 2019. According to the government, many recipients of foreign funding have not utilised it for the purpose for which they were registered. Opponents have argued the government has used the provisions to clamp down on political rivals as well as voluntary organisations.The home ministry on July 8 set up an interministerial committee to oversee investigations into three trusts linked to the Gandhi family, for alleged violations, of among other laws, FCRA 2010. These trusts are the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, and the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. The trust has denied any wrongdoing.In November 2019, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had raided the offices of the human rights organisation, Amnesty International, for alleged violation of FCRA. The organisation denied the charges.The Centre has cancelled certificates of registration of more than 19,000 voluntary organisations between 2011 and 2019, according to home ministry data. FCRA, 2010 was enacted to regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any activities detrimental to “national interest”, according to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the new Bill. Under FRCA, election candidates, editor or publisher of a newspaper, judges, members of any legislature and political parties are prohibited from receiving foreign donations. The Bill adds public servants (as defined under the Indian Penal Code) to this list of prohibited persons. A key amendment proposes to introduce the requirement of Aadhaar, the biometric ID, stating that applicants must now provide Aadhaar details of all its office-bearers as an identification document. The Bill prohibits the transfer of foreign grants received by an entity to a partner organisation or an associated person, which is a usual practice. Under FCRA, a registered person must accept foreign contribution only in a single branch of a scheduled bank but they may open more accounts in other banks to spend the funds. The Bill says foreign contribution can now be received only in an account designated by the bank as “FCRA account” in a branch of the State Bank of India, New Delhi (as notified by the central government). No funds other than the foreign contribution should be received or deposited in this account. Earlier, recipients of foreign grants could use 50% of the contribution for meeting administrative expenses. The Bill reduces this limit to 20%. The Voluntary Action Network India, a representative body of development organisations, has urged the government to refer the Bill to a select or a Standing Committee of Parliament. “The Bill throttles the spirit of cooperation that had been ushered in earlier this year by the positive role played by development organisations in mitigating the lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic by virtually making it impossible for NGOs to function.” The Bill assumes that all NGOs receiving foreign grants are guilty, unless prove otherwise, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-the-fcra-amendments-mean/story-3kVry4Tx2ml0ObG19dFNvL.html
22-09-2020||India||PM Modi visited 58 countries since 2015||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited 58 countries since 2015 and a total expenditure of Rs 517 crore was incurred on them, the government said on Tuesday. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan provided details of the prime minister’s visits abroad since 2015, including their outcome, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha. “The total expenditure on these visits was Rs 517.82 crore,” he said. According to the details provided by Muraleedharan, the prime minister made five visits each to the US, Russia and China, and multiple trips to some other countries like Singapore, Germany, France, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. Some of the visits the prime minister undertook were multi-nation trips while some were standalone bilateral visits. Modi’s last trip was to Brazil on November 13-14 in 2019 where he attended a summit of influential grouping BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa). Muraleedharan said Modi’s visits to the countries have enhanced their understanding of India’s perspectives on bilateral, regional and global issues. He said the visits helped in strengthening India’s relations with the countries in a wide range of sectors including trade and investment, technology, defence collaboration and people-to-people contact. “These, in turn, have contributed to India’s national development agenda to promote economic growth and well being of our people,” the minister said. “India is now increasingly contributing to shaping the global agenda at the multilateral level including on climate change, trans-national crime and terrorism, cyber security and nuclear non-proliferation, and offering to the world its own unique initiatives for global issues like the International Solar Alliance,” he added. To a separate question on Nepal, Muraleedharan said India’s age-old ties with the neighbouring country are “unique and special”, based on shared history, geography, culture, close people–to–people ties, mutual security and close economic linkages. Asked whether the government is aware that Nepal has signed a number of transit and transportation treaties with China in the past few years to shrug off its dependence on India, he said New Delhi’s ties with Kathmandu stand on their own merit. “Two–thirds of Nepal’s global trade is with India and over 90 per cent of Nepal’s third country import-export transit is through India. India’s ties with Nepal stand on their own merit, and are independent of Nepal’s relations with third countries,” he said. India’s ties with Nepal came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand as its territories. India maintains that these areas along the border with Nepal in Uttarakhand belong to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-visited-58-countries-since-2015/story-OXeYFJW2pma9F8hDE8hASP.html
22-09-2020||India||Jagan Mohan Reddy meets Amit Shah, asks for CBI probe into Amaravati land scam||YSR Congress party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday requested the Centre to order a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged irregularities in land transactions in the Amaravati capital region during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime. The chief minister made the request to Union home minister Amit Shah at a brief meeting in New Delhi in the evening. Jagan is expected to have another round of meetings with Shah and later with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday morning. According to a party functionary familiar with the development, Jagan explained to the home minister in detail how several Telugu Desam Party leaders, including family members of then chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu made huge purchase of land in and around Amaravati between June and December 2014, before the region was declared as a capital. He pointed out that the cabinet sub-committee which probed into this “insider trading” by the then TDP government had found several irregularities including fraudulent means of grabbing assigned and government land and surrendering it for land pooling to get the benefits announced by the government. Jagan also requested Shah to order a similar CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the AP State Fibernet Limited (APSFL) to the extent of over Rs 600 crore. There were grave irregularities right from bidding to undue favours granted to the company owned by Naidu’s then IT advisor Vemuri Harikrishna Prasad. Jagan also reportedly asked Shah to approve the AP Disha Criminal Law (AP Amendment) Bill and secure the President of India’s assent for it to become an Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-mohan-reddy-meets-amit-shah-asks-for-cbi-probe-into-amaravati-land-scam/story-Dw6oEeu2scGYQqmrjnD3pO.html
22-09-2020||India||RS approves 7 bills in under 4 hrs as Oppn skips session||In an Opposition-less Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the government quickly cleared seven bills in roughly three and a half hours, putting its legislative agenda back on track after two days of intense protests and disruptions in the Upper House. The Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Nationalist Congress Party, Aam Aadmi Party and Left outfits announced a boycott of Rajya Sabha proceedings for the remainder of the ongoing session if the government did not meet their demands, including revoking the suspension of eight MPs . After issues related to suspension of MPs and the farm bills were disposed off after a lengthy discussion, legislative agenda took centre-stage around 10 am. By then, the Opposition parties had left the House. And the government managers seized the opportunity to push through several pending bills. It cleared The Indian Institutes of Information Technology Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The National Forensic Sciences University Bill, 2020, The Rashtriya Raksha University Bill, 2020 and The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020. The Upper House worked overtime to clear the day’s legislative package before proceedings ended a little after 2 PM. To be sure, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu repeatedly mentioned that the eight lawmakers expelled during the fracas over the passage of the farm reform bills are welcome to return if they express regret for their action on Sunday. The opposition erupted after the deputy chairman denied a request for a division (or voting) and allowed the passage of the bills through a voice vote. The protests saw MPs rushing to the well of the house, throwing papers, and standing on the table. The BJP has claimed that the lawmakers abused deputy chairman Harivansh . The approval of seven bills in such a short time is a rare instance in the Rajya Sabha and may help the BJP meet its target of clearing 20 bills, including those replacing 11 ordinances promulgated during the past three months. In the Lok Sabha too, the Opposition boycotted the session for a day citing the developments in the other House. The Lower House, which sat beyond midnight to clear bills on both Sunday and Monday, approved three key labour reforms after a debate with no participation from the Opposition. Former parliamentary affairs secretary, Afzal Amanullah said, “What I have heard is that proper procedure was not entirely followed while suspending the 8 MPs. I would have been happy if magnanimity were shown to take back the suspended MPs. The bills might have been passed in a perfectly legal way, but perhaps we have lost sight of essence of our parliamentary democracy. This doesn’t auger well for future.” “Parliamentary democracy is never about majoritarian tyranny. But the capacity to listen, absorb and take others along. It is no use serving tea and simultaneously passing seven bills without the opposition presence. Legislative force is irrelevant without moral force and in many ways this already Covid session have made into a sham session by the government,” said senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi.The three labour bills are: The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020 and The Code on Social Security, 2020. The House also cleared The Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020.  Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla later called Opposition floor leaders for a chat and urged them to return to the House. According to officials, the meeting was attended by Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury and Gaurav Gogoi, NCP’s Supriya Sule, DMK’s TR Balu, Trinamool’s Saugata Ray and others. The leaders clarified to Birla that they have no grievances against him and are happy with the way the Lower House is running.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-approves-7-bills-in-under-4-hrs-as-oppn-skips-session/story-Xa1eGIEhPdmywpxxnUoo0K.html
22-09-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB summons producer Madhu Mantena to join drug-related probe with Jaya Saha, Shruti Modi||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has summoned film producer Madhu Mantena on Wednesday along with Sushant Singh Rajput’s former talent manager Jaya Saha and his ex-manager Shruti Modi for questioning in connection with the drug-related probe in the Bollywood actor’s death case, news agency ANI reported. Saha has been called for the third round of questioning while Modi will be quizzed for the second time on Wednesday. The duo was first summoned on September 16 but the questioning was postponed after one of the members of the investigating team tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Earlier in the day, the central agency, which is probing the drug link in Rajput’s death, had summoned Bollywood talent agency KWAN Agency’s CEO Dhruv Chitgopekar, deputy director of NCB KPS Malhotra confirmed. Chitgopekar reached the Bombay Port Trust (BPT) guesthouse, where NCB officials were questioning people, around 2 pm. Malhotra, however, denied reports of KWAN employee and actor Deepika Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash being summoned by the agency. “No summons have been issued to Prakash. But we will summon her later this week,” he said.The agency had earlier confirmed that Bollywood actors Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh and designer Simone Khambatta will also be called to join the NCB probe this week. The actors will be summoned under Section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, after they were named by Rhea Chakraborty while she was being interrogated between September 6 and September 8 before being arrested, NCB officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-ncb-summons-producer-madhu-mantena-to-join-drug-related-probe-with-jaya-shah-shruti-modi/story-fEkCN8npAVYtKh7EGgULrM.html

The 53 men underwent the training in four batches between July 23 and September 18. An organisation under the Union ministry of defence and with the defence minister as its president, HMI is one of the premier mountaineering institutes in the country. Group captain Y K Bajaj from Air Force Station Kurseong in Darjeeling district requested HMI to provide quarantine facilities for two weeks to personnel coming from different parts of the country before they could join duty. Group captain Jai Kishan, the principal HMI, came up with an idea to make the most of the opportunity. When the nationwide lockdown was announced in March, HMI’s 76 trainees and 50 staff members were stranded at the institute’s base camp at an altitude of 14,600 feet at Chowrikhang in the Himalayas in West Sikkim. The trainees were brought back to Darjeeling and kept at the institute for more than two months. To keep them occupied and prevent mental fatigue, the institute came up with physical and mental exercises, said Jai Kishan. Using this experience, Jai Kishan decided to utilize the 14-day quarantine period for the air force personnel. “The training was conducted outside the HMI hostel in Darjeeling,” he told HT on Tuesday. “The trainees started their day with two hours of physical training which included aerobics, muscle strengthening exercises, yoga, meditation etc. The morning session ended with puja and the national anthem,” said Jai Kishan. The air force men were taught about various types of hazards, use of safety ropes, equipment, improvisation for survival, building shelters, improvised first-aid procedures and response during emergency. “It was a judicious utilisation of the quarantine time,” said the HMI principal. There were six instructors, including Jai Kishan. To maintain social distancing, the hostel rooms, each of which are otherwise meant for eight people, were used by two air force men. HMI has so far trained 46,000 people and around 1000 of its students have successfully climbed to the top of Mount Everest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarantined-iaf-personnel-enhance-survival-skills-learn-rescue-ops-at-darjeeling-s-hmi/story-7e9PJuwjV82drlrnwsAG6M.html
22-09-2020||India||Facebook moves SC challenging Delhi Assembly’s jurisdiction to summon its officials||Facebook India and its vice president and managing director, Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee which sought Mohan’s presence before the panel which is probing the Delhi riots of February 2020 and the role of the social media giant in failing to curb hate speech in connection with the riots. The petition stated that the subject matter under investigation by the Delhi assembly falls within the exclusive domain of the Union government and a state legislative assembly cannot compel witnesses to appear and provide evidence on such subjects.“The Committee seeks to compel petitioner No. 1 (Ajit Mohan) to provide testimony on subjects within the exclusive domain of the Union of India. Specifically, the Committee is seeking to make a “determination of the veracity of allegations levelled against Facebook” in the Delhi riots, which intrudes into subjects exclusively allocated to the Union of India,” the petition said.Regulation of intermediaries like Facebook falls within the Union list of the Constitution under the Entry “Communication” (Entry 31) in the said list. The Parliament, in exercise of that power enacted the Information Technology Act, 2000 to regulate intermediaries. Therefore, any assessment of the veracity of allegations against Facebook as an intermediary is exclusively a Union subject, it was submitted.Besides, it was contended that the summons violates the right of the petitioner to remain silent and right to privacy which are fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. “By targeting Facebook – a platform that allows users to express themselves – the summons create a chilling effect on the free speech rights of users of the Facebook service,” the plea added.The case will be heard by a 3-judge bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Wednesday.Mohan was first summoned by the committee for its meeting of September 15 in connection with the complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by the social media company in removing hateful content and posts. The committee had earlier said that in its meeting of August 31, it had prima facie found Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead and over 400 injured.A notice was issued to Facebook officials on September 10 based on that finding asking them to appear before the panel on September 15 but Facebook officials had failed to appear for that meeting after which a second notice was issued on September 18.In its summons issued on September 18, the committee had said that it is empowered to make suggestions to the central government and it is in line with co-operative federalism which “encompasses a large number of areas including making recommendations to the union government when the same is required.” The committee is investigating the matter based on several complaints received from the public after an article was published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.The WSJ report titled ‘Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics’ had alluded to the role allegedly played by top Facebook officials, particularly its public policy head Ankhi Das, by citing business imperatives to refrain from applying hate-speech rules to at least 4 individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though the groups and individuals had been internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.Meanwhile, Facebook had written a letter to the Delhi assembly’s panel on September 13 stating that the matter was already under consideration by a parliamentary committee and the subject matter relating to content regulation is outside the scope of state assembly.This stance was reiterated by Facebook and Mohan before the top court with the petition stating that a state legislative assembly cannot compel non-members to appear before it for an investigation into a subject matter which is beyond its jurisdiction.“The Constitution of India, in conferring powers upon Parliament and State Legislatures endows them with the power to hold a non-member in breach of privileges, but only if that non-member has impeded or obstructed the body’s legislative functions. The Committee’s powers do not extend to compelling non- members to appear when the non-member has not impeded or obstructed legislative functioning,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-moves-sc-challenging-delhi-assembly-s-jurisdiction-to-summon-its-officials/story-P8pGYAp3UDJCuqpL0bQtCP.html
22-09-2020||India||Weapon firings, flying ops in India-Australia naval drill in Indian Ocean||The Indian and Australian navies will conduct a two-day passage exercise in the east Indian Ocean Region from September 23, an Indian Navy spokesperson said on Tuesday. A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. “The exercise would involve participation of HMAS Hobart from the Australian side and Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri and Karmuk,” he said. Helicopters from both sides are also taking part in the drills. “The exercise, aimed at enhancing interoperability, improving understanding and imbibing best practices from each other, would involve advanced surface and anti-air exercises, including weapon firings, seamanship exercises, naval manoeuvres and cross-desk flying operations,” the navy said in a statement. In the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the exercise would be conducted strictly as a non-contact activity and would not involve any physical contact between the participating personnel, it added. The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year. China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row with China in the Ladakh sector. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment and the vessels could be diverted for any mission. Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weapon-firings-flying-ops-in-india-australia-naval-drill-in-indian-ocean/story-8sF4v9Mz5aOH7MKyGcj2xI.html

This was clarified by the Centre in a fresh affidavit filed in Supreme Court on Tuesday. The affidavit came on the eve of a scheduled hearing on a bunch of PILs before the top court where the Centre’s scheme for refund of flights cancelled during lockdown is expected to be taken up for consideration.This is the second affidavit jointly filed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). On September 9, the top court had asked the Centre to file an additional affidavit to clarify whether the credit shell and incentive scheme formulated by Centre extended just to tickets booked during lockdown or the period prior to it. Several passengers had booked their tickets in advance and failed to get refunds from airlines after a travel ban during lockdown led to cancellation of their flights.Clarifying its stand, the latest affidavit by Amit Gupta, Director with DGCA said, “Passengers who have booked tickets prior to lockdown for travel up to May 24, 2020 (as the calibrated domestic operation recommenced from May 25, 2020), refund of fares to the passengers covered under this category shall be governed by the proposed formulation related to credit shell and incentive scheme.Under this proposed formulation, if the airline is not in a financial position to refund within 15 days, a credit shell will be created in the name of the passenger that he/she can avail while flying next with the airline on any route on or before March 31, 2021. This credit shell will be transferrable and if the money is kept idle in the credit shell, the passengers will be entitled to 0.5 per cent interest from the date of cancellation till June 30 and thereafter, 0.75 per cent interest till March 31, 2021. The airline will be liable to return the credit shell amount with interest to the passenger after March 31, 2021.The scheme will apply to all passengers who booked their tickets on domestic airline either individually or through travel agent for travel on domestic and international routes (provided flight originates from India). As regards foreign carriers, the credit shell scheme will not apply and passengers will be entitled to refund of fare within 15 days.For passengers who booked tickets during the lockdown, the DGCA came out with a notification on April 16, 2020 providing for immediate refund. This notification clearly specified that airlines were not supposed to book tickets knowing about the travel ban in place. The latest affidavit also catered to tickets booked for travel after May 24. It said, “Passengers who booked tickets at any period of time but for travel after May 24, 2020, refund of fares to the passengers covered under this category shall be governed by the provisions of Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR).”Advocate Jose Abraham appearing for one of the petitioners before the Court – Pravasi Legal Cell expressed satisfaction with the clarification issued by Centre. Speaking to HT, he said, “We are happy that the Centre has accepted that those who booked tickets prior to the lockdown will get full refund within 15 days or credit shell facility and incentive scheme. Their earlier affidavit of Centre dated September 5 did not state so.”The Centre in its earlier affidavit referred to two categories of passengers – those who booked tickets from March 25 to April 14 (lockdown period) and those falling under “any other cases” without specifying the period of travel.One grey area still remains as the scheme does not extend to international flights (both domestic and foreign carriers) where the flight originated outside India. For international air tickets to avail the proposed refund scheme, the booking must be “ex-India”, states the affidavit. This term is not defined in the Aircraft Act, 1934 or the Aircraft Rules, 1937, but the affidavit states, “In aviation industry, this term denotes the flights which are originating from India.”Pravasi Legal Cell will challenge this aspect as several Indians arriving from foreign destinations could not arrive in the country as their flights stood cancelled during lockdown. “This is a grey area still in the affidavit and we will seek clarification from Centre when the matter comes before the Court,” said advocate Jose Abraham.The scheme has largely found approval from all airline operators and travel agents. Some tour operators had on the previous date of hearing objected to the creation of credit shell in the name of passengers. The tour operators informed the Court that tickets are booked in advance without collecting money from passengers and hence the credit shell should not be in the name of the passenger.The Centre clarified in its latest affidavit that the ticket will remain in the name of the passenger and in case the credit shell is utilized by the passenger, he/she has to pay to the agent and not the airline. But in case if the amount is not utilized, the money will go back to the same account of the agent from which the ticket amount was paid to the airline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/refund-credit-shell-available-on-air-tickets-booked-before-lockdown-centre-tells-sc/story-9RqjUvAuLEZgCg5Xi61z5L.html

22-09-2020||India||Court stays arrest of 3 accused in Rajasthan Palace Hotel Sale||The Rajasthan High court on Tuesday stayed the arrest warrant against former disinvestment secretary Pradip Baijal and two others accused of causing Rs 244 crore loss to the government through the sale of ITDC-owned Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur in 2002.The high court also asked the special CBI court hearing the case to summon the accused through bailable warrants, a counsel for the accused said.Last week, the trial court ordered the registration of an FIR against former union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, then department’s secretary Pradip Baijal, Lazard India Ltd managing director Ashish Guha, valuer Kantilal Karamsey and Bharat Hotels director Jyotsana Suri for the sale of the hotel.Tuesday’s order by a single-judge bench of the high court was on a plea filed by Baijal, Guha and Suri, challenging the trial court’s directions. “We argued that the accused could not be summoned through an arrest warrant in the first place,” a counsel said.Arun Shourie had also moved the high court for a stay on the arrest warrant but his petition is yet to be listed for hearing.The fifth accused, Kantilal Karamsey, the owner of the valuation firm Kanti Karamsey and Company, has not yet moved the high court.Shourie was the minister in charge of divestment during the Atal Bihari Vajpaye-led NDA government when the Udaipur property, owned by the public sector India Tourism Development Corporation, was sold to Bharat Hotels Ltd, a private company.In last Wednesday’s order, the CBI court rejected the closure report submitted in the case by the Central Bureau of Investigation in August 2019, and asked the agency to reinvestigate it.The hotel was sold for Rs 7.52 crore. During the CBI’s preliminary investigation, it was valued at Rs 252 crore, suggesting a loss of Rs 244 crore to the exchequer.The CBI registered a case on August 13, 2014, that some unknown officers from the Department of Disinvestment, in connivance with a private hotelier during 1999-2002, renovated and then sold the hotel at a throwaway price.While ordering the reopening of the investigation, the trial court had also directed that the property should be placed under the charge of the Rajasthan government until the matter is disposed of.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-stays-arrest-of-3-accused-in-rajasthan-palace-hotel-sale/story-iLJtqhOPAuWhIB1xhYOibM.html

22-09-2020||India||Maoist posters resurface in Bengal, third incident since August||Four handwritten posters bearing the name of Communist Party of India (Maoist) were found on Monday at Sarenga in West Bengal’s Bankura district where the Maoists had a stronghold till the Trinamool Congress (TMC) came into power in 2011. This is the third time since August that such posters have been spotted in the western districts of the state.Two of these posters were found inside a compound where an office of the state land and land reforms department is located. Incidentally, Monday was the foundation day of the CPI (Maoist). On September 21, 2004, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist), People’s War and the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) merged into one organisation. A significant part of the local population in these areas comprises tribals. On the eve of Independence Day last month, around a dozen posters were recovered from three villages in the Bhulabheda area of Jhargram district, another erstwhile hotbed of Maoist activity.The posters urged the public to observe Independence Day as ‘kala divas’, or a black day. On September 4, some handwritten posters were found in Belpahari, which is also in Jhargram district. “There is no evidence to prove that Maoists had put up the posters on Monday because they have no presence whatsoever in the region. All Maoists surrendered in or after 2011. They have been rehabilitated by the government. Most of them have got government jobs. The rest are waiting for their turn,” Surya Shankar Mondal, officer-in-charge, Sarenga police station, told HT. “To establish a base, the Maoists need the support of local villagers. That is not possible anymore because perception of the local people has changed,” added Mondal. A senior state intelligence branch (IB) officer said on condition of anonymity that the government is not sitting idle because West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram had virtually become a ‘liberated zone’ of the Maoists between 2009 and 2011.“The problem was tackled efficiently but we still cannot take chances,” the IB officer said.Last month, chief minister Mamata Banerjee directed the police top brass to reactivate the counter intelligence force (CIF) that was created a decade ago to combat Maoists.On September 7, Virendra, the director general of state police, visited Jhargram and West Midnapore districts and reviewed security arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-posters-resurface-in-bengal-third-incident-since-august/story-27whJMxPrR17M2FgYGkLzN.html
22-09-2020||India||PDP may hit streets to seek Mehbooba Mufti’s release, says party leader||The PDP says it may take to streets to secure party chief Mehbooba Mufti’s release - who has been in detention under the Public Safety Act since August last year - if all other means do not yield results. In an interview to HT’s Mir Ehsan, Youth PDP president Waheed ur Rehman Parra conceded that the party definitely took a hit by the desertions, but asserted that it will bounce back with its core philosophy. Reflecting on the new Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, the leader said he is “making efforts”. The PDP recently resumed political activity after they were allowed to hold two big meetings in Srinagar.Q. The PDP organised its first meeting after August 5 last year, what was discussed in the meeting?It was much more than a meeting. It was an attempt to free oneself from unofficial house arrest. We discussed August 5, 2019, and the post-scenario, insecurities and challenges confronting people. We strongly reject unconstitutional, undemocratic treatment meted out to Kashmir.Q. Are all the PDP leaders free?Yes, except Party President Mehbooba Mufti.Q. Do you think, government is trying to stop the PDP from resuming its activities?This sense of unfreedom, absence of democracy and absence of politics is self-created by the BJP. Not just the PDP, the entire Kashmir is being treated similarly. The only difference is that the PDP continues to be on their target and they continue to attack it by using tactics for limiting our space. They want a BJP narrative here and help them gain ground at the cost of local parties, especially the PDP. At a time when we as a population desperately need 4G communication for education and healthcare sectors, the BJP is busy politicising 4G for the sake of their personal agendas of letting no dissenting voices escape this space. Is this what integration looks like? Rest of India studies and heals but Kashmiris are deprived everyday for every little opportunity.Q. After August 5, many leaders, especially former ministers and legislators, left the PDP, do you think it has weakened the party?Yes, many have left, such exits disclose a pattern which reveals that this episode was engineered by the politically macho to thwart PDP efforts and subvert its strength. Those who have exited, have been responsible for eroding party space by all means and when nothing worked finally created factions. The party is definitely affected but it will bounce back with its core philosophy, not by losing individuals.Q. Why is PDP president Mehbooba Mufti still under detention while all other leaders released?Mehbooba Mufti cannot be threatened or coerced into serfdom. They treat her stance and voice as a challenge to their politics. The attempt to install puppets is not what democracy is. The BJP should be ready to accept real political challenges. Just to exercise their own power they are keeping her silenced using extreme laws. If one wants to really see what Kashmiri politics will look like, they can’t understand even the mood of the people until she’s free and hits the ground. It is difficult to control Mehbooba Mufti and BJP knows it very well. They failed to control her while in alliance and that must be their concern and fear.Q. Is the PDP trying to launch an agitation to press the government to release the party president?Yes, we have approached the Supreme Court. If it doesn’t work, we will raise our voice democratically. And if need arises, we will be forced to hit streets to seek her release.Q. Do you have hope from the new Lt Governor?He is definitely making efforts at his level but it is too small an institution to address our anxiety, anger or our problems. People want the PM to respond to Kashmir and his silence is definitely not acceptable here. This is a negative and controlled peace.Q. Being a youth leader what is the feeling of youth in J&K and what should New Delhi do?There is a huge sense of resentment among young people, but they are scared and suffocated. Silence in itself is a statement.It is the level of disappointment among youngsters towards Delhi. The Centre should come out of denial and address the issues, talk politically, initiate dialogue with all stakeholders.Q. Is it true security and government accommodation of many PDP leaders have been withdrawn?All of our leaders are out of government accommodation and without security cover. One or two PSOs have been assigned to protect a few leaders but that is negligible cover. Given the present circumstances or as per SOP followed earlier. Security is not a privilege here but a survival of means to ensure democratic space. It is for the first time, we see the state using security as a tool to undermine us and empower a select group of people at the cost of our life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-may-hit-streets-to-seek-mehbooba-mufti-s-release-says-party-leader/story-ejyXWmv8KhnELCxTaUKzIK.html

A Swiggy spokesperson in an email reply said over the last couple of days, Swiggy had a constructive dialogue with its partners to explain the revised pay-outs and assuage their concerns and a large number of executives have understood the strong earning potential, as a result of which more 3,700 partners have logged on to Swiggy in the last three days.We are disheartened by the many unfortunate incidents where our delivery partners are being intimidated by a smaller set of people, including external parties who are resorting to instigation and coercion No significant disruption. It is coming back to normal in most parts of the city, the spokesperson told PTI.In fact, in a sentiment survey conducted by Swiggy three days ago, 75 per cent from over a 1,000 delivery partners stated that they would like to resume deliveries, the Bengaluru-based firm claimed, adding it was working with the authorities to ensure that those who want to make an honest living with Swiggy were allowed to do so.With the beginning of the cricketing season and the surge in orders in the city, those who delivered with Swiggy over the past three days made an average of over Rs 85 per order and high performing partners made close to Rs 250 per order, the email claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swiggy-delivery-executives-on-strike-in-hyderabad-company-says-no-disruption-in-service/story-dViMxdUzQ2ead5vBdtHY1N.html

22-09-2020||India||India’s projects in Africa ‘empower rather than extract’: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday held up India as Africa’s most steadfast partner, whose projects would “empower rather than extract from local communities” and ensure sustainable development. Jaishankar didn’t refer to other countries involved in the development of Africa in his remarks, made during a virtual event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, but it appeared he was comparing India’s track record to that of China. Describing maritime security as the new frontier in cooperation between the two sides, he said India offers Africa “an honest partnership and room to maximise its space under the sun and multiply its options” in all spheres. “Africa is, of course, not without its options and by no stretch does India claim to be the only one. However, what we can promise is to be Africa’s most steadfast partner,” he said in his speech at the CII-Exim Bank digital conclave on the India-Africa project partnership. Pointing to India’s partnership with Africa, Jaishankar said the country has implemented 194 developmental projects in 37 African countries and is working on 77 more in 29 countries with a total outlay $11.6 billion. These projects, which are in sectors such as infrastructure, ICT, power generation, water, roads, railways and agriculture, foster entrepreneurship and “empower rather than extract from local communities”, he said. The projects also marry transparency and technology with imperatives of social and ecological sustainability, he said. “This is the template we offer our African friends,” he added. In recent years, China has faced criticism for bringing in large numbers of its nationals to work on projects in Africa and for “debt trap” financing of projects under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Against the backdrop of the border standoff in Ladakh, India has stepped up developmental assistance and projects for countries in its immediate neighbourhood. Jaishankar also highlighted the importance of the Indian Ocean in ties between India and Africa, saying it has “acquired even greater salience” and the two sides “need to cooperate to preserve and protect it”. In the field of trade, the minister noted that India is Africa’s third-largest export and Indian investments in the continent total $54 billion. He also welcomed the coming into force of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement because of the possibility of increased business. India’s oil and gas firms have invested $7 billion in a gas field in Mozambique and $0.5 billion in South Sudan, and these make Africa a “crucial energy partner for India”, he said. Jaishankar also pointed to India’s maintenance of critical supply chains to provide medical supplies to Africa amid the Covid-19 pandemic as another instance of its reliability as a partner. Describing the pandemic as the most debilitating global event of the past 80 years, he said it posed a challenge to the global economy, reliability of supply chains and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. “For India, Africa’s rise as one of the global system’s poles is not just desirable, it is absolutely necessary. In fact, it is fundamental to our foreign policy thinking. Broader global rebalancing is incomplete without the genuine emergence of Africa.

22-09-2020||India||Lok Sabha takes up three labour codes amid boycott by Opposition||The labour reforms that are being undertaken by the government will prove to be a milestone for the welfare of workers, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Lok Sabha took up bills on the labour codes, which were moved by Gangwar, amid boycott of the House proceedings by several opposition parties, including the Congress, in protest against the suspension of eight Rajya Sabha members. While moving the bills for consideration and passage, the minister said the government has come out with the changes in the legislations after extensive consultations with state governments and other stakeholders. He said about three-fourth of the recommendations of the standing committee, which scrutinised the codes, have been incorporated in the bills by the government. On Saturday, Gangwar had introduced the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and the Code on Social Security, 2020. Over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and one (Code on Wages Bill, 2019) of them has already been passed, according to the minister. The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, will consolidate and amend the laws regulating the occupational safety, health and working conditions of persons employed in an establishment and related matters. The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, seeks to consolidate and amend the laws relating to trade unions, conditions of employment in industrial establishments or undertaking, investigation and settlement of industrial disputes. The Code on Social Security, 2020, will amend and consolidate laws relating to social security with the goal to extend social security to all employees and workers either in the organised sector or the unorganised sector. Gangwar said efforts have been made to work out a balance between welfare of workers and ease of doing business for the industry. Starting the debate on the three bills, Pallab Lochan Das of the BJP said that it is for the first time that such extensive labour reforms are being undertaken. Although the country has 44 labour laws for the past several decades, the standard of living of workers has not improved, he said. BJD member Pinaki Misra said there could have been minimum health and safety standards in the code, and also suggested that the government have a relook at the definition of ‘workers’. While supporting the bill, he also said that certain provisions needed to be relooked at.Margani Bharat of the YSR Congress said the codes will push forward ease of doing business in the country as well as help in attracting more foreign direct investments. According to BJP’s Virendra Kumar, the codes will help in ensuring the welfare of labourers and also reduce ‘inspector raj’. Another BJP member Dilip Ghosh said the codes will ensure that all stakeholders work with discipline and also that corruption does not happen in labour unions. Ghosh, who is from West Bengal, also claimed the situation of labourers was bad in the state. TDP’s Jayadev Galla and Dileshwar Kamait (JD-U) also supported the codes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-takes-up-three-labour-codes-amid-boycott-by-opposition/story-5xvLzvKwGFBYTMq0Yb8KkM.html
22-09-2020||India||‘New Parliament building to cost around Rs 970 crore’: Centre in Lok Sabha||The estimated cost of construction of the new Parliament building is Rs 971 crore, union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri informed Parliament on Tuesday. It is an increase of Rs 82 crore from the Centre’s initial estimate.The tender for construction of the new Parliament building is under scrutiny, while architectural plans for other buildings are under planning stage, Puri said in response to a question raised by All India Trinamool Congress(AITC) MP Mala Roy in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.“The estimated cost for Construction of new Parliament Building is Rs 971 crore. Estimated cost of other buildings and development/ redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue shall be worked out after finalization of plans,” Puri said.Last week, Tata Projects Limited emerged as the lowest of the two bidders for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex by quoting a bid of Rs 861.90 crore. According to the Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) tender, the estimated cost of construction for the new building is Rs 889 crore.In response to a question from Trinamool MP, seeking “the rationale behind the project in light of the fact that economy is in doldrums,” Puri said that the facilities and amenities of the 93-year-old existing Parliament building “are highly inadequate to meet the current demand of the Parliament.”The Central Vista redevelopment project has come under criticism from different quarters. While the Opposition has called for suspending around Rs 20,000 crore project due to the pandemic, some conservationists have argued that it would change the historic nature of Lutyens’ Delhi.“The existing Parliament House Building was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927; this “building is already 93 years old and has since been declared heritage grade-I building. Its facilities and amenities are highly inadequate to meet the current demand of the Parliament. There is an acute shortage of office space and there are no individual chambers for Members of Parliament. This building was not meant for bicameral Parliament and has been over-stressed through large scale retrofitting done over the years,” Puri said.“The other buildings on the Central Vista were built after Independence, i.e. Krishi Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, etc. These buildings are more than 50 years old and there is a shortage of working space, parking, amenities and services in these buildings for an efficient office atmosphere… The Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of New Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi. However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking, etc. The unorganized vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. Therefore, there is a need for its upgradation of the central vista,” Puri added.Puri said that in the current economic scenario, the project will generate a large number of direct and indirect employment.The new Parliament building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures. Work on the new Parliament, a ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building, is expected to begin after the ongoing monsoon session.According to the tender for its construction, the new building is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parliament-building-to-cost-around-rs-970-crore-centre-in-lok-sabha/story-y7HMlc8M72ApY45XxuHlYN.html
22-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha holds crucial meeting as Opposition boycotts Parliament proceedings||The Rajya Sabha has called its Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting on Tuesday after a day-full of hectic activities, protests and passage of several bills. But the Opposition, which announced to boycott the Upper House for the remainder of the session, will not attend the meeting. TMC’s Derek O’Brien, SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav, Congress’s Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh and RJD’s Manoj Kumar Jha are the five Opposition leaders who will skip 11-member committee meeting. The BAC is a panel led by Rajya Saha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to discuss the weekly agenda of the House. The meeting has been called amid indications that the House might be adjourned in a day or two. The Opposition parties also alleged that they were informed just an hour ago about the BAC meeting, leaving them little time to attend the meeting. Rajya Sabha officials pointed out that the meeting was decided at a short notice and all efforts were made to inform the members of the panel as quickly as possible. On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed the two key farm bills - Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, amid fierce protests in the house. While the Opposition claimed that the bills were anti-farmer, the government says that these bills will help boost the farming sector through private investments. On Monday, eight Opposition MPs were suspended for unruly behaviour. On Monday, the opposition demonstrated its disapproval in the Upper House of Parliament against the suspension of MPs and passage of these bills and boycotted the Rajya Sabha for the remaining part of the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-opposition-boycotts-parliament-proceedings-rajya-sabha-business-advisory-committee-meet-called-at-6-pm/story-BLnEc2atHd0kSKWKkb3xRI.html

About a 400-member strong Greyhound forces, the anti-Maoist wing of the Telangana Police have been combing the forests all along the Pranahita river on the Telangana-Maharashtra border for the last three days, looking for a group of Maoists headed by Mailarapu Bhaskar alias Adellu, the Telangana state committee member in-charge of the Kumaram Bheem-Mancherial squad. The police force has deployed drones equipped with high-range cameras to track the movement of Maoists in Koutala, Bejjur, Dahegaon, Neelwai and Chennur areas from Pranahitha river to Godavari river. District in-charge superintendent of police V Satyanarayana told reporters that the police were confident of nabbing the squad, as they had completely sealed the area all along the river so that they do not go back into neighbouring Maharashtra. “We are using modern technology including drone surveillance to track their movement,” the in-charge SP said after his extensive tour in Maoist-infested villages of Chintala Manepalli block on Monday.These drone cameras are presently being used by security forces in Chhattisgarh forests to track the movement of Maoists. In Telangana, they have not been used till date, a senior police official familiar with the development said.The police suspect that Bhaskar had been entrusted with the task of recruiting cadres for the CPI (Maoist) party in the bordering villages so that the party could regain its lost hold in Telangana. The Maoists have called for a week-long celebration of the completion of 16 years of the formation of CPI (Maoist) till this week-end. In the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, the police managed to track a Maoist squad in the Kadamba forest range of the district. In exchange of fire with the police, two Maoists were killed. They were later identified as Chukkalu of Chhattisgarh and Jugane Badi Rao from Neradigonda mandal of Adilabad district. “However, Bhaskar and three others managed to escape from the site of the encounter,” the in-charge SP said. The police have taken into custody as many as 15 people who were understood to have been recruited by the Maoist party in different parts of Asifabad Kumaram Bheem district like Utnoor, Sirpur (U), Tiryani and Asifabad mandals. They are being questioned to know the whereabouts of Bhaskar and his team members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-with-high-range-cameras-help-telangana-cops-track-maoists-deep-inside-forests/story-LMATJHNenGPUCQjl4YXtcK.html

But the Union health ministry said that the country’s active cases are less than a fifth of the total tally.Addressing a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the number of Covid-19 related fatalities in India per million population is among the lowest in the world. “It stands at 64 for India and 123 for world,” said Bhushan.He also said that daily recoveries from Covid-19 are more than the number of new infections reported per day since past four consecutive days.“We get swayed by the narrative that India has over 50 lakh cases, but we forget that nearly 45 lakh people have already recovered,” the health secretary said.“India has highest number of recovered cases of Covid-19 in the world - 44,97,867,” he added. The ministry had earlier said that the country registered over 1 lakh Covid-19 recoveries in the last 24 hours, the highest number of single-day recoveries.The government’s data said that India’s Covid-19 cases share is 17.7 per cent of global infections, while those who have recuperated are 19.5 per cent of total recoveries in world.The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the country currently stands at 1.59 per cent. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), CFR is a measure of the severity of a disease and is defined as the proportion of reported cases of a specified disease or condition which are fatal within a specified time.With a spike of 75,083 new cases and 1,053 deaths in the last 24 hours, India’s Covid-19 count crossed 55 lakh on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-get-swayed-health-ministry-highlights-covid-19-recoveries-as-india-s-tally-crosses-5-5-million/story-IQ4oCtWnkJplnXe0rOcKqJ.html

Their lawyer Satish Maneshinde said the plea will come up for hearing on Wednesday before a bench headed by Justice Sarang Kotwal.The siblings filed the petition on a day when a special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, court extended Chakraborty’s judicial custody till October 6.She was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on September 8 for her alleged involvement in a drugs case linked to Rajput’s death on June 14. She was then sent to judicial custody for 14 days. The NDPS court had on September 11 rejected bail pleas of Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and others in the case, noting that there was no “reasonable ground” at present for not connecting the accused with the crime.The actor, however, maintains that she is innocent and has been falsely implicated. She also claimed that during her custody, she was coerced into making incriminatory confessions and that the statement was retracted on September 8 itself.Before the 28-year-old actor’s arrest, the NCB confronted her with Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda and his house staff Dipesh Sawant to ascertain their roles in an alleged drug racket.Also read: NCB to summon Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh, Simone KhambattaChakraborty has been charged under Section 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import); 20(b)(ii) (punishment for contravention in relation to the cannabis plant and cannabis where such contravention relates to small quantity, involves quantity lesser than commercial quantity but greater than small quantity, involves commercial quantity); 22 (punishment for contravention in relation to psychotropic substances); 27A (punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders); 28 (punishment for attempts to commit offences); and 29 (punishment for abetment and criminal conspiracy) of the NDPS act.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-brother-showik-move-bail-plea-in-bombay-hc/story-Tesg6ixXl6xmZOrUa0t27L.html
22-09-2020||India||120 tribals in jail under anti-terror law for 3 years, trial yet to begin||Deep inside the Sukma jungle, the serenity of the small village Burakapal, situated just 200 meters from nearby security forces camp, is disturbed only by women nonchalantly engaged in their chores and kids boisterously playing with slingshot.A few men can be spotted in the village but they fear interacting with outsiders. For more than three years, things have not been normal in the village since 37 tribal residents of this village were arrested and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act ( UAPA).In April 2017, just 100 meters from this village, Burkapal, 25 personnel of 74th battalion of the CRPF, including an inspector-rank officer, were killed in a deadly Maoist ambush.After the brutal killing of 76 personnel of CRPF in 2010, the ‘Burkapal Attack’ is one of deadliest hits on security forces in the last decade in the Bastar region.The troopers were guarding the Dornapal-Jagargonda road construction work near Burkapal village when the Maoists attacked. In the next few days, the Chhattisgarh police registered a case in Chintagufa police station and booked 120 tribals of six villages – Burkapal, Gondapalli, Chintagufa, Talmetla, Koraigundum and Tonguda - under UAPA and other IPC sections.“Within a few days after the attack, 37 residents of my village were booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other sections of Indian Penal Code and were sent to jail,” said Muchaki Handa, a 30-year-old newly elected sarpanch of the village, whose elder brother is also in jail for his alleged involvement in the attack.The sarpanch claimed that every male who was present in the village that day was booked.“Every male and even some teenagers who were living in the village were booked under UAPA and other sections of IPC and only those who were working in cities were left unnamed, more as a matter of chance than design. I was working in a grocery store in Andhra Pradesh therefore was not named, but my brother was booked. Not a single person was involved in the attack but police have booked them accusing them to be Maoists,” said the sarpanch.For more than three years, the trial in these cases is yet to start and bail has not been granted even in a single case registered under the UAPA. As per the police records, total 120 villagers of three villages, including 37 of Burkapal, were booked under UAPA for their involvement in the attack.“Seven juveniles of my village were also picked up and booked under sections of the IPC. After spending eighteen months in Dantewada jail they have been released,” said the sarpanch.“The incident took place when I was playing just outside the village with some friends. We heard gunshots and rushed towards our huts. Few days after the attack, my father was picked up and later one day when I was sleeping in my house in the afternoon, security forces took me to the police station,” said Bheema Sodi, pointing towards the area where he was playing.Sodi’s father Muda is in jail and was booked under the UAPA.Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist and lawyer of some of the accused booked for the attack, said 120 innocent people from villages around Burkapal were booked under the act in this case.“Till now the trial has not started and has been delayed solely for the reason of the large number of accused and the police expressing its inability to make arrangements to produce them before a court regularly. The police said they did not have enough constables. And the court was initially not willing to entertain them in batches,” Bhatia said, adding that the police arrested people without necessary investigation and culpatory evidence.Bhatia said that during the lockdown period they should be given bail and after that they should be produced in court regularly.“The police framed innocent people under the UAPA and other sections of IPC from the area where the Maoist action occurred. The trial is still in the initial stage of “framing of charges”. It is now three years since the 120 accused are in Jagdalpur jail. Such prisoners should also be categorised as political prisoners. They should be granted bail during lockdown and subsequently the trial should be carried out in fast track mode,” Bhatia added.Bastar police have denied the allegation.“Due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, there was hindrance in the trial of the case. Bastar Police are committed to ensuring a just and speedy trial of the case,” said IG Bastar Sunderaj P, rubbishing her allegation.“In April 2017, we lost 25 of our CRPF jawans in one of the cruelest attacks by Maoists on security forces, who were out on an operation to facilitate the road construction work. During the course of investigation we have arrested more than 120 Maoists cadres and their supporters. This stringent action has not only broken the network of Maoist cadres in the area, but also provided tactical advantage to the security forces during “Operation Prakhar” which was conducted in 2017-2018. As far as prosecution of the case in the court is concerned, Bastar police would extend its sincere cooperation in this regard,” he said.The activists said availability of only one trial court for the UAPA cases in Jagdalpur was a major reason for delay in start of trial.“In my view, these cases should also be tried in other sessions courts so that such cases get distributed over various courts and the trial moves faster,” said Bhatia.Another lawyer, Sanjay Jaiswal, who is the advocate for most of the accused in Burkapal case, said this is an undeniable fact that the inordinate delay is due to the tardy process in the court.“The trial will start after everyone is chargehseeted,” said Jaiswal.Soni Sori, who has been raising her voice against the arrest of tribals, said the government is not listening to the anguish of innocent tribals.“There are no men left in the village. After the attack, the security forces put innocent tribals of Burkapal and other villages in jail without any evidence. I visited the village twice. Quite unsurprisingly, women and most of the remaining tribal persons ran away to Andhra Pradesh or in the jungle due to the fear of police atrocity. The security forces gave the gullible women an assurance that they know that people of Burkapal village are not the accused and hence the men returned. The forces then did a volte face, cordoned off the villages and arrested them without any evidence. Can you imagine that even the trial has not started in the last 3.5 years after their arrest? Is this justice? Why is the government not intervening?” said Sori.DM Awasthi, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh, said that the accused have the right to have a fair trial in the court and he will instruct police in this regard.“I have not been told about the delay in trial and no one has complained to me. I will enquire about the issue and give necessary instruction so that the trial would start. Everyone has the right to have a fair trial in the court,” Awasthi said. Sujata Jaswal, the government counsel, Jagdalpur said that the challan has been submitted in the court in May and June in Burkapal case.“The trial has not started yet due to the lockdown. As per instructions of the high court, only the necessary cases are being heard in the court. The trial of the case will start after further instructions by the court regarding the routine work,” said Jaswal. Back in Burkapal village, Jogi Sodi (25), whose husband is in jail is worried and asked the sarpanch about the case.“I have not seen my husband since three years… Will he come this year or will we have to wait more ...” she asked Handa, who nodded his head in reply and started consoling her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/120-tribals-in-jail-under-anti-terror-law-for-3-years-trial-yet-to-begin/story-uRDQr8ClO5XhjXysqZJbnL.html

There are two approaches, one is to standardise the greenhouse technology. This (Leh) place has high intercity of solar even during peak winter period so we are working on a passive greenhouse. We will be able to grow cabbage, cauliflower, and even tomato even in the month of January where the temperature drops till -25 degrees. We have an underground greenhouse as well. Another approach is to develop the storage of vegetables grown in summers. It is zero energy-based storage technology. Potato, cabbage, cauliflower, Raddish, carrot can be stored for 4-5 months,” said Chaurasia.Chaurasia also highlighted that DISAR is also cultivating superfoods like Quinoa, chia seed, seabuckthorn, and Goji Berries which are exclusively grown in Leh.“Oxygen level is low and under stress condition in this area. So, we require foods which are enriched with nutrition. We are cultivating a superfood which is a food which you consume less and it is more effective. We are cultivating foods like Quinoa, chia seed, seabuckthorn, and Goji Berries,” he added.In August last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned a special plant named ‘solo’ which is also known as the Sanjeevani herb that is found in Ladakh.Describing the utilities of solo herb which is known as Sanjeevani, Dr Chaurasia said, “Himalaya is a treasure of herbs. Sanjeevani is one of the herbs found in the Himalayas. Its scientific name is Rhodiola. It cures fatigue, mountain sickness, and works on memory boosting. The roots of Sanjeevani have the fragrance of a rose. DRDO is working with UT administration for mass cultivation of it.”DIHAR has worked on the microgreen plant which will help jawans grow plants in harsh conditions and can be grown in 10-15 days. The product can be used as a seasoning for farmers.Talking about microgreens, Dr Dorjee, a scientist in DIHAR said, “In the far area, Army is deployed in harsh conditions and there is no availability of substrate or soil to grow vegetables. Through technology, we will be able to provide these microgreen plants to army jawan when he is having lunch or breakfast in those areas.”“To grow these plants, we have to ensure that ingredients need to remain minimum like cocopeat, and after 10-15 days, these plants are ready for consumption. It can be used for seasoning too,” he added.Dorjee further said that around 20 vegetables can be grown in this medium and it is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-army-prepares-for-long-winter-at-lac-drdo-works-on-developing-vegetables-under-intense-weather/story-oKj99I8wPauDiQUYVUsz7O.html

22-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha passes 7 key bills in three and half hours||In one of the most productive days in its history, Rajya Sabha on Tuesday in a matter of three and half hours passed seven key bills including one that removes cereals, pulses and onion from the essential commodities list and another that abolishes penalty for certain offences by companies.This after most of the opposition including the Congress, Left parties, the TMC, the Samajwadi Party and the NCP decided to boycott House proceedings in protest against the suspension of eight MPs for the remainder of the session for unruly behaviour.Only members from the ruling BJP and its ally JD-U and those of parties such as AIADMK, BJD, YSR-Congress and TDP, which have been extending support to the Modi government on various issues, participated in the debates on the bills.In most bills, the members participation was sparse and the minister’s reply brief.The Upper House took up government legislative business after nearly an hour of discussion over the conduct of opposition MPs during the passage of two agriculture reform bills on Sunday, with Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu saying the suspension could be revoked if the members expressed regret over their action.First, it passed a bill to declare five newly-established Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) as institutions of national importance. The crucial Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which removes cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and removes stockholding limits on them, was passed next. This bill is part of the agriculture reforms bills that the government is pushing to raise farm incomes. The bills passed on Sunday gave farmers the freedom to sell produce anywhere in the country and enter into forward contracts with companies. Rajya Sabha also passed amendments to the Bank Regulation Act to bring cooperative banks under the supervision of the RBI in a bid to protect the interest of depositors. Thereafter the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which removes the penalty for certain offences, was passed. The National Forensic Sciences University Bill, 2020 and the Rashtriya Rakash University Bill were passed in quick succession. Thereafter the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020 to relax time limit on compliance with tax laws, GST payment and filing in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 as well as the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020 replace emergency ordinances. The sitting of the Rajya Sabha was extended by just over an hour beyond the scheduled time to allow the passage of the bills. The legislative business started at 10.29 hours and ended at 14.03 hrs - 214 minutes in all. All the seven bills have already been passed by Lok Sabha and will now be sent to the President for assent. Once he gives his assent, they will become the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-7-key-bills-in-three-and-half-hours/story-V3FgFKJFscOdconKKhRUUO.html

RDIF will supply 100 million doses to Dr Reddy’s.The RDIF has also reached agreements with Indian manufacturers to produce 300 million doses of the shot in India. Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine.Sputnik-V doses supplied in India will likely be a combination of Indian- and Russian-made doses, Sapra said, adding that RDIF and Dr Reddy’s would soon identify potential manufacturers in India.The RDIF has said vaccine deliveries to India could begin in late 2020, but Sapra suggested it could take longer. “I think it’s going to be several months before we accomplish all the steps in the process,” he added.India, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, is the world’s second worst affected country by Covid-19 behind the United States. For weeks, it has reported the world’s highest daily jump in infections, which reached a total of 5.6 million on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-trials-for-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-could-start-in-next-few-weeks/story-7u9nVvx7DvRCypoiEMQGWP.html

22-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session 2020: Essential Commodities bill gets Rajya Sabha nod||Parliament on Tuesday passed a bill to remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities after the Rajya Sabha (RS) gave its nod.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which was approved by the Lok Sabha (LS) on September 15, was passed by a voice vote in the RS. The bill replaces an ordinance that was promulgated in June.The bill is also aimed at removing the fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in their business operations.The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply would lead to harnessing economies of scale and attract private sector and foreign direct investments in the agriculture sector, the government had said earlier. Replying to a short debate, Minister of State (MoS) for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Danve Raosaheb Dadarao said the stock limit conditions imposed through the law were hindering investments in the agriculture infrastructure.The amendments to the six-and-half-decade law provides that stock-holding limit on commodities would only be imposed under exceptional circumstances such as national calamities and famine with a surge in prices, the minister said. Processors and value chain participants would be exempted from the stock limit, he added.The minister said the move would boost investments in the agriculture sector and would also create more storage capacities to reduce loss of crops after harvest.“This amendment is in favour of both farmers and consumers,” he added.The changes in the 1955 law is an important step by the government to achieve its target of doubling farmers’ income and also for the ease of doing business, the minister said.He said the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was brought when the country was not self-sufficient in food grains production. But now the situation has changed, and as a result, the amendment was required, he said.While India has become surplus in most agri-commodities, farmers have been unable to get better prices due to lack of investments in cold storage, warehouses, processing and export. Farmers suffer huge losses when there are bumper harvests, especially of perishable commodities, he said.Parliament on Tuesday also passed a legislation to declare the five new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Surat, Bhopal, Bhagalpur, Agartala and Raichur as institutions of national importance.The Indian Institutes of Information Technology Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was introduced in the RS by education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Monday. The bill was passed by the LS in March.

22-09-2020||India||Over 50% mobile, electronic manufacturers registered with BIS are Chinese: Govt||The Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) has informed Parliament that over 50% of the manufacturers of mobile phones and electronics registered with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in the last four years are Chinese companies and at least 123 Chinese products failed compliance norms since 2015. “A total of 13,752 registrations were granted to the Chinese manufacturers based on tests conducted at laboratories recognised by BIS. The detail is available in public domain at http://electronicstds.gov.in,” the ministry said in its response on Monday. According to the website, a total of 23,838 manufacturers are registered on the website. BIS is the National Standard Body of India (NSBI), which is notified under the BIS Act, 2016 and works under the aegis of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. BIS seeks harmonious development of the activities of standardisation, marking and quality certification of goods. The ministry was responding to an unstarred question in Parliament on Monday following a rise in tension with China along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the past few months. There has been a major push back against Chinese companies that dominate the electronics and telecom industry in the country since the worsening of ties between New Delhi and Beijing. The government in response to a separate question said it placed no ban on imports of electronic equipment from China. “To boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the electronics value chain, the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for large scale electronics manufacturing was granted Cabinet approval on March 20,” it added. Under the scheme, the “Domestic Value Addition is expected to grow from the current 15% - 20% to 35-40% in case of mobile phones and from 35%- 40% to 45%-50% for electronic components,” the response stated. The ministry listed 123 Chinese products that failed to satisfy compliance norms since 2015.“Among the product categories notified under the Electronics and IT Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012, 123 Chinese products have failed to comply with the notified Indian standard since February, 2015,” the response added. Liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, notebook personal computers (PCs), microwave ovens, fixed general purpose light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires, printers, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, mobile phones and scanners are among the Chinese products that failed compliance norms. RK Bhatnagar, a former technology advisor to the department of telecommunications (DoT), said that it is a theoretical exercise and by no means conclusive. “The bigger question is how many of these Chinese companies are manufacturing these products because that number will be substantially lower,” he said. “The registration is only on paper. The actual number of functional manufacturers will depend on how many set up their units and sourced equipment via imports or otherwise,” he said . “Actual manufacturers may well be less than 100,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-2020-over-50-mobile-gadget-manufacturers-registered-with-bis-are-chinese-says-govt/story-vWnl5nmC46JZ8kPmVNaoJO.html

Details of these military positions are outlined in a report released on Tuesday by Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy. The new positions include three airbases, five permanent air defence positions and five heliports. “Construction on four of those new heliports started only after the onset of the current Ladakh crisis in May,” said the report authored by Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security and a military analyst with Stratfor. “The 2017 Doklam crisis appears to have shifted China’s strategic objectives, with China more than doubling its total number of airbases, air defence positions, and heliports near the Indian border over the past three years,” it added. The Chinese military is building four air defence positions within existing airbases, and other facilities such as additional runways and shelters that will help obscure combat aircraft from observation. It has also been deploying more air defence systems and fighter aircraft to existing facilities, the report said. Amid the current standoff in Ladakh that became public in early May, there have been numerous reports of China deploying additional troops, special forces, armoured units and air defence units on the Tibetan plateau. Analysis of open source satellite imagery has shown that China has created a surface-to-air missile site on the banks of Mansarovar Lake in Tibet, and is developing similar facilities to cover sensitive stretches of the disputed border in the Doklam and Sikkim sectors. A graphic included in the Stratfor report showed that China had only one heliport and one air defence site on the Tibetan plateau in 2016, and there was a substantial expansion and upgrade of its military infrastructure in the area since 2019. Last year, China developed four airbases, four air defence sites, one heliport and one electronic warfare station. China has developed four airbases, four heliports and one air defence site on the Tibetan plateau this year. Work on heliports and one airbase began after the tensions in Ladakh. “The rapid expansion of permanent Chinese military infrastructure points to intentions that span a wider timeframe than current and recent border standoffs,” the report said. Also Read: India-China military commanders to meet at least twice more before disengagement commencesA significant portion of China’s recent infrastructure developments is aimed at “strengthening its ability to project air power along the entire Indian border” and exploiting potential “gaps in India’s capabilities”. The report surmised that such “long-term developments rise above the more immediate deployments that China conducted in its previous border standoffs with India, and indicates future intent to ramp up Chinese assertive military posturing in border disputes with India”. “China’s strategy aims to confront India with an insurmountable challenge in territorial disputes by leaning on broad support capabilities that provide Beijing with a tremendous ability to mobilise forces into disputed border areas,” it said, adding that such an approach is similar to Beijing’s strategy in the South China Sea, where a build-up of permanent defence facilities supports Chinese “localised military superiority and significantly raises the potential cost of military opposition to Beijing’s maritime claims in the region”. By applying the same strategy on the LAC, China aims to “discourage Indian resistance or military action during future border disputes by ostentatiously demonstrating its ability and intent to engage in military confrontations”. Following a string of smaller skirmishes that culminated in the June 15 clash, which killed 20 Indian soldiers and also caused unspecified Chinese casualties, the two sides have deployed around 50,000 additional troops each along the LAC. After several rounds of military and diplomatic talks failed to take forward the disengagement process, China resorted to “provocative” military manoeuvres on August 29 and 30 that were thwarted by the Indian side. Also Read: India’s imports from China dip 27.63 per cent during April-August: Piyush GoyalThis was followed by a string of incidents in which guns were fired for the first time along the LAC since 1975, though there were no casualties. “China’s intensified development of military infrastructure on the Indian border suggests a shift in Beijing’s approach to territorial disputes, forcing New Delhi to rethink its national security posture,” the Stratfor report said. While China’s new developments are geographically focused on Ladakh, its activity “across India’s entire border will likely drive future expansions of Indian military infrastructure near disputed borders at Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh”, it said. The report warned: “By forcing India to respond in kind, China’s aggressive strategy is leading to a greater concentration of military assets in heavily disputed areas along the border that could raise the risk of potential escalations and sustained conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-doubled-its-air-bases-air-defences-and-heliports-near-lac-in-three-years-report/story-LgpbHDWgdfuh4cHwgyeQXP.html

22-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha commotion resonates in Bihar, support for Harivansh pours in||The resonance of unruly scenes - torn papers, broken microphones and sloganeering - that unfolded in Rajya Sabha on Sunday when a group of MPs from the Opposition benches surrounded the Chairman’s desk, where deputy chairman Harivansh sat while conducting the House proceedings, is being felt in election-bound Bihar.Harivansh is a native of the state and a member of the ruling JD(U). Senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, while condemning the Opposition MPs’ conduct, have made pointed references to the “heckling”, “abuse” and “disrespect” shown to him. The Opposition MPs created a commotion in the House after the chair refused to grant more time for discussion on two contentious farm bills that were passed by a voice vote. The Opposition also alleged that their demand for seeking a division of votes was not met; violating the parliamentary procedure.Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP, Jairam Ramesh alleged that the BJP is politicising the issue. He tweeted, “The shadow of the forthcoming Bihar elections has fallen over Parliament now. It is all very well for Constitutional authorities to demand respect. They must, in fact, command respect by their non-partisan actions.”Also read: Rajya Sabha passes bill to bring co-op banks under RBI supervision माननीय हरिवंश जी! आपका ह्रदय से अभिनन्दन। राज्य सभा में उपसभापति पद पर हुए अपमान से आप आहात हैं और पूरा देश भी। महामहिम राष्ट्रपति को लिखा आपका पत्र बहुत प्रेरणादायी है। (1/3) pic.twitter.com/jwA3kZUUE1On Monday, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who represents Patna Sahib constituency in the Lok Sabha, referred to the ruckus and said the party will not politicise the issue. Prasad, however, linked the issue to Bihari pride. “Harivansh ji is an eminent writer, we have all felt very bad at the treatment meted out to him. An eminent Indian who hails from Bihar was humiliated; the people of Bihar will give a response. Harivansh ji remained dignified… We will not make it a political issue but people are hurt,” the minister said.The minister also trained his guns at the Opposition and said, “The way the Congress and the RJD were silent and even encouraged the protesting MPs in the Rajya Sabha, this will be told to the people of the state. Both the Congress and the RJD will have to answer.”On Tuesday, following reports that the 8 MPs who were suspended for their conduct in the House declined to have the tea which Harivansh carried to their protest site inside Parliament complex, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put out two tweets to appreciate the deputy chairperson’s gesture. माननीय राष्ट्रपति जी को माननीय हरिवंश जी ने जो पत्र लिखा, उसे मैंने पढ़ा। पत्र के एक-एक शब्द ने लोकतंत्र के प्रति हमारी आस्था को नया विश्वास दिया है। यह पत्र प्रेरक भी है और प्रशंसनीय भी। इसमें सच्चाई भी है और संवेदनाएं भी। मेरा आग्रह है, सभी देशवासी इसे जरूर पढ़ें। pic.twitter.com/K9uLy53xIB“To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on Dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart. It shows his greatness. I join the people of India in congratulating Harivansh Ji,” the PM said.In an earlier tweet, there was a reference to his Bihar roots. “For centuries, the great land of Bihar has been teaching us the values of democracy. In line with that wonderful ethos, MP from Bihar and Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson Shri Harivansh Ji’s inspiring and statesman-like conduct this morning will make every democracy lover proud,” the PM said.This is the second time when the PM has invoked the deputy chairperson’s connection with the state where elections are expected in November. On September 14, when Harivansh was re-elected to the position for the second term, the PM mentioned how he belonged to “the land of democracy.”Also read: ‘Glided like snakes... now silent’ - Sena slams BJP’s silence on Kangana’s ‘terrorist’ remark “When anyone who is a seeker of democracy, from the land of democracy, Bihar, from JP’s (Jayprakash Narayan) and Karpuri Thakur’s land, from Bapu’s (Mahatma Gandhi) Champaran, steps forward to take responsibility, this is what happens… what Harivansh has accomplished,” the PM said while complimenting his conduct of the House. Support for Harivash, who will undertake a day-long fast, anguished by the occurrence in the house and the “humiliating” conduct against him also poured in from Vice President Venkaiah Naidu who expressed displeasure over the ruckus in the House.“This is a Gandhian way, this is the JP way. We shouldn’t try to score political points… Despite everything, Harivansh ji made tea at home and brought it for the protesting MPs,” Naidu said.In Bihar, where the BJP is part of the government in alliance with the JD(U), the party that Harivansh belongs to, deputy chief minister Sushil Modi also said the incident has “hurt the pride of Bihar”. While the NDA feels that the issue will impact the electoral outcome in the state, Shankar Dutt of the Patan University said the polls will be dominated by issues of “healthcare, employment and education that has not been able to address concerns about employability.”“The statements made by the political parties are for scoring brownie points, but I don’t think it will have an electoral impact,” he said.While a no-confidence motion against Harivansh moved by the opposition was not admitted, AAP’s Sanjay Singh, Derek O’Brien, and Dola Sen of Trinamool Congress; Congress’ Rajiv Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain, and Ripun Bora; CPIM’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem were suspended for the remainder of the session for “gross disorderly conduct” after the House passed a motion by voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-commotion-resonates-in-bihar-support-for-harivansh-pours-in/story-Bjv0nnKLRwBGsjIGQ3UD7K.html

22-09-2020||India||Sharad Pawar stages one day fast to support suspended Rajya Sabha MPs||Former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Tuesday criticised Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh for his conduct during the passage of two contentious farm bills on Sunday and said he is holding a day-long fast in solidarity with eight members of the House suspended for protesting against it.The eight were suspended on Monday for the remainder of Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session for storming the Well of the House and charging towards Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings on Sunday. Parliament marshals formed a double-layered barricade to protect Harivansh. The lawmakers were angry as their demand for the division of votes on the bills was ignored. The bills were passed by voice vote while the opposition wanted them to be referred to a select committee.Pawar called Harivansh’s behaviour objectionable and added it does not suit the reputation of the Upper House. “I have decided not to have food today [Tuesday] to express my support for the eight members of Rajya Sabha. The members wanted a proper discussion on the farm bills but the deputy chairman chose to pass them without discussion and that too with a voice vote,” he said. “I have never seen such a behaviour by a presiding officer in any of the Houses where I have been a member for 50 years.”Pawar said he is happy that the lawmakers did not touch the tea Harivansh offered the eight lawmakers and continued their protest. “...It would also be a bold statement to make that the protests would bring changes in the deputy chairman’s behaviour and thus I would not dare to make it,” he said.Harivansh on Tuesday met eight lawmakers, who staged an all-night sit-in on the lawns of Parliament, and offered them tea and snacks. The lawmakers declined the refreshment and appeared unwilling to end their protest even as Harivansh said he will undertake a day-long fast over the “humiliating conduct against him”.Pawar said the ideas of Gandhi have never been destroyed like this in the country. He questioned the intentions of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government regarding the farm bills. Pawar said there was no reason to clear the bills in one go. “There was a doubt in the minds of the members over the Centre’s intention because it is claiming to make the market free for all and also boasts that farmers can sell their produce wherever they want. But on the other hand, they impose a ban on the export of onions,” Pawar said.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade banned all exports of the item on Monday following a shortage and sudden increase in prices in the domestic market.Pawar, who backed the farmers’ agitation against the legislation, underlined his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) does not support the bills. “[NCP lawmakers] Supriya Sule in Lok Sabha and Praful Patel in Rajya Sabha have opposed the bills.” He added he could not attend the Parliament’s proceedings as he stayed in Mumbai to discuss the Maratha reservation issue.Pawar said he has also received a notice from the income tax department over financial statements he has submitted with his election affidavits for the last three elections. “The notice says that the Election Commission is not satisfied with the details shared and thus the department has sought the clarification. I heard even Supriya Sule is also going to get such a notice. It looks like they have much love and respect for some people.”Pawar said he has read somewhere that similar notices have been sent to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son, Aaditya Thackeray. He was responding to a question on whether he was being targeted because NCP is an ally of Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-stages-one-day-fast-to-support-suspended-rajya-sabha-mps/story-RTJPzlJ207Ym4T01RGVePK.html

The MPs have said they were voicing their apprehensions regarding the passage of the two bills introduced by the Centre which aims to revitalise the country’s agricultural sector.“I will also take part in their (eight suspended Rajya Sabha MPs) movement,” Pawar, the former Union agriculture minister, said.Pawar-led NCP opposed the passage of the three bills in the Lok Sabha.

22-09-2020||India||An exclusive sneak peek into Hindustan Times E-Tourism Conclave||Hindustan Times E-Tourism Conclave, a two-day webinar on the road ahead for travel and tourism in India, is set to showcase the country’s leading efforts in reviving its most beloved sector.This year, not unlike last year, the conclave will have a stellar line-up of industry leaders, policymakers and stakeholders voice their concerns and find solutions. The e-conclave will be held between September 24-25, and will focus on the theme: Indian Tourism – Road to Recovery ‘Refocus, Reboot, Revive’. There will be a total of eight sessions spread over two days. Giving a sneak peek into what the e-conclave has in store, some of the panelists share their views.Vikram Kapur, Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, says, “Certain concessions in terms of waivers, deferment of taxes be provided, given that State governments have limited fiscal space. Even though hotels have opened, there is no footfall – the leisure sector is not on the list of priority for the consumer. People have lost jobs, there have been cuts in salaries, so when disposable household income is limited, it will definitely not be a priority to spend on travel and hospitality.” Exploring viable solutions, he mulls, “We need to see how we can kick-start this demand. Marketing can only help to an extent, but then you also need funding. Perhaps the Central government can look at ways to fund the States to offer discounts and subsidies on travel. LTC scheme is there for government employees and even the private sector has leave concessions, which is a way of putting money in the pockets of the consumer to help them travel. Incentives and discounts on travel fare, hotel rooms etc. will help boost the demand. I think it is only a matter of time before people develop that confidence.”Read: HT E-Tourism Conclave: Redefining the future of tourism in India in the new normalTP Rajesh, MD and Commissioner of Tourism, Government of Tamil Nadu, says, “We will now try to focus on domestic tourism. Barring hill stations, hotels have opened, but we still haven’t reached normalcy.” Highlighting the importance of an event of this nature, he explains, “One side of it is the tourists, others being the stakeholders. We want to know what is in the mind of the stakeholders so that when we develop policies or initiatives, we will know their ideas. It provides one common platform for the aggregation of ideas. Tamil Nadu has some great stories to tell; we have identified 290 new tourism sites. We want to put it on a professional platform and leverage those strengths.”Films have always been at the intersection of demographics, continuously opening up new destinations. Be it the hidden gems of the heartland, or the more popular hill and seaside locations, films always fascinate with their geographical cinemascape. Effortlessly, they become symbiotic partners in this cycle of economic growth, too. Filmmaker Kunal Kohli, says, “There is an urgent to kick-start both these industries. A film shoot by its very nature has a whole lot of people working on it. With the advent of OTT, so much more content is being produced. India stories are very much in demand and people want to see different parts of the country for the content they are craving for. It means locations, and if every State can provide infrastructure and support to the crew, then we can work together and shoot all over the country. We will be using a lot of local resources - drivers, cooks, location managers, local actors and accommodation. It will be a revival for their business as well as our business. The film and the tourism industry need to work together and collaborate to find ways to generate employment for both industries.”Read: The future of travel: Slow, meaningful and closer to homeThe event is in partnership with Bihar Tourism, Chhattisgarh Tourism, Delhi Tourism, Gujarat Tourism, IRCTC, Tamil Nadu Tourism.

Courts of one country seek the assistance of the courts in another for the administration of justice there through letters rogatory.The CBI has said it has reasons to believe that the loans Mallya availed from Indian banks were diverted and invested in companies based in countries like the US, UK, and Switzerland. It has called the funds lying in accounts associated with Mallya in such countries as “the proceeds of crime”.Also read: SC asks Centre to clear stand on winding up of Mallya’s United Breweries Holdings LimitedMallya is among those who have fled India in recent years to escape prosecution including in loan defaults cases. He lost an appeal in Britain’s High Court in April against a 2018 decision to extradite him to India to face fraud charges linked to the collapse of his defunct company Kingfisher Airlines. Kingfisher is alleged to have taken loans with no intention of repaying them.The CBI obtained the letter on Monday from a special court to ascertain the utilisation of funds received in an account with the American First Commerce Bank (now Pacific Premier Bank) from December 2007 to March 2009. It has sought evidence related to $20 million remitted by Airbus SAS (France) in June 2008 and over $5 million from the State Bank of Mauritius, etc.The agency has said loans Mallya and his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines availed from IDBI Bank, State Bank of India, and other consortium banks were diverted for purposes other than those avowed to the banks.Kingfisher Airlines was incurring losses from its inception. It faced net losses of Rs 2,168 crores in the financial year that ended in March 2009. By 2009, Kingfisher had availed loans worth Rs 4,998.50 crore from various banks.As the consortium of banks sought to recover the dues, Mallya left India for the UK. The CBI initiated a probe against Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, and IDBI bank officials in 2015 for cheating and conspiracy to dupe banks. The Enforcement Directorate is probing money laundering charges against Mallya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-gets-letter-rogatory-to-investigate-fund-flow-in-vijay-mallya-s-bank-accounts/story-fwklY4gPFdH8SCQebqziyJ.html

The assembly, in its monsoon session, convened for a day on Monday in view of Covid-19 situation and passed at least 10 amendment bills, a finance bill and certain other bills without any discussion.Congress leader Govind Singh wanted a discussion on the finance bill but parliamentary affairs minister Narottam Mishra urged the protem speaker Rameshwar Sharma not to allow a discussion while citing the unanimous decision taken in the all-party meeting prior to the session. On this, leader of Opposition Kamal Nath said the members who wanted a discussion could submit their views in writing that could be incorporated in the proceedings. While Nath raised the issue of alleged mismanagement in the private hospitals, senior Congress MLA KP Singh expressed his concern over huge gatherings in the meeting held by political parties.Singh said, “The government has imposed a ban on religious programmes and processions but there are huge gatherings in the political programmes irrespective of the political party.”Also read: Congress to boycott session, says Opposition’s views not accommodatedNath said, “There is a lot of mismanagement in private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. We have received several complaints that even such patients were treated as Covid-19 patients who didn’t test positive for the infection. There should be an inquiry into such complaints. There should be a complaint centre where people can go and tell the authorities that they have been cheated.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in his reply, said, “This pandemic is new for all of us. Nobody knew what would be the situation. There is no vaccine but we are doing our best to control the disease.”He said, “The situation was under control till there was a lockdown. But lockdown couldn’t go on for an indefinite period. As the economy was ruined there was the decision on unlocking during which virus has further spread.”He said, “The state has reported 108,167 Covid-19 cases till date. But it’s a matter of satisfaction that the recovery rate is more than 77 percent. There are 25,542 active cases in the state at present. However, there are states which have 2 to 2.5 lakh active cases. There have been 2007 deaths so far i.e. 1.89 percent of the total Covid-19 cases. Madhya Pradesh is at the 16th position in the country. I am not saying this is an achievement but in the past six months we have strengthened our testing and treatment facilities comprehensively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mismanagement-in-private-covid-19-hospitals-madhya-pradesh-opposition/story-fivycHZB7EfRt2tDNX9ANI.html

They continued to fight for the farmers, regardless of the heat, mosquitoes and other inconveniences. They are not asking for anything for themselves. They are fighting for democracy and constitution. They are struggling for the farmers of the country,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.“Farmers across the country are saying that these laws will put an end to the farmers. How can such dangerous laws passed by Parliament without voting? Then what is the meaning of Parliament, what is the meaning of elections? If you want to pass the law in the same way then why do you call the Parliament session?,” he added.Sisodia alleged that the government is behaving like the Britishers.“The British used to run like this - used to commit the crime on the common farmers, traders and workers of India. Black laws were made against them so that Britishers could commit more crimes. Then when Gandhiji and other leaders used to meet them, they also used to give tea. Our rulers are still running the government in the same English style,” Sisodia tweeted.The eight Opposition Rajya Sabha members were suspended by Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu for “unruly behaviour” with Harivansh.On Monday, Venkaiah Naidu announced the one-week suspension of Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen, Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Sanjay Singh, Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Ripun Bora and Syed Nasir Hussain, CPI (M)’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Karim for “unruly behaviour” with the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman on Sunday during the passage of the farm bills.On Sunday Rajya Sabha witnessed unruly scenes as Opposition members stormed the well and reached the deputy chairman’s seat to protest against the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and passed by the Upper House through voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-sisodia-laud-suspended-rajya-sabha-mps-for-taking-up-farmers-cause/story-owYyXinjGJ0wk0K5Z2sFcI.html

Bilaspur is a major hub of trade and commerce in the northern region of Chhattisgarh and also connects the northern districts of the state, said CM Baghel in his letter to the Central minister. Citing the importance of Bilaspur city, the CM stated that South Eastern Coal Field Limited Headquarters, South East Central Railway Zonal Headquarters, and Raipur Railway Division are situated in Bilaspur. “The city is one of the important centers of power production in the country. The NTPC in Seepat and many Power Production Plants in Korba and Janjgir-Champa are also situated close to this city. Besides, there are many industrial areas near Bilaspur, which make an important contribution to the economy of the state. If Bilaspur is connected to metro cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata via air services, the regional air connectivity would improve and it would also boost the nation’s economy, trade, commerce, tourism, and health sectors and promote socio-economic activities,” the letter stated. On Monday, CM Baghel launched flight services from Maa Danteshwari airport in Jagdalpur under the Centre’s UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme.Alliance Air will operate services to Raipur, some 300 kilometers away, and Hyderabad from the Danteshwari airport, which is named after the famous Goddess Danteshwari temple in Dantewada in tribal-dominated Bastar division.The Maa Danteshwari airport in Jagdalpur has been set up on an area of 57.6 hectares, with the state Public Works Department having developed the infrastructure and AAI managing the Air Traffic Control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/connect-bilaspur-to-delhi-mumbai-kolkata-air-route-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel/story-Y8WYREHhWj8VGglTtfrmUK.html

The Sena, in an editorial in Saamana, said that the political party that “glided like snakes” to what the actress said are now silent on the “insult” to farmers. After the bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha amid din on Sunday, Prime minister Narendra Modi, in a series of tweets, reassured the farmers that the MSP and the government procurement of farmers’ produce will continue. Ranaut picked up one of PM’s tweets, described the protesters as “the same terrorists who indulged in bloodshed even though no countryman lost citizenship due to CAA”. जैसे श्री कृष्ण की नारायणी सेना थी, वैसे ही पप्पु की भी अपनी एक चंपू सेना है जो की सिर्फ़ अफ़वाहों के दम पे लड़ना जानती है, यह है मेरा अरिजिनल ट्वीट अगर कोई यह सिद्ध करदे की मैंने किसानों को आतंकी कहा, मैं माफ़ी माँगकर हमेशा केलिए ट्वीटर छोड़ दूँगी 🙏 https://t.co/26LwVH1QD9The actor later clarified that she did not call farmers terrorists and dared anybody to prove it. On Monday, the actor tweeted, “Like Lord Krishna has Narayani Army, similarly Pappu has his Champu army that knows only to fight on the basis of rumours. This is my original tweet, if somebody can prove that I called farmers terrorists then I will apologize and leave Twitter forever.”Also read: Please return farmers’ niwala’ - AAP’s Sanjay Singh responds to PM ModiWithout naming Ranaut, the editorial said, “Farmers fighting for their rights are ‘terrorists’, if anyone is saying this then it is dishonesty. But the political parties that glide like a snake when an actress speaks are now silent on the insult of the farmers.”ALSO WATCH | Kangana Ranaut on Anurag Kashyap harassment charge: ‘Many big heroes...’  It added that farmers are being called “dishonest” and “terrorists”, but what recourse is left for them then to commit suicide. In a veiled attack on Ranaut, the editorial said, “Farmers are terrorists, Mumbai is Pakistan and the civic body is Babar’s army et cetera,. Leave other accusations but the ruling BJP should at least remove their face mask over the insult of the farmers. This was our only expectation.”It also asked if the bills brought by the Modi government were “revolutionary and historical” why was coercion and the majority used to get the Bills approved. The editorial added the bills have led to “peaceful” protests by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Also read: Congress to boycott session, says Opposition’s views not accommodated“In Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, farmers have come out on the streets to protest against the farm bills. They have blocked roads at many places. When all this was going on in moderation and peace, what symptoms would it be to term them terrorists?” it said.Further attacking the BJP, the editorial added, “Farmers have been lathi-charged and have cases registered against them. This is extreme. Even Babur’s army did not do this much oppression. But the people who have made this country ‘Sujalaam, Suflaam’, have been termed terrorists by a pro-BJP actress. If the protesting farmers are terrorists, then the government approved a new agricultural bill for all the terrorists?”The Shiv Sena took different stands in both Houses of the Parliament. When the bills were introduced in Lok Sabha, Sena MP “welcomed” it. Later, when it was tabled in Rajya Sabha, Sena took a critical view of the bills. Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that the party has taken a “neutral” stand on the bills. However, it raised questions on the bills in the editorial. “We never say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the enemy of the farmers. The new bill has two sides. The government ended the brokership in APMC and enabled the farmers to sell their produce even outside the markets but who would buy them? This is the controversy. Big industrialists are now investing in the grocery business. This means that there is a possibility that farmers will now be caught in the new slavery of corporate companies. “Farming has also been approved to be done in a contractual manner but the scheme has flopped in the US and Europe. Farmers fear that they will not get the lowest support price. The government says this will not happen. It is all rumoured,” Shiv Sena said. If MSP will continue, why has a Union minister resigned over the farm bills and why has the farmers come to the streets to protest against the bills,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glided-like-snakes-now-silent-sena-attacks-bjp-s-silence-on-kangana-s-terrorist-remark-on-farmers/story-ZbNcpXmsSd72uxDzgt0LjI.html

The government is in talks with prominent filmmakers. Many films, including several big budget productions, were halted midway due to the coronavirus pandemic and are waiting for the government’s nod to resume shooting. “Very soon,” said sources in the chief minister’s office (CMO) on the issue of commencement of shooting. The Centre had issued guidelines in August, allowing film shooting to resume with some preconditions which include most crew members, other than actors emoting in front of the camera, wearing kits to protect themselves. UP Film Development Council (UPFDC) chief Raju Srivastava had in August written to the government to allow shooting to resume and sought guidelines for the same. It isn’t immediately clear as to why there has been a delay in formulating and releasing guidelines for film shooting, but it’s expected that they can now be released any moment. There are many films, including some with big stars like John Abraham, a film by Anushka Sharma Productions, Kartik Aryan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The government is in contact with several prominent filmmakers like Subhash Ghai, David Dhawan and Boney Kapoor, whose suggestions it plans to incorporate in the revised film policy that is in the works, officials said. It is learnt that chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who met filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar in Lucknow on Sunday, will be meeting several top filmmakers to give a boost to his plans to develop the country’s biggest film city in UP. The government’s subsidy scheme for filmmakers shooting in the state too has been successful with several directors filming at locales in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-for-resuming-film-shoots-in-uttar-pradesh-to-be-released-very-soon/story-yZwjimfW9e448GKG9FqfUL.html
22-09-2020||India||‘Provide food to sex workers during lockdown’: SC tells Centre, states||Moved by the plight of lakhs of sex workers rendered jobless and without an alternate source of livelihood following the Covid-19 lockdown, the Supreme Court gave a week’s time to the states to respond on providing them free ration and asked Centre if something could be immediately provided to them in the exercise of its powers under the National Disaster Management Act.The bench of Justices LN Rao and Hemant Gupta said, “This is a human problem. People are not getting ration for want of ration cards. They are under severe distress.” An application filed by Darbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee before the top court said, “After the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, 2020, there was no work and no income. During April and May, sex workers scrimped through their meagre savings or took loans at exorbitant interest rates to survive. Most were dependent on the charity provided by individuals and philanthropic organizations.”The Committee represented by senior advocate Anand Grover said, “Food is the most critical need of sex workers as an assessment conducted in five states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu shows that only 52 percent of 1.2 lakh sex workers are receiving ration through the public distribution system (PDS). The situation in other cities is even worse.”Also read: Study shows at least 99% of surveyed sex workers in Pune in search of alternative livelihoodGrover demanded the Court to order free ration for sex workers across the country without insisting on ration cards as most sex workers do not have any identity documents. He said that this suggestion was approved by the top court on September 15, 2011, while hearing a PIL seeking improvement of living conditions of sex workers. The suggestion stated, “All state governments, local authorities and other appropriate authorities should issue ration cards to the sex workers, relaxing the rigours of the existing rules and/or requirements as to verification of address, without mentioning the profession in the document.”As per the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, there are over 8.68 lakh female sex workers in the country and 62,137 Hijra/transgender persons in 17 states, of which, 62 percent are engaged in sex work.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) RS Suri, who appeared for the Centre, informed the Court that the government has provided benefits to sex workers under the Ujjwala Yojna for grant of LPG cylinders. Grover pointed out that in the 5-state survey, only 8 percent of 1.2 lakh sex workers could avail of the cooking gas scheme. In addition, the sex workers demanded medicines, healthcare, school fees incentive for their kids and pension for widows and old women among their community.Grover pointed out that in April 2020, the Government announced cash support of Rs 1,500 for transgender persons to help them tide over the lockdown situation. He insisted on having something similar for sex workers. He said, “While it might seem that the condition of sex workers is no different from that of other poor, unorganized workers who are also encountering extreme hardships due to Covid-19, in reality, sex workers are worse off on account of the stigma associated with their work and the exclusion that results from such prejudice.”While posting the matter for hearing on September 29, the Court asked the Centre to consider some immediate arrangement of food and basic needs for sex workers under the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/provide-food-to-sex-workers-during-lockdown-sc-tells-centre-states/story-JlAtJ064xSaw9QB4WRzrPK.html

We are fighting for the welfare of our farmers, which you have taken away. I humbly request you - I am returning your tea with all due respect, please return my farmers’ morsel,” Singh tweeted on Tuesday. मोदी जी, हम अपनी चाय के लिए नहीं लड़ रहे। हम अपने किसानों के निवाले के लिए लड़ रहे हैं, जो आपने छीना है। मेरी आपसे विनम्र बिनती है - मैं आपकी चाय पूरे आदर के साथ लौटा रहा हूँ, आप कृपया मेरे किसानों का निवाला लौटा दीजिए। https://t.co/o2QUsu0BdbHe was responding to PM Modi’s praise for Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh, who had offered tea to the suspended MPs. Harivansh is at the centre of the entire controversy.“To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart. It shows his greatness. I join the people of India in congratulating Harivansh Ji,” the Prime Minister had tweeted earlier. To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on Dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart.

22-09-2020||India||Opposition to boycott Rajya Sabha until MPs’ suspension is revoked||The Congress and a few other Opposition parties on Tuesday boycotted the proceedings of Rajya Sabha, demanding that the suspensions of eight of its members be revoked.The government responded that it was not in favour of keeping the suspended MPs away from the House, but they must express regret over their “unruly conduct” in the House on Sunday, when two contentious farm bills were passed.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also demanded that the government introduce a bill mandating that private companies and even Food Corporation of India (FCI) will not purchase farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP).“The government should introduce another bill which ensures that private players do not purchase beneath the MSP. On this, farmers can move court. MSPs should be announced using the Swaminathan formula. The state corporations and FCI should not purchase below MSPs. Our colleagues who have been suspended—their suspension should be revoked. Till the time the government does not take it back, we will boycott the proceedings of the House,” Azad said.Also Read: Farm bills row: Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh to observe 24-hour fastSeveral Opposition members, including Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav, Praful Patel and Keshav Rao, who spoke after Azad, also supported the demand to revoke the suspensions.Azad, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, said no one, whether from the ruling side or the Opposition, was happy with what happened in Rajya Sabha on Sunday. Two agricultural reform bills — the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 — were cleared by voice vote in Parliament on Sunday even as the Opposition protested and stormed the well of the House seeking that they be sent to a select committee.The high-pitched protests were also the most aggressive in recent years and continued even after the House was adjourned at 1pm. Aaam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh, Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen (Trinamool Congress); Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain, and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (M) were suspended on Monday for seven days under Rule 256(2) for “gross disorderly conduct”.Azad blamed time constraints in the House and said they often did not allow members to elucidate upon important issues. He said Lok Sabha could sit longer as proceedings began at 3pm, which provided the MPs with more time, while Rajya Sabha had to wind up early. “We fight for every minute like soldiers fight on borders,” Azad said. Also Read: ‘Sloganeering, raising placards’: Protests in Parliament over the yearsHe said the MPs had been feeling uncomfortable about several such issues for some time now, and Sunday’s proceedings were the “last straw that broke the camel’s back”. He said members were also upset that bills were not sent to select or standing committees when they should have.“I don’t approve of someone breaking the microphone or standing on a table, but this had been pent up over a long time and came out like a storm,” said Azad. Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the time constraint was not a new phenomenon. Many leaders, Joshi said, had sought that the proceedings be concluded early. “Four hours were allocated and the discussion took place from 9am till 1pm,” Joshi said. “The dispute was over the sense of the House. Sense of House does not mean numbers. Sense of House means majority of political parties. Their were 18 parties on one side and one party on the other,” Azad said.He said that the House depends on coordination within the government, and between the Opposition and government. “But there should not be coordination between the chair and government,” he said.“I do not know if the government had the numbers. But there could be no division on resolutions or amendments,” Azad said, referring to the passage of the farm bills.He said parliamentarian Arun Jaitley had said a government becomes “illegitimate” if the Speaker does not allow division of votes. Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu retorted that Jaitley had also spoken of the “tyranny of the minority”.Azad said government announced the MSPs on Monday, but gave no further information during discussion in the House, adding the cabinet meeting should have been held earlier.“The government has put forward a new slogan—one nation, one market—in an advertisement. My request is don’t go towards one nation, one party,” he said.Meanwhile, Naidu said the chair should not be dragged into the controversy.“Don’t try to put the blame on the chair or the person in the chair,” he said, asserting deputy chairman Harivansh had shown restraint. “If some people think ‘my way or the highway’, I will not accept it,” he added.Naidu said the members had a right to ask for a division and the deputy chairman had said “13 times” that he would allow one and asked members to go back to their seats, but they did not do so.The Rajya Sabha chairman said that the eight suspended members had not only admitted to their unruly behaviour, they had even justified their actions. “Some people justify all this. I cannot justify it,” Naidu said.Referring to statements by Opposition leaders calling the suspensions and the contentious passing of the farm bills “unprecedented”, he said there were several instances of bills being passed amid a lot of din in Parliament and that it was not the first time MPs were being suspended either. “What is unprecedented about this?” he asked, adding that passing bills amid a ruckus was not healthy and he was not happy about the suspensions either.On Sunday, Opposition parties sat in Rajya Sabha for two hours after it was adjourned and drafted a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh, which was rejected by Naidu on Monday. Naidu said it was non-admissible under the Constitution’s Article 90. The article deals with “vacation and resignation of, and removal from the office of the deputy chairman” of the Upper House of Parliament.  Harivansh met the suspended members, who staged an all-night sit-in on the lawns of Parliament, on Tuesday morning and offered the lawmakers tea and snacks. The lawmakers declined the refreshment and appeared unwilling to end their protest even as Harivansh said he will undertake a day-long fast over the “humiliating conduct against him”.Also Read: Suspended Rajya Sabha MPs on sit-in outside Parliament refuse deputy chairman’s teaNaidu said that he had told the secretary general that the protesting members must be taken care of. The secretary general, however, pointed out that members could not use the precinct of Parliament House to hold any protest, dharna or religious ceremony, he said.“I again appeal, if they [the suspended MPs] express regret for whatever has happened , the government is not very particular that they be kept out,” Joshi said. Meanwhile, the eight protesting members ended their sit-in outside Parliament after Congress and other Opposition parties boycotted the proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-to-boycott-rajya-sabha-until-mps-suspension-is-revoked/story-9n0xr4EFIDLkqHrNq2iVHM.html
22-09-2020||India||Vaccine for combating Covid-19: A look at the latest developments||As countries across the globe are witnessing a surge in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), governments and organisations are consistently working towards producing a fool-proof vaccine that will combat the infection and have very few or zero side effects.Here is a look at the latest updates on Covid-19 vaccine:1. A leading scientist while speaking to Bloomberg said that a Covid-19 vaccine will be ready for India in early 2021 but rolling it out safely across a population of 1.3 billion people will be the biggest challenge.2. An $18 billion initiative being led by the World Health Organization (WHO); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to deploy a vaccine globally is moving into its next phase, with 156 nations and regions joining the program. The program called ‘Covax’ is aiming towards having 2 billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021.3. A senior Indian official on Monday said the Phase III of the vaccine being developed by Oxford and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) began at the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. Under phase-II, trials had been conducted at the Bharti Vidyapeeth Medical College and also KEM Hospital in the city.4. The vaccine candidate of Bharat Biotech International Limited is also under phase-II trial whereas Zydus Cadila’s is in the process to receive approvals for conducting phase-III trials.5. AstraZeneca on Monday released a 111-page blueprint stating that the goal is to develop a vaccine with 50 per cent effectiveness as mandated by the Food and Drug Administration. This development comes after several doubts were raised about the pharma company’s vaccine as two participants fell ill.6. On Monday, Union minister of health and family welfare Harsh Vardhan said that over four vaccines are in advanced stages of pre-clinical trial adding that support was provided to 30 vaccine candidates.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-combating-covid-19-a-look-at-the-latest-developments/story-65aTDKp0EhvZULVMKpBVNI.html

22-09-2020||India||Congress, other opposition parties to boycott monsoon session over farm bills, suspension of members||Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh issued a statement on Tuesday saying that his party along with other like-minded opposition parties will boycott the Parliament. The senior leader pointed out several reasons for their decision to boycott the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament which is being held under extraordinary circumstances due to Covid-19. Congress said that the suspension of the members of Parliament, not letting the Leader of Opposition air his views, and not referring the bills to a standing or select committee as the main reasons behind the boycotting of the session. Also Watch | ‘Don’t move towards one nation, one party’: Opposition boycotts Rajya Sabha The senior leader speaking on behalf of his party also alleged that the recent bills introduced by the government have been not been passed but were rather ‘bulldozed’. He said that the bills should have referred to select panels for further review. On Sunday during the Rajya Sabha proceedings, several MPs had collected near the Speaker’s seat and raised slogans voicing their opposition towards the passage of two bills intended to reform the agricultural sector. Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and his colleague Dola Sen; Aam Admi Party’s Sanjay Singh; Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) are the MPs who are facing a weeklong suspension from the Parliament proceedings.

The laboratories will start testing samples by end of the month, he said.The new laboratories will help patients in the backward districts get quick sample test and will also assist the department in checking the spread of the Covid-19 infection.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed the health department to increase the sample test, particularly the RT-PCR test which is considered the gold standard of the Covid-19 testing. The department was also directed to set up laboratories in across all 75 districts.The department is testing around 1.50 lakh samples daily out of which around 50,000 samples are tested with RT-PCR machine at laboratories across the state.

22-09-2020||India||Covid-19 cases fall in Delhi, Mumbai: Number of tests, other possible reasons||Delhi and Mumbai, the two largest cities in the country, are also among its worst Covid-19 hit regions. While Delhi, the national capital, has recorded nearly 249,259 cases of the coronavirus disease so far, Mumbai, the financial centre, has registered 186,276 cases.On Monday, Delhi and Mumbai saw relatively low spikes of 2,548 and 1,837 respectively. Here are the likely reasons behind the fall in the number of cases in Delhi and Mumbai:(1.) The number of Covid-19 tests per day in both Delhi and Mumbai have gone up recently. While Delhi, for example, has done 135,723 tests per million, testing in Mumbai has also increased in the last three months.(2.) Last week, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain had spoken about a ‘downward’ trend in the capital’s positivity rate ‘due to increased testing over the past 10-12 days.’(3.) However, low number of cases could also be due to less tests conducted on Sunday. One of the reasons behind this, officials say, is many people are unaware Covid-19 test centres are open on Sundays as well.(4.) While both Delhi and Mumbai have opened up considerably in recent days, as indeed the rest of the country has, as part of the ongoing Unlock 4.0, most private offices are yet to resume working at full strength. Maharashtra, for example, has allowed private offices to work with 30% strength.(5.) Similarly, strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols has helped keep the numbers low. While going out in the middle of a raging pandemic is always risky, following protocols- -like wearing a mask- -gives one the best possible chance to avoid catching the infection, experts say.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-fall-in-delhi-mumbai-number-of-tests-other-possible-reasons/story-3IBWpIR0UcwpaiY6cPwelJ.html
22-09-2020||India||India-China military commanders to meet at least twice more before disengagement commences||Indian and Chinese military commanders are expected to meet again in a few days after the marathon talks on Monday could not cover all the points of contentions and differences between the two countries over the border standoff.The outgoing and incoming Indian Ladakh corps commander and the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) South Xinjiang Military District commander along with the head of India’s China division in the ministry of external affairs met at Moldo on Monday as part of an agreement between the foreign ministers of two countries.Authoritative sources described the nature of talks as “complex” with each side holding its ground but agreeing that India and PLA needed to completely disengage to ensure peace in border areas. “We will need at least two more rounds of talks at the military-diplomatic level before a consensus on disengagement exercise is reached,” said a senior official.ALSO WATCH | Can India conduct cross LAC strikes against China?: Lt Gen DS Hooda answers The road-map to peace on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is disengagement, de-escalation and then de-induction of both the armies with all steps requiring a certain amount of synchronization. The problem is rather serious with PLA deploying huge amount of weapon platforms including intermediate-range ballistic missiles in occupied Aksai Chin to threaten India. It is quite evident from the satellite imagery that PLA has packed Aksai Chin with heavy weapon platforms and continues to build-up on the airbases in the Western Theatre Command. Apart from missile silos in Xaidulla, just across the Karakoram Pass, in Xinjiang and Qizil Jilga in Tibet, PLA is playing the psychological warfare game to the hilt in Ladakh with rocket regiments, the surface to air missile batteries and artillery guns deployed.PLA deployed similar tactics in the South China Sea by test-firing both DF-26 and DF 21-D missiles to threaten the exercising US navy aircraft carriers, Ronald Reagan and Nimitz. Despite having intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in its arsenal, China is part of no international treaty on strategic arms reduction and the need for it to join tripartite talks with Russia has been a regular refrain of the Trump administration.However, removal of heavy weapon platforms and missile delivery systems is phase II of the disengagement process and may take the entire 2020 winter, just as the de-induction of troops will take time.“The Indian Army, however, is not deterred by PLA’s psy-ops in Aksai Chin and is ready with a counter in case of a worst-case scenario. Just as China has missiles to cover entire India, the converse is also true even though there would be a mismatch in numbers in favour of Beijing,” said a senior Indian military commander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-military-commanders-to-meet-at-least-twice-more-before-disengagement-commences/story-bAQSWhdcYj0vKMYgpBXP7I.html

Sometimes they try to sneak in placards inside the House as well which is not permitted and usually met with a reprimand from the Speaker in the Lok Sabha or the Chairperson in the Rajya Sabha. Protests that hit headlines over the years include the blocking of the main gate of Parliament during the Telangana statehood demand. Also read: Suspended Rajya Sabha MPs on sit-in outside Parliament refuse deputy chairman’s teaIn April 2012, at the peak of the pro-Telangana movement, 8 Congress MPs staged a protest by blocking Parliament’s main gate for 30 minutes and raised pro-Telangana slogans. They had been suspended from Lok Sabha for four days for their unruly behaviour in the House and causing disruptions.The suspended MPs - Ponnam Prabhakar, Madhu Yaskhi Goud, M Jagannath, KRG Reddy, G Viveknanda, Balram Naik, Sukender Reddy Gutha and S Rajaiah - had occupied the steps of the main gate of Parliament, forcing MPs to use other gates to enter and exit Parliament.A year later, five Congress MPs from Telangana sat on a two-day protest in Parliament to push for the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. GS Reddy, Manda Jagannathan, Poonam Prabhakar, G Vivekananda and S Rajaiah sat at the main entrance of Parliament carrying placards.In 2018, Telugu Desam Party MPs staged a sit-in inside Lok Sabha speaker’s chambers demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh. The then Speaker Sumitra Mahajan was not present in the chamber. They had to be marshalled out late in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sloganeering-raising-placards-protests-in-parliament-over-the-years/story-11nu7a49ZCfn6xLTfVHMAJ.html

22-09-2020||India||IT ministry tackled 3,635 ‘misuse of social media’ cases in 2019||The Ministry of Electronics, Information and Technology told the Parliament on Monday that it took down 3,635 social media pages/accounts in 2019 for violating the Information Technology Act. In a response to an unstarred question by Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu about the ministry’s regulation of social media, the ministry said that 1,385 pages were blocked in 2017 and 2,799 were blocked in 2018. “With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue,” the ministry said in its response. Also Read: Delhi House panel sends summons to top Facebook executive“In line with increase of usage of Internet as also the growth of social media platforms, there are increasing number of incidents of reporting of such content having potential to incite violence and hatred. Government has a well-defined system of reporting and blocking for public access within the framework of section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 and the Rules thereunder,” it added. The Ministry’s response comes in the wake of the Facebook controversy in August this year, wherein news reports alleged that the social media company was prejudicial while implementing its hate-speech policy, giving leeway to the members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Opposition came down heavily on the government as more reports surfaced regarding the conduct of Facebook India’s public policy head, Ankhi Das, wherein she claimed credit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s victory in the elections. Facebook India managing director Ajit Mohan was also quizzed by the IT parliamentary panel, barely days after IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg alleging Facebook allowed anti-Modi posts. Also Read: Facebook neutral, non-partisan, its India chief says defending handling of hate speeches“There were media reports that Facebook’s hate-speech rules collide with Indian politics, thereby trying to tarnish the image of those who indulge in constructive criticism of policies. Minister for Electronics & Information Technology has written to CEO, Facebook about alleged bias of the platform and to ensure integrity and neutrality of Facebook and the people working for Facebook. Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has already taken up the matter with Facebook,” the government said in another response. Social media companies, it added in its first response, are considered intermediaries under the IT Act, 2000. They are required to “observe due diligence while discharging their duties and have to inform the users of computer resources not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is, inter alia, grossly harmful, harassing, defamatory, libelous, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically objectionable, disparaging, or otherwise unlawful in any manner”. They are also expected to remove any unlawful content under Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by the government or its agency. The ministry, in response to a third question, said that the 59 Chinese-origin applications that were banned in the first round of blocks after tensions broke out along the Line of Actual Control with China were taken down in accordance with a Ministry of Home Affairs request. Subsequently, the ministry banned 47, and then 118 more applications, including the popular game PUBG and video-sharing platform TikTok. “The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has blocked 224 mobile apps under the provisions of section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India and security of State. Blocking of such Apps has been done on national security concerns and thus linkage with any country may not be disclosed in public domain,” the ministry said in response to a fourth question. According to Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta, the government’s blocking process lacks transparency. “The blocking process in India is extremely opaque,” Gupta said. “As recently demonstrated by the blocking of several environmental websites, the owners of websites are not provided with even a proper notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to blocking. This requires urgent reform and, while proper steps need to be taken to prevent hate speech from being circulated on social media, it should not be done like a form of censorship that is conducted with secrecy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-tackled-3-635-misuse-of-social-media-cases-in-2019/story-F5NCnURWqlA4L3uKZ7IMSP.html

And while the Lok Sabha was still buzzing with activity well past midnight, a group of eight lawmakers suspended for “gross disorderly conduct” on Monday organised the first overnight sit-in just outside the Parliament building near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi.The lawmakers were suspended after they stormed the Well of the House and charged towards Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Sunday, who was presiding over the proceedings on Sunday, after two of the three farm bills were passed by voice vote. The opposition wanted the bills to be referred to a select committee and the division of votes for their passage.Monday night, as alive as the day, presented the two sides of India’s parliamentarians: their commitment to work beyond the stipulated hours of the House and also to assert their democratic right to protest.Also Read: Cong plans campaigns, month-long protest across India from Sept 24In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Om Birla, 57, sat through the proceedings till the House was adjourned on Tuesday morning to meet again in the afternoon.

22-09-2020||India||Trinamool Congress to launch series of protests against farms bills from today||The ruling party in West Bengal, Trinamool Congress, will hit the streets to protest the passage of contentious farm bills starting from Tuesday in Kolkata. Parallel protests are going on outside the Parliament. Two of the party’s senior Rajya Sabha members – Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen – were suspended for a week on Monday for “unruly behaviour” that took place as the upper house of the Parliament passed two controversial bills relating to the agriculture sector on Sunday. Condemning the two bills, chief minister and party supremo Mamata Banerjee said that the TMC will launch a series of protests against the bills every day starting from Tuesday. “The party will stage continuous protests starting from Tuesday. On September 22, the party’s women wing will hold a dharna near Gandhi statue in Kolkata. The youth wing will stage a protest on Wednesday followed by farmers and labourers,” Banerjee said. Also read: Despite BJD’s opposition to twin farm bills, Odisha farmer leaders aren’t impressedTuesday’s protests in central Kolkata would be led by Chandrima Bhattacharya, the minister of state for health in West Bengal. The TMC chief also called on all parties to unitedly oppose the farm bills and assured her party’s support. Meanwhile, the Congress and the Left Front have also decided to hit the streets on September 25 to protest the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. Among the eight suspended MPs, while two were from the TMC, three were from the Congress party and two were CPI(M) lawmakers. One was from the Aam Aadmi Party. In the Unlock 4 guidelines, the Union home ministry had earlier said that political functions could be held with a ceiling of 100 people from September 21. “Because of the pandemic, there is a restriction on the number of people that can gather. Hence, we will stage the protest following protocols and not bring in a large number of people,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-to-launch-series-of-protests-against-farms-bills-from-today/story-1FRr9gMa6sMXuy68QVm8WM.html
22-09-2020||India||India rejects Pakistan’s reference to Kashmir issue at UN, calls for tackling terrorism||India on Tuesday rejected Pakistan’s contention that the Kashmir issue is one of the most long-standing disputes at the United Nations (UN), saying Islamabad should instead focus on the unfinished task of tackling terrorism. In a video message on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the world body, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi lauded the UN’s achievements but also referred to “failings and deficiencies”. “The organisation is only as good as its member states wish it to be. The Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and Palestine disputes are the organisation’s most glaring and long-standing disputes. The people of occupied J&K still await fulfilment of the commitment made to them by the UN to grant them their right to self-determination,” he said. “Today, the UN is derided as a talk shop. Its resolutions and decisions are flouted. International cooperation, especially in the Security Council, is at its lowest,” he added.

First secretary Vidisha Maitra said India had hoped the General Assembly “would be spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods that have now become a trademark of Pakistan’s interventions on such platforms” during the commemoration of a shared global milestone. “However, for a nation that is bereft of milestones, one can only expect a stonewalled and stymied approach to reason, diplomacy and dialogue,” she said. Turning to the specific reference to the Kashmir issue, Maitra said Pakistan was interfering in India’s internal matters.

Pakistan is globally recognised as the epicentre of terrorism, which by its own admission harbours and trains terrorists and hails them as martyrs and consistently persecutes its ethnic and religious minorities,” she added. Maitra said Pakistan “would do well to turn its attention inwards to immediately addressing these pressing concerns instead of diverting attention from them by misusing the UN platform”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-reference-to-kashmir-issue-at-un-calls-for-tackling-terrorism/story-r6yTCBjswM3rFT9RkxVRaL.html

22-09-2020||India||Suspended Rajya Sabha MPs on sit-in outside Parliament refuse deputy chairman’s tea||Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Tuesday met eight opposition lawmakers, who staged an all-night sit-in on the lawns of Parliament after they were suspended a day earlier for the remainder of the ongoing monsoon session for charging at him during protests against the passage of two of the three contentious farm bills in the upper House on Sunday. He offered the lawmakers tea and snacks. The lawmakers declined the refreshment and appeared unwilling to end their protest even as Harivansh said he will undertake a day-long fast over the “humiliating conduct against him”.Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh, who is among the eight, said the issue is not about personal equations but concerns for farmers. He added they are protesting to protect the farmers’ rights and against the way “black laws“ were passed in Parliament in violation of rules and procedures following the rejection of their demand for putting the bills to vote.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about Harivansh’s large-heartedness in offering tea to the suspended lawmakers and congratulated him.To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on Dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart. It shows his greatness. I join the people of India in congratulating Harivansh Ji.Singh reacted to Modi’s tweet saying they are not fighting for tea. “We are fighting for the welfare of our farmers, which you have taken away. I humbly request you - I am returning your tea with all due respect, please return my farmers’ morsel,” he tweeted.मोदी जी, हम अपनी चाय के लिए नहीं लड़ रहे। हम अपने किसानों के निवाले के लिए लड़ रहे हैं, जो आपने छीना है। मेरी आपसे विनम्र बिनती है - मैं आपकी चाय पूरे आदर के साथ लौटा रहा हूँ, आप कृपया मेरे किसानों का निवाला लौटा दीजिए। https://t.co/o2QUsu0BdbSingh, Derek O’Brien, and Dola Sen (Trinamool Congress); Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain, and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (M) were suspended for seven days for “gross disorderly conduct”. They stormed the Well of the House and charged towards Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings on Sunday. Parliament marshals formed a double-layered barricade to protect Harivansh. The lawmakers were angry as their demand for the division of votes on the bills was ignored. The bills were passed by voice vote while the opposition wanted them to be referred to a select committee.Harivansh wrote to Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Rajya Sabha chairman about the fast citing anguish over the “humiliating” conduct against him.Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Shobha Karandlanje lauded Harivansh for his magnanimity in offering the suspended parliamentarians tea. “A magnanimous Gesture by Harivansh Ji! Deputy Chairman of RS [Rajya Sabha] brings tea for the same MPs who heckled, ill-treated & carried out undignified attack on him in the house. Committed Gandhian met those who targeted him & told that he’s here as a friend of them!” she tweeted.Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill tweeted, “Offering Tea will not whitewash the act of Curbing Democracy-Voices raising issues of 62 Crore Farmers cannot be muted & attention cannot be diverted #FarmBill2020 #FarmersProtest.”Naidu called Sunday a “really a bad day for the Rajya Sabha” and said he was worried that Harivansh would have been harmed also. He said his deputy was also abused and the Rule Book was thrown at him.Naidu on Monday named O’Brien and repeatedly requested him to leave the House. O’Brien refused to go, while opposition members demanded that they be heard as well. Naidu also rejected the no-confidence motion against Harivansh.Also Read: Oppn MPs hold first-ever night protests near HouseThe suspended lawmakers refused to leave the House on Monday calling the action against them unilateral. They said the version of what had transpired was not considered. They brought bedsheets, snacks, and water, and began the sit-in near the Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Parliament House.The suspension triggered a fresh confrontation between BJP and the opposition Congress as they accused each other of violating democratic norms. The Congress said the lawmakers were suspended without being heard and accused Harivansh of muzzling and throttling the voices of the opposition parties at the behest of the Prime Minister’s Office.This is the highest number of lawmakers to be suspended from the Upper House since 2010. Seven lawmakers from three parties were barred for the rest of their session over their protests against the Women’s Reservation Bill in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harivansh-meets-opposition-mps-who-camped-overnight-at-parliament-lawns/story-Zxm5u00qg8HiZUiwftP5HL.html
22-09-2020||India||Cheaper, quicker kit can help in scaling up testing: Researcher||India’s first diagnostic kit for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) based on the gene editing technology CRISPR Cas9 has been approved for commercial use by the Drug Controller General of India. The testing kit, developed by researchers from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), was found to have high sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%, meaning it can accurately detect both positive and negative cases. The cost-effective and quicker test has been named after the fictional Bengali detective Feluda who stars in series of novels by filmmaker Satyajit Ray. It is also an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay. The test barcodes the Cas9 protein – a component of the CRISPR gene editing system – to interact specifically with the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. This complex of Cas9 and CoV2 is then applied on a paper-strip test, which gives the result in the form of two lines for a positive and a single line for a negative just like the home pregnancy test. The test kits will be manufactured and marketed by Tata group. Dr Debjyoti Chakraborty, who developed the kit along with Dr Souvik Maiti, spoke to HT about how the new kit can help the government in scaling up testing for Covid-19 further: How does Feluda compare to the current gold-standard RT PCR test? The method of sample collection and extraction of RNA from the swab will remain much the same, but the processing of the sample will be quicker and done on a machine that is cheaper and more readily available than the ones currently used for RT-PCR test. And, it is almost as accurate as RT-PCR test. Within the lab, it took us about an hour to process the sample but the time will vary a little depending on how the final kit is packaged by the company. (An RT PCR test takes about five to six hours to be completed). It will reduce the sample to report time. How will the kits help the government in scaling up testing? The machine used for these kits are cheaper and readily available at all diagnostic labs and even colleges, which will help in increasing the number of tests that can be done. It also does not use the expensive probes needed for the RT-PCR test. And, it uses a lateral flow paper strip for giving a negative or positive result that can be interpreted visually by anyone. In comparison, the results given by the RT-PCR machine requires a trained person to interpret the result. The government has been using rapid antigen tests for ramping up India’s testing capacity? Will this be a better alternative? This test cannot be done in the field and still requires a lab to process the sample, but it is more sensitive, thereby reducing chances of throwing up false positives. The rapid antigen test detects the presence of the antigen or the viral protein. The problem with is that unless there is enough protein in the sample, the test may not detect it. In comparison, Feluda and other nucleic acid tests can detect very low copy numbers of the virus (through amplification) so the sensitivity is very high. This means the tests can detect the virus even at an early or late stage of the disease. What next? We are now working towards developing tests that can be performed at the point of care, in a sense bringing the test closer to home. The work is ongoing for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cheaper-quicker-kit-can-help-in-scaling-up-covid-testing-researcher/story-rqcos1k1GhGLEOqqNBEc9K.html
22-09-2020||India||NIA detains 2 from airport in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram for suspected extremist links: Report||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has detained two men from the international airport in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram after a three-hour interrogation on Monday night, days after three al Qaeda operatives were arrested from the state, a report said on Tuesday.HT’s sister publication, Hindustan, cited sources saying that NIA detained the two men after they arrived Thiruvananthapuram from Saudi Arabia. Hindustan reported one of these two men is associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the other belongs to Indian Mujahideen. One of them is Gul Nawaz from Uttar Pradesh and the other Shuhaib belongs to Kannur in Kerala, it reported. Both of the men have been detained in connection with the serial blasts in Bengaluru in 2008 and a lookout notice was also issued against them in connection with the case.They were interrogated for nearly three hours by several investigative agencies, including intelligence agency RAW, after they returned from Riyadh, it added. They will first be taken to Kochi, Hindustan reported citing sources, after which Shuhaib will be taken to Bengaluru while Gul Nawaz will be taken to Delhi.On September 19, NIA had said it had busted an al Qaeda module and arrested three terrorists from Ernakulam in Kerala and six from Murshidabad in West Bengal, who were allegedly planning to carry out major terror strikes in India at the direction of their Pakistan-based handler.The suspects were planning attacks at several locations, including Delhi-NCR, Kochi and Mumbai, and they were about to leave for Kashmir to receive a consignment of weapons, which was likely to arrive from Pakistan, the officials added.Under the scanner for some time, the nine men were arrested after the agency learnt that they acquired large quantities of weapons, country-made firearms, locally fabricated body armour, jihadi literature, and literature used for making explosives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-detains-2-from-airport-in-kerala-s-thiruvananthapuram-for-suspected-extremist-links-report/story-ICDdQndYv8jFArQAxuncCI.html

In the Rajya Sabha too, where the party has nine parliamentarians, there was no voting.Also read: ‘Govt didn’t talk to us, it should consult farmers’ - Sukhbir Singh BadalBJD’s opposition to the twin farm bills came as a surprise to several political analysts who were taken aback by the party’s stand considering that the party had supported the NDA on CAA, demonetisation, revocation of Article 370 and Triple Talaq Bill. Political analysts Satya Prakash Dash of Sambalpur University said BJD’s opposition to the central bill was a clever ploy to guard its support among farming community who have supported it over the years. “As close to 70 percent of the state’s population are farmers and many of them are BJD’s supporters, the party perhaps wanted to send a message that it is ready to oppose the BJP when it comes to agriculture,” said Dash.But despite the party’s opposition to the twin farm bills, farmer leaders did not seem to be impressed with the BJD’s stand with many of them calling it a half-hearted attempt. “The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 which is almost similar to the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 was brought in at least three weeks before the central ordinance. The BJP and the BJD are hand in glove when it comes to sacrificing the interest of farmers at the altar of the marketplace,” said Lingaraj, convenor of Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti, an umbrella body of various farmer organisations.Lingaraj said while the central Act ensures that no market fee, cess levy can be collected from farmers, traders and e-trading platform for the trade of scheduled farmers produce in the trade area, the Odisha ordinance(to be brought in as bill in the coming monsoon session) has provision of market committee collecting fee on notified commodities within the market yard. “The most important part is both the state and central ordinances and Acts support contract farming which would prove to be harmful for farmers of the state,” he said.Another farmer leader Akshay Kumar of Navanirman Krushan Sangathan said on principle both the BJP and the BJD are on the same page when it came to contract farming. “For the last several years, Odisha has been trying to get contract farming knowing that it would not be beneficial to small and marginal farmers. Yet they brought in an ordinance and now would make it an Act. There is not much to choose between the two parties when farmers’ interest is concerned,” said Kumar.Also read: ‘UN needs to address crisis of confidence’: PM Modi calls for ‘reformed multilateralism’Noted farmer leader Ashok Pradhan of Sambalpur said BJD’s opposition to the bill did not carry any meaning as the party has hardly done anything for the farmers in last 20 years of its rule. “BJD is also bringing two bills on farming that are in essence similar to central ones. When the BJD brought in the two ordinances in May this year we had warned of its disastrous consequences. While northern Indian states have some sorts of infrastructure for farmers, Odisha farmers do not have that luxury. The central Act, as well as the Odisha ordinances, would not help the farmers here anyway. The BJD opposition looks like some kind of deal,” said Pradhan.Pradhan further said in the last many years, many paddy farmers of Odisha do not get the minimum support price despite the state government’s regular announcement. Unlike northern and central states, Odisha farmers don’t get any bonus. “Farming is totally unremunerative and there is no incentive for farmers. The central Act, as well as the proposed Odisha Bill on farming, would ensure big business houses would make the farmers agricultural labourers in their own fields,” he said.Agriculture expert Devjit Sarangi, who has studied the central bill, as well as the Odisha ordinance, said a farmer can enter into a written farming agreement for any farming produce as per central bill, the proposed Odisha Bill has similar provisions. “The Odisha one only talks about state government collecting a facilitation fee of maximum 4 percent from the corporate houses that come for contract farming while there are no such features in the central bill. But if one looks at the central and state laws, there is hardly any difference,” he said.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated by the state government on May 13, aims at registration of farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity by way of land, soil management, seeds, saplings, fingerlings, inputs, feed and fodder, technology and other such services. The ordinance covers sale and purchase of 50 varieties of plant produce and 5 varieties of animal produce.The Odisha ordinance, like the central bill, would provide for geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce, including livestock, across the State and country to give freedom to the farmers to sell their produce in a better manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/half-hearted-despite-bjd-s-opposition-to-twin-farm-bills-odisha-farmer-leaders-aren-t-impressed/story-TimSbHwegLX713LBe0Uh4K.html

22-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Diabetes, hypertension common comorbidities in patients, says Health ministry||Hypertension and diabetes are the most common comorbidities found in Coronavirus (Covid-19) patients, with 5.74% and 5.20% of the patients analysed as part of the Union health ministry’s disease surveillance initiative suffering from these two medical conditions respectively.About 76% of those infected had comorbidities, and conditions that have been commonly observed in Covid-19 patients include hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low immunity, malignancy, bronchitis and chronic neuromuscular disease among others.Also read: UK raises Covid-19 alert to second highest levelAge-wise distribution of patient data analysed till Monday showed nearly 63% of the positive cases were either 40 years of age, or below, and just about 10% positive cases were above 60 years of age. Men made up for 68.48%, and women 31.51% of the total case load.The findings about the age-wise distribution of infections and deaths in India appear to be in line with what scientists have observed about the global trends of the disease — it disproportionally infects younger people, while it severely affects those who are older.Fever, cough and sore throat are the most common three symptoms that Covid-19 cases experience. Of the data analysed of 37,084 laboratory confirmed cases, 25.03% had fever, 16.36 had developed cough, and 7.35% complained of sore (itchy) throat also. Breathlessness was observed in 5.11% of the cases.Government’s data shows India’s patient recovery graph is also going up steadily as nearly one in four Covid-19 cases are healthy individuals with no known comorbidities, leading to a better chances of recovery.At least 90,000 Covid-19 patients have been cured and discharged from home or facility isolation and hospitals every single day for three consecutive days. “This high rate of daily recoveries has positioned India as the top country globally with maximum number of recovered cases. This has also pushed the recovery rate to a high of more than 80%,” the health ministry tweeted on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-diabetes-hypertension-common-comorbidities-in-patients-says-health-ministry/story-hBcBewqKpNK5yxTUASehtL.html

She was remanded to 14-day judicial custody after being arrested.Chakraborty was arrested on September 8 by the agency after three days of questioning over the drug abuse case in connection with the death of actor Rajput on June 14. If found guilty, she faces up to 10 years in jail.The 28-year-old was arrested on the basis of statements from other accused who have been arrested in connection with the case. She was confronted with her younger brother Showik Chakraborty, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda and his house staff Dipesh Sawant to ascertain their roles in an alleged drug racket.A special court had denied bail to Chakraborty on September 11, saying if she was released on bail she might alert others and they might destroy evidence.

22-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||At a time when a mask has become a political statement — at least in the US — it isn’t surprising that the semantics between a droplet (a small drop of liquid, just to clarify)and an aerosol (a suspension of either solid particulate matter of liquid droplets in gas or, in this case, just air) should become a matter of great debate. Which could explain the enthusiasm with which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Friday update to its website on “how Covid-19 most commonly spreads” was received. And which could explain why, less than 15 hours after it was widely reported (early on Monday morning India time), the update was pulled, with CDC claiming it was a draft that was posted in error. “Through respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. These particles can be inhaled into the nose, mouth, airways and lungs and cause infection. This is thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” the now-rescinded update said. “There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond six feet (for example, during choir practice, in restaurants, or in fitness classes). In general, indoor environments without good ventilation increase this risk,” it added. The language was very different from that of CDC’s previous update (in June) on how Covid-19 spreads; that June update, now back on the organisation’s website, said nothing about aerosols.Because some may miss it, let me point to the “distances beyond six feet” in the rescinded update. I’ve seen people in conference rooms remove masks citing the six feet rule, and continue to talk (loudly). Both, the update-that-wasn’t suggested, are risky. So is the 15-minute exposure threshold CDC suggested in a late July note. I know of organisations that keep meetings to under 15 minutes purely on the basis of that — the internet is a wonderful thing, but as the poet Alexander Pope put it, “a little learning is a dangerous thing; drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.” The CDC’s new guidelines-that-weren’t clearly pointed to the heightened risk of indoor transmission, especially in shared rooms, but also in open offices with poor air conditioning and bad ventilation. And talking (especially loudly, which is a natural reaction in conference rooms because everyone is spread out), was an additional risk. There’s thus far been an assumption that it is all right to speak without masks in socially distanced meetings (usually held in a closed room). Not so, indicated the CDC update. Going by it, even plexiglass-separated lawmakers in the current session of Indian Parliament are not safe. Most of them who speak do so without their masks, making it possible for aerosols to circulate (the plexiglass-glass is in front and on the side, not on top).The World Health Organization has been importuned for months by scientists who have asked to change its own advice on transmission to include the warning on airborne transmission. That hasn’t happened. While it isn’t clear what made CDC change its mind, its rescinded update can still form the basis of guidelines that governments around the world can now draft — to ensure the safe reopening of public spaces and the restart of activities. There’s enough evidence (based on research) to prove the airborne transmission of the virus. These guidelines will need to cover two aspects — the physical, and the behavioural. The first covers such things as nature of ventilation and air-conditioning, the number of people present and the distance between them, and presence or absence of barriers(such as plexiglass partitions). The second has to do with whether or not people are wearing masks, the amount of talking (or shouting or singing), the duration of the gathering or meeting, and the nature of the activity in which people are engaged (for instance, a gymnasium, where a bunch of people are exercising, and, consequently, breathing heavily, is definitely more risky than a quiet ride in the Metro). This may sound like a lot of detailing, but with a vaccine unlikely to be available till the middle of 2021, and life (and work) having to go on, everyone has to learn to live with the virus — and that involves rules, a lot of them, but all based on data and science, even if politics sometimes gets in the way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-azT5tUzIWwcF6OeDDNxUJL.html
22-09-2020||India||Police seek ED’s help in Chinese spy case probe||A Delhi court Monday sent 61-year-old journalist Rajeev Sharma, a Chinese woman and a Nepalese man, all arrested on charges of spying last week, to seven more days of custodial interrogation by the Delhi Police’s special cell. Police have also written to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking its help in exploring how Sharma was allegedly paid through shell companies operated by a couple in China.Chief metropolitan magistrate Pawan Singh Rajawat extended the custody of Sharma, Chinese woman Qing Shi, and Nepalese man Sher Singh after they were produced before the court at the end of their police remand. Sharma was arrested under the Official Secrets Act on September 14. The other two were booked under the same Act on September 19 for allegedly helping Sharma receive money from Chinese intelligence agents in lieu of information he allegedly provided them. On Monday, police sought eight days’ remand of Sharma while stating that they have written to the defence ministry about the “incriminating documents recovered from Sharma”. They said Sharma has to be “confronted with huge and voluminous data”. The police also said a lot of data was recovered from the cellphone and laptop of the three arrested persons. Appearing for Sharma, senior advocate Adish C Aggarwala, opposed the remand plea and said the investigation was not being conducted in the correct manner. He said all charges against his client were baseless and there was no evidence against Sharma with the police. Aggarwala had earlier told HT that police did not recover any classified document from Sharma’s Pitampura house (when he was arrested).“We also informed the court that the police have not provided us with a copy of the FIR. The bail application that we filed on September 17 was to be heard today ( Monday). The court directed the police to provide us with the FIR copy and reply on the bail plea by September 24,” Aggarwala said. Following this, the court sent Sharma to seven-day police remand and posted the matter to September 28. The bail hearing will also be on September 28, the senior advocate said. Special cell officers said Sharma was allegedly passing on “sensitive and classified information” to Chinese intelligence agencies since 2016, and was allegedly paid nearly Rs 40 lakh through various channels, including Hawala transactions and shell companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-seek-ed-s-help-in-chinese-spy-case-probe/story-AG9O9Y9u4vSy29HVCB6eTI.html

Edited excerpts: We have to try our best to stop it. The bill doesn’t become an Act till the President signs it. We are representing the farmers and on their behalf we are requesting the President, please reconsider signing the bill. Please send it back to Parliament and let it be properly debated there... There was no voting, it was just bulldozing of the bills taking place over there [in Rajya Sabha]. I feel that the government should talk to the farmers. There’s no point of putting ministers on TV giving clarifications. The same ministers should be deputed to meet the farmers and listen to them... Whether you make it private or not, middlemen will stay. You think {Mukesh} Ambani or {Gautam} Adani will go directly to the farms and buy it {farm produce}? Obviously they will have their layer of middlemen. Secondly, the mandi system as it exists is such that anyone can come and buy from there... Farmers feel that big corporate houses will take them over. They {government} say farmers can take legal recourse...You can’t make a farmer fight a big corporate house... They are poor people who want a sense of security which they get from the government mandi system...I feel the arguments are being made without consulting stakeholders. We are part of the NDA, they could have at least consulted us. We were never told. We got to know about the ordinance when it came to the cabinet. There itself she {Harsimrat Kaur Badal} said, please do not pass it as from the look of it, they {farmers} are going to have issues with it. But they passed it, saying we’ve got three months till the Act comes, we will talk to them...They have curtailed government APMC’s jurisdiction to 5-7 acres. They said parallel to the APMC, private people can open the mandis on their own, they will not have to pay tax. Government mandis charge 7-8% tax ... Basically, they {corporate houses} have been given tax-free incentives to buy. Outside {Parliament}, rights of farmers {are} being bulldozed, inside rights of MPs {are} being bulldozed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-didn-t-talk-to-us-it-should-consult-farmers/story-ZXzQ11KkwI7S9KqJD6PhYN.html
22-09-2020||India||Mass suspension of MPs not a first||The suspension of eight Opposition MPs in Rajya Sabha on Monday is extraordinary but not unprecedented. Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have a history of mass suspensions aimed at retaining order in the House and control chaos. The two houses, however, have different rules for suspension . Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and Aam Admi Party leader Sanjay Singh, Congress leaders Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah, CPIM’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem and Trinamool’s Dola Sen were suspended by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu for “gross disorderly conduct.” The latest suspension set a new record in the Rajya Sabha -- for the number of lawmakers involved. In 2010, seven MPs were suspended when they aggressively disrupted the proceeding during the passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill. The Lok Sabha, however, has a higher benchmark. It saw the suspension of 18 Andhra Pradesh MPs in February 2014 during the Telangana issue under by then Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar. In November 2013, nine MPs were suspended for the same issue by the Speaker. The first case of suspension of an MP goes back to 1962, a decade after India’s first Lok Sabha polls. Godey Murahari, a Congress lawmaker was suspended for the remainder of the session. To be sure, suspension is an extreme step to control the House and presiding officers use it only as a last resort. In Lok Sabha, the Speaker can directly suspend an MP but in the Rajya Sabha, a motion for suspension has to be moved and approved by the House. Raj Narain—known best for defeating late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the 1977 elections—was twice suspended. In 1966 and 1974. In 2010, the UPA government moved a motion on March 9 for suspension of seven members; Kamal Akhtar, Veerpal Singh Yadav, Ajaz Ali, Sabir Ali, Subhash Prasad Yadav, Amir Alam Khan and Nand Kishore Yadav for creating disturbance during the passage of the Women Reservation Bill. Suspension orders are sometimes revoked if lawmakers express regret for their conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mass-suspension-of-mps-not-a-first/story-XCvzLUx2DUzOIqPzRAaD1M.html
22-09-2020||India||Polls in India pose a formidable challenge amid Covid-19: CEC||Chief Election Commissioner of India Sunil Arora on Monday said “elections in India pose formidable challenges” at the inauguration of the international webinar on the theme “Issues, Challenges and Protocols for Conducting Elections during Covid-19 : Sharing Country Experiences” on completion of one year of chairmanship of the Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB). According to ECI’s press note, it was an occasion for democracies world over to come together to share experiences of conducting elections during Covid -19.South Korea’s National Election Commission (NEC) detailed the steps it took for the electoral process, in which it is widely believed that no Covid-19 transmission took place. South Korea reportedly grappled with nearly 10,000 Covid-19 cases on April 15. The country, however, became the first one to go ahead with its national elections, which saw a voter turnout of around 30 million. At the presentation, the Koreans said that they had implemented a three-phase voting protocol for patients under quarantine. Home voting was an option for those who had tested positive until March 28 and special early voting was allowed for those who received a positive result between March 28 and April 11. Eight care centres were set up for the latter, while the registration for home voting was done online and the Commission sent home voting ballot paper. Over 11,000 voters who had self-quarantined on April 15 were asked to collect a token to vote after 6 pm, close of time of voting, to cast their votes in specific polling stations. Korea’s learnings come ahead of the 243-member Bihar assembly elections, which are likely to be held ahead of November this year and have an electoral pool of over 70 million voters. “Elections in India pose formidable challenges on account of large electorate, geographical and linguistic diversity and differing climatic conditions. Explaining in detail the scale of the upcoming elections to the Legislative Assembly of Bihar, he mentioned that the total number of electors is 729 million,” Arora told news agency ANI.The webinar had participants from over 45 countries. According to officials who attended the webinar, Arora and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar were among those who spoke, along with secretary-general Umesh Sinha. “A presentation was made about the preparedness for the upcoming Bihar polls,” said a person familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polls-in-india-pose-a-formidable-challenge-amid-covid-19-cec/story-P0gsC43d6jdhP5gZBo12NP.html

On Sunday, too, the Lok Sabha was in session after midnight. This is the first time that the House sat for two straight days beyond midnight. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla was chairing the session. The Lower House-- which started at 3pm due to Covid-related protocols this session-- cleared The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 and late in the evening gave its approval to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020 and The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The long working hours in Lok Sabha took place on a day when the Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned without much work due to disruptions by Opposition MPs. The Lok Sabha passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 aimed at making rules governing the foreign funding of non-government organisations (NGOs) more stringent and also mandating Aadhaar for all office bearers of these organisations.  The bill also seeks to bar government employees and judges from receiving foreign funds, and to prevent recipients from transferring funds to other organisations or individuals. The new bill also gives sweeping powers to the Centre to suspend the licence of any NGO, which could previously be suspended for 180 days under the original law, by an additional 180 days. And it reduces the amount of funds received that can be spent on administrative expenses to 20% from the previous 50%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-approves-strict-foreign-funding-rules-works-beyond-midnight/story-r6oOKFBtusZix4yZYbuBzK.html

Lt Col Amit Sharma and Lt Col Sutikshan Rana were posted at Army Service Corps (Supply) Type ‘C’ at Dimapur as successive Commanding Officers during this period when they allegedly took bribes in cash, kind and through bank transactions. The same contractor, identified as Jai Prakash Singh, allegedly gave bribes worth ₹58.62 lakh to Sharma, and Rs 22.92 lakh to Rana. After completing its probe against the two officers, CBI has approached the defence ministry seeking sanction against them under prevention of corruption act so that a charge sheet can be filed. “The charge sheet is ready. We will file it as soon as ministry of defence accords sanction,” said a CBI officer who didn’t want to be named. Army and defence ministry spokespersons refused to comment. The anti-corruption agency registered a case against Sharma, Rana and Singh on December 18, 2018 on a complaint from Brigadier Rajiv Gautam, posted at the headquarters of Army’s 3 Corps.  An Army court of inquiry held both officers guilty of taking the bribe. In fact, the army, while asking CBI to probe the matter in 2018, said : “ The magnitude of corruption is much more than what has been revealed by army investigations. Therefore, detailed further investigations are required by CBI to unravel the complete nexus of corrupt officers...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-looks-to-charge-2-lieutenant-colonels-over-bribery/story-vkg2JPprTeGrje7uF2kpoN.html

22-09-2020||India||Organic farming to be promoted in villages along Ganga to curb pollution under Namami Gange||The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) or Namami Gange has initiated a project for organic farming in the villages along Ganga right from its source in Gangotri in Uttarakhand till Gangasagar in West Bengal to curb pollution in its water. The project was launched during the lockdown month of May under which the agriculture departments of the respective states where the Ganga flows will work on promoting organic farming in the villages situated along the river with funds for the same from NMCG. In Uttarakhand, the project will cover the villages located alongside Ganga from Devprayag in Tehri Garhwal district where its two main tributaries Alaknanda and Bhagirathi, merge in it. It will also include the villages near its aforementioned two tributaries till Haridwar from where the Ganga exits to Uttar Pradesh. The total length of Ganga in the Himalayan state including the tributaries is about 250 km. 50,000 hectares area covered in Uttarakhand with project cost of Rs 400 crore Suresh Chandra, joint director, Uttarakhand state agriculture directorate which is overlooking the project in Uttarakhand said the ‘total cost of the project here is about ₹400 cr’. “Under this project, the finding will be completely done by Namami Gange while the implementation would be done by state agriculture department. Of the total cost, we have already received ₹37 cr from it so far after it was launched in May this year,” said Chandra. He informed that in Uttarakhand, an area of 50,000 hectares would be included in the project. “The area is of the villages which are situated near the Ganga and its tributaries in Uttarakhand. In the project duration of three years, we will promote organic farming by training the farmers there for its implementation so as to gradually stop the use of chemical fertilizers,” said Chandra. Move meant to stop flowing of chemical fertilizers in Ganga Chandra said that the main objective of the project is to stop the flowing of chemical fertilizers into Ganga from the crops near it. “As of now, farmers majorly use chemical fertilizers in their crops which during rains wash down into Ganga which then pollutes it and affects water quality. This initiative aims to stop that as in organic farming the farmers will stop using the chemical fertilizers,” he said. Not much effort needed to implement the project in Uttarakhand The agriculture department official also said that in Uttarakhand ‘not much effort will be needed to implement the project.’ “It is because we have been already working on promoting organic farming here before this project was launched. We have an Organic Farming Act- the only state in the country to have it and already have 1.45 lakh hectares in organic farming. This project will add 50,000 hectares in it which is not a big deal for us,” said Chandra. Initiative will improve Ganga water quality as well provide quality agri-produce Explaining the importance of this project, Chandra said that it ‘will not only improve the water quality but will also improve the quality of agricultural produce in the crops near Ganga.’ “The improved water quality will be beneficial for the river’s ecosystem. Apart from this, with organic farming, the people will be able to get good quality vegetables and fruits from the crops near Ganga. So it is a win-win situation for all,” he said. Experts have mixed opinion on the project The experts, however, have mixed opinion on the initiative with some welcoming it while others termed it a mere gimmick. Prominent environmentalist and Padma Shri awardee Anil Prakash Joshi who runs Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organisation (HESCO) welcomed the initiative saying it will ‘curb down the pollution in Ganga which is much needed.’ “About 70% pollution in Ganga is due to man-made pollutants. This move will, if not all but, reduce the pollution by at least 15-20% which is significant considering the number of people this river has an impact on. Hence, we should welcome this step,” said Joshi. Rajendra Singh, another eminent environmentalist and Magsaysay awardee, who is also known as the ‘Waterman of India’ called the initiative as ‘mere gimmick.’ Singh said, “This move is nothing but a mere gimmick in the name of cleaning Ganga and an attempt to defame the farmers. The main cause of pollution in Ganga is discharge of waste water by industries and sewerage by the cities situated near it.” “It was evident during the lockdown when the quality of water in Ganga had improved significantly because the industries were shut down. It was not because of organic farming,” he said. Singh also said that the “Maa Ganga is actually suffering from a cardiac disease but the government is like trying to treat her toothache with this new project. The focus should be on cardiac disease which is industrial pollution.” SP Subudhi, member secretary of Uttarakhand state pollution control board welcomed the Namami Gange’s move and said, “The government has launched the project after much analysis, it will surely help in curbing down the pollution in Ganga and improve its water quality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organic-farming-to-be-promoted-in-villages-along-ganga-to-curb-pollution-under-namami-gange/story-Del4rC9zxargjMHr3O124I.html
22-09-2020||India||To sustain political aims, both YSRC and BJP display separate roles at Centre, state||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh appears to be maintaining a love-hate relationship with the Bharatiya Janata Party which is making efforts to grow into a potential opposition party in the state. While the YSRC leadership has been extending full-fledged support to the Narendra Modi government at the Centre on various issues, it is facing bitter opposition from the BJP back home in the state. For the last few days, the BJP leaders have been turning aggressive against the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government over a series of alleged attacks on temples. The recent burning of a 62-year old chariot at the famous Vaishnavaite temple at Antarvedi in East Godavari district was a flashpoint in the BJP’s agitation against the state government and the YSRC government went all out to crush their agitation by arresting hundreds of BJP workers and putting scores of BJP leaders under house arrest. The BJP leaders are also fuming over the recent statement of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy that there was no need for non-Hindus like Jagan Mohan Reddy to sign the mandatory declaration in the Tirumala temple disclosing their faith in Lord Venkateshwara. Adding fuel to the fire, YSRC leader and state civil supplies minister Kodali Nani questioned why such a rule was imposed only in Tirumala, when it was not there in churches and mosques. “If Jagan Mohan Reddy doesn’t sign the declaration of his faith in Lord Venkateshwara, does it lose its sanctity?” he asked in a television chat on Sunday. This has triggered a furore in the state BJP, who took out a rally at Alipiri at the foothills of Tirumala on Monday. “This is nothing but blasphemy and it has hurt the sentiments of the Hindus. The chief minister should sack the minister,” BJP state president Somu Veerraju said. Strangely, the YSRC is extending whole-hearted support to the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. Both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the YSRC MPs voted in favour of the three controversial bills on agriculture sector, seeking to replace three ordinances – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The YSRC MPs extended support to the BJP in the election of Harivansh Narayan Singh as deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha last week. The Jagan government also accepted the option given by the Modi government for going in for additional borrowings to offset the GST compensation payment by the Centre, though more than 12 states including Telangana opposed the same. Jagan also accepted Modi government’s condition to implement power sector reforms as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package, including fixing of meters to agriculture sector so as to enhance its borrowing limits. Political analyst Mallu Rajesh said both the YSRC and the BJP were playing their cards as per their political convenience. “The BJP, which lost badly in the last elections, wants to emerge as a strong political force in AP and unless it opposes the YSRC, it cannot fulfil its objective,” he said. On the other hand, the YSRC needs the support of the Modi government at the Centre to sustain state financial position. “And Jagan is still facing the CBI case in his alleged quid pro quo case. So, he cannot afford to confront the Centre,” Rajesh said. Interestingly, Jagan’s neighbour-- chief minister of Telangana K Chandrasekhar Rao has taken a completely different stand towards the Centre, though both the chief ministers had enjoyed very good relations till recently. KCR rejected Modi government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat package because of its conditions, opposed the twin options of the GST compensation payment and refused to implement power sector reforms. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi MPs not only stayed away from the election of deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha but also voted against the NDA government’s controversial bills on agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-sustain-political-aims-both-ysrc-and-bjp-display-separate-roles-at-centre-state/story-Bj6nIR3CG7s7G1ndl2mMOK.html
22-09-2020||India||Meghalaya schools reopen in staggered manner, attendance sparse||Amid surging cases of Covid-19 infection in the small hill state which is preparing itself for a bigger onslaught in the coming month, schools here as in some parts of the country are bracing themselves to partially throw open their doors to students of Class 9-12 from Monday..On September 10, the state education department had studied at length the protocol for opening of institutions from September 21 issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare and with the help of experts had submitted a state-centric SOP (standard operating procedure) to the government.This was approved by the cabinet the following week paving the way for re-opening of schools at least from class 9 to 12 albeit with a rider. Students may attend school seeking help from their teachers on subjects that they need to but with their parents’ written consent. Teachers, however, will start attending school based on a roster system.Day one witnessed sparse attendance as teachers, parents and students are still wary of venturing out with cases increasing each day especially in Shillong agglomeration. However, it was noticed today that people are still unsure and are yet to come to terms with the new normal.HT spoke to a student of Class 11 in a popular city private school who requested not to be named and this was the response. “I’m already doing online classes but there are some parts of some subjects which I want to consult with my teachers. But after seeing the increase in Positive cases in our district (East Khasi Hills) especially Shillong I’m not really sure I should move out right away,” the student stated.Echoing similar sentiments a parent of Pine Mount School one of the oldest premier institutions established in this state since the British era, Mrs VP Kharmawlong asserted, “Unless and until I’m 100% sure my daughter is going to be absolutely safe, there’s no way I’m giving my consent,” adding, “Even the IVR announcement before our mobile phones are connected says one small mistake can prove to be costly so it’s better to be safe than sorry.”On the other hand, schools are gearing up to take matters forward. St Edmunds School for instance has collated data on what topics of which subject a student requires help and accordingly a time table has been prepared which is topic and subject centric and not an extra load on the teachers who have to get back home to carry on with online classes. “We have asked students to specify the exact topics of respective subjects where they need help so that it is organised and accordingly we know how to address the matter,” Brother Solomon L Morris the Principal told HT over the phone. He said about 26 students divided into 3 batches will attend school for a particular subject daily so as to maintain social distancing norms and other protocols. He however made it clear that Class 9 students are not included yet.Loretto Convent is planning to start classes by this coming Thursday after a detailed action plan has been chalked out today. Speaking to HT over phone, Sr. Mercia the Principal said, “We’re going to have 4 teachers coming in daily for classes 9-12 and they will address the needs of the students subject wise after written consent of their parents,” adding “However, the counsellor will be available daily and we will ensure that the students won’t have to stay long. They come, finish their business and leave.” She said she was more concerned about practical classes where physical presence is required. “But we’re not starting them now, we’ll see how the situation evolves.”Vice Principal Seven Set School, Geddelia Nongbri, said, “After having received proper instructions from the government, we are ready to open. We will call students in batches to maintain social distancing etc. Otherwise the school has been fumigated and sanitised and kept ready for reopening.”This indeed will be a trying week for students, parents and teachers as well as school administrators as they try to adapt themselves to the drastic changes taking place in the education sector amidst the ongoing pandemic. While some are keen to see normalcy return, others remain concerned and wary about taking the plunge however soft the landing maybe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-schools-reopen-in-staggered-manner-attendance-sparse/story-NznxvjX1jVri9bNT3zucnL.html
22-09-2020||India||After thundershowers across Mumbai, more rain likely today||The city, suburbs, and various areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region recorded light to moderate rain and thundershowers from Monday afternoon and evening onwards.The weather bureau said thundershowers were expected to continue overnight between Monday night and Tuesday morning while an orange alert has been issued for Tuesday with the possibility of heavy to very heavy rain across isolated areas.Between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm on Monday, the suburbs recorded 15.6 mm rain while 3.2 mm rain was recorded in south Mumbai. Location-wise rain showed 22 mm rain at Sion and Bandra, Bhiwandi recorded 12 mm rain, 32.3 mm rain in Thane, 43.4 mm rain in Navi Mumbai, and 64.8 mm (heavy rain) across Dombivali-Kalyan over 12 hours.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted active monsoon conditions on Monday and Tuesday due to the development of a low-pressure area over northeast Bay of Bengal, which will strengthen surface level winds and its convergence along the west coast. “On Tuesday, conditions are likely to intensify with intense cloud cover off the Arabian Sea coast, which is likely to bring heavy to very heavy rain across isolated areas,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-thundershowers-across-mumbai-more-rain-likely-today/story-p7COy1FJdfCqiYo2GNUHQL.html

22-09-2020||India||Karnataka assembly session to be cut short as Covid-19 cases continue to surge||The monsoon session of the Karnataka assembly that began on Monday has been cut short amidst growing concerns of increasing Covid-19 cases in the state. Instead of the 10 days till September 30, which was the original duration of the session, it has now been truncated to six days after the government finally managed to convince the opposition and will now end on September 26.Earlier CM BS Yediyurappa had appealed to the opposition to curtail the session to a mere three days pointing out that nearly 55-60 of the 225 MLA’s in the assembly could not attend as they had been infected. Though administration officials said that extraordinary precaution has been taken to ensure safety measures are in place, there was concern among both leaders and officials.Finally at the Business Advisory Committee meeting, leader of opposition Siddaramaiah who till then had even called for extending the session to three weeks, agreed to cutting it short. In turn the government has promised that it would allow detailed discussion on some of the contentious bills including those related to land reforms, APMC, amendments to electricity act and purchase of equipment for Covid-19 care. The government is looking to pass at least 38 bills.Siddaramaiah said that the APMC act was a “death sentence” for the farming community in the state. “Unable to control the pandemic and misusing the occasion, the government is bent on destroying agriculture which has been one ray of hope,” he said in a statement.Meanwhile, thousands of farmers took to the streets of Bangalore protesting against the government’s proposed changes in the land reforms act which would permit non-agriculturists to purchase farm land. They are also protesting against changes proposed in the electricity act, APMC and are demanding adequate compensation for farmers who have lost crops due to recent floods.The amendments in the APMC act allow farmers to directly sell to private players circumventing the 160 APMCs in the state. This some farmer organisations would put farmers at a disadvantage. They have threatened to launch a state wide bandh on Friday in case the contentious bills and amendments are not withdrawn.The opening day of the session also witnessed an unseemly fight between a ruling party MLA from Kadur, Belli Prakash and minister for horticulture Narayana Gowda over release of some funds and transfer of officials, creating embrassment for the government. Though later on both BJP legislators tried to underplay the incident claiming it was just “differences between brothers” the opposition said that this was an indication of the inefficiency and chaos in the government.Nearly 10 members of the BS Yediyurappa cabinet including deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan, home minister Basvaraj Bommai, among others - have tested Covid-19 positive or are under isolation. Several opposition leaders too, including former minister and Congress leader Priyank Kharge, have tested positive for coronavirus and are in isolation.The state which till now has recorded more than half a million Covid-19 positive cases said on Monday that it had identified 7,339 new cases and 8,145 people have died till now due to Coronavirus. Earlier in the day, responding to a question on cabinet expansion, CM Yediyurappa had said that he is awaiting directions from the party high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-assembly-session-to-be-cut-short-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge/story-3yE3wFf7iOoVcEfJzmJQkJ.html
22-09-2020||India||Had decisive majority in RS: Ravi Shankar Prasad||The Centre refuted on Monday claims by Opposition leaders that it did not have the numbers to push through two controversial farm bills in the Rajya Sabha and said the conduct of some members did not allow a division of votes to take place.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad along with cabinet colleagues, railway minister Piyush Goyal and parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi, held a press conference where they blamed opposition members of trying to “humiliate” deputy Rajya Sabha chairperson Harivansh.Prasad claimed that the government had a decisive majority among the members present in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday -- 110 in favour and 72 against.“If Opposition members had gone to their place, there would have been voting. And their defeat was certain. But their agenda was not to let the bill pass,” claimed Prasad.Prasad called the Opposition’s behaviour “the tyranny of minority”, a phrase coined by former finance minister Arun Jaitley. “You will not follow rules, break mikes, attack deputy chairman and then talk of democracy, this won’t do,” the law minister said.A top parliamentary authority told HT that the number count in the Upper House revealed that the National Democratic Alliance and its supporters were 32 votes ahead of the Opposition bloc. A number of members have stayed away from the proceedings of the 250-member House because of concerns over the Coronavirus pandemic.The comments came a day after the Rajya Sabha turned into a battleground over the passage of two agricultural reform bills — the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020.The Upper House saw senior leaders charge towards the seat of Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings; jump onto tables; and shoot videos of the ruckus. The bills were eventually cleared by a voice vote with the Opposition alleging its demand for a division (voting through paper ballots) on the legislation was rejected.Prasad said Harivansh was a person of international eminence from Bihar and the way he was treated hurt the people of the state. Prasad said the decision by opposition members to not leave the House after they were suspended was a violation of rules and patently illegal.Referring to the incidents on Sunday, Prasad said Joshi had requested that the House keep functioning until the bill under consideration was passed – but that opposition members did not pay heed to the request and rushed to the well of the House.“There is enough visual evidence available that if the marshals would not have protected the deputy chairperson Harivansh ji, he would have been nearly been physically assaulted as to what was happening just by his side on the podium,” Prasad said.He said in his 21 years in Parliament, he or the other ministers had not seen “shameful” conduct of members who were minister or leaders of their parties.He said the Opposition members knew the norms and the need for conduct. “Harivansh ji was ready for voting. Thirteen times the deputy chairman asked them to go back to seats. How can voting take place when you won’t go to your seats,” Prasad asked.Prasad said if a member was suspended, the member has to accept it and go out of the House. “You will not follow the norms, the rules and propriety and you talk of democracy,” said Prasad.Prasad said Harivansh, who hails from Bihar, was an eminent writer, and that everyone from the eastern state felt bad at the treatment meted out to him. “An eminent Indian who hails from Bihar was humiliated and the Congress party and RJD [Rashtriya Janata Dal] were encouraging it in the most unabashed manner. The people of Bihar will give a response,” Prasad said.Bihar is scheduled to go to the polls later this year.Joshi said the proposal to curtail the session came from the Opposition.CONGRESS/OPPOSITION COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-decisive-majority-in-rs-prasad/story-dB7wasXTR5vINAN8WGRrhL.html
22-09-2020||India||Oppn MPs hold first-ever night protests near House||With Opposition MPs continuing their sit-in protest near the Gandhi statue at the time of going to print, protests in Parliament saw its first-ever night shift on Monday, adding to the several “new normal” unveiled in the monsoon session. Initially, the MPs refused to leave the House after being suspended by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu for “gross disorderly conduct.” After the House was adjourned for the day, the MPs shifted base to near the Gandhi statue—the favourite spot for protests inside the Parliament complex. It was a long haul but they didn’t look tired. They received a regular supply of snacks, packed juices and cold drinks as well as a steady stream of supportive leaders: Ahmed Patel, Gaurav Gogoi of Congress, Manoj Jha of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and several Trinamool Congress leaders joined the protesting MPs to express solidarity. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee called up and spoke to the MPs staging the agitation. She also tweeted, “Suspension of the 8 MPs who fought to protect farmers interests is unfortunate & reflective of this autocratic Govt’s mindset that doesn’t respect democratic norms & principles. We won’t bow down & we’ll fight this fascist Govt in Parliament & on the streets.” Colourful bed sheets were hurriedly brought from an MP’s flats from South Avenue. The aides also ensured enough supply of food for the MPs to sustain them. In the evening, Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s KK Ragesh told others that his wife was preparing idlis at home. He was asked to bring them after 7pm. Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh spent time giving interviews, Trinamool’s Dola Sen started singing songs and protestors held placards screaming “We will fight for farmers”, “democracy murdered” and “parliament assassinated.” Apart from packed thalis, boxful of snacks were also supplied. Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien, one of the eight suspended MPs, announced, “We will continue to sit in protest overnight. Our protest will not end soon.” Indian Parliament is no stranger to unique protests. In the 70s, Atal Bihari Vajpayee arrived in Parliament in a bullock cart to oppose the hike in fuel by the Indira Gandhi government. Last year, when the government was celebrating Constitution Day, Congress and other Opposition parties gathered near BR Ambedkar’s statue in the Parliament lawn and read out different articles of the Constitution.Later in the day, leaders of 18 political parties, including the Congress, Left parties, Nationalist Congress Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena and the RJD, submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention in the matter. The leaders urged the President to not grant his assent to the proposed legislations and expressed concern over the way farm bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha. “We, belonging to diverse political parties cutting across India’s political and geographical spectrum, bring this representation to you to respectfully draw your urgent attention to the absolute and total murder of democracy, ironically in the most hallowed temple of democracy, Parliament,” read the memorandum. “We pray that you return the bills and do not append your signature,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-mps-hold-first-ever-night-protests-near-house/story-nmDihGsHS1be46bMV1QyYM.html
22-09-2020||India||Parties gear up to oppose three labour code bills in Parliament||Opposition parties, which fiercely protested the passage of two farm reform bills, are now preparing to oppose three upcoming labour reform laws. One of these, a provision in the Industrial Relations Code allows companies with up to 300 workers to lay off people without the concerned state government’s approval, a facility only available to companies employing up to 100 people under the current law. Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar on Saturday introduced three labour codes—on social security, industrial relations and occupational & health safety—in the Lok Sabha. The fourth Code, on wages, has already been cleared by Parliament. The labour reform bills will replace myriad archaic labour laws into codes, have been pending for a long time. The government claims to have incorporated 174 of 233 recommendations of the standing committee on labour for the three codes. The Opposition had claimed that the fresh bills — replacing the original versions, should be reviewed afresh by panels. The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019, Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020 are set to be discussed in next few days, setting the stage for a renewed confrontation between the Opposition and the government. The Industrial relations bill redefines the scope of trade unions. The social security Code aims to create a social security network for all workers including migrants and the OSH Code sets standard for health safety norms for firms. Already, Congress leaders such as Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari and the Left leadership are opposed to the labour reforms. While Tewari wants the new codes to be put in the public domain for a month as they have seen substantial changes, Tharoor has demanded that the government accept the standing committee’s recommendations fully. “The alternative would be to face constitutional challenge in the court…does he wants a judicial scrutiny again?” Tharoor questioned the labour minister.“The government has held nine tripartite consultations, and 10 inter-ministerial consultations during the drafting stage of the codes,” Santosh Gangwar told the Lok Sabha, introducing the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-gear-up-to-oppose-three-labour-code-bills-in-parliament/story-Jl3yAgW1YWKbLBbloZvAmI.html
22-09-2020||India||First stubble fires start to show up on Nasa map||Farmers have begun burning crop residue in parts of Punjab and Haryana, satellite images from the United States space agency Nasa has shown, suggesting an early start to a practice that plunges much of the region, including Delhi, into a pollution crisis in the run up to the winter. Data from Nasa’s (national aeronautics and space administration) fire information for resource management system (FIRMS) shows a progressive increase in detection of fire in areas that typically have farmlands. Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said that the most number of fires, shown as red spots on the map was seen from Amritsar district in Punjab. “Crop fires in the state of Punjab and Haryana have started appearing in India. This year, we will be supporting satellite air quality data analysis and forecasting through a community forum for better understanding the impact of such fires on local weather and environment,” said Gupta. Data provided by Gupta shows that in the Amritsar district, between September 13 and September 16, five to seven fires were spotted through satellite monitoring. However, the number started rising and reached 26 on September 18 and on September 19 as many as 50 fires were spotted. On September 20, 62 fires were observed only in the district. Apart from Amritsar, other districts in Punjab where stubble burning fires are being seen are Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and parts of Kapurthala, Mansa and Jalandhar, where every day, at least two fires are seen. A senior official of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) said that these fires were signs of ‘early varieties’ of crops being harvested. “We are hoping that the number of stubble burning cases will be less this year. Our teams are alert but these fires are yet to start,” the official said on the condition of anonymity. While the situation in Haryana is still better, fires were spotted in the districts of Fatehabad and Ambala. Every year these farm fires usually begin in full-swing by mid-October, last year early fires were detected by September 25. The practice is linked to paddy farming in both these states. As a cheap and quick solution, farmers set fire to vast spreads of crop residue in order to turn their farm around for winter sowing. But this spews clouds of smoke in the atmosphere, which coupled with typical pre-winter conditions – slow, cooling winds that settle down closer to settlement – covers cities in a thick blanket of toxic smoke. The problem has turned into a public health crisis in recent years, with vulnerable people being advised to stay indoors.This year, it is likely to exacerbate Covid-19 outbreak. Research from Italy, one of the first coronavirus hot spots, showed that air pollution was linked to worse mortality rates. The virus, in severe cases, causes respiratory distress -- a condition that can be made worse to exposure to polluted air.By October 15, when monsoon retreats, winds change direction: they turn westerly and north-westerly, bringing in the smoke. In Delhi, the average wind speed in winter ranges between one and three metres per second, which is nearly one-third the average speed in summer months. Delhi government data shows that last year stubble burning accounted for 44% of Delhi’s air pollution. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes was burnt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-stubble-fires-start-to-show-up-on-nasa-map/story-5X3cEhFihEHkdM5G0NssOJ.html
22-09-2020||India||Unregulated digital media can spark hate, terror: Govt to SC||Digital media is completely unregulated and capable of spreading hate and instigating violence and terror, the central government told the Supreme Court on Monday, adding that if the top court was undertaking an exercise to regulate media, it should start with internet-based news outlets and not mainstream electronic media, which is governed by some checks and balances.A web-based news portal or YouTube channel can be launched by anyone without any requirement of registration or clearance by the government, and does not face any geographical barriers, factors which the Centre said could harm the “fabric of the nation”.“Any individual can start his own web-based channel by way of a YouTube channel and the only thing he needs is a desire to start and a smart phone which can be accessed by anyone. There is absolutely no check on the web-based digital media. Apart from spreading venomous hatred, deliberate and intended instigation to not only cause violence but even terrorism it is also capable of indulging in tarnishing the image of individuals and institutions. The said practice is, in fact, rampant,” the affidavit filed by the government said.The centre also urged the court to leave broader issues relating to media regulation to the parliament and the central government stating “it is a subject matter which must be examined and dealt with by the competent legislature.” The affidavit was submitted in the context of a case against television (TV) news channel Sudarshan News — which has been at the centre of a controversy after it aired four episodes of a programme, Bindas Bol, on September 11, 12, 13 and 14, relating to the entry of Muslims into the civil services — and the court is now considering the larger issue of regulating television content in the absence of a robust self-regulation mechanism.“The Centre’s stance is interesting, because it is very well empowered to frame laws to regulate digital media. The affidavit filed by the centre itself acknowledges that. It is, therefore, not clear why Centre has asked the court to regulate digital media,” said Mahesh Menon, who teaches law at the Daksha Fellowship programme.The Centre’s affidavit said no eligibility criteria or qualifications had been stipulated by the law for starting web-based news organisations and no statutory provisions to regulate or govern them were in place.The affidavit likened the functioning of web-based media to electronic media, pointing out that digital news outlets use “spectrum” and “internet”, which are public property, much like how electronic media uses “airwaves”.The Centre’s affidavit highlighted the wider reach of such web-based media in comparison to print and electronic media because of its easy access.“The print media has a limitation — only those who can read a particular language can have access to a particular newspaper or a magazine. The electronic media also has a limitation, as, by and large, one would be able to access a ‘broadcast’ or a channel only when he has an access to a TV set and subscription through either Direct to Home [DTH] operator or a cable operator,” it said.Issues concerning security of the nation are also addressed in case of print and electronic media since a TV channel requires a clearance by the ministry of home affairs before it can be registered, while print media is also required to get similar clearances from statutory authorities.So no further directions from the court are required for regulating electronic or print media, the Centre said. However, if the court considers it necessary to lay down guidelines for media, it should start with web-based media, which is completely unregulated, it suggested.“By the very nature of its composition, the print and electronic media would rarely cross the line which may need intervention of this Hon’ble Courts frequently. As against that, by its very nature the web-based digital media, by and large, remains unregulated,” the affidavit contended.The Centre also cautioned that regulating television content could have the undesired impact of media organisations pushing similar content on digital platforms, which are unregulated.“Any further regulation of electronic and print media by the court either by way of guidelines or providing for any redressal mechanism would incentivise broadcasters to use electronic media less and telecast / publish the same thing on digital platforms which would remain unregulated despite having wider reach without any corresponding responsibility or obligation,” the Centre submitted in its affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unregulated-digital-media-can-spark-hate-terror-govt-to-sc/story-XsyiTiJXiCugRZHLYqx9NL.html
22-09-2020||India||India, China commanders meet again amid standoff||Senior military commanders from India and China on Monday met in the eastern Ladakh sector in their latest attempt to break the logjam in talks to reduce tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with a joint secretary from the Indian external affairs ministry taking part in the military dialogue for the first time, officials familiar with the developments said. The military dialogue started at 9am at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC in the Chushul sector and was on at the time of going to print. The outcome of the talks was not immediately known. Two Indian lieutenant generals were among the officers who took part in the talks — Harinder Singh, who heads the Leh-based 14 Corps and his soon-to-be successor PGK Menon, the officials said on condition of anonymity. Menon is tipped to replace Singh in Leh after the latter completes his one-year term as corps commander next month. Menon attended Monday’s talks — the sixth between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6 — as a representative of the army headquarters, the officials said. A joint secretary-ranked diplomat was roped in for the dialogue in a step to ensure that the talks yield some headway, as reported by HT on Monday. The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs — the diplomatic dialogue between the two countries — involves a representative of the Indian defence ministry. Military tensions are high in the eastern Ladakh theatre where both armies have made arrangements for holding positions through the winter. Monday’s meeting between the Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers was their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on September 10. The recent developments on both banks of Pangong Tso have increased India’s bargaining power as there will definitely be an element of quid pro quo in the talks, the officials said. A high-powered panel on China reviewed the latest developments in the Ladakh sector last week, focussing on charting the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April on the disputed border. The agenda for Monday’s talks was discussed at the high-level meeting, even as the situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling the country’s borders in the Ladakh sector, signalling a strong resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC. In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching forward areas they could previously patrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-commanders-meet-again-amid-standoff/story-l7WU6lKNXjFsP540r69psK.html
22-09-2020||India||More chaos in House as 8 MPs suspended||Eight opposition MPs were on Monday suspended from the Rajya Sabha — the most in the history of the Upper House — for the remainder of Parliament’s monsoon session for “gross disorderly conduct” during protests against two contentious farm bills the previous day, triggering a fresh confrontation between the government and the Opposition.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress accused each other of not upholding democratic norms after action was ordered by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu against the MPs from four opposition parties for their Sunday protest, in which they stormed the Well of the House and charged towards the Chair, which was occupied by deputy chairman Harivansh.The suspended MPs refused to leave the House on Monday on the grounds that the action was unilateral and without considering their version of what transpired. After House proceedings were halted, they brought bedsheets, snacks, and water, and sat beside the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament House, where they said they intended to stay through the night. They were still in the premises till late evening. Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and his colleague Dola Sen; Aam Admi Party’s Sanjay Singh; Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) were suspended for seven days each. The last time a large group of MPs was suspended from the Upper House was in 2010, when seven MPs from three parties were barred for the rest of their session over their protests against the Women’s Reservation Bill.On Sunday, Parliament marshals formed a double-layered barricade to protect Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings when the MPs charged at him, ostensibly for not paying heed to their demand for a division of votes on the two agricultural reform bills. The bills were passed by voice vote, without being referred to a select committee of Parliament. In the House on Monday, Naidu condemned actions of the eight MPs and read out a list of “offences” he said the members were guilty of.“Some members came into the Well of the House. They also threw papers. They wrenched the mike of the deputy chairman. They hurled some papers at the deputy chairman. They also abused the deputy chairman also and the Rule Book was also thrown at him,” the chairman said.Declaring that he was “pained yesterday”, which he called a “really a bad day for the Rajya Sabha,” Naidu said: “I am worried that he (Harivansh) would have been harmed also.”The day began with the government moving a resolution seeking the suspension of the eight MPs for “unruly behaviour especially with the Chair and their gross disorderly conduct in violation of the rules and etiquettes of Rajya Sabha”.Amid furious protests, Naidu named O’Brien and repeatedly requested him to leave the House. O’Brien refused to go, while several opposition members demanded that their side also be heard.As chaos prevailed, Naidu also rejected the no-confidence motion by opposition MPs against deputy chairman Harivansh. “As per the provisions of Article 90 (c) of the Constitution, a notice period of 14 days is required for moving a resolution, not a motion. As the House is going to be adjourned sine die on October 1 as per the present schedule, notice does not complete the required period of 14 days,” Naidu said.Leaders of 18 political parties, including the Congress, the Left parties, NCP, DMK, Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena and the RJD, submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention in the matter. “We pray that you return the bills and do not append your signature,” it added.Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh said the eight opposition MPs were suspended without being heard . “The Murder Of Democracy in India rolls on.” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “By suspending MPs if the government hopes to silence the Opposition, it shall not succeed.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the government. “Muting Of Democratic India continues: by initially silencing and later, suspending MPs in the Parliament & turning a blind eye to farmers’ concerns on the black agriculture laws. This ‘omniscient’ Govt’s endless arrogance has brought economic disaster for the entire country,” he tweeted.The Congress alleged that the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman tried to “muzzle and throttle the voices of the opposition parties at the behest of” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).BJP’s Bhpender Yadav hit back at the Congress. “My leader and my party have a tradition of following democratic principles. We were in the House and debating the Bills following the point of order set by the Chair. Who started the hooliganism is for everyone to see,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister, Prahlad Joshi, defended the suspensions. “When the Chairman names a member, then that member has to leave the house. Never before (has) a member defied the orders of the Chair. Eight suspended MPs had misbehaved, it was a type of goondaism {hooliganism}. They have proved that they have no trust in democracy.”In a media briefing on Monday evening, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the suspended MPs had no right to talk about democratic processes. “Suspended MPs who assaulted the dy chairman of Rajya Sabha yesterday refused to follow the orders of the chairman today and created ruckus despite directions to leave the house. They have no moral authority to talk about democracy if they can’t respect the institutions of democracy.”The suspension of the MPs was carried out after invoking section 256 of the rule book, which allows the chairperson to ask an MP to leave the house for unruly behaviour. Rule 256 provides for the suspension of a member; it says: “If the chairman may, if he deems it necessary, name a member who disregards the authority of the Chair or abuses the rules of the Council by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business thereof.”Commenting on the suspensions, PDT Acharya, a former Lok Sabha general secretary, said: “There were unruly scenes on the floor of the House. These things have been happening and don’t always end up in suspension; the choice to take action is also a political decision.”On the Opposition’s charge that their demand for a division of votes had gone unheeded, Achraya said that as per the rules, the Chair cannot deny a division. “If the chair has done that, then it is a cause for addressing. As per the Constitution if a member has asked for division, the chair has to agree.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-chaos-in-houseas-8-mps-suspended/story-0GqZAMUgC7U0dx3w8tdOiO.html
22-09-2020||India||Bill suspending insolvency action against Covid-hit firms passed in LS||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, that prohibits the initiation of fresh insolvency proceedings against companies under stress due to the spread of Covid-19 pandemic since March 25.The Rajya Sabha passed the bill on Saturday. The bill seeks to replace an ordinance promulgated in June this year to provide relief to pandemic-hit firms.The ordinance, promulgated on June 5, prohibited initiation of insolvency proceedings against companies for their defaults for six months starting March 25, when a nationwide lockdown to arrest the spread of Covid-19 came into effect.The six-month period is due to end on September 25. The protection period is, however, extendable up to one year.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the house that the ordinance was issued to provide “immediate relief” to companies as the government had to prevent companies, stressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, from being pushed into insolvency.“This bill is the successor to the ordinance issued on June 5. The object of the bill is for temporary suspension of any CIRP [Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process] for a period not exceeding one year due to unusual circumstances caused by the pandemic,” Abir Lal Dey, partner at law firm L&L Partners, said.“It will be interesting to see how the wilful defaulters will be dealt with during the suspension period. Also, upon expiry of the suspension period, which is not very far, there may be an increase in the filing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-suspending-insolvency-action-against-covid-hit-firms-passed-in-ls/story-Q0kC8L4zOHGFNW6nWpFH7O.html
22-09-2020||India||14 yrs on, APMC abolishment yields mixed results in Bihar||Fourteen years after Bihar became the first state in India to abolish the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act in 2006, enabling private companies to buy directly from farmers, the results have been a mixed bag.The agriculture markets have been replaced by roadside wholesale markets that have come up in every part of the state , and where farmers sell their produce without any regulatory protection -- but to anyone they want unlike in the APMC system, where they were bound to commission agents. The local municipal bodies, which have set up these markets, charge 1% of the selling price each from the farmer and the buyer as a facilitation fee.“Government should abolish municipal tax from small vegetable farmers and allow them to sell produce for free in municipal areas,” said Bijay Kushwaha from Parhuti village of Bihar’s Kaimur district.He said that under the APMC Act, also farmers had to pay 1% tax. When asked what has changed since the APMC law was abolished, he said farmers can now bargain with the buyers without having to go through a commission agent. “We don’t feel cheated.”Anil Kumar from Sakra village of Muzaffarpur district in the eastern part of the state said that farmers are free to sell -- although this doesn’t guarantee cartelization by the buyers.“Earlier, commission agents used to control the price. Now, traders from other states do. Nothing has changed since the Act was repealed. Farmers fight their own battle and there is no government protection,” said Shekhar Mehta, a farmer from Navhatta in Saharsa district.The passage of two farm reform bills by Parliament on Sunday has brought the focus on Bihar. A third bill is awaiting clearance by the Rajya Sabha. One of the bills allows farmers to operate outside the purview of APMC. And another allows them to strike contract farming deals with businesses. “Bihar was the first state to repeal the law even though it meant an annual loss of Rs 70 crore. But it brought an end to exploitation of farmers and corruption at mandis. This helped in farmers getting a better price and brought freedom from commission agents,” said Bihar’s deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday. A study by Jaipur-based National Institute of Agriculture Marketing in 2011-12 said that despite repealing of the APMC law the state’s agriculture infrastructure had not developed in the absence of private firms. The study recommended markets to be developed in the public-private partnership mode through a regulation to be enacted by the state government. “The private sector will operate and maintain the market. The user charge may be levied for the services provided in the market,” the study said.It also said that the market information system had been dismantled with abolition of APMC Act, which is effective in the rest of the country because of the mandi system. The study also suggested formation of farmers associations for better marketing of the produce.This agricultural season has also seen a lower volume of grains being procured by the government at the Minimum Support Price. According to the Food Corporation Of India website, only 0.05 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat was procured from Bihar in 2020-21 against the revised target of 7 LMT. In 2019-20, the state agencies procured 0.03 LMT of wheat.Bihar co-operative minister Rana Randhir Singh claimed that procurement of wheat was low as market price was better than the MSP (of Rs 1,925 per quintal). “Many buyers like those from biscuit and flour industry are buying wheat directly from farmers,” the minister said.“Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce. This year farmers sold grains (wheat and maize) at much less than MSP whereas farmers in Punjab and Haryana got MSP for wheat,” countered Kaimur District Kisan Majdoor Sangh president Vijay Bahadur Singh.This is primarily because the number of procurement centres had reduced from about 9,000 in 2015-16 to 1,619 in 2019-20, and the farmers are dependent on buyers from other states. About 80% of the foodgrains disbursed under the Public Distribution System in Bihar is procured from other states.Former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain said the state government had not done enough to ensure that farmers are able to sell their produce at MSP. “While several eastern states have geared up their procurement machinery, Bihar has unfortunately not been able to develop its cooperatives which are primarily responsible for procurement in the state.” “It is (through a) direct marketing module approach that ITC, makers of Ashirwad flour, is procuring 2-3 lakh metric tonnes of wheat yearly directly from farmers,” Sushil Modi said. Agriculture minister Prem Kumar added that Bihar farmers were getting good price and with the new farm reform law, they will get a better price.The opposition feels otherwise. “It (APMC Act abolition) has hardly helped in improving the farmer’s condition. Instead, it has led to a continuous rise in prices and consumers are still facing its impact. Farmers are not getting any benefit too,” said senior Congress leader, H P Verma.(With inputs from Prasun K Mishra and Aditya Nath Jha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-yrs-on-apmc-abolishment-yields-mixed-results-in-bihar/story-dP9PLxWuVe41I27YZMgIPK.html
22-09-2020||India||Cabinet hikes MSPs for rabi crops amid farm stir||The Union government on Monday announced higher minimum support prices (MSPs) for a range of winter-sown or rabi crops, setting them at 50% over costs of cultivation, a move aimed at allaying concerns among farmer groups that a set of farm-sector reforms undertaken by the government could weaken the MSP regime. The decision on rabi MSPs was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced the hike in Lok Sabha. The new MSP rates, announced earlier than usual, come amid widespread protests by opposition parties and farmer groups in Punjab and Haryana, after Parliament passed two key farm bills on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video address, said opponents of the farm-sector reforms were misleading farmers, saying the government would continue to buy farmers’ produce at MSP rates. MSPs are federally fixed prices for farm produce aimed at preventing distress sale. The government buys largely rice and wheat at these prices through its procurement system. For the upcoming winter-sown season, the highest increase in MSP was announced for lentil (a jump of Rs 300 a quintal) followed by gram and rapeseed and mustard (Rs 225 a quintal each) and safflower (Rs 112 a quintal). The Cabinet approved an increase of Rs 75 a quintal and Rs 50 a quintal for barley and wheat. At these new MSP rates for key winter crops, farmers would get 106% return over cost of cultivation for wheat, 65% return over costs for barley, and 78% returns over cultivation costs for lentil (masoor) and gram, and 98% return over costs for mustard. In absolute terms, wheat MSP for 2021-22 stands at Rs 1,975 a quintal, up from Rs 1,925 in the previous year. Similarly, the MSP for lentil stands at Rs 5,100, higher than Rs 4,800 during 2020-21. The MSP for mustard was hiked to Rs 4,650 from Rs 4,425 earlier. “The differential remuneration (varying hikes in MSP) is aimed at encouraging crop diversification. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission,” a Cabinet note said. Earlier in the day, in a speech aimed at putting a lid on concerns of farmers’ groups, Modi said the existing agricultural state-regulated mandis (also known as agricultural produce market committees or APMCs) would continue to function. He also said the government would continue to buy farm produce at MSP rates. “APMCs will not shut down. The new laws are not against mandis and I also want to assure the country that the government will continue to buy farm produce at minimum support prices in every (farm marketing) season,” the PM had said. Parliament on Sunday passed The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, also passed on Sunday, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation.Some farmer groups want the government to write MSP into the new act. “Our demand is to make MSP a legal right. We will continue to protest,” said VM Singh, the convener of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a major platform of farmer organisation, which is protesting the farm-sector reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-hikes-msps-for-rabi-crops-amid-farm-stir/story-mFhhVhSZq6g5EPFPZcDhhK.html
22-09-2020||India||SC cancels separate entrance exam of B’luru law school||The Supreme Court on Monday quashed the September 3 decision of National Law School of India University, Bengaluru (NLSIU) to hold a separate entrance exam, National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) for admission to its the 5 year integrated LLB programme and the postgraduate LLM programme in place of Common Law Admissions Test (CLAT).A 3-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan ordered NLSIU to admit students based on CLAT 2020 and also directed the consortium of national law universities (NLUs) to conduct CLAT on September 28. “The notice for admission to the five year integrated B.A.LL.B(Hons.) programme 2020-21 dated September 3, 2020 is quashed. The respondent No.1 (NLSIU) shall complete the admission of BA LL.B (Hons.) programme 2020-21 on the basis of the result of CLAT-2020,” the bench which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah ordered.CLAT should be conducted after taking all precautions and care for health of the students after following the standard operating procedures of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development, the court added.The court also directed that declaration of results should be completed as early as possible so as to enable NLUs to start their courses by mid-October.Admission to LLB courses offered by 22 National Law Universities (NLUs) in different states is based on the CLAT score which is held every year by a consortium of NLUs. CLAT is scheduled to be held on September 28.However, NLSIU decided that it would hold a separate entrance test this year, the NLAT, in view of the delay in conducting CLAT due to Covid-19. A notification was also issued on September 3 announcing its decision to hold NLAT.“Candidates will be selected on the basis of the aggregate marks secured in an online home-based Entrance Examination known as NLAT. The NLAT 2020 will test applicants for admission to the undergraduate B.A., LL.B. (Hons) and postgraduate LL.M programmes commencing in 2020,” the notification said.It also made it clear that NLSIU will not accept CLAT 2020 scores for admission for the academic Year 2020-21. According to the notification, NLSIU preferred to opt out of CLAT this year because it has to complete admissions before the end of September 2020 failing which it will inevitably result in a ‘Zero Year’ with no admission. This is because the NLSIU follows a trimester system with 3 terms of 90 days duration.“Each term must accommodate 60 hours of classroom instruction in each course and adequately provide for examination and evaluation processes. Further, the academic offering for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year of the B.A., LL.B programme as well as the LL.M programme is fully integrated and requires a common academic calendar,” the notification explained.Later another notification was issued stipulating technical requirements for writing the exam. As per the notification, candidates were to have a computer system with minimum internet bandwidth of 1 Mbps and exams can be given using laptops or desktops alone with integrated webcam and microphone. Further, only Windows operating system would be allowed.Dr. Venkat Rao, who was a former Vice Chancellor at NLSIU, approached the Supreme Court challenging NLAT stating that the decision taken by the Executive Council of NLSIU to conduct NLAT was illegal and without any legal authority.Further, the notification mandating technical requirements to give the exam are onerous and cast unreasonable burden on students, the plea said. A parent of one of the law school aspirants was also a petitioner along with Rao.The Supreme Court had on September 11 allowed NLSIU to hold NLAT as an interim measure but asked the university not to declare results or admit students till the court arrives at a final decision. The university had conducted NLAT pursuant to that order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-cancels-separate-entrance-exam-of-b-luru-law-school/story-sq2hSAXSjRtLOoLvsSRDfO.html
22-09-2020||India||Rain burst likely before monsoon withdrawal||Parts of India are likely to experience a late burst of rainfall in the next two to three days when the monsoon normally begins its gradual withdrawal. A low-pressure area over northwest India is likely to bring widespread and heavy rains to the west coast, the east and the peninsular region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said on Monday.IMD scientists are expecting the withdrawal of monsoon to commence from west Rajasthan only after September 25; the four-month monsoon will come to an end on September 30, and any rain recorded after that will be counted as post-monsoon rain. As of Monday, the monsoon is 7% excess this year, although there are significant variations across regions. It is 29% excess over the southern peninsula, 14% excess over central India, 1% excess over northeast India, but 16% deficient over northwest India. Since a plus/minus 19% deviation from the long period average is counted as normal, this means rainfall is normal in three of the regions, and above normal in the fourth. Following intense showers in the west, east and even several parts of Uttar Pradesh, IMD is expecting reduced rainfall over the country, which may make conditions favourable for commencement of monsoon withdrawal from northwest India.The low pressure system will move west-north-westwards up to central Madhya Pradesh and then recurve towards Uttar Pradesh. We are expecting very good rains in UP too during this spell,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.The low pressure area is lying over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north coastal Odisha. “We are expecting rains to reduce significantly once this low pressure system passes. There is no likelihood of another low pressure area forming in the next seven days,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.The normal date for commencement of monsoon withdrawal from northwest India is September 17 and for complete withdrawal from the country, October 15. The new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates were issued by IMD in April. Until last year, the normal date for commencement of withdrawal was September 1 and for complete withdrawal was October 15 . IMD’s new onset dates are based on an analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and withdrawal dates are based on data from 1971 to 2019 by scientists in IMD, Pune.“We are not seeing any parameters of monsoon withdrawal being met in the next two days. Rain should stop completely but it rained in west Rajasthan on Saturday and there is water vapour in the region; anti-cyclonic wind pattern is also not established yet. We have to monitor if conditions are becoming favourable for withdrawal after the low-pressure area weakens. But the monsoon season will end on September 30. There are no changes to the season,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the National Weather Forecasting Centre.Last year, the monsoon started withdrawing only on October 9 against the normal date of September 1 and withdrew completely only by October 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-burst-likely-before-monsoon-withdrawal/story-dffeCarbCMVfR76atiYcUM.html
22-09-2020||India||Need balanced approach on right to protest: Supreme Court||The right to protest in public place should be balanced with the right of the general public to move freely without hindrance, the Supreme Court observed on Monday, reserving its verdict on a batch of petitions over the road blockade at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi by protestors opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act , or CAA.While the issue pertaining to Shaheen Bagh itself was rendered infructuous (pointless) since the protests ended after the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and a lockdown was imposed on March 25, the court heard the parties on the larger issue of the right to stage protests in public places and to what extent it can be regulated.“The right to protests should be balanced with the right to movement of public. In a parliamentary democracy, there is a right to protest. But can a public road be blocked for a long time? When and where can protests be held? We will think about how it can be balanced,” the bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul remarked.The protestors in Shaheen Bagh were opposing the CAA, which was passed on December 12, 2019. The CAA sought to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to religious minorities, including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, from the Muslim-majority countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.The exclusion of the Muslim community led to widespread protests across the country, as did the linking of citizenship with religion. Shaheen Bagh was the epicentre of such protests in the national capital. The protests in Shaheen Bagh started on December 15, 2019 and continued for more than three months. Advocate Amit Sahni and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nand Kishore Garg had moved the Supreme Court in February, seeking the lifting of the road blockade in the Shaheen Bagh – Kalindi Kunj stretch.Sahni, in his plea, stated that the road closure in Shaheen Bagh had caused great inconvenience to the public at large. The road closure and the consequent traffic diversion led to a wastage of precious time and energy besides congesting other routes, he claimed.Sahni stated that while people had the right to protest, the right is subject to reasonable restrictions and protestors cannot be allowed to occupy public roads indefinitely.The Supreme Court had tasked senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran, on February 17, to mediate with the protestors and come to a constructive solution to resolve the issue but no solution could be arrived at.During the hearing on Monday, advocate Sahni said that while there is a right to protests, it should not inconvenience public at large. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, said the right to protest cannot be absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions.“Every right is qualified,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-balanced-approach-on-right-to-protest-court/story-HOkyuWncusx7rAma1ObmWJ.html
22-09-2020||India||Nearly 7 lakh cyber attacks in 2020, IT Ministry tells Parliament||The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY) told the Parliament on Monday that Indian citizens, commercial and legal entities faced almost 7 lakh cyber attacks till August this year.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has “reported 49,455, 50,362, 53,117, 208,456, 394,499 and 696,938 cyber security incidents during the year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (till August) respectively”, the MeITY said while responding to an unstarred question in the Lok Sabha regarding cyber-attacks on Indian citizens and India-based commercial and legal entities. However, countering the claim that India is among the top five countries with the greatest number of cyber-attacks, the Ministry said that such “vendor reports” are not validated. However, according to a NITI Aayog report by member VK Saraswat, “India ranks 3rd in terms of the highest number of internet users in the world after USA and China, the number has grown 6-fold between 2012-2017 with a compounded annual growth rate of 44%”. “With proliferation in internet and mobile phone usage, there is a rise in number of cyber security incidents in the country as well as globally. Proactive tracking by CERT-In including its Cyber Swachhta Kendra and National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) and improved cyber security awareness among individuals and organisations across sectors has led to increased reporting of incidents,” MeITY said in its response. The government also highlighted steps taken to counter the attacks. “The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) regularly issues alerts and advisories regarding latest cyber threats/vulnerabilities and countermeasures to protect computers and networks on regular basis. Government has issued guidelines for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) regarding their key roles and responsibilities for securing applications / infrastructure and compliance. Government has empanelled 90 security-auditing organisations to support and audit implementation of Information Security Best Practices,” the ministry said. The ministry said the government has also formulated “Cyber Crisis Management Plan for countering cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism” for implementation by all Ministries/ Departments of Central Government, State Governments and their organizations and critical sectors”.It has also conducted 49 mock cyber drills to assess preparedness in sectors such as Finance, Defence, Power, Telecom, Transport, Energy and Space. “Government has initiated setting up of National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) to generate necessary situational awareness of existing and potential cyber security threats and enable timely information sharing for proactive, preventive and protective actions by individual entities. Phase-I of NCCC has been made operational,” said the response adding that it was in the process of formulating a national cyber security policy. According to Raman Jit Singh Chima, Global cybersecurity lead and Asia Pacific Policy Director at Access Now, the lack of clarity regarding who manages the cyber-security scenario of India has thrown up way lesser numbers than the actual cyber-attacks. “These are voluntarily reported incidents,” said Chima. “These include both state and non-state attacks that one govt agency - CERT-IN - is aware of. However, there is no legal requirement in India to declare a data breach. On an average, according to industry report, data breaches cost Indian firms an average of Rs 14 crore.” Chima added that the government needed to expedite the national security policy, explain their position on attributing state cyber attacks, and make it legally binding to report data breaches and cyber incidents in India. “This is useful initial data but the government should also take note of how many incidents have been found by the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre to assess how much critical infrastructure has been targeted. They should make this information public and also disclose if any of the attacks can be attributed to other countries, which is a part of the MP’s questions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-7-lakh-cyber-attacks-in-2020-it-ministry-tells-parliament/story-bOv6SuWSP9XxUwtF9uBTvK.html

22-09-2020||India||SC: Mindful of need to protect free speech||The nature of the injunction to be imposed on Sudarshan TV from airing its controversial show on the entry of Muslims in civil services would require careful consideration, the Supreme Court observed on Monday, underscoring that its orders on regulation of television content should not lead to a chilling effect on free speech.A three-judge bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud asked the parties to the case whether or not there should be a blanket injunction on the programme, Bindas Bol, or whether the injunction should be on those aspects of the show that can be counted as hate speech.“What exactly can the court prohibit? It is not like a trademark infringement suit where court can say not to use a particular symbol or colour. In this case, we can’t say for instance visuals of a bearded man in green T-shirt and skull cap should not be aired. We can’t go into such specifics. That will denigrate the standards of dialogue of a Constitution court,” justice Chandrachud said.Advocate Shadan Farasat, who was appearing for three students from Jamia Millia Islamia, expressed doubts whether a limited injunction would serve the purpose, adding that he will come up with suggestions in response to the query from the bench on the nature of the junction to be imposed.During the hearing on Monday, the court also took exception to an affidavit filed by Sudarshan TV on Sunday in which the Noida-based news channel had stated that it will comply with all laws while airing the remaining episodes of the controversial programme but did not go into any specific changes it intended to introduce.The court also objected to the affidavit referring to certain shows telecast by NDTV in 2008 and 2010 on “Hindu Terror,” with justice Chandrachud asking what the relevance of the shows was to this case.The affidavit by editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, Suresh Chavhanke, had highlighted two shows aired by NDTV, one in September 2008 titled “Hindu Terror: Myth or Fact” and another in 2010 titled “Is Saffron Threat Real?” both anchored by journalist Barkha Dutt ,which he submitted “pained” and “shocked” him. “Did we ask for your opinion on NDTV show,” justice Chandrachud added.Jain said that it was in response to the court’s remarks concerning representation of a Muslim man in green T-shirt.“This is contrary to judicial practice. Just because we ask questions does not mean you can shoot off your mouth and put it on affidavit,” the bench said.The court had, on September 18, asked Sudarshan News to file an affidavit giving details of what changes it proposed to make in the programme so as to convince the court to lift the injunction imposed on September 15.The top court had on September 15 barred further telecast of the controversial programme after it took strong exception to the content of the show, observing that the first four episodes gave an impression that it was being aired with the insidious objective of vilifying the Muslim community and to bringing it into disrepute.The court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan challenging the broadcast of the programme contending that it was derogatory towards the Muslim community and fell within the realm of hate speech and was in violation of the programme code which regulates TV content.The bench, which also comprises justices KM Joseph and Indu Malhotra, had also decided to lay down guidelines on regulation of TV content after it took note of the fact that self-regulation had not achieved desired results.The court also said that it is mindful of the fact that its orders on regulation of TV content should not lead to a chilling effect on free speech. The court made this observation after advocate J Sai Deepak, who was appearing for certain intervenors, said that the court should consider the impact its orders may have as it could resulting in a chilling effect.“You are absolutely right. But here we are concerned with balance between free speech and dignity. And the dignity is not of an individual but a community as a whole. If it was an individual, he could have availed civil remedy. But here the community is a large amorphous group and we can’t ask them to take recourse to civil remedy,” justice Chandrachud said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-mindful-of-need-to-protect-free-speech/story-hJPqXpZjHP9wHDTGZeAlYO.html
22-09-2020||India||Women leading from front in armed forces||Warships will no longer be a no-go zone for women naval aviators with two of them --- selected for the helicopter stream --- set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels, the navy announced on Monday.The announcement comes even as a female fighter pilot is being trained to fly the Rafale aircraft and join the Ambala-based No. 17 squadron shortly. The woman pilot, who is undergoing conversion training to fly the Rafale jet, is one of the 10 women fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force (IAF), officials said. “Two women officers have been selected to join as observers (airborne tacticians) in the helicopter stream. They will, in effect, be the first set of women airborne combatants who will be operating from warships,” a Kochi-based navy spokesperson said.  The entry of women has so far been restricted to fixed-wing aircraft operating from inland bases, he said. In a short-lived experiment, women from the navy’s logistics branch were deployed on warships in the mid-1990s. The two lady officers --- Sub-Lieutenants Kumudini Tyagi and Riti Singh (daughter of a naval officer) --- are among the 17 officers who were awarded “wings” on graduating as observers at a ceremony held in Kochi on Monday. Rear Admiral Antony George, chief staff officer (training), presided over the ceremony. As observers, the two women have been trained for a variety of roles including navigation, flying procedures, tactics employed in air warfare, anti-submarine warfare and airborne avionic systems. It feels great to be a part of Indian Navy’s history today, said Sub Lieutenant Kumudini Tyagi. “Being combat-ready platforms of navy, through the helicopters, we will be capable of carrying out combat roles including control of weapons and onboard sensors. This profile is exciting and thrilling at the same time,” she said.“Men on deck be ready to be observed. Women observers for sure will navigate you to the shore. Waiting to see women in the trenches now,” said Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd.), from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the IAF in the early 1990s. They will serve on board maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare helicopters of the navy --- currently Seaking choppers and later on MH-60R helicopters being bought from the United States. India is buying 24 Lockheed Martin-Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters from the US to strengthen the navy’s anti-submarine/anti-surface warfare and surveillance capabilities, in a deal worth Rs 17,500 crore. “Rear Admiral George while complimenting the graduating officers highlighted the fact that it is a landmark occasion wherein for the first time women are going to be trained in helicopter operations which would ultimately pave way for the deployment of women in frontline warships,” the navy said in its statement. Along with the navy, the IAF is also giving its women officers more opportunities and exposure with the Ambala-based Rafale squadron set to induct its first woman fighter pilot. Ten women have been commissioned as fighter pilots after the experimental scheme for their induction into the IAF’s combat stream was introduced in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history. IAF is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert, amid heightened border tensions with China. The IAF’s current fleet of five Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission, officials said. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. The air force formally inducted the planes at the Ambala air base on September 10 though they landed at their home base on July 29. The Rafale jets are part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, also known as the Golden Arrows. Rafale weaponry includes Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles --- weapons that allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges. The next batch of three to four Rafale jets is expected to reach Ambala from France in October followed by a third batch in December. All deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021. The head count of women in the military adds up to more than 4,000, but combat roles were off limits to them until the IAF took the lead in crushing internal resistance to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-leading-from-front-in-armed-forces/story-qf9lJU0T9Xo6dwG7OnIGRK.html
22-09-2020||India||UP new business destination: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath spoke to Sunita Aron about the state’s rise in the ease of business rankings, steps being taken to attract investments, and development areas that still need work, among other things. Edited excerpts: After a leap from 12th to second spot in the national ease of business rankings, are you aiming for the first position next year? Why not?. We should make every effort to get the top position. The state has the potential, and we know how to work hard. Our ranking stood at 16th in 2016. We have reached the second position, and we will strive for the top position next year. UP has displayed that it is the new destination for business. The government of India has already provided a list of total 301 reforms to be implemented before the end of this year, and we are working on them. I have already conducted a review meeting with all departments concerned at my level and have given clear directions. For this year, our target is to 100% implement all the prescribed reforms vis-à-vis constantly reaching out to the beneficiaries from time to time. We plan to establish a dedicated feedback call centre at Invest UP level which shall reach out to our entrepreneurs to seek their feedback as well as redress their grievances.Some states are still raising questions on the methodology adopted this year in the rankings.The Business Reform Action Plan (Brap) had listed 187 reforms and we, in one year, implemented 186 of them, spread across multiple areas such as labour, land allotment, registration, environment clearances etc. However, our online single window portal, Nivesh Mitra, became a game-changer. From submission of applications and fee, the entrepreneur could download digitally signed approvals/NOCs {no objection certificates} and licences. It also helped in ensuring transparent licencing system. Moreover, in 65 of the 75 districts, widespread reforms took place. The satisfaction level of entrepreneurs was also 75%. Lot of groundwork has been done in past three years to transform the investment climate in the state But this is not the first time we are hearing about a single window system. Successive governments had announced this. How is it different?We worked on ground implementation of the reforms, with focus on Brap 19. The evaluation has also been done on user feedback. We received 2.3 lakh NOC applications out of which 2.2 lakh were efficiently disposed of. This was possible as about 20 departments were integrated with the online single window portal. This is how 186 key reforms across 20 departments were done in the last one year. What about the poor law-and-order, and the bureaucratic red-tapism that UP is infamous for? Where is the red-tapism now? No one is complaining. Besides reforms, we are improving air connectivity, constructing expressways and ensuring timebound disposal of complaints and grievances. The number of sanctions too have been reduced from 55 to 35 as compared to 38 in Andhra Pradesh and 49 in Telangana, the states that won first and third position, respectively. The entrepreneurs often faced problems in environmental clearances and labour. These issues, too, have been addressed. As for law-and-order, the government has taken several steps for its overall improvement. The police response has drastically improved .The data shows that majority of the crime cases that are happening are because of personal enmity or family feuds. I can only say that the entrepreneurs never felt as secure as they do today. The opposition parties are still critical of the government. They dub it as just branding and marketing. The Opposition is not aware about the ground realities, and they do not want to accept the fact that UP has done it. But the reality cannot be disputed as the [Brap] ranking has been done on the basis of independent feedback. While some investors have experienced the post-reforms efficiency of the system, it has raised the curiosity of others. After investment summits, ground breaking ceremony and defence expo, entrepreneurs have now understood the state’s potential.Which regulations were changed that made the environment conducive for business? We gave clear timelines through the Public Service Delivery Guarantee Act for approval of complete application. We have done away with the practice of inspection prior to registration under the Shops and Establishment Act. The registration is granted within one day from the date of application. Such instructions were also given for labour, land and other clearances. You have been meeting entrepreneurs, big and small. Are they satisfied with the reforms undertaken by the state government? We have great feedback. Their confidence is high as my officers are in regular contact with the investors. We have created a dedicated help desk to handhold the investment leads generated, particularly those relocating from foreign countries. As a result, we have more than 50 investment intents that have been received from around 10 countries, including Japan, US, UK, Canada, Germany, South Korea, etc. worth around Rs 7,000 crore. These include Ikea, Yazaki, Miyachi Corp, AB Maurie, Britannia, etc. Often MoUs get signed at investment summits; they rarely start rolling. Out of 1,045 MoUs signed during the UP Investors’ Summit, 152 MoUs (with investment intent of Rs.49,147 crore) have started commercial operations and 175 MoUs (with investment intent of Rs.55,055 crore) are at various phases of active implementation. Four hundred and sixty-one MoUs (with investment intent of Rs.93,474 crore) have been in active follow-up position at various UP departments. You think the government still needs to be more proactive in ensuring timebound clearances? Time bound delivery of licences/NOCs is the most critical step for ease of doing business. Understanding this criticality, we have taken several initiatives in this regard, including clearly telling departments to raise only one-time query on submitted applications from entrepreneurs within seven days of application received. You want to make Uttar Pradesh a trillion-dollar economy in the next five years. How do you propose to go about it? The state government is emphasising on Industry 4.0 and rejuvenating its investment promotion strategy. For this, over and above the traditional sectors such as food processing, dairy, textile, ESDM & IT {electronics system design & manufacturing and information technology}, the state has identified new focus sectors such as pharma, with renewed focus on bulk drug and medical device manufacturing, electric vehicle mobility to push EV demand in the state, warehousing & logistics, defence and aerospace manufacturing, data centre, etc. Also, rapid extension of world-class infrastructure through expressways – Poorvanchal/ Bundelkhand, new industrial parks are on the anvil. According to you, which are the weak areas that demand attention and focus? The major challenges for rapid industrialisation are creation of land bank and adapting to modern techniques for good governance. All the available industrial land of all industrial authorities have been updated on the GIS {Geographic Information System} portal and is available on the single window portal Nivesh Mitra. Other reforms include FAR {floor area ratio} increased up to 3.5 for industrial use, which is one of the highest in India, allowing agricultural land leasing for solar energy projects, fast track land allotment within 15 days for mega investments, allowing mix land use for development of Integrated Industrial Townships etc. Through Invest UP, now we are prepared to provide complete investment life cycle support to the investors. Covid-19 has had adverse impact on the state’s finances. What is your action plan to mobilise funds to take the state back to the path of development? Since, the state government has resorted to generate fresh leads post Covid-19, not only the scope of investment facilitation has broadened, but also the focus on faster investment implementation has gained importance. The state government is now promoting rapid investment implementation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-new-business-destination-yogi-adityanath/story-3qCaZTAFUIkK6PEGtlTEFK.html
22-09-2020||India||Calcutta HC forms benches for Ponzi scheme matters, criminal cases involving lawmakers||Calcutta high court chief justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan has constituted a two-judge bench that will exclusively hear chit fund or Ponzi scam cases every Friday starting September 25. The chief justice has also formed a two-judge bench and a single-judge bench that will hear all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former members of the state legislature and Parliament. These two benches became operational on Monday. Formation of a separate bench for Ponzi scam cases is being viewed in political circles as a significant development since several prominent leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) figure among the accused. No TMC leader, however, has commented on this. With over six months left for the West Bengal assembly elections, heightened activity by Central probe agencies since August has prompted the TMC to allege “political vendetta by the Bharatiya Janata Party.” On August 24, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sent notices to five TMC leaders in connection with the 2014 Narada News sting operation, the videos of which were made public before the 2016 Bengal assembly polls, seeking details of their family property. The videos purportedly showed high-profile TMC MLAs and MPs receiving money to help a fictitious company. On August 26 and 27, the Kolkata office of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the Narada case as well as the Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS Group Ponzi fund scams involving thousands of crores of rupees, revamped its economic offence wing. Two officers of the rank of superintendent of police flew down from Delhi to join duty. The CBI is trying to wrap up the probe in the Saradha Ponzi fund case involving an estimated Rs 2,460 crore that was raised from around 1.8 million depositors from West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. Sudipta Sen, who owned the group, is in jail. TMC’s former Rajya Sabha member Kunal Ghosh spent over two years in jail in this case. The Rose Valley scam, involving around Rs 17,000 core, is the biggest Ponzi scam in Bengal in terms of money involved. In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the scams and the role of ‘influentials’ in money laundering. The ED is conducting a parallel probe. In the Narada case, the CBI filed the FIR in March 2017, acting on a Calcutta high court order that was upheld by the Supreme Court. However, the trial in this case is yet to start. “We welcome the formation of the new benches. Court proceedings got delayed because of the Covid-19 lockdown. A separate bench for Ponzi scams will help common people who lost their money,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. “The Calcutta high court is overseeing the probes into the Ponzi scams as well as refund of money to investors, around 200 of whom have died by suicide. Thousands of depositors have been waiting for refunds since 2013-14. Faster hearings will help them,” said lawyer Arindam Das who represents the cheated investors of Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS groups. The official notification (No 3477-RG), announcing formation of the three benches was issued by Rai Chattopadhyay, the high court registrar general, on Saturday. Justice Joymalya Bagchi and justice Suvra Ghosh will hear all pending criminal cases involving sitting or former lawmakers. The single bench in this matter will be headed by justice Bibek Chaudhuri. Justice Joymalya Bagchi and justice Jay Sengupta will take up Ponzi scheme cases. On August 26, while hearing a bail petition filed by MPS Group owner Pramathanath Manna, who is in jail for six years, the division bench of Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Suvra Ghosh expressed displeasure and asked the CBI why the trial has not started yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-forms-benches-for-ponzi-scheme-matters-criminal-cases-involving-lawmakers/story-BXs3CFLXaW1QzEfA6ZRExM.html
22-09-2020||India||Sushant’s former talent manager Jaya Saha quizzed by NCB, called again along with Shruti Modi||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing the drugs angle in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, has summoned the actor’s ex-manager Shruti Modi on Tuesday along with his former talent manager Jaya Saha who was questioned on Monday as well.The central agency quizzed Saha for around four hours at the Bombay Port Trust (BPT) guest house in South Mumbai. She reached the guest house around 2 pm and left around at 6:15 pm in the evening, NCB deputy director KPS Malhotra said. The NCB had earlier summoned Saha and Modi to appear on September 16 but their questioning was postponed after one of the members of the investigating team tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Bollywood actors Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh and designer Simone Khambatta will also be called to join the NCB probe this week, Malhotra had said earlier in the day.The actors will be summoned under Section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, after they were named by Rhea Chakraborty while she was being interrogated between September 6 and September 8 before being arrested, NCB officials said.The agency had earlier confirmed that Chakraborty had named the three in her statement but the context in which their names were taken is not clear yet. “Their roles can’t be given right now,” Malhotra said. Chakraborty, however, had later retracted her statement. The agency has so far arrested 18 people, including Rajput’s girlfriend actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and drug peddlers from Mumbai and Goa.Meanwhile, the Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have also launched investigations over different angles associated with Rajput’s death on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-s-former-talent-manager-jaya-saha-quizzed-by-ncb-called-again-tomorrow-along-with-actor-s-ex-manager-shruti-modi/story-2xrPSVr3QZ52OhZl315NLL.html
22-09-2020||Editorials||Why civil society matters||The Lok Sabha has passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment (FCRA) Bill 2020 regarding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without debate, which is unfortunate. NGOs are not without their problems, but the estimated three million such bodies that exist in India are a vital and important element of civil society. Many of them implement and monitor the government’s welfare policies, operating at the grassroots level where the official apparatus is often non-existent. They also provide a voice for marginal groups and social movements, offering a safety valve that prevents the country’s millions of local mutinies from becoming uprisings.NGOs functioned for decades with thin or non-existent regulations. Self-proclaimed societies were not required to register, and trusts and religious foundations functioned without transparency and financial auditing. The introduction of the Section 25 non-profit company, aligning NGO finances and management with those of a normal firm, was a crucial reform. The new legislation should have moved further on this path. Instead, the new FCRA amendments obsess about the flow of foreign fund to such bodies. No one can question the need for NGOs to be transparent about their sources of funding, whether foreign or domestic. But there is a thin line between enforcing transparency and using rules to allow official interference and harassment in the sector. Much of the present bill crosses that line and moves toward a licence-raj on NGOs.NGOs are a heterogeneous category. Regulations regarding NGOs, therefore, should be about basic principles and requirements. The bill introduces a questionable degree of micro-management. An NGO should be required to state how much it spends on administration, but the level of spending should not be a government concern. Restricting inter-NGO money transfers ignores that many NGOs are funding bodies or sub-contract their operations to other NGOs. And that funding should be routed through a specified bank branch has little logic. The Right-wing has, wrongly, constructed foreign-funded NGOs as a threat. While some excesses have been rightly curbed, if this is marked by political vendetta, it will open the doors for all forms of harassment, of all kinds of organisations, under different regimes. The government should send the bill to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha. NGOs are a necessary component of civil society and this bill needs greater public debate and scrutiny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-civil-society-matters/story-hrFdprPXrCXkHTghdZ7rGL.html
