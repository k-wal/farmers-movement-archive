07-09-2020||News||Reversing the economic reversal||News of a contraction of almost 24% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year would have come as a shock to every responsible citizen. The degree of contraction exceeds that in any major world economy. This is not surprising as India combined the world’s most stringent lockdown with the weakest economic stimulus.For perspective, the actual fiscal impulse has amounted to less than 2% of (2019) GDP while it has been close to 10% in the United States (US). The difference finds its reflection in the relative rates of contraction, with GDP in the US contracting by 9% in the April-June quarter compared to two-and-a-half times that in India. There is no doubt that we are observing something that will have a deep and lasting impact on the economy unless the government responds to this news with decisive and quick action. Above all, a functional economic policy is what is needed now, rather than one that is attractive to the government for reasons either ideological or aesthetic.That the future of the economy can no longer be ignored is obvious. The lockdown was justified on the grounds that lives are more important than livelihoods. But, life having to be lived without a livelihood is not acceptable five months after the lockdown was first imposed.Every effort needs to be made to restore economic activity while requiring adherence to wearing masks, social distancing and hand-sanitising. With the magnitude of the contraction now known, the daunting scale of the challenge is evident. The response of policy has to be different from what the government has so far pursued in the name of addressing it.The nature of the government’s response until now may be seen in the two rounds of announcements made, the first soon after the lockdown was announced in late March, and the other in mid-May. The first was mainly in the form of enhanced rations and the front-loading of payments already announced to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman scheme, which, as an income-support scheme, would be deemed selective. The second round of announcements by finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman had two components: A set of guarantees for loans to be made by banks to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the agricultural sector, and a host of structural reforms. The latter includes private sector entry into defence production and changes to existing laws related to the marketing of agricultural produce. Totalling the additional public expenditure, the loan amount guaranteed by the Government of India, and liquidity provision announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government asserted that it had provided a “stimulus” amounting to 10% of GDP. This was immediately called out as a tall claim, for additional spending announced by the government was estimated at less than 2% of GDP. It is not surprising that the contraction in India has been as severe.We will have to await the GDP data for the second quarter of the financial year to know whether a recovery has taken place after June. Despite the Centre having lifted the nationwide lockdown, either statewide closures or lockdown in the containment zones, has continued in some parts of the country. However, it would be unwise to expect a V-shaped recovery. Production is undertaken with an eye to demand, and consumption would have fallen with the income loss, as production had been shut down due to the lockdown for most of the first quarter. Firms are likely to wait for inventories to come down to normal levels before restoring production to past peaks.But the most important reason for believing that a rapid return to normalcy may not be taking place right now is on grounds of the reduction by up to a third in investment as share of GDP, reported by the government along with the most recent GDP figures. Most of this reduction is likely to be of private investment. Private investment will not revive in a hurry given the magnitude of the contraction in output. The present state of the economy is not conducive to investment, nor is the cost of credit down despite RBI’s efforts. The real bank lending rate for fresh loans is higher than it was in March when evaluated in terms of the Wholesale Price Index, which presumably is what matters to investors.The only lever left is the one the government has revealed itself to be most reluctant to use thus far, and that is public spending tilted towards investment. The pandemic has exposed the parlous state of public health infrastructure in the country. Expansion in public spending could start right there. And, not only because health is constitutionally a state subject but also because state governments are closer to the ground, the Centre could transfer funds to the states for deployment. For this, the Government of India would have to borrow, either from the public or RBI. At the best of times, economic policy should be functional and not tied down by a dogma that excludes certain options. We are now living in extraordinary times and only extraordinary measures will do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/reversing-the-economic-reversal/story-QkFtUhttB9pVWUzprycfiN.html
07-09-2020||News||Xi’s new approach to Tibet will affect India||Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent remarks at the seventh Central Symposium on Tibet Work indicate that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is doubling down on its hardline approach in the region, which evolved gradually after the 2008 protests. The strategy for the next few years that Xi outlined entails a mix of persuasion, development, connectivity, indoctrination and coercion. This will not only have serious implications for ordinary Tibetans but will also impinge on the Sino-Indian boundary question, particularly in the context of China’s claims on Arunachal Pradesh.Before discussing Xi’s plan, it is worth mentioning that the seventh symposium was held following back-to-back visits by three high-level Chinese officials to Tibet. In July, Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Yang travelled to the region, focusing on ethnic solidarity, separatism, and management of religious affairs. A few weeks later, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua discussed poverty alleviation during a visit. It is important to note that as per local party officials, poverty alleviation work in Tibet has achieved “a decisive victory” with no counties or districts falling in the category of being poverty-stricken. Finally, foreign minister and state councillor Wang Yi made a rare visit to Tibet in mid-August, focusing on security and border infrastructure. These visits would have undoubtedly provided feedback for the central leadership, and speak of the multifaceted approach that’s being adopted.In his speech on the subject, Xi spoke about the need to “forge the consciousness” of the Chinese nation as a community and “enhance the quality of development” and “national security and long-term stability” in order to “build a new socialist modern Tibet.” More importantly, he suggested that the CCP must adhere to strategic thinking to govern the borders and stabilise Tibet before governing. This indicates enduring concern about local pushback against the party. Beijing still has serious concerns about stability in Tibet. These are likely to be heightened given the contestation that one can expect over the appointment of the next Dalai Lama.Consequently, the strategy that Xi outlined comprises the following elements. First, he highlighted the need to adhere to the direction of Sinicisation of religion. This implies a continuation of existing policy. For instance, starting from 2011, CCP cadres have been stationed in monasteries around the region. The objective is to ensure that religion does not challenge the bottom line of the legitimacy of party rule. Second, Xi demanded that ideological education be stepped up, with the aim being to “plant the seeds of loving China in the depths of the hearts of every youth”. Third, he stressed that the party must dig out, sort out and publicise “historical facts” that link Tibet to PRC. Fourth, he spoke about border defence and the need to create an “impregnable fortress”. One should think of this not just from a physical border defence perspective, but also a broader sense of surveillance and information security. Fifth, the party leadership in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai has been ordered to build physical and developmental linkages with Tibet. And finally, Xi talked about economic development, ecological protection and addressing livelihood issues. In this, Xi appears to be invoking Hu Jintao’s argument that “functioning markets, water, electricity, heat: These are as much part of counter-insurgency as police work and brute force.”Based on these, one can expect a continued and potentially intensified crackdown on communications and freedom of expression, speech and movement in Tibet. Starting from 2012, the CCP has developed, strengthened and securitised its grid policing and surveillance systems in Tibet. The region already accounts for a large chunk of China’s domestic security expenditure. If threats escalate, it isnot inconceivable that Beijing could seek to replicate its model in Xinjiang, which CCP sees as a success, in Tibet to pre-empt instability. From an Indian perspective, Xi’s comments on border security along with those about digging up historical factswill impact the boundary dispute. The former will have an impact at a tactical level the latter implies that Beijing will engage in greater public opinion and legal warfare, leveraging selective history to strengthen its claims on Arunachal Pradesh. In the long-term, this will likely undermine the possibility of arriving at any resolution to the boundary dispute based on the current status quo on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/xi-s-new-approach-to-tibet-will-affect-india/story-CjOIGguEGKOIlRCzTbFqyI.html
07-09-2020||News||Clean air could be a strong economic boost for India||Clean air should be a basic human right and yet air pollution is the single greatest environmental risk to human health. In 2017, 3.4 million people died prematurely as a result of outdoor air pollution which makes 6% of global deaths. The share for India was 8.26%. The World Health Organization (WHO) ranked New Delhi as the world’s most polluted city in 2014. The Covid-19 pandemic made urban air pollution a highly visible problem. As cities declared lockdowns, people in many highly-polluted cities saw the blue skies and many of them realised for the first time what the world might look like if the air was clean. Public perception surveys since the pandemic reveal that fresh air has caused many to reconsider a return to “normal”. There’s a clear demand for greener spaces in cities, increased public transportation, work from home and penalising the polluters. The sharp drop in air pollution during the pandemic has also created a greater awareness of the health impacts and vulnerability to threats like Covid-19 due to airborne pollutants. While India develops its economic recovery plans, it is essential to include measures to reduce air pollution. The lockdown has shown us how quickly the air could be cleaned up if major pollution sources are properly controlled. However, to make such positive change permanent we need to start addressing the sources of air pollution at a systemic level. An area of obvious concern is automotive emissions. The drastic drop in transport emissions during the lockdown was evident when cities across India recorded a 65-70% reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NOx) concentrations—a pollutant directly attributable to internal combustion engines. At the same time, India has the world’s second-largest road network, and with the current rate of growth, the total number of vehicles is projected to double by 2030. A chronic point of contention has been the expansion of roads to accommodate more cars. Cars are an inefficient mode of transport and use of public space as they waste over 50% of their carrying capacity and are parked for almost 90% of the time. Doubling car numbers could bring even more unbearable traffic, air pollution and expensive additional road infrastructure. One obvious solution is the two- and three-wheelers which now account for nearly 84% of the county’s annual auto sales and road transport volume. They fare much better on carrying capacity as well—especially three-wheelers used in public transport. Their counterparts, the electric rickshaws, have emerged as a clear winner for the last-mile connectivity across much of urban India since their fares are also 30% cheaper. They are not only cleaner but also quieter. Electric public transport also ties in with what should be India’s long-term focus: Developing affordable and comfortable solutions for longer distances. Taking inspiration from Delhi’s excellent metro rail, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Nagpur are now also developing their own metro lines. Commuter convenience can be further enhanced by state governments expanding their fleets of electric buses and introducing regulations and incentives for electric rickshaws, taxis and city delivery vehicles. They all have zero on-road emissions, are cheaper to access, and significantly more efficient in moving people around than private cars. In terms of micro-mobility, studies suggest that 71% of all trips in India happen within a radius of 5 km. These can be easily serviced by electric two- and three-wheelers, which can do several runs per charge at a low cost, even with standard battery packs of 70-80 km capacity. They can operate in addition to a focus on urban redesign that includes more bicycle lanes. It is important to hold extended public discussions between residents of areas with heavy traffic and city planners, so that redevelopment takes into account what non-car owners want. The programmes such as CyclesforChange, launched jointly in Chennai by the Institute for Transportation Development and Policy (ITDP) and the Centre’s ministry of housing and urban affairs to encourage more intra-city bicycle trips, are essential steps in the right direction. The experience of many European cities shows that moving from heavy car traffic to predominantly pedestrian, bicycling and public transport mobility is often met initially by the hostility of residents, shop owners and drivers but once the changes are in place people appreciate the new arrangements. Shops benefit from pedestrians that can stop and enter easily, the air is cleaner, life is healthier. However, it is also important that reducing transport emissions is coupled with clean sources of energy. As more renewable energy enters the market, the pollution load of charging EVs will decline nationally, not just locally. As part of state EV policies, state governments should incentivise that charging stations and battery swapping points are powered by renewable energy. The United Kingdom and other countries are introducing the practice of charging stations declaring what the energy source is. In India, some states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu, are already setting an example with reduced power tariffs for the EV charging infrastructure. Policies for ambitious electrification of city transport could also have a strong economic benefit by boosting battery and electric vehicle production. It can create demand that would catalyse the National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage and move India forward in the fierce global competition in the field of energy storage and new mobility. This could be an area of particular interest for international cooperation with the European Union (EU) and some of the most ambitious EU countries in these sectors such as Germany and France. Overall, the response to recovering after the pandemic has shown that local, collective action has the power to enforce change. A truly green recovery should allow people to avail the cleanest, most affordable modes of travel, which is where e-mobility and public transit solutions are important. With on-road economics starting to tilt irreversibly in their favour, governments would thus do well to prioritise demand-side funding of new mobility over business-as-usual.

07-09-2020||News||TV news is in crisis. Regulate, reform it||The time for news channels to introspect is long overdue. News channels have a legal and moral responsibility to provide factual and informative inputs to society. Sane voices such as former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s appeal “for self-restraint” or Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu’s condemnation of “Sensationalism, yellow journalism and TRP-generating news...” have had little impact. The Delhi High Court’s humorous comment in Tharoor vs Goswami that “TV viewers who want to watch action films should (instead) watch TV debates on current affairs...” is more a cry of anguish. The nation wants to know when we will have news without the noise and content sans fiction.The toxic triangle of viewership, ratings and revenue is the catalyst driving most debates and that paradigm must be continuously stigmatised along with use of a relentless societal scissor to cut this Gordian knot. The clear line between editorial and commercial decisions, and between news and entertainment, must be restored. Uneven debates, deliberate interruptions, verbal blood sport, conscious invitation of biased and malicious participants, strategic muting of mikes, the formulation of one-sided themes and unevenly numbered viewpoints are standard tactics for driving TRP ratings and advertisement revenue. Serious news items are presented as popular crime thrillers and extremist anchors pose a potent threat to democracy. A set of reforms are now essential. One, the corruption of and connivance between TV channels and rating agencies is an open secret. For sanity in studios and on screens, an ecosystem that goes beyond this ratings-driven practice and which is citizen-centric and democratic is vital. Only the legislature can do this by inaugurating a credible, independent rating regulator.The second minimalist reform is the accountability of the media or, more importantly, the awareness and acceptance of such accountability. No freedom is absolute: Reasonable restrictions are inevitable. If progress without freedom is impossible, democracy without discipline is chaos. The courts must be quick and decisive whenever the media transgresses the Laxman rekha. In the Sahib Singh case (1965), the apex court said that journalists “have no greater freedom than others to make any imputations or allegations sufficient to ruin the reputation of a citizen…..Reckless comments are to be avoided”. The problem lies in these principles not being enforced. The third reform, industry self-regulation, was meant to be the key to maintaining standards. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA), the watchdog for visual media, has enough power to stop unethical practices. From prohibiting an anchor/presenter from making derogatory, derisive or judgmental statements to ensuring that programmes do not become a platform for spreading acrimony to controlling egregious behaviour, the regime is comprehensive and unequivocal. The problem is that these powers have not been used effectively because of a conspiracy of silence, the incestuous nature of an exclusive peer club, the chalta hai attitude and an old boys’ cartel, which seem too powerful for NBA to bust.Enforcing the ethics code and ensuring compliance is anathema to the fourth estate, at least voluntarily. But democratic spirit itself demands that media not take undue advantage of its powers. Have we seen anything like what we see in India on any British, Australian or Canadian channel or even the more aggressive American channels? The BBC and its guidelines not only mandate appropriate respect and dignity during programmes but also hold themselves accountable by law for any defamatory comments during shows. The Swiss Federal Act has similar provisions for visual programmes as does Hong Kong which ensures great accuracy and impartiality in news programmes. If the diagnosis of the disease is obvious, disciplined self-medication is the prescription. Sermons have not worked. Reliance on voluntariness has been construed as weakness and trespasses have not been visited with harsh consequences. For example, NBA has a range of powers — warn, admonish, censure, express disapproval, impose a fine upon the broadcaster and /or recommend to the concerned authority for suspension/revocation of its licence. But it has never imposed the last, and very occasionally, the penultimate penalty. As the industry’s conscience-keeper, NBA must get its teeth into the issue. Its advisories must increase and their slightest violation should evoke harsh warnings and penalties. Make an example of a few egregious violators. NBA has nothing to lose except its passivity and much to gain. A clear message sent to a few, consistently and even-handedly, will lead to a tangible and decisive change in temperature, content and direction and invite huge appreciation from the public.Abhishek Singhvi is a senior, third-term sitting MP; former chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee; former additional solicitor general, senior national spokesperson, Congress and eminent jurist.

07-09-2020||News||In India, nurturing the growth of local economic ecosystems||Scientists speculate that nature sends viruses to stop other things growing too fast that threaten the health of the whole system while caring only for their own health. Unbridled globalisation was threatening the well-being of societies and of the natural environment. Covid-19 has stopped this from spreading any further. Physical lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus have broken up global supply chains. Businesses, as well as humans, are being compelled to find resources locally. A “vocal for local” movement, which was growing even before Covid-19, was described as retrograde by the “vocal for global” lobby. Local has now become a necessity for business and human survival. But even though there is clearer evidence now that the model of globalisation which was founded on more trade across borders is not sustainable, eminent economists continue to defend it. Economic history has disproved a foundational premise of the free trade theory. Nations have grown, through history, by learning to do what they could not do before, and doing it better than others — Japan after the war; China in the 21st century; and the United States (US) in the 19th and 20th centuries. Industrial nations, unlike natural resource-rich nations, are not born with competitive advantages; they develop them.The simplistic free-trade theory must be supplemented with theories of how humans, businesses, and nations, learn new capabilities. And, since humans, businesses, and nations will compete, the only sustainable competitive advantage of businesses and nations is their ability to learn faster than any potential competition. Therefore, an industrial policy focused on increasing the capabilities of people and businesses within the nation is imperative for the survival of the nation and the well-being of its citizens. This is real atmanirbharta. There is continuing conceptual confusion among some of India’s policymakers. While they are beginning to recognise the need to be atmanirbhar (self-reliant; which is more urgent because of the China threat), they continue to propound the necessity for Indian businesses to be connected with global supply chains. There is nothing wrong with taking advantage of global supply chains. However, they will hardly provide India and its businesses large channels for growth in the next two decades. India must grow local supply webs, radiating outwards as far as geopolitical boundaries and trade barriers will allow them to spread. As a recent UNIDO paper says, a shift in business and national economic strategies is required away from cost-efficiency, which global sourcing enabled, to increases in market focus. “Europe for Europe, Asia for Asia”, they say. India for India, we may add. India has the potential to be a large market. It will be a large market when more Indians earn higher incomes. For more people to earn higher incomes, they must produce something that someone else will buy. Markets will be more local, and production will also be more local. India needed an employment policy with an industrial policy ever since it embarked on its trade liberalisation path in the 1990s. For nations to become competitive, it is not enough to develop a few, large, world-class companies. Industrial ecosystems within countries, comprising webs of small and large, and formal and informal enterprises, must compete with ecosystems in other countries. Indeed, large companies from a country cannot become competitive unless they are sustained by a competitive ecosystem. Therefore, large companies must nurture small domestic companies, and all of them must nurture the people who work in them. Human beings are the only “appreciating assets” any enterprise can have. Because they have the ability to learn new capabilities if they are given opportunities to do so. Fortunately, India is abundantly endowed with people. They will be India’s source of sustainable competitive advantage when India reorients its policies to nurture the growth of local economic ecosystems.

According to the victim, she was gangraped by four men, but the police registered the first information report (FIR) only against three accused.Seeking action, the girl, along with her family members, on Monday met the joint commissioner of police, Kanwardeep Kaur, and filed a written complaint.The woman alleged that she had given names of all four accused in her statement to the police and before magistrate as well, but the police registered a case only against three accused, who are minors. The main accused, who is 24-year-old, is politically connected, which is why the police have spared him, she alleged. Her mother also accused the Division Number 3 police of harassing them.“The police called my daughter for investigation late in the evening and made her wait for hours at the police station,” she claimed. Joint commissioner of police Kanwardeep Kaur said the area was not under her jurisdiction, so the matter was sent to the official concerned.The victim had lodged an FIR on September 1 at the Division Number 3 police station against three minors. The victim, who is a domestic help, was returning home when the accused intercepted her. They threatened to attack her with acid and took her to a room, where they raped her and also clicked her pictures.Division Number 3 SHO Satish Kumar said the police had registered an FIR according to the statement recorded by the victim. He said had “no idea why the victim was accusing the police”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-gangrape-victim-accuses-police-of-favouring-accused/story-x6pUzdUY6BMxKpYaZMP7oN.html
07-09-2020||Noida||Registration department to seize 19 properties for stamp duty evasion||The Gautam Budh Nagar stamp and registration department have decided to seize 19 properties which had claimed waivers on stamp duties to set up industrial units, but failed to establish the same in the past three years. Officials said that these units had claimed waivers and paid bank guarantees of the equal amount of stamp duties however, they failed to set up a factory/company while also getting the bank guarantee released.SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general (registration), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the Uttar Pradesh government provides exemptions on stamp duty to certain industrial units as per the Infrastructure & Industrial Investment Policy 2012. “According to the policy, industrial units related to information technology, biotechnology, agro processing, food processing, food parks, solar energy or alternative sources of energy and BPO call centres will be provided 100% exemption from stamp duty in the state. There are some other fields in which the government gives 50% or less exemption in stamp duty. As per the guidelines, these units need to be operational within three years of the land being allotted,” he said.Tripathi said the allottees need to submit a bank guarantee of the same amount equal to stamp duty for three years. “We have found that some people have not developed their industrial units, while they have got their bank guarantee released. We will seize the properties of 19 such allottees and recover the stamp duty,” he said.Tripathi said that about Rs 16 crore stamp duty would be due against these allottees.Sudhir Shrivastava, vice president, Noida Entrepreneurship Association (NEA), said some allottees sometimes fail to develop their units. “We have also seen that the allottees sometimes do not get the land developed. The officials need to investigate in what circumstances the units were not developed and then they can take action,” he said.The district stamp and registration department did not change circle rates this year as the real estate sector is facing a slump and has been hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown. There were zero registrations in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/registration-department-to-seize-19-properties-for-stamp-duty-evasion/story-wCWhC7qVpAWNXC6zmc57KP.html
07-09-2020||Noida||Field work initiated to make a case of Dhanauri wetland as Ramsar site||In what could be termed as the initiation of fieldwork to notify the Dhanauri wetlands, officials from Wetland International and the state forest department on Monday begun ground inspections and terrain analysis to make a case for Dhanauri to be declared as a Ramsar site and a sarus crane sanctuary.Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance. Once declared Ramsar sites, no other activity can be taken up at the wetland. India is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, 1971 in Iran. India has a total of 27 Ramsar sites, including Narora in UP.The officials, aided by gram panchayat members from neighbouring villages, collected water samples and demarcated the coordinates of the area to draw a ‘habitat map’ of the wetland.Once the habitat map is developed, the forest department will observe the land ownerships falling within the wetland, initiating the process of land acquisition.“The forest department has made a good proposal so far. We as knowledge partners of the Union environment ministry will complete the technical work, and will make a case for the Ramsar site,” said Dr Ritesh Kumar, director, Wetlands International, South Asia.The on-spot sample -- collected from one of the muddiest parts of the wetlands – found dissolved oxygen of 2 milligram per litre (mg/l) (against the required 4 to 8 mg/l), as well as high levels of phosphate nitrates. However, officials said parts of the wetland with cleaner water, away from agricultural fields, would have a better water quality.“These values will differ from place to place. But with these values, we can establish a baseline about the existing condition, so we will build a case for it,” said Dr Kumar.In 2018, the district forest department first sent its proposal to declare the waterbody as a wetland under Wetland Rules 2017. Forest officials said that upon notification, the ecology would improve as no other works which could harm the ecology of the area would stop.“It is a wetland as per definition. Once notified as per the Supreme Court’s guidelines it will be officially notified as a wetland. We are speeding up the process for a Ramsar site as well. Once declared a wetland, it would bring a curb to the other works such as agriculture,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, and nodal officer appointed by the state government to initiate the legal processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/field-work-initiated-to-make-a-case-of-dhanauri-wetland-as-ramsar-site/story-IQTXg0XWbwFwGLylCGM8uI.html
07-09-2020||City||All 10 metro stations in Gzb to resume graded operations on September 9 and 10||Ghaziabad: All 10 metro stations under the two metro networks in Ghaziabad will open for passenger operations from September 9 and 10. The Ghaziabad district magistrate on Monday said he held meetings with station in-charges and went for an inspection of arrangements made by the Delhi metro rail corporation (DMRC) The Blue line is scheduled to resume passenger operations from September 9 while the Red line is slated to open on September 10. The Blue line comprises two prominent stations of Vaishali and Kaushambi. The Red line has eight stations -- Shaheed Nagar, Raj Bagh, Major Mohit Sharma Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Mohan Nagar, Arthala, river Hindon and Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda. “We held meetings with station in-charges of DMRC on Monday and all 10 stations will open as per schedule. The DMRC officials have requested us for additional deployment of 104 civil defence personnel in two shifts to help in social distancing and to maintain order at stations. Besides, at stations where there is likelihood of heavy rush of passengers, our police personnel will remain deployed,” Pandey said. “We have also directed the municipal commissioner to clean the space outside all metro stations as they have been shut since March and ensure that all garbage and clutter are removed. We visited the stations and DMRC officials showed how passenger operations will work,” he added. A DMRC spokesperson said the stations will open for operations as per dates already announced by it. According to the schedule released by DMRC on September 2, Line-3/4 (Blue Line) from Dwarka Sec-21 to Noida Electronic City/Vaishali & Line-7 (Pink Line) from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar will open for graded operations from September 9. The trains will run in two shifts from 7am to 11am and 4pm to 8pm. The schedule also said Line-1 (Red Line) from Rithala to Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda, Line-5 (Green Line) from Kirti Nagar/Inderlok to Brig. Hoshiar Singh (Bahadurgarh) & Line-6 (Violet Line) from Kashmere Gate to Raja Nahar Singh (Ballabhgarh) will resume operations from September 10 with a similar schedule. The DMRC sources said all passengers arriving at the stations will be screened carefully with the help of infrared thermometers, besides sanitisation of luggage and use of hand sanitisers. “Trains will not stop at stations in containment zones. Such stations will remain closed for public. Similarly, some of the stations may be skipped if social distancing is not followed by passengers,” the statement had said.

However, there has been a steady increase in testing,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta.While he maintained that testing is done as per the requirement and there is no “target to achieve”, experts said people should be encouraged to come forward for testing to rule out infection.“The message should be that if anyone is having symptoms or has come in contact with a confirmed case or has even the suspicion of contracting the infection should be encouraged to go for testing. It should be available in a hassle-free manner, which in turn will increase the testing numbers,” said Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER.Professor Yogesh Chawla, former director, PGIMER, said at times, people have symptoms but don’t come forward due to the fear of stigma. “In such a scenario, it is necessary to encourage people at the local level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/testing-not-keeping-pace-with-rising-cases-in-chandigarh/story-sirn60hjnVmocdu1Bjo1qK.html

The negligence in dealing with coronavirus crisis have exposed the government’s insensitivity towards the people’s plight,” said former UP congress chief Raj Babbar. The first phase of virtual rallies will end on September 16 after covering 19 north Bihar districts. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) spokesman Rajesh Rathore claimed over 10.50 lakh people watched the rally across the state and country. Meanwhile, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is slated to address a virtual rally after the second phase, covering south Bihar districts, which is likely to conclude by month end. Babbar alleged Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is yet to deliver on the promises of better education facility, job opportunities, change in health infrastructure that he had made even as people continue to struggle with recurring floods and subsequent devastation. AICC general secretary and screening committee chairman Avinash Pandey alleged that state economy had collapsed and employment opportunities reduced. AICC spokesman Acharya Pramod Krishnam said the country was waiting for Bihar’s mandate, which always offered a new dimension to the nation’s political narrative. He said the CM should be ashamed for perpetuating a regime of chaos and corruption and leaving the people to fend for themselves. AICC secretary Ajay Kapoor, All India Mahila Congress Committee Chief Sushmita Dev and state Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha among others also addressed the rally from party offices in Delhi and Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/congress-kicks-off-virtual-rally-from-champaran-slams-govt-for-not-fulfilling-promises/story-6TM7vJJVzDQ06MJ25n4DuJ.html

07-09-2020||Chandigarh||UT Employees’ Housing Scheme: CHB redraws plans, explores price options||It was an apartment scheme that fell through due to the high price tags of the units, but now the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is making new drawings of the project and exploring costing options of the UT Employees’ Housing Scheme.A consultant has been hired by CHB to rework plans, it has been revealed. “Unless architectural plans of all the options are prepared, we will not know how to minimise costs... or the exact costs,” says a senior board official who wishes to remain anonymous.Once the drawings are complete CHB will get inputs on it from the UT urban planning department.Process to take two weeksThe entire process is likely to be completed within two weeks, said the official. “Various elements regarding Floor Area Ratio (FAR), covered space, and density will be reworked for different options, particularly when it comes to the number of floors and other plans.” FAR is the ratio of a building’s gross floor area to the total area of the land on which it’s built.The move followed a meeting to discuss the housing scheme through video conferencing on August 19 under the chairmanship of the Union home secretary.After deliberations to resolve the costing issue it was decided that costs be recalculated again for different categories by applying various factors such as FAR, collector rate, plotted area etc in consultation with the representatives of petitioners who had filed a court case related to the scheme.FAR likely to be increased“The options being accessed includes increasing the FAR for the project. The floors can go up to 11. Increase in FAR means the scheme will only apply to Sector 56. Also, charges will only be applicable for plotted areas instead of the total land parcel,” the official said.Around 4,000 apartments were to be built in sectors 52, 53 and 56 by CHB for government employees as part of a scheme launched in 2008.A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around Rs 57 crore with CHB.Later, the scheme was shelved and then revived after the employees took up the matter with city MP Kirron Kher. But the ministry of home affairs (MHA) allowed the administration to transfer the land to the CHB at the current collector rates.With this the apartment prices shot up to Rs 50 lakh for Category D, Rs 1 crore for Category C, Rs1.64 crore for Category B and Rs2.08 crore for Category A.When the scheme was announced prices were low at Rs 34.70 lakh for Category A, Rs 24.30 lakh for Category B, Rs 13.53 lakh for Category C and Rs 5.76 lakh for Category D.The employees then moved the Punjab and Haryana high court alleging that the CHB was charging five times the initial price for land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-employees-housing-scheme-chb-redraws-plans-explores-price-options/story-bzDgp2Ap4HvArcOF5etVPI.html

07-09-2020||Chandigarh||Now, an extra green topping for Chandigarh Golf Club course||Golfers from Tuesday will get to play on the newly re-laid and only three-tiered greens at hole 12 of the 18-hole Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC) course. As CGC resumes sports activities amid a slew of relaxations after the Covid-19 lockdown, players will now face increased difficulty levels putting three-tier greens at the 415 yard par-4 hole.Putting from one tier to another can be difficult, as the slope that divides tiers can prevent players from speeding up their game.The new changes come eight years after the greens at hole 6 were re-laid at the CGC course. Even as the basic characteristics (a dogleg right hole, green with table top and no bunkers around) of hole 12 remain unchanged, 36% of its surface area has increased from 4,800 square feet to 6,554 square feet.“The greens are a very important part of the course as 50% of the scored strokes are taken on the greens. In the overall round of the golf game, half is played on the greens. It is a delicate area on the course and requires extra care. Looking at the footfall we have at our course, the greens are overused, so on a rotational basis we need to change the upper layer (turf) of the green. Also, if required, we need to completely relay the green, which is a very technical task, requires time and decent investment too,” says SPS Matharoo, CGC captain, who is responsible for the course.“We started the relay work of the hole 12 greens in mid-March but faced delays because of the lockdown. Now we are ready to open it for play. During the time of the relaying work, we made a small makeshift green close to the original area of the green. The members are enthusiastic about playing on the new green and hopefully it will add more challenge to their play,” adds Matharoo.Apart from producing top-class professionals such as Jeev Milkha Singh, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Shubhankar Sharma and Ajeetesh Sandhu, CGC hosts professional events regularly.The big-ticket Rs1.5 crore Jeev Milkha Invitational Tournament was played last year. “For hosting top professional golfing events, we need to have a top-class course. For that our course manager and entire course maintenance team have been on their toes,” he says. Elaborating on the changes at hole 12, course manager Amrit Inder Singh says, “We reduced the existing big slopes and introduced smaller contours and more small slopes. This is the first three-tiered green at the course, all others are either single or two-tiered. The new green gives more pin position, thus increasing its lifespan.” The 7,202 yard 18-hole CGC course was designed by five-time British Open champion Peter Thompson. He was assisted by a founder member of the club and professional golfer Simran Singh, who also remained coach of the Indian golf team for the 1986 Seoul Asian Games. The overall annual budget of maintaining the CGC course, including investment in machinery, is around Rs 2.5 crore, giving employment to over 100 people for maintaining the course. Getting it rightGreens: The greens are where the flagstick and hole are located. When players hit the ball on the green, they use a putter to roll the ball into the hole. Half of the strokes are played on the greens.Components of greens: Below the turf (putting surface) is a 12-inch to 16-inch hole filled with seedbed, sand, gravel, drainage pipes and subsoil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-an-extra-green-topping-for-chandigarh-golf-club-course/story-7nRUwceT6LoI7HmiANfGAJ.html

They said that they regretted that the weekend lockdown had broken the backbone of the traders’ community and that if liquor vends, restaurants, hotels, etc are permitted to open then why are other shops not allowed to. They said, “It seems as if traders are being ignored by Capt Amarinder Singh government even when it is they who give maximum revenue in the form of taxes to the government.

He highlighted the role of OSU alumnus and former PAU vice-chancellor, Dr GS Kalkat in strengthening the bond between the two universities which led to the formation of the Food Industry Centre at PAU. While acknowledging the online presence of OSU president, Dr Johnson, the V-C extended an invitation to her for visiting the university after the pandemic.The 16th president of Ohio State University, Dr Kristina Johnson called Dr Rattan Lal an unbelievably outstanding and inspiring personality with a humble demeanour. While calling for deeper partnerships with PAU, Dr Johnson said she was confident that under Dr Rattan Lal’s dedicated guidance, the two universities would achieve major milestones in providing safe food to the planet and stopping climate change.While accepting the newly bestowed honour by PAU, Dr Rattan Lal (who was also celebrating his birthday) referred to the event as his best birthday ever and expressed gratitude to the university for sowing in him the seeds of hard work and excellence. “It is a momentous occasion as the Ohio State University is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year,” Dr Rattan Lal said.He congratulated the university scientists for playing a frontier role in perching the country as the largest producer of 15 crops and soon projected to become a leading producer of wheat and rice too. Dr Lal appreciated the shifting of 25% state farmers to direct-seeded rice, and applauded PAU’s role in the impressive 5% agricultural growth rate of the country, at a time when other sectors are struggling for survival.He further highlighted the future goals as making agriculture a part of the solution by changing the mindset of people. Dr Lal emphasised minimising agricultural dependence on chemicals and raising awareness about the inseparable nexus between soil and human health. He concluded by elaborating a Sanskrit verse that refers to the world as one big family, of which, said Dr Rattan Lal, “PAU and OSU are the exemplary icons”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-renames-department-of-agronomy-after-dr-rattan-lal-on-his-birthday/story-8ONdTV1cMwOu4FcsdaYItL.html

07-09-2020||Delhi||Wife, friend held for attempt to murder of businessman, six others for arms smuggling||The probe into a case of attempt to murder of a businessman in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar last week led to the arrest of his wife and friend and also helped the police bust an interstate arms smuggling racket.Police said the duo had procured two pistols and bullets from the smugglers to try and kill the businessman, the police said Monday.A total of nine countrymade pistols and 53 cartridges have been recovered from the duo and six other persons, who are part of the gang that supplies firearms to criminals in western parts of the city. Police said the syndicate has roots in Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh, where the firearms are illegally manufactured. The gang had supplied over 50 firearms and hundreds of bullets to over a dozen criminals in west Delhi, senior police officers associated with the case said.An investigating officer, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said the arrested 24-year-old woman, Sunita (single name), and her husband’s friend Manoj (single name), were allegedly having an affair. When Sunita’s husband Babu (single name) got to know of this, fights ensued between the couple and they had also complained about each other to the police in the past. “As altercations between the couple became routine, Sunita and Manoj decided to get rid of Babu and planned his murder,” the investigator said.On September 1 around 10.30pm, Babu, an apparel businessman, was returning to his Raghubir Nagar home from a nearby temple when an unidentified masked man waylaid him and fired two shots at him. The bullets missed him and he survived the attack. After the attacker fled, Babu rushed home and informed his mother, Panno Devi, who in turn called the police.“A case of attempt to murder and firing was registered and investigation was taken up. Babu suspected the role of his wife and Manoj in the attack. Manoj was caught the next day and his interrogation led us to unravel the entire conspiracy and arrest Sunita from whose possession two pistols and a bullet were recovered,” the officer said.During their interrogation, another police officer associated with the case said Manoj disclosed that he had procured the firearms from one Tarun alias Rakesh. When Tarun’s antecedents were verified, it was found that he was wanted in a murder and robbery case, registered recently in Nihar Vihar. “We arrested Tarun,26, and his questioning revealed his association with Sabir alias Mulla, a weapons supplier. Mulla was also arrested with two pistols and 20 cartridges. His interrogation helped us bust the entire network,” the second officer said.Sabir told the police that he was operating the racket along with his uncle, who runs the illegal firearms manufacturing unit in Firozpur. The duo is believed to have supplied over 50 illegal firearms to west Delhi criminals in the past three or four months, the police said.“After Sabir, we arrested four more men – Ajay alias Jatin,28, Bobby,25, Sunny,26, and Shalender,33 -- and recovered five more pistols and 32 cartridges. Efforts are on to nab Sabir’s uncle and all those who procured weapons from the duo,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wife-friend-held-for-attempt-to-murder-of-businessman-six-others-for-arms-smuggling/story-0ORyXUE1op0Mgnlqfmru8N.html
07-09-2020||City||Three held for kidnapping and robbing truckers||New Delhi: The police scanned footage of more than 60 CCTV cameras to arrest a gang of robbers who had allegedly kidnapped and robbed a truck driver and his helper in West Delhi’s Najafgarh on Thursday night, the police said. The helper escaped by jumping off the vehicle while the driver pulled off some wires to stop the truck, after which the robbers fled. The victims went to the police, which tracked down the robbers with leads from CCTV footage.The three arrested men had followed the truck in a compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) before two of them forcibly entered it and held the two victims captive and robbed them of Rs 25,400 in cash and a mobile phone. One of the suspects, Yogesh, was previously booked in four robbery cases, and another was found involved in a drugs case. The third arrested suspect had no criminal past, Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said. “They robbed to fund their drug addiction. We recovered two pistols and a toy gun from them,” the DCP said. The victims were identified as truck driver Parmod Rawat and his helper, Amit. The crime happened around 8 pm on Thursday when they were driving a truck loaded with construction material from Najafgarh. “We had stopped at a temple to take drinking water near Mitraon village. Just as we were getting into our truck, two men asked us for a lift. When we refused, they forcibly entered the truck and beat us up,” Rawat told the police. The investigators later learnt that the two men involved in the robbery were being followed by their third partner in a Hyundai Venue car. One of the suspects allegedly took over the wheel. They robbed cash from the driver and a mobile phone from the helper, the police said. “At one point, my helper suddenly jumped off the truck when the vehicle slowed down. The robbers continued to drive with me inside,” Rawat said. About two kilometres later, Rawat took the suspects by surprise by pulling off some wires, due to which the truck stoped. “The robbers got off the truck and fled even as I fixed the wires to drive back and check on my colleague,” he said. The driver and the helper had relatively minor injuries and went on to seek police’s help, upon which a case of robbery and kidnapping was registered at Baba Haridas Nagar police station. “We began tracing the movement of the suspects backwards. One of the 60 CCTVs we checked had captured the vehicle number of the suspects before they had targeted the truckers,” the DCP said.The car allegedly used in the crime belonged to one of the suspects and it helped the police track them easily. The three suspects were subsequently nabbed from Jhajjar in Haryana on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-held-for-kidnapping-and-robbing-truckers/story-8I4Xw4W9ahgnsZTmvLkM4K.html

07-09-2020||Delhi||Riots: Delhi court seeks clarification of HC order on bail extensions||A Delhi court on Monday has sought a clarification from the Delhi high court as to whether the directions of its full bench, extending the interim bail of an accused by 45 days to stop the spread of Covid-19 in jail, apply to the cases of riots or not.It observed that several accused have taken interim bail on humanitarian grounds and later sought extensions, citing the order passed by the high-powered committee constituted to decongest jails in view of Covid.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, whose court has been specifically assigned to hear the riot cases, said a specific trend has been noticed where a number of accused persons have been applying for interim bails on humanitarian grounds based on the order passed by the full bench of the high court.The court noted that if it grants interim bail on humanitarian grounds or some other urgency, then the accused, invariably file applications for extension of interim bail on the grounds that the full bench of the Delhi high court has extended the interim bails en masse from time to time and presently they stand extended till October 31.ASJ Yadav said that while the minutes of the meeting of May 18 of the high-powered committee, constituted to decongest prisons of the city, had excluded the category of under-trials whose cases are being investigated by CBI/ED/NIA/Special Cell of Delhi Police, Crime Branch, SFIO, terror-related cases, riot cases, cases under Anti-National Activities and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act etc, the full bench of the HC has directed to extend the interim bail granted to an accused at the end of the bail period.On July 13, a full bench of the high court comprising of chief justice DN Patel, justice Siddharth Mridul and justice Talwant Singh had extended till August 31 all interim orders, including bails, in cases being heard by it and district courts so as to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and under-trial prisoners during the pandemic.Later, in another order of the full bench of July 24, the court had clarified its order and said the order of extension of interim bail/parole shall be applicable to all under-trials/convicts, who have been released on interim bail or parole before or after March 16.On Monday, ASJ Yadav said in his opinion, interim bails are granted purely on humanitarian grounds for a limited period and hence it should not come within the purview of the directions of the HC directive because such category of under-trials (riot accused) are excluded from being entitled to bail by the high-powered committee.The court was hearing the interim bail application of 19-year old Suhaib Saifi, an accused in the northeast Delhi riots case who wanted to appear for his CBSE class 10 compartment examinations.In his plea, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, Saifi said he was arrested on March 10 before which he was appearing for his CBSE Class 10 exams. The plea said Saifi had to write the mathematics and social science exams in custody. He passed social science but could not clear math.The judge, on Monday, while directing that a copy of the order be sent to the Registrar for clarification, also said that all arrangements have been already made for Saifi in the jail for him to prepare for the examination. The court directed the jail superintendent to provide the necessary books to Saifi.Saifi was arrested in connection with the murder of one Mahroof Ali and his neighbour Shamshad during the north-east Delhi riots. The FIR was registered on a complaint by Ali’s brother, who alleged that the mob shot at the two people with the intention to kill them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/riots-delhi-court-seeks-clarification-of-hc-order-on-bail-extensions/story-c0cJUxdtVXUz6DGv0zqi3I.html

In the last four days, the daily cases have hovered over 1,000, even touching a record high of 1,316 on Sunday.The higher percentage of cases in Jammu this month is in complete contrast to the overall distribution of number of Covid patients in the UT, majority of which have been found infected in Kashmir. Of the total 43,557 cases till September 6, Kashmir has contributed 31,739 patients (72.8%), while Jammu accounted for 11,818 (27%). If the comparison is made without including the cases in September, the Valley till August 31 has witnessed 76.6% cases, while Jammu has contributed to 23%.“The increase in cases in Jammu is due to two things – one that testing has increased and second is the increased public activities due to relaxation in lockdown,” said Dr ADS Manhas, epidemiologist and state surveillance officer of infectious diseases in Jammu.He said the rate of testing has increased by 100 percent since the rapid antigen tests (RAT) were introduced. “Earlier, we used to conduct some 4,000-5,000 RT-PCR tests, but now we are testing 10,000 to 11,000 people daily using RAT as well as RT-PCR,” he said. With RAT, the test results come within 15 minutes as against 1-2 days for RT-PCR.Of the 10 districts in Jammu division, majority of the cases have been recorded in Jammu district. Out of the total 3,037 cases in the region from September 1 to 6, over 2,065 were recorded in Jammu district alone.“Testing has been enhanced in every district, not just Jammu,” Manhas said.In terms of death rate, Kashmir has recorded seven times more fatalities than Jammu.

The accused shall be handed over to the jail authorities by September 10,” the court said in its order.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing allegations that Hussain and some associates laundered about Rs 1.10 crore by using purported shell or dummy companies to fuel the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the subsequent riots in north-east Delhi in February.During the hearing, senior advocate K K Manan and advocate Uditi Bali, appearing for Hussain, opposed the application saying the 15 days period for grant of ED custody has to begin from the date of arrest, August 20, and thus, further extension of remand was not permissible in law.Central government’s standing counsel Amit Mahajan, appearing for ED, said the 15 days remand has to begin when his application was considered and allowed.Mahajan argued that the probe agency had obtained Hussain’’s physical custody on August 31 after the Jail authorities handed him over to the probe agency after performing the Covid-19 test.Special Public Prosecutor N K Matta said a complete and comprehensive investigation could not be completed within the custody remand granted by the court earlier.Hussain was arrested in connection with the riots in north-east Delhi. He has also been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a conspiracy case related to the riots. He was also arrested in connection with the alleged murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma during the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-court-extends-by-3-days-ed-custody-of-tahir-hussain/story-KF558l1sKkZH5UGi6AFNzJ.html

Strict action will be taken against the organiser if any person is found positive after taking part in the gathering,” the DC added. Deepender had addressed two gatherings at Anwali and Sirsadh villages on Friday. Apart from him, two of his staff members had also tested positive for the virus.

07-09-2020||Chandigarh||Multani disappearance case: HC reserves order on two pleas of former DGP Saini||A Punjab and Haryana high court bench on Monday reserved order on two pleas of Sumedh Singh Saini, former DGP of Punjab police, including one for anticipatory bail in the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case of 1991. Punjab police special public prosecutor Sartej Narula said Saini had not been granted interim protection from arrest by the high court, with the anticipatory bail plea pending before it. During the hearing that started at around 11:30 am and continued till 4:30 pm on Monday, Saini pleaded that an FIR filed against him for the disappearance of Mohali resident Balwant Singh Multani in 1991 was the result of a mala fide act against him for launching probes against Congress leaders and their relatives to unearth scams. Punjab police have argued that fresh evidence has come on record on Saini’s alleged involvement in Multani’s murder case. Hence, question of political victimisation does not arise. The judgment in both the petitions from the high court bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh is likely to be pronounced on Tuesday. Two judges who had recused from hearing this case earlier were justice Suvir Sehgal from hearing the bail plea and justice Amol Rattan Singh from hearing the petition seeking quashing of the FIR on September 2. The additional district and sessions judge of Mohali had on September 1 dismissed Saini’s anticipatory bail plea and he had appealed to the high court against this order on September 4. Before this, Saini had approached the high court on August 19 seeking quashing of the FIR. The former DGP, whose whereabouts are not known at present, was booked in May this year in connection with the disappearance of Mohali resident Balwant Singh Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) in 1991. Multani had been picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh and now he faces arrest because of murder charges.Initially the case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multani-disappearance-case-hc-reserves-order-on-two-pleas-of-former-dgp-saini/story-37AeWtqUyGGKphKDoUo9IL.html

07-09-2020||Delhi||Deserted platforms, closed eateries as Delhi Metro resumes services||Platforms and key hub stations, including Rajiv Chowk, wore a deserted look, eateries remained closed and the ambience far removed from the usual hustle-and-bustle as the Delhi metro services resumed on Monday after a 169-day hiatus triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Station employees frequently sanitised areas of the metro station and ensured social distancing norms, even as very few commuters opted for the metro services on the first day. Rajiv Chowk, which is one of the busiest stations of the national capital remained empty. At around 9 am, the usually busy entry point at Rajiv Chowk metro station was deserted with officials, wearing masks and face shields, ready with sanitizers to ensure a safe ride for passengers.After the entry point, there was a second layer of sanitisation process where thermal screening of passengers as well as their luggage was done.Imran Khan, who was travelling from Chattarpur to Barakhamba metro station, was on his way to attend a job interview.“The ride was smooth and there were hardly less than five commuters in my compartment. So, we had ample space to maintain social distancing even within the coaches. I’m glad that metro services have finally begun or I wouldn’t have been able to make it for my interview on time,” he said.Another commuter, Vishal Naik (21), a resident of Shastri Park, was relieved that now he would finally be able to reach office in Connaught Place on time.“Until now, everyday, it took almost two-three hours to reach office. Half of my time was spent in travelling. I had to start at least an hour early from home and wait for unusually longer hours at the bus stands and if the passenger count exceeded beyond 20, I had to again wait to catch the next bus, which is equally risky during pandemic,” he said.Asked if he was afraid to take the ride amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Naik said metro rides are much preferred than buses. Rajiv Chowk metro station, which serves as an interchange facility between the Yellow Line and the Blue Line, witnessed an unusually thin crowd between 9 am to 11 am. While many train coaches remained totally empty, some had hardly one passengers. Some others had less than 10 passengers on board.Deepika Nautiyal, a resident of Laxmi Nagar, said she is scared but has taken all the precautions. “I took an auto rickshaw from my home in Laxmi Nagar and reached Rajiv Chowk metro station. I am a bit scared but have taken all the precautions,” Nautiyal, who works at company in Gurgaon, said. Another commuter Mona Jha, who lives in Bhajanpura in northeast Delhi and works at Barakhamba Road, said she noticed that people are maintaining the norm of social distancing inside the metro train. “ I boarded the metro at Kashmiri Gate and have seen that people are aware. I am not scared. People are more concerned but we must follow social distancing norms. The situation will take time to become normal,” Jha said. At Kashmere Gate metro station, only two gates were opened. When people were entering the premises, they were seen getting their bags sanitized by the metro employees. Before contactless frisking, CISF personnel were also seen helping the commuters maintain social distance. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) were making several announcements about dos and dont’s during Covid-19. “If you have cold cough or fever, then please don’t take metro. Duration of opening and closing of metro doors have been increased for the convenience of commuters,” the announcer said.Trains were stopping at station with an extra time so that the passengers can easily board or de-board the metro without get in contact with anyone. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said all possible measures will be taken to ensure that services are smooth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/deserted-platforms-closed-eateries-as-delhi-metro-resumes-services/story-c6NRuXa4Q0gyeuVxMt7OkJ.html

The House will assemble in the afternoon to pay tribute to the former president Pranab Mukherjee, who passed away on August 31. It will also pay tribute to former MLA from Theog Rakesh Verma and former Dharamshala MLA Chander Verker.The opposition will try to pin down the government over issues such as corruption, ‘involvement’ of a BJP minister in dubious land deals, and increase in power tariff.The Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government will undoubtedly try to highlight its achievements, especially its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which the CM claims was better than other states and won accolades from the Prime Minister himself.The Congress will bring up the bribery scandal involving former health and family welfare director Dr Ajay Gupta, which had caused much embarrassment to the ruling party . In an audio-clip that was widely circulated on social media, Dr Gupta was heard demanding ₹5 lakh for clearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kit orders for the state health department.A sanitiser-purchase scam, which had involved some BJP leaders had also rocked the secretariat. The opposition has also alleged mishandling of the Covid-19 Response Fund. Allegations of social justice and empowerment minister Sarveen Chaudhary’s involvement in some questionable land deals in Kangra are also likely to be brought up. Former Congress minister Vijai Singh Mankotia had accused the minister of purchasing lands worth crores in the name of her family members.Though, the minister has denied the allegations, a preliminary probe by the state vigilance bureau had pointed out some irregularities in the purchase.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the government was ready to debate every issue.

Bains had on Saturday held a ‘Janta Darbar’ outside the DMCH and asked people to share their complaints with him. Most of the complaints the MLA had received were regarding fleecing of patients by private hospitals.The civil surgeon in his complaint stated that a video of Bains was being circulated on social networking websites. “In the video, the MLA is misguiding the locals over Covid-19. Bains has been asking people not to wear masks, while masks or face covers are necessary to avoid Covid -19 infection.

07-09-2020||City||Chhattisgarh Police arrest diamond smuggler, seize 171 diamonds||Police have seized 171 pieces of rough diamonds worth around Rs 25 lakh from a smuggler in Chhattisgarh’s Gariaband district. Police said that the smuggler is part of an interstate gang working in the area and more arrests are likely.Police said though the smuggler, who belongs to neighbouring Odisha, was arrested, the other accused managed to escape. “We were keeping a tab on this gang for the last 10 days. The accused Nutan Patel (55) along with another smuggler was trying to sell these diamonds in the market. One of the policemen posed as a trader and laid a trap for him. Patel was arrested on Saturday evening near Kaitpadar village under the jurisdiction of Deobhog police station,” said Bhojram Patel, superintendent of police (SP), Gariaband.Patel was heading towards Odisha’s Nuapada district from Payalikhand, a diamond-rich belt in Gariaband, with a huge quantity of rough diamonds. Preliminary investigation has revealed that he had illegally brought the diamonds from Payalikhand area of the district and was going to sell them in Odisha. “In the last five months, four diamond smugglers in the district were arrested with 340 pieces of rough diamonds in three separate cases,” he said. The SP said that rough diamonds are found in mines in Deobhog and some people are engaged in illegal mining of the precious gemstones. “Some people are engaged in illegal mining of diamonds. Inter-state gangs engage labourers and locals for mining rough diamonds. Patel had also engaged some people for the mining of diamonds,” said the SP. The police official said the diamond smugglers operate through a network that spans across states in the country.“There are some inter-state smugglers. We have some leads as a follow-up investigation,” the SP said. “The area, where diamonds are found, is not given to any private company for mining operations. The land belongs to the state government. However, the terrain is hostile, which helps the smugglers to operate,” he added.Activists in Chhattisgarh claimed that diamond mining in the state has been marred in several legal battles since the 1990s. “The then Digvijay Singh-led government had sanctioned some permits to a private company but it was challenged by other parties. Chhattisgarh has been endowed with not only diamond, which is found in Devbhog area of Gariaband district, but also some other precious gemstones such as Alexandrite and Corundum,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, an activist and lawyer. Shrivastva said that the tribals are aware of presence of precious gemstones in certain areas of Devbhog region where Kimberlite, an igneous rock, is commonplace. “The traders in Chhattisgarh and adjoining Odisha have been buying these raw stones at throwaway prices. Besides, one in every 50-100 stones could prove to be a diamond that fetches a handsome sum,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhattisgarh-police-arrest-diamond-smuggler-seize-171-diamonds/story-lWA9sC5nqMztWpaXqOWW9M.html

07-09-2020||Pune||1,564 safety violations in Lonavla on first weekend after e-pass rollback||A total of 1,564 cases of safety norm violations were registered in the Lonavla region by Pune rural police on the first weekend after the state government announced a rollback of e-passes for inter-district travel. It includes all kinds of cases - without mask, social distancing violation, and tourism violation. However, most of the cases were for not wearing masks, according to the police. “The floating population in Lonavla is very high. Since the e-pass was waived off, the rush was very much. Though we have stopped tourists from going to places like Tiger’s point, Sahara dam and Bushi dam - as was stated in the district magistrate (DM) order - the population in the market and other places rose up exponentially this weekend. And now the limited number of police personnel cannot do anything about it,” said Navneet Kanwat, the sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Lonavla division. The division includes Lonavla city, Lonavla rural, Kamshet and Vadgaon Maval police stations which have multiple tourists spots in and around the Lonavla hill station. The spots are accessible and frequented by people from Mumbai as well as Pune. However, crowds from nearby states could also be seen, according to police. “The people travelling in cars are resisting ₹500 fine. People have also grown smart and pull up their masks when they see police,” said DySP Navneet Kumar Kanwat. The local politicians and city council members are now working towards measures to reduce the number of cases with the flow of weekend tourists resuming, according to police. However, Kanwat stressed on the need for self-discipline and observation of state and central government guidelines. “The entire nation is facing a dilemma. Lockdown hurts tourism, economy and day-to-day needs and unlock increases Covid-19 cases. What we should learn is self-discipline. You come here only for two days, but you infect people who have to live here. In your enjoyment spree you should not forget to care for other human beings by wearing masks, even inside the car, and social distancing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/1-564-safety-violations-in-lonavla-on-first-weekend-after-e-pass-rollback/story-SB3OTup5mHDKKtFILdLslL.html

07-09-2020||Pune||Unlock Pune: ‘Simulations, workshops for faculty, among measures adopted to revolutionise medical education’||The Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a new paradigm in education. At a time when healthcare is in focus, HT reporter spoke to Lt Gen Nardeep Naithani, director and commandant, AFMC, to get an idea of what measures have been taken by the institute to ensure dissemination of medical education. How is AFMC looking at the Covid-19 situation and higher education in India? AFMC’s existing online learning management system (LMS) was adapted on priority for teaching undergraduates. As on date, four virtual classrooms are being used for students to conduct 12 classes per day. Online interactive sessions and learning modules have been started for all. AFMC also identified the need to empower faculty with recent educational tools. Small group faculty development workshops are being conducted to ensure that they become adept at using the available LMS. We are focussing on advanced skills required for online interactive teaching, including video making and editing workshops, and designing interactive presentations, among others. Also, a MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses) platform is being built for sustainability of resource material. How negatively will Covid-19 impact the institute’s functioning and ability to deliver medical education? The pandemic has made teaching of medicine extremely challenging, since medicine essentially is a profession which requires personal contact between doctor and patient, both for training as well as treatment. While some things can be replaced by simulation and online demonstration, there cannot be a substitute for a doctor actually performing procedures. We are identifying the areas and using various innovative tools to bridge this gap. The theory and non-skill based practicals are being covered online using MOOCS/Moodle platform. Moodle has various modules which include: online ‘live’ share lectures, pre-recorded lectures, assignments, attendance log, online chat facility and a virtual quiz. The preliminary and internal assessments for the first time were conducted through video-conferencing. What new teaching methods have been devised? Are you planning to go online with classes or looking at staggered classes with limited students? The teaching methodology will be more focused on collaborative and immersive learning. AFMC started its online classes in the first week of April. Faculty is taking online classes, followed by discussion using case-based scenarios. This is supplemented with an actual off-site simulation of a scenario with mannequins and instruments required for a related procedure. In addition, there is a plan to start synchronous small group in-person teaching at multiple locations through ‘live’ streaming. Classrooms with required IT equipment have been created to enable streaming. Students would be attending same lecture at multiple locations, thus maintaining social distancing. Will AFMC look at changing its core syllabus given the delay in admissions this year? Medical curriculum is formulated and approved by the Medical Council of India and implemented by the respective medical universities. Keeping in mind the importance of competencies covered under UG/PG curriculum, AFMC would not recommend changing core syllabus. However, within the framework of current regulations, improvisations and innovations will be done to optimise the efficiency of training. The effective and early use of available resources at AFMC, has ensured that the college is in a position to complete the syllabus in the scheduled timeframe. The most crucial step is ‘timely planning’ and departments have already planned the year ahead, identified key areas which require frequent formative assessments and will be using an integrated trans-disciplinary approach to ensure better understanding and completion of the curriculum. Many Armed Forces Medical officers and post graduate students are being deployed at military healthcare facilities and even civilian hospitals handling coronavirus patients. Will this result in faculty shortage? The pandemic is presenting an opportunity for all of us to study various facets of communicable diseases like preventive measures, clinical aspects, lab services and others. Post graduate residents are getting hands-on experience in dealing with a pandemic. The students are actively involved in various duties pertaining to Covid-19 and we strongly believe that this would be a great learning experience for all of them. AFMC is striving to ensure that PG teaching is in continuum. Online classes and case-based discussions are an integral part of their training. E-mentoring is being done by postgraduate guides on a regular basis. How can AFMC help in bridging the gaps in the healthcare sector? The innovations cell has been actively working in clinical and medical fields and striving to develop solutions for safer environment and innovative medical equipment, like ventilators to tackle the pandemic. The best way of bridging the gap would be telemedicine, tele-consultation and e-delivery of drugs/medicines. Finally, what will your priorities be during this tenure at AFMC? The overarching theme would look at building infrastructure and resources for cloud-based or distance learning, setting standards for skill-based training of PG residents to improve quality of healthcare delivery and creating an ecosystem for quality research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unlock-pune-simulations-workshops-for-faculty-among-measures-adopted-to-revolutionise-medical-education/story-4aaYCz0C51VPPLh8sYLWSL.html

07-09-2020||Pune||Unlock Pune: AFMC an ‘SMS’ away from students back on campus||The pandemic has altered all sectors of life, including education, wherein it has created a requirement for institutions to adapt to technology to ensure the flow of knowledge isn’t disrupted. Covid-19 has also brought into focus the healthcare system of the country, and its shortcomings, highlighting how medical education requires an innovative and prompt response from educators. With the National eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) scheduled for September 13, one of the premier medical institutes in the country, the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune, is all set to induct a new batch of students in October/November - keeping in mind the Covid-19 guidelines. “The admission process which includes computer-based tests, interviews, documentation and medical examination, will be undertaken keeping in mind all precautions against the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. A detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) has been designed enlisting all the necessary precautions required in the post-Covid world,” said Lt Gen Nardeep Naithani, director and commandant, AFMC. AFMC being a residential programme requires students to stay on campus for their duration of studies. In the post-Covid world, physical distancing is key and AFMC has ensured robust infrastructure is in place to comply with Covid-19 guidelines. A dedicated team is in place to make sure that SMS – sanitisation, mask and social distancing guidelines - are followed in letter, and spirit, on campus. “AFMC is concentrating on four verticals - preventive measures, clinical measures, developing testing capability and research - to tackle Covid-19. Preventive measures include IEC and disinfection; clinical verticals involves patient care and formulation of protocols/SOPs; along with developing the testing capacity and research. Hand sanitisation stations have been installed, staff members have been equipped with infra-red temperature monitoring devices at various locations and wearing of masks has been made mandatory,” read a statement from the AFMC on Covid-19 protocols. On plans to have students back on campus, the Commandant said, “Medical cadets at the beginning of the pandemic, as a preventive measure, were sent back to their hometowns. There is a plan to re-induct medical cadets in a phased manner. Such cadets will be screened, quarantined at a special facility on campus, be provided packed food in the rooms for first 14 days and also given housekeeping and laundry services, among others.” Such measures at the institute are already up and running as the AFMC inducted a new batch of PG residents (2020-23) into the college in the second week of June. “All the officers were placed in quarantine for a stipulated time and inducted into AFMC, thereafter,” added Lt Gen Naithani, who is hopeful that with the measures in place, the process of induction of medical cadets in the post-Covid world will reach a state of normalcy. The institute already has some experience handling candidates during the pandemic, as in the second week of July, AFMC undertook counselling for priority V (civilian) candidates for entry into post-graduation courses in armed forces hospitals. “Civilian candidates from across the country participated in the counselling, which included a thorough medical examination. This gave us an opportunity to audit our preventive measures and SOPs,” added an official from the AFMC, who is aware of the developments. The pandemic put the spotlight on the number of doctors and nurses in the country and AFMC is an apex training institute for MBBS, specialist, super-specialist doctors and paramedics. However, the institute is not looking at expanding its number of seats. “The college does not envisage increasing the number of seats at this point of time. The implementation of online and distance-learning courses has ensured that teaching reaches beyond the boundaries of AFMC. The online classes have been ‘live’-streamed to various armed forces hospitals across India and hence, expertise has not been restricted to limited numbers,” explained Let Gen Naithani. AFMC and Covid-19 research AFMC was part of the principal secretaries advisory panel for developing inventory for scaling of bedded hospitals for Covid scenario in the country. AFMC is also involved in national capacity building in collaboration with ICMR. The innovations cell at AFMC has been working in clinical and medical fields like innovative medical equipment (ventilators) to tackle the pandemic. The Ministry of Defence has begun work on setting up 10 new laboratories across the country, primarily to conduct research on viruses in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). One of these is proposed at AFMC. Dates for setting up of the lab at AFMC are currently under consideration at ICMR. AFMC is also part of the principal scientific advisor’s initiative on mental health which will be the national digital wellness programme. On campus Do Thorough medical examination for all inducted Cadets and after induction, 14-day mandatory quarantine ‘SMS protocol’– Sanitise, wear a mask and maintain social distancing on campus Don’t Socialise on campus or crowd classrooms Fail to declare if you are witnessing symptoms or have been in contact with a Covid-19 positive patient Know the Commandant Lt Gen Nardeep Naithani took over as director and Commandant of AFMC on December 1, 2019. Prior to the present appointment, he served as MG Medical, HQ Central Command. He is a graduate of AFMC and was commissioned in the Army Medical Corps on December 27, 1982.

07-09-2020||Mumbai||Facebook ‘friend’ cheats Mumbai nurse of Rs 17.5 lakh in cyber fraud||A nurse working in a civic hospital in Malad lost Rs 17.5 lakh to a cyber fraud group who befriended her on Facebook with one of them posing as a doctor from London. The alleged doctor lured the victim under the pretext of sending her expensive gifts and jewellery worth Rs 49 lakh, and made her pay Rs 17.5 lakh for clearance of the gift parcel at the airport thus defrauding her, said the police.According to the Malad police, in March the complainant received a friend request on Facebook from Alex Wilfred, whose profile portrayed him as a doctor from London. The complainant accepted the request and started chatting with him after he shared his phone number. Since August 15, the two started chatting frequently.On August 17, Wilfred called her and informed her that he had sent her a surprise gift. After an hour, she received a call from a female, posing as a cargo official, named Anjali Sharma who said she is posted at the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi international airport.Sharma told the complainant that a parcel has come in her name and it contains Rs 35 lakh cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 14 lakh. But, to get the parcel cleared she will have to pay Rs 30,000 courier charges. She then shared bank account details with the complainant.The complainant transferred the money and next day Sharma again called her and told her that she will have to pay an additional Rs 1.10 lakh as a penalty as the parcel contains excess amount of cash. Thereafter, Sharma called her on multiple occasions and made her pay money for getting the Anti-Money laundering certificate, GST certificate and Income tax on the parcel, states the complaint.On August 27, the fraudster sent her an email showing it to be from the RBI and made her pay more money under the name of some code which is mandatory to claim the parcel coming from abroad. After the complainant paid the money, she again received another email supposedly from RBI which again requested her to make another payment to get mandatory tax code, the complaint states.This time the complainant didn’t make any payment as she had exhausted all her savings. She had also borrowed money from friends and relatives. “She yelled at Wilfred and told her to return whatever money she has spent. Wilfred told her not to worry as he would be coming to India with money on August 31 and will return all her money. He also sent her photos of his air tickets and photos of himself sitting in the flight,” a police officer said.On August 31, the complainant received a WhatsApp call from Wilfred informing her that he has been arrested at the Delhi international airport as he was carrying a huge quantity of cash. He requested her to help him get released by paying a penalty charge of Rs 5.40 lakh.The complainant sensed something was amiss and made a video call to him. But he didn’t receive the video calls. The complainant realised that she was duped by fraudsters after Wilfred cut all his contacts with her. But by then the complainant had already lost Rs 17.5 lakh, said the police officer. On Friday, she registered a complaint against the fraudster at the Malad police station.The Malad police have registered an FIR against Wilfred, Sharma and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and section 66c and 66d of the Information Technology Act.“The fraudsters used multiple bank accounts in New Delhi, Mizoram, Darjeeling and West Bengal, and it clearly indicates the involvement of a highly professional gang whose members are spread all over the country. The modus-operandi points out the involvement of Nigerian cyber fraud gangs who involve Indians in their teams offering them hefty money,” said the officer.Details of fraudster’s phone numbers, bank accounts are being analysed to find the whereabouts of the fraudster, added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/facebook-friend-cheats-mumbai-nurse-of-rs-17-5-lakh-in-cyber-fraud/story-mTpJ6Ct4Ngt1VQnwVaD4sI.html

The decision to provide 24x7 security comes two days before Ranaut, who is in her home state of Himachal Pradesh and had likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, plans to return to Mumbai.Ranaut, whose comments led to a spat with Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut over social media last week, said she felt unsafe in Mumbai after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and also spoke of drug use in a section of the film industry.SHE’S A DAUGHTER OF HIMACHAL, SAYS CMDescribing the Queen star as a daughter of Himachal Pradesh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur issued a video statement on Monday, welcoming the decision to provide her with CRPF security.He said the central and the state governments are providing security to the actor and would do whatever necessary for her security. “I have got information that an 11-member commando team of the CRPF has been provided by the ministry of home affairs for her security. I welcome this decision and also express my gratitude to the Union home minister. Her security is important for us,” he said. A Union home ministry official explained that Y-plus category central cover entails the deployment of about 10 armed commandos who will work in shifts around the clock, he said.Ranaut, often in the eye of the storm for her provocative comments, took to Twitter to express her gratitude for the security being provided to her. “This shows that no one can crush a patriot in the country. I am thankful to home minister Amit Shah,” she said.In his statement, the Himachal Pradesh chief minister said that the state police would provide security at the actor’s Manali residence and he had directed director general of police Sanjay Kundu to assess the security threat. “If it is necessary, Himachal Pradesh is ready to provide her security during her tours,” he said. On Sunday, he said his government had decided to provide the actor security after her father and sister sought protection for her.Kundu said that on the chief minister’s direction, an assessment of the threat perception to the actor was carried out. “We submitted our report to the home department. The ministry of home affairs has decided to provide the CRPF security to Kangana. The state’s intelligence agencies will be assessing the threat perception to her from time to time.”Though Kangana belongs to Bhambla village in the state’s Mandi district, she has constructed a house in the scenic tourist town of Manali, where she is staying with her family at present. She will be returning to Mumbai on September 9. WHAT TRIGGERED THE FACEOFFBJP leader Ram Kadam recently asked the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government to provide police protection to Ranaut since “she wanted to expose the Bollywood drug nexus”.Responding to Kadam’s tweet, the actor said she feared Mumbai Police more than the “movie mafia”, and would prefer security either from Himachal Pradesh or the Centre.Reacting strongly to her comment, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut purportedly said, “We kindly request her not to come to Mumbai. This is nothing but an insult to Mumbai Police.” Hitting back, Ranaut tweeted, “Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?” The actor also tagged a September 1 news report on Raut asking her not to return to Mumbai if she was afraid of the city police.Raut had on Friday urged the Maharashtra government to take action against people defaming the city police. He also asked Ranaut to tour PoK first to see the situation prevailing there.In a tweet stating that she would be returning to Mumbai on September 9, Ranaut had dared anyone to stop her. Sena MLA Pratap Saranik hit back with a slap threat and said she should be arrested for sedition.Ranaut also asked Raut to apologise for his remarks against her. Raut on Sunday said he would consider doing so only if she apologises for her “insulting” remarks against Mumbai and Maharashtra. SHANTA KUMAR WRITES TO UDDHAV Meanwhile, senior BJP leader from Himachal Pradesh and former Union minister Shanta Kumar has written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that the “brave daughter of Himachal” is the only actor who has been promoting nationalism in Bollywood. “She recently wrote that her agenda was nationalism only. In the political sphere, the Shiv Sena is the only nationalist party after the BJP,” Shanta wrote, adding, “So, I expect the Shiv Sena to support Kangana.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-mumbai-return-bollywood-actor-kangana-ranaut-gets-y-crpf-security-cover/story-2x2AdY2BcqABEfz2eIFGjM.html

Today, I have called a meeting of a team of specialists on this”, the minister told news agency ANI.The woman had first tested positive in July and was discharged later that month after recovering from the virus. However, on Sunday, Fortis Hospital, where she underwent treatment for Covid-19, said that in the last week of August, she once again tested positive for the disease.Karnataka is one of the worst-hit states in the country, with nearly 4 lakh cases of Covid-19 thus far. Till Sunday night, the southern state had reported 2.92 lakh discharges, 99,266 active cases and over 6,300 deaths.Most of the state’s cases are from its capital Bengaluru, with the IT hub also being among the worst-affected cities in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-minister-calls-for-meet-after-bengaluru-reports-first-case-of-covid-19-reinfection/story-RCtmeTlsCGj6I7TMIB40oM.html

The day began with just two to four passengers on each train from 7 am to 11 am.Also read: In highest single-day surge, Noida records 213 fresh Covid-19 casesMetro staff and security personnel with safety gears were deployed to guide the commuters at the stations. Commuters are allowed to get tickets once their temperatures are checked. They can use smart card, or get tickets using NMRC mobile app or from counters. The commuters are now required to put all their belongings like bags, mobile phones, and any other metallic objects like keys in trays for checking like at airports. There is no manual frisking anymore.Meenu Singh, a commuter, said, “The Metro is always suitable for me to commute to Pari Chowk. I am happy that the service has resumed. But I feel there is still a sense of fear of the infection. Hence, many people hesitate to use public transport including the Metro.”Praveen Mishra, NMRC executive director, said the response has been satisfactory. “We will be able to share the details about total footfall in the evening.”NMRC officials said people will gradually get confidence and started travelling on the Metro again. They said businesses and offices have not resumed functioning fully and that is why they expect lesser footfall.NMRC, in association with an NGO, has also set up a stall at the Sector 51 Metro Station to sell mask made by women, who have lost jobs due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nmrc-resumes-metro-services-with-improved-safety-measures/story-LPnTKQMPWYIeOfAah7pFtJ.html
07-09-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Varavara Rao’s sons-in-law served notices to appear before NIA||National Investigation Agency (NIA) has served notices on two sons-in-law of outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist), or CPI (Maoist’s), ideologue and poet Pendyala Varavara Rao (81) asking them to appear before the probe agency authorities on Wednesday (September 9) in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case. Rao’s second son-in-law K V Kurmanath, a senior journalist with a national business daily, and the youngest son-in-law K Satyanarayana, a professor of English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) in Hyderabad, received notices under Sections 160 and 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to appear before the NIA authorities in Mumbai at 10 am on Wednesday. Rao has been in jail for over 18 months after being arrested by Maharashtra Police on charges of links with the outlawed CPI-Maoist. Also Read: Varavara Rao released from hospital after Covid treatment; back in jail“In August 2018, Pune Police had raided my flat and that of Satyanarayana and seized the hard discs of our computers, pen drives, books and some other materials apparently in a bid to collect alleged incriminating evidence against my father-in-law. May be, the NIA authorities want to question us in connection with the same case,” Kurmanath told HT. Satyanarayana described NIA’s notice as distressing. “The NIA notice adds to our family distress at a time when my father-in-law’s (Rao’s) health condition is not good and the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is spreading at a rapid pace in Mumbai. I am summoned to Mumbai amid these terrible times,” he said. He stated that the Pune Police had raided his flat in August 2018 on the pretext of collecting evidence against Rao. “I had stated then that I was in no way connected to the Bhima Koregaon case. The fact that Rao is my father-in-law was the only reason to raid my house and cause mental agony.” Rao, the revolutionary poet, was arrested by the Maharashtra Police on August 28, 2018, in connection with the Bhima Koregaon clashes in January that year. Though he was released on bail later following a Supreme Court (SC) order, he was arrested by the Pune Police again in November on the charge of being a part of an alleged Maoist conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Rao and his family members have denied the allegation. Initially, Rao was lodged in Yerawada jail and later shifted to Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. In July, Rao had shown signs of loss of memory, hallucination and gave incoherent replies to his wife during his telephonic conversation from the jail.

07-09-2020||Delhi||Two suspected members of Babbar Khalsa International held in Delhi after shootout, six pistols 40 rounds seized||Delhi Police on Monday claimed to have arrested two suspected members of the banned militant outfit Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) after a brief exchange of fire near Nirankari ground in north Delhi.Police said the suspected BKI members had come to Delhi from Punjab late at night on Saturday to collect a consignment of illegal arms and ammunition. At least six rounds of fire were exchanged between the suspected BKI members and the police personnel. Six pistols and 40 cartridges were seized from the arrested duo, who have been identified as Bhupender alias Dilawar Singh and Kulwant Singh. Both the arrested accused belong to Ludhiana in Punjab, said Delhi Police’s special cell officials, who were involved in the operation. Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (special cell), Delhi Police, said that Dilawar is a key member of the BKI and he was deported to India from Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), last year in a terror-related case. “The arrested persons have revealed that they had planned to kill some politicians in Punjab and the arms and ammunition were being procured for the mission. We cannot disclose the names of their potential targets because of their safety and security,” said DCP Yadav. The special cell team had been intercepting telephonic conversations of an illegal arms supplier based in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and keeping a tab on their activities for the past few months. They came to know recently that two persons from Punjab would visit Delhi to collect a consignment of illegal arms and ammunition, the DCP said. Later, the special cell team learnt that the delivery of the consignment would take place near Nirankari ground in Burari, north Delhi, late at night on Saturday. Accordingly, a trap was laid in the area and two persons were arrested after an exchange of fire while they were walking to a taxi in which they had come from Punjab, the DCP said. “Nobody was hurt in the shootout. We are interrogating the arrested accused, who are wanted in some other cases in Punjab as well,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-suspected-members-of-babbar-khalsa-international-held-in-delhi-after-shootout-six-pistols-40-rounds-seized/story-5SrEN5GTaEwqXSrxtcdliN.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Unlock 4: Delhi Metro brings smiles back, but travel time increases with most gates remaining closed||The resumption of Delhi Metro services on Monday brought smiles back on the faces of commuters in the national capital, but many said the closure of most entry-exit gates caused delay and inconvenience.A Delhi Metro employee said he had to spend more time walking to the operational gate of the GTB Nagar metro station as the other gates were closed.“The gate nearer to my residence is closed. So, had to walk to gate number 5 which took extra 10 minutes,” he said.However, the journey remained smooth right from entering the metro premises to boarding the train and exiting the station at the destination, he added.Jyotsna Singh, 28, who travelled from HUDA City Centre station to Central Secretariat station, said she usually exits from gate number 1, but it was closed this time.“I had to take a detour and exit through gate number 3, which took 5-7 minutes extra. I was prepared for such minor delays considering the situation,” she said.Singh, who works at Shashtri Bhawan, said metro travel costs her just Rs 50 compared to Rs 350-400 spent on cab.Saurabh Roy, who boarded the metro from Jor Bagh and got down at Patel Chowk, said he entered from gate number 1 near the Lodhi Gardens. “It didn’t make any sense travelling 15 minutes by foot for an 11-minute journey. Anyone facing such problems will give priority to personal vehicles over the metro,” he said.The Delhi Metro resumed services in a graded manner on Monday, with elaborate measures for crowd management and ensuring hygiene to check the spread of the virus.The Yellow Line connecting Samaypur Badli and HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon was the first one to be opened.The services resumed at 7 am with strict safety and social distancing measures in place.The trains will operate in batches of four-hour each from 7-11 am in the morning and 4-8 pm in the evening.A number of passengers faced difficulty buying new smart cards or getting them recharged through cashless modes due to network issues.At a few stations, such as Central Secretariat, Chawri Bazar, and Chandni Chowk, passengers said there were hiccups while making payments for new smart cards or recharging them online due to non-availability of mobile network on the station premises. Luckshay Gupta, 28, said issues in online payment caused a minor delay during his travel from Chandni Chowk to Race Course.Rohini Bansal, 25, said she tried getting her smart card recharged online but it could not be done due to network issues.“Money got deducted from my account, but the transaction failed. I waited for 15-20 minutes at Central Secretariat metro station before I left the premises and took an auto to work,” she said.

07-09-2020||Dehradun||Dehradun doctor who went on the run 26 years ago nabbed in Haryana||A 59-year-old doctor from Dehradun has been arrested from Haryana’s Palwal 26 years after he absconded when a case of fraud was registered against him in 1994 for forging a recommendation letter for gun license, the state police said on Monday. A local court had declared Sudhir Tiwari a fugitive in 1997.Sub-inspector Deepak Dhariwal, who led a four-member team that arrested Tiwari on Saturday, said the accused had attached a recommendation letter with fake signatures of then chief minister ND Tiwari’s personal assistant while applying for the license.“The letter later turned out to be fake and a case was then registered in Cantonment police station [Dehradun] and the probe was given to CBCID Lucknow branch [when Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh]. ... [a] charge sheet was filed in the case but Tiwari fled after knowing that a case has been registered against him,” said Dhariwal.A reward was also announced in 2006 for his arrest.Dhariwal said Tiwari was working as a public relation officer at a private hospital in Palwal. He added Tiwari first fled to Meerut, where he stayed or four years before moving to Haryana. “He was presented before a local court in Dehradun which then sent him to jail,” said Dhariwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/dehradun-doctor-who-went-on-the-run-26-years-ago-nabbed-in-haryana/story-JEiT8d1hrNBBhLfETdb0lM.html
07-09-2020||City||Bihar junior doctors seek denotification of medical colleges as Covid hospitals||Bihar’s junior doctors, who are postgraduate medical students, have pitched for de-notifying medical colleges in Patna, Gaya and Bhagalpur as dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hospitals because of lack of patients and allow admission to non-Covid-19 patients.They have cited that the existing arrangement is hampering their curriculum and also expressed concern about academic loss. Also read: Covid-19: India’s death rate has reduced by 0.43% in a monthIt was impossible to achieve the goals and objectives of medical training in a hospital that allows only Covid-19 patients, the members of Junior Doctors Association (JDA), Bihar, highlighted in a letter to Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, health, Bihar, on Monday. It also quoted extensively the regulations of the Postgraduate Education, 2000, of the Medical Council of India (MCI). “Designating medical colleges as exclusive Covid-19 care hospitals should be the last resort and not the first option. Non-teaching hospitals should be engaged first,” the letter stated. Conversion of a medical college into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital also renders a huge infrastructure and large pool of doctors, including specialists and super-specialists, useless, it argued. Dr Papu Kumar Safi and Dr Divyanshu Martand of Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) requested that admission of Covid-19 patients to medical colleges should be temporarily stopped and existing patients suffering from the viral infection be shifted to a ward with adequate oxygen beds.Earlier, though NMCH’s JDA had raised the issue of academic loss on June 3 and 24, their plea had allegedly fallen on deaf ears of the authorities concerned.The JDA, alternatively, suggested that the 110-bed Guru Govind Singh Hospital in Patna that has six intensive care unit (ICU) beds could be utilised as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital after equipping it with more ventillator-supported beds and operation theatre for emergency surgeries of patients suffering from the viral infection. It also suggested developing a joint pool of doctors from NMCH, Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and Guru Govind Singh Hospital for clinical management of Covid-19 patients. “A medical college is bound to provide training as per curriculum prescribed by the MCI and failing to do so is a breach of contract by the institution. MD and MS (doctor of medicine and master of surgery, respectively) is a three-year course out of which we have lost six months. MBBS internship’s duration is one year. Half of it is gone and the students are suffering,” said Dr Martand, who is pursuing a postgraduate degree in medicine at NMCH. “Doctors with incomplete training can cause a serious threat to the patients they treat. No law of the land gives anybody the right to do so. If these incompletely trained doctors cause any damage to a patient after they pass out, the authorities must be held responsible for hampering their training for all these months,” alleged Dr Safi, who is also pursuing a postgraduate degree in medicine at NMCH.JDA members said the bed occupancy of Covid-19 patients at NMCH had never crossed 50 in the past month against a total capacity of 447 beds. Bed occupancy of the other dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, including the one made by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at ESI Bihta was also low. The Patna-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had 145 Covid-19 patients against 600 beds until Sunday. While the NMCH had 32 Covid-19 patients against 447 beds.Bihar has less than 3,000 Covid-19 patients in institutional quarantine against a total bed capacity of 54,126 of which 36,011 beds were in “ready to move in” as per the government data accessed by HT. There were less than 600 patients in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals against a total bed capacity of 4,024, said government officials. The state government has designated AIIMS and NMCH --- both located in Patna --- Anugrah Naryan Magadh Medical College Hospital in Gaya and the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital in Bhagalpur as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.The government has also created 100 isolation beds in each of the remaining six state-run medical colleges for Covid-19 patients. Bihar has reported 1,47,658 Covid-19 cases, including 754 deaths, until Sunday. At present, the state has 16,603 active cases and a recovery rate of 88.24%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-junior-doctors-seek-denotification-of-medical-colleges-as-covid-hospitals/story-RGDqFcJ5WHUx7XJn2p5D0L.html

A division bench, comprising Justice Sangeet Lodha and Justice Rameshwar Vyas, is hearing a public interest litigation related to the issues of Pakistani immigrants living in India on long-term visas (LTVs).The amended Act aims to grant Indian citizenship to six minorities - Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhist, Christians and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have faced or fled fearing religious persecution. The law, which ran into a controversy because it excludes Muslims, will be applicable to those who entered India before December 2014.Vipul Singhvi, counsel for the Centre, told the court on Friday that MHA received 20,370 applications from the Rajasthan government for issuing LTVs from January 1, 2015 to August 25, 2020, of which 20,080 have been disposed of. As many as 115 applications are currently pending and 239 have been sent back to the foreigners regional registration officer for clarification. Singhvi submitted that the return visa of LTV holders, who have gone to Pakistan on No Objection to Return to India (NORI) before the lockdown and have been stranded there due to travel restrictions, has been extended by the MHA for 15 days. The extension is effective from the date on which restrictions on travel from Pakistan to India are lifted by the Centre. The MHA has conveyed ‘no objection’ for return of 410 LTV holders whose details were received from the ministry of external affairs or the High Commission of India in Islamabad, Singhvi told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/grant-of-citizenship-only-after-caa-rules-notified-centre-tells-hc/story-8eTM5orSANT7qyoEb1yKcK.html

07-09-2020||Patna||Ambulance rams truck, patient among four killed, three injured||At least four persons, including a patient and three of her family members, were killed and three persons were injured after an ambulance carrying them rammed a parked truck in Nalanda district on Monday morning. The incident took place on national highway 31 around 7.30am near Gaurapar village under the jurisdiction of Chandi police station, 110km southeast of the state capital Patna. The victims—all residents of Chainpura village—were travelling in the ambulance that was on its way to Patna from Nalanda, police said. Injured persons alleged that the ambulance driver was inebriated. They said that the patient was referred by doctors at Biharsharif Sadar Hospital to Vardhman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri. “But the driver was forcibly taking us to Patna,” they alleged. Confirming the four deaths in the mishap, Nalanda SP Nilesh Kumar said, “The ambulance was carrying a patient (Sobha Devi), who was severely injured in the head after falling from the roof of her house late Sunday night. She was accompanied by six family members. The driver fled the spot after the accident and a manhunt has been launched to nab him.”He said four persons, including Sobha, her husband Viru Paswan, and her relatives Sudama Paswan and Asha Devi, died on the spot while Baleshwar Paswan, Sarita Devi and Sansar Devi were injured. All the injured have been admitted to the Biharsharif Sadar Hospital. Talking to mediapersons Baleshwar said the driver lost control over the vehicle and hit the parked truck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/ambulance-rams-truck-patient-among-four-killed-three-injured/story-fNne6SuyqZBxxs54WDzasL.html
07-09-2020||Mumbai||Vikhroli Park Site accident: HC grants bail to BMC sub-engineer||The Bombay High Court (HC) last Friday granted anticipatory bail to a civic engineer booked in connection with the death of four persons, as a fully loaded truck got stuck in a manhole and toppled on them at Park Site in Vikhroli, Mumbai, in April 2019.Justice Sarang Kotwal granted pre-arrest bail to Ashish Amare, a sub-engineer employed with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), because he was shown as the accused in the case 10 months after the incident had occurred and also his custodial interrogation was not required.“The first information report (FIR) was filed in April 2019, but until February this year the investigating agency did not name the present applicant as the accused,” said the judge. “If the applicant is arrested, he would lose his job besides facing the trauma of arrest.”Four persons were killed after a truck transporting foodgrains fell on them at Surya Nagar, near Vikhroli’s Park Site, late in the evening on April 18, 2019. A culvert failed to hold the weight of the fully-loaded truck, which toppled after the driver accelerated the engine to move the vehicle out of the manhole, and crushed five people. Four of them had died on the accident spot, while the fifth person survived after being severely injured.Experts from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay investigated the accident and came to the conclusion that the newly laid concrete around the manhole cover had poor quality with very low strength and weak structural integrity. Due to heavy tyre load the concrete around the manhole failed in shear causing the collapse of the manhole cover and overturning of the truck. The report cited that the failure of the concrete could have been because of patchwork at the damaged location, as bonding between old and new concrete was not achieved adequately. The culvert should have been cast in a single pour, experts suggested.Though the experts blamed poor quality of construction work for the accident, the HC noted that the sub-engineer was appointed as the contractor because he had undertaken the emergency work of the stormwater drain manhole following persistent requests from a local councillor. Besides, the public did not allow the concrete to settle properly. They drove away an employee of the contractor who was watering the concrete, and opened the patch of the road for traffic without letting the concrete settle.In this backdrop, justice Kotwal said if the sub-engineer is guilty of any offence, as alleged by the prosecution, he would be convicted and sentenced after trial, but his custodial interrogation at this stage is not required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vikhroli-park-site-accident-hc-grants-bail-to-bmc-sub-engineer/story-vvAelPPQlqWleo0daincZO.html

Over 60 people boarded the train en route to Munshipulia.Keshav said, “ I am happy to see the trains running again. UPMRC has kept no stone unturned to make travel safe for the passengers. There was no flag-off ceremony because we do not want any sort of crowd collection at any spot.”He added the Metro is using advanced technology to make travel safe for passengers and their staff. “There has been an emphasis on contactless travel, sanitisation, social distancing, hygiene, and using ultraviolet lights for disinfecting surfaces and installing touch-free foot pedals,” he said. “I am confident Lucknowites will feel safe in the Metro and use it more than any other mode of transport.”He added initially trains will be available after a gap of 5 minutes and 30 seconds. “But when the ridership will increase, we will reduce the gap to around 3 minutes.

07-09-2020||City||Covid-19: At 235,857, Maharashtra has 1/4th of country’s active cases||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra has been rising steadily. With 126, 523 cases and 2,205 fatalities reported in the last seven days, the state now has 235,857 active patients, more than a fourth cases in the country, leading to the fall in the recovery rate over last week. Also read: What you need to know today about Covid-19The rising number in the active cases is a cause of concern for the authorities as it would put an additional burden on the health infrastructure. In a few districts where cases are rising, the infrastructure has not been ramped up enought to be able to take the load of additional cases, officials feel. “From 171,542 cases two weeks ago on August 23, the number of active cases rose to 193,548 on August 30, and 235,857 on Sunday. The whopping rise in the cases over the past week is obviously putting the infrastructure under tremendous pressure. Some of the districts, like Sangli, Satara, Nagpur, have witnessed over a 40% rise in cases over the past week. The positivity rate of the state has jumped to more than 23% in the last few days from below 19% three weeks ago,” said an official from the health department.The officer said that they were concerned about the availability of sufficient number of beds with oxygen and ventilator supply. The officer said that the ramping up the infrastructure has not been met to cope with the rise of 90,000 active patients increase in the last one month.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the rise in the number of cases was owing to the unlocking. “We have lifted restrictions on inter-district movement, have increased workforce in offices and this has led to the spread of the virus. It is true that tracking of high and low risk contacts is just 10-12 against the expected number of up to 20 people. We are, however, prepared to take up the rise in the number of patients. District and corporation administrations have been directed to focus on tracking-testing and ramping up of the infrastructure,” he said. In the wake of the spike in the cases, state’s recovery rate also fell to 71.03% on Sunday from 72.58% on September 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-at-235-857-maharashtra-has-1-4th-of-country-s-active-cases/story-1KWDxjvrnUeGvriV7ItbYJ.html

We were AICC [All India Congress Committee] members and could have been removed only by AICC, not UPCC,” said former minister Satyadev Tripathi, one of the signatories of the letter, on Monday.Also Read: Salman Khurshid on key UP Congress poll team, ‘dissenters’ cold-shoulderedThe state unit revoked the expulsion of one of the 10, former minister Ram Krishna Dwivedi, days before his death in April.In their letter to Sonia Gandhi on September 2, the group said Congress and the nation were built under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, upholding democratic values and ideals. “And you yourself adopted those values. None can deny the strength the Congress has gained under your leadership. But this is ironical that a sense of confusion and non-communication prevails among the Congress workers in view of the manner the party is running or being run.” The letter cited many defeats that the party has faced and added Congress workers have never been so hopeless and disappointed as they are now. “This is an issue of concern for the Congress for sure…..Those who are not even the primary members of the Congress have been working at the party’s headquarters [in states] on a financial package [salaries]. And such people now are reviewing the loyalties of committed and dedicated [leaders] who fought for the Congress from 1977-1980 and have occupied important positions in the party representing it in the Lok Sabha and the state assembly,” the letter said. “And It was under the pressure of such leaders that 10 leaders were expelled overnight from the Congress in an undemocratic, unconstitutional, and unjust manner.”The other signatories of the letter include former MP Santosh Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/expelled-uttar-pradesh-congress-veterans-asks-sonia-to-rise-above-enchantment-of-the-family/story-X5HKsFAW2oGDAP5WTQDAJP.html

The development has raised serious questions as the woman complainant, who accused the school owner and a senior official of the revenue department of raping her, was also arrested for allegedly taking Rs 7.25 lakh to withdraw her complaint. She recently availed bail and presented some audio recordings, accusing the son of Nilokheri MLA of helping the police to ‘frame’ her in the case.As per the letter, SP Surinder Singh Bhoria said the cases were already under the investigation and two SITs have been formed for the same. “But these cases are being highlighted in the social media to a great extent and unnecessarily, district police are being dragged in the controversy by both the parties,” he said. “Many audio recordings are being used in the media, but these were never produced before the SIT during the course of investigation by the complainant,” read the letters.“It is requested to ensure the impartial image and working of the police and in the interest of justice that this case be transferred to some other district,” the SP mentioned in the letter. Karnal IGP Bharti Arora confirmed that she has got a letter from the SP and decision to transfer the case will be taken on Monday.It is pertinent to mention here that on the complaint of the woman on July 7, the police had booked the owner of a private school, a revenue official and the woman principal of the school under sections 376D, 506, 323 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the crime committed in 2018. The school management accused the woman of extortion and blackmailing for a hike in salary, leading to the registration of an FIR against the woman. Two SITs were constituted to investigate these cases.On August 22, the woman was arrested for taking Rs 7.25 lakh to settle the case. Now, the woman has presented recordings of her telephonic conversation with Nilokheri MLA’s son, accusing him of persuading her to settle the case. However, the MLA’s son has refuted the allegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pvt-school-staffer-gangrape-karnal-sp-wants-case-transferred-to-other-district/story-77vNKLmGI0u7iNPrNSHfqL.html

07-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meera’s living history||She has lived through the Second World War, and through many other profound historical shifts. Including the Partition. Actually, she came of age in what is now Pakistan.She is 93.“No (public) event ever affected me as personally as the coronavirus pandemic,” declares the stately Meera Sachdeva.This evening, the woman who has seen so much is calmly chatting on WhatsApp video from her daughter’s home in west Delhi. She is a Gurugram dweller, however, and lives with her son in that city’s Mianwalli Colony. She arrived to visit her daughter’s family here in Tagore Garden a week ago, in the carefully sanitised family car.Because the coronavirus can be lethal, in particular to the elderly, Ms Sachdeva hadn’t stepped out of her house in all these months.“But I keep myself active.” She takes regular daily walks within her bungalow, conscientiously strolling from one room to another.Ms Sachdeva’s five children are scattered at various hoods across the Delhi region. Her (Tagore Garden) daughter Renu Kathuria, a retired English teacher, hugs Ms Sachdeva and says: “I hadn’t seen Bhabhi (all her children call her by this address) for such a long time.”“I’ve seen nothing like this,” Ms Sachdeva insists, referring to the pandemic. “Na kabhi pehele aisa dekha, na kabhi pehele aisa suna (never seen or heard something like this).” Showing the gold chain round her neck, she says—“it’s from before the batwara (Partition).” Looking back on various transformative events of her long lifetime, Ms Sachdeva recalls when she was a young mother and had to leave her home in west Punjab’s Mianwali for a new life across what would become the India-Pakistan border. “It was around Baisakhi, just when the first troubles were starting.” There was enough time for the family to transport all their valuable possessions, she explains, and that includes the chain she is wearing.Now surrounded by her daughter, her son-in-law, her grandson, and her great-grandchildren, Ms Sachdeva poses for a corona-era portrait through the phone screen that connects her to this reporter (the grandson’s wife is holding the phone). Her erect figure quietly stands out among her loved ones, as a living witness to all the histories that have unfolded since the 1930s, including the great pandemic that is still to become history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-meera-s-living-history/story-7V2Qn2tAAdZ1djPuthyEpL.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal launches anti-dengue campaign, urges all citizens to participate||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched the second edition of the ‘10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute (10 weeks, 10 o’clock, 10 minutes)’ campaign against dengue and other vector-borne diseases on Sunday.He said, “Last year, two crore people of Delhi joined hands to win a fight against dengue. In the next 10 weeks, we shall do it again. I inspected my home today for places where stagnant water could accumulate. I urge you to do the same. Let’s join hands to fight against dengue once again”.The CM also urged religious organisations, cultural groups and resident welfare associations (RWA) to endorse the campaign.The first edition of the campaign was held last year – which, said Kejriwal, help bring down the number of dengue cases and deaths. The campaign urges people to inspect their homes for any possible sources of stagnant clean water, which can lead to the breeding of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes that spread dengue. In 2015, Delhi recorded 15,867 cases of dengue and 60 deaths. In 2019, the Capital recorded 2,036 cases and the number of deaths dropped to two, data shared by the Delhi government shows.On Sunday, all cabinet ministers in Delhi, Rajya Sabha MPs of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), MLAs and other party leaders joined the drive, as they posted photographs on social media. Several volunteers and supporters of the party also joined the citizen campaign and posted their photos and videos on social media.“One should not be complacent assuming that there is no place in her house where clean water accumulate. If you invest 10 minutes, you are most likely to come across some place which went unnoticed. I urge more people to participate,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a tweet.The participants, including the chief minister, pledged that they would devote 10 minutes at 10 am every Sunday for 10 weeks to inspect their residence for stagnant clean water and clean it to avoid breeding of mosquitoes and prevent the spread of diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya.In the coming weeks, doctors would be requested to endorse the campaign and more children would be encouraged to participate through homework assigned by schools. Government offices would also be asked to promote it, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.BS Vohra, president of an umbrella group of RWAs in east Delhi said, “We shall endorse this campaign. It significantly contributes to generating awareness about fighting dengue. At this juncture, the government should consider designing a similar campaign to generate more awareness on sanitisation, social distancing and respiratory etiquettes in the light of the spike in Covid-19 cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-launches-anti-dengue-campaign-urges-all-citizens-to-participate/story-XR3tNRdam1tsA9GODFZgVP.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan’s mother passes away; her body donated for scientific research||Union health and science minister Dr Harsh Vardhan’s mother Snehlata Goel died on Sunday after suffering a cardiac arrest. She was 89. The minister rushed her to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) after she collapsed suddenly, but she could not be revived. She died at 8.50 am“Heartbroken to inform that my dearest person on earth, my Mother, has left for heavenly abode. She was 89 & suffered a cardiac arrest today morning. A towering personality, my guide & philosopher, she has left a void in my life that none can fill. May her pious soul find peace,” tweeted the minister in the morning, with a photograph of him with his mother. Dr Harsh Vardhan, who is an ENT doctor by training, donated her eyes at the Organ Retrieval and Banking Organisation (ORBO) at AIIMS for people with corneal blindness to regain their vision. “After his mother passed away, the minister asked to donate her eyes and signed the consent form himself. It is a really great step and hopefully an inspiration for others,” said Dr Aarti Vij, chief of ORBO. Since his mother’s advanced age made her unfit for donating other organs, Dr Harsh Vardhan donated her body to Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) for the advancement of science to help medical students and researchers learn about the human anatomy.“Her body had been pledged to the institute earlier and was received today upon her death. She would live on after her demise and help in educating the future generation of doctors. Training of anatomy is an essential part of the MBBS course but rarely do we see people donate bodies. It was a courageous step taken by the minister,” said Dr Suresh Seth, director of the Lok Nayak Hospital that is attached to MAMC. Minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office, Jitendra Singh, wrote in a tweet: “My sincere condolences to Dr Harsh Vardhan ji, with whom I share a long-time relationship as my senior, both in medical profession as well as in public life. Mother’s void can never be filled.” Condolences also came from the Congress MP Digvijay Singh, who said, “Very sorry to hear about the sad demise of Harsh Vardhan ji’s Mother. Our condolences to Harsh Vardhan ji and his family. May her Soul rest in Peace.” The Indian Medical Association also expressed sadness at the demise of the minister’s mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-s-mother-passes-away-her-body-donated-for-scientific-research/story-31N14cce1PZdIkbvv8qYTN.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi adds over 3k for the first time since June 26; positivity rate on steady rise||The national capital recorded over 3,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the first time since June 26 on Sunday, as per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin.Despite a dip in tests — to 36,046 on Sunday from 38,895 the day before, the city added 3,265 cases of the infection. A bulk of the tests on Sunday were performed using the less-sensitive rapid antigen method — a trend that has persisted in the Capital since they were introduced in JuneClick here for full Covid-19 coverage The Delhi government last month said it aims to increase testing to 40,000 a day. The increase in the number of cases also resulted in a bump in the single-day positivity rate to 9.03%, as compared to the 8.68% rate recorded over the last week. The week before that, the average daily positivity rate stood at 8.66%, and just 6.85% two weeks ago. After seeing a decrease in the number of new cases in the first two weeks of August — with just 652 cases recorded on August 16, Delhi started seeing an increase in the number of new cases and the positivity rate from the third week of the month. “Not just the number of cases, but the positivity rate has also increased in the city, indicating an increase in the transmission of the virus,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said, “Its not just the numbers. We have to look at micro-level data to see whether the new cases are being reported from. From what I have seen so far, most of the cases are being reported from southwest and south Delhi now. In June, when there had been a surge in the number of cases, most new infections were being reported from central Delhi, from areas such as Chandni Mahal. This implies that the virus is now in transmission in areas where the infection had been low earlier.” He also said, “People have now become more relaxed or fatigued, and are not following simple preventive measures such as wearing masks in public places, maintaining social distance, and washing hands frequently. This has also led to an increase in transmission of the virus.” Delhi has also seen an increase in the absolute number of deaths, which has gone up from a low of eight in one day on August 16 to 29 reported on Sunday. On average, 20 people died of the infection every day in the city over the last one week. Despite the increase in the number of deaths, the surge in testing has resulted in a declining case fatality ratio (CFR) — the fraction of deaths among those who test positive. Delhi’s CFR stood at 2.39% as on Sunday, the lowest since May 31. The highest CFR in Delhi was recorded on June 16 — 4.11% — when Delhi reconciled the number of deaths, adding 437 deaths in a day to the total toll. “Even though the number of cases is going up, the mortality is likely to remain almost the same. This is because the doctors have a better understanding of the disease, the treatment protocols have been standardised, and there are more options for treatment such as plasma therapy and drugs like remdesivir. Also, with beds and infrastructure in place, people are being motivated to get admitted even when the disease is not very serious for better monitoring and management in case the condition deteriorates,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital. “The only way I see the mortality going up is if our ICUs and isolation beds start running full and we are not able to admit patients early on. The case fatality ratio in Delhi is higher than the national average perhaps because people from neighbouring states also come to Delhi for treatment,” he said. The country’s average CFR stands at 1.7%. The other reason for the low mortality rate, experts suggest is that many asymptomatic and mild cases are also being detected. “Not only the number of tests have gone up since June, the criteria has also been relaxed and the government has now allowed testing on demand. People are now being motivated to get tested. This also means we are detecting many more asymptomatic and mild cases that were not being diagnosed back then. This also means the proportion of those tested who will have severe disease will be lower, and so will be the deaths,” said Dr Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-adds-over-3k-for-the-first-time-since-june-26-positivity-rate-on-steady-rise/story-LPRbkQPjX600f5COtx9jdP.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Belgian Malinois adds more bite to CISF canine squad||As the Delhi Metro prepares to resume operations on Monday, a brigade of 61 commandos are ready for deployment — the Central Industrial Security Force’s canine commandos, who will be back helping keep Delhi’s public transit lifeline.While most of the CISF’s four-legged squad comprises German Shepherds, Labradors and Cocker Spaniels, force’s “best” sniffer dogs, there is a special addition to the lot this — Khoj — their most sought-after dog, a Belgian Malinois. The breed shot to international fame after a member was speculated to have accompanied the US Navy Seal team that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.Last year, a Belgian Malinois dog named Conan took part in a raid in Syria which resulted in the death of then Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.The 16-month-old Khoj — whose name means ‘search’ — joined the CISF’s dog squad two weeks ago, after completing her year-long training in Bangalore. She is the only dog with the force trained in attacking or neutralising “fidayeen attackers”, and is known to be an expert tracker — as her name suggests.“Khoj is the only tracking dog we have. She can track a scent for at least five kilometres. She can differentiate between multiple scents, and can clearly distinguish between a variety of explosives. But her best quality is that she’s an attack dog. She’s been trained to attack fidayeen attackers and pin them down,” said Raman Kumar, deputy commandant, CISF, who is in charge of the Quick Response Team, bomb detection teams and dog squad.Apart from Khoj, eight other dogs, five of them German Shepherds — Yoddha, Sarah, Dolly, Bella and Charlie, and three Labradors — Max, Johnny and Julie, joined the force two weeks ago.When Metro operations were shut and these dogs were not in service, they followed a strict training routine and were given a tailored diet to keep them in shape and keep their instincts active.Another official, who asked not to be named, said so far, over ₹1 lakh has been spent on buying and training the Belgian Malinois, making it the most expensive member of the CISF dog squad — funds for which came from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/belgian-malinois-adds-more-bite-to-cisf-canine-squad/story-dqMY4TzIrT6Qo6d6lH5b3K.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro says it is ready for Covid-19 challenge||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Sunday said it is all geared up to resume services, and meet all challenges including crowd management, after a five-and-a-half-month-long hiatus from Monday.With transport experts expressing concerns over the issue of crowding inside the network and outside the transit stations, DMRC officials said it has put necessary arrangements in place to maintain social distancing and hygiene, which is crucial to control the spread of Covid-19 infection. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn an interview to HT last week, DMRC chief Mangu Singh had said that crowding is indeed a concern and they will make efforts to “break the peak”. Singh had told HT, “We want to ensure that there is no peak in crowding; that there is an even flow. We want people to support us and plan journeys accordingly because this is the best way to utilise the system. And we will also be able to provide the best service.”The DMRC has issued a detailed advisory for commuters about the dos and don’ts while travelling in Metro in the new normal post-coronavirus pandemic. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, on Sunday said, “Besides ‘break the peak’, DMRC appeals to commuters to talk less during travel in the Metro to prevent the possibility of short-range aerosol transmission.”The other concern, raised especially by medical experts, is of strict enforcement of social distancing norms.Also read: DMRC conducts dry run on Yellow Line, Rapid MetroWith the Metro, which is the transport lifeline of Delhi and NCR, starting its services with reduced capacity –from 360-400 passengers to 50 passengers per coach—experts say crowding at stations and outside is bound to happen. The DMRC has decided that if the train is full or there is a crowd at the station, the train will skip the station.Experts say crowding is likely on stations which are immediately on the line after the point of origin. “Not many people take the Metro for short distances. The train is bound to be full at the starting point. So, what happens to passengers who will be waiting at the third or the fourth station?” said Mukti Advani, principal scientist, transportation planning division, CSIR-Central Road Research Institute.She added, “For this, the DMRC can spread out the starting point, that is the trains can start from multiple stations so that those on station falling in the middle of the corridor are also able to travel without waiting for too long.”DMRC officials say that a plan has been worked out to avoid such a situation. Dayal said, “To prevent crowding in trains/stations, we may have to opt for starting certain empty trains from terminal stations or short loop some trains to manage the crowded zones on a particular route/section.”He added, “This dynamic regulation of train movement will be based on the ground situation at given hours and one may have to skip a train or two, leading to extra time in completing the travel.”The measures planned by DMRC for crowd management inside the network, experts say, might result in congestion outside the station. While the situation inside might be good, transport expert Sewa Ram said, there could be chaos on the streets outside the station. “They should set up queuing areas outside the station so that people can wait in case the station gates have to be closed due to rush inside,” said Sewa Ram, professor at School of Planning and Architecture. To begin with, the DMRC is starting its service on the Yellow line (HUDA City Centre to Samayapur Badli) and subsequently open another line. By September 12, the entire network spread over 389 kms will be operational.This is when the DMRC’s crowd management plan will be put to test, especially at interchange stations. Transport experts say that it is impossible to know how many people at any given point of time will exit the trains at interchange stations.“To manage crowds at interchange stations will be a real challenge. For this, the DMRC can work out a service plan in which it can ensure that all trains might not stop at a particular interchange station. Also, the DMRC should open all the Automated Fare Collection gates,” said Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India.With DMRC increasing the dwelling time at each station by 10-20 seconds for boarding-deboarding and extra time to sanitise the trains at the terminal stations, the frequency of trains is likely to drop. Bhatt said, “The 5-7minute gap between trains can be counter-productive as it will result in crowding at stations. Efforts should be to increase the frequency of trains.”The DMRC has decided to push all the trains into service to minimise the frequency gap. Starting its services after a long hiatus, DMRC has advised passengers to keep 15-30 minutes of extra time while planning their journey.While the medical fraternity is divided over the decision to resume metro services, those in favour say that the DMRC should ensure strict enforcement of the safety norms needed to contain the spread of the infection.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said, “The most important thing is that people don’t take off their masks inside the trains. They should have one person deployed on trains to check that people wear masks properly. I personally feel that there is no need to leave a gap of one seat as long as people wear a mask. Those standing inside the trains will be touching multiple points and should be very careful.”Smita Nair, a resident of Janakpuri, said that the opening of Metro services will come as a huge relief to her, especially because of the nature of her work that requires her to regularly go to office. “I am an IT professional and I work in Noida. Our team was called back from June and ever since, I either have to pay a hefty amount for cab rides or depend on my husband to drop me. Metro station is barely two kilometres from my place and commuting now will be extremely convenient. It was inconsiderate for the government to have allowed offices to call its employees but not allow the most used transport mode in the city,” she said.Vighnesh Jha, secretary general, Federation of Richshaw Pullers’ Association of India, said the resumption of Metro services will boost the earnings of cycle rickshaw pullers by 40-50%. “With several commercial activities being allowed in June, cycle rickshaw pullers’ income had revived. But it wasn’t sufficient. Now, with opening of Metro, things will change for better. It will result in an additional 40-50% increase in their earnings, as a large number of Metro commuters prefer to take rickshaw for short distance travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-says-it-is-ready-for-covid-19-challenge/story-7PDigkRkVRkc01FLsmIbsO.html

07-09-2020||Chandigarh||Social distancing norms broken outside some NDA exam centres in Chandigarh||Social distancing norms went for a toss at some of the centres where the National Defence Academy (NDA) and Naval Academy (NA) examinations were conducted on Sunday.More than 26,000 students were set to appear for the exam that constituted a mathematics part from 10am-12:30pm and a general aptitude portion held between 2pm to 4:30pm. Due to lack of clarity on rules, however, the gates to the Sector-33 Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), one of the 65 designated centres, remained closed during the gap between the two exams, when the students were supposed to have their lunch.A total of 480 students were supposed to appear for the exam at the Sector-33 centre. Parents crowded around the gate on the outside, passing water bottles and food to their wards through the railings.Police posted at the gates said, “We did not receive any instructions from inside the centre, so the gates will remain closed.”Meanwhile, other centres operated normally and opened for lunch.Himanshu Mittal from Abohar at GMSSS, Sector 35, said the exam was generally easy. Most students said the questions on integration and probability were the toughest.Kunal Singh, who provides NDA coaching at Sector 34, said this year UPSC left out questions of general geography and focused on agricultural geography instead. “Phrases and idioms and reading comprehension were also missing from the English section. In math, around 19 out of 120 questions were of the advanced JEE-level while 17 questions were from previous years.”LESS THAN 50% ATTENDANCE IN CLASSROOMSMost of the classrooms registered less than 50% attendance. Aniket Singh from Mohali said although his classroom was supposed to adjust 24 students, only eight turned up. Other students also confirmed that the attendance remained low.For some students, both NDA and JEE Main exams were held on the same day. Arshdeep Singh of Amritsar had his JEE Main in Amritsar, but had instead chosen to travel to Chandigarh to sit in the NDA exam.Even though nine special trains were run to ferry students from various stations in Punjab, Haryana and even Himachal Pradesh to Chandigarh, most candidates preferred to travel to the centres themselves. Dipanshu from Jalandhar said he felt safere taking a taxi from Jalandhar rather than depending on the train. Jitender Bhaskar who came from Karnal added that the trains would have reached just hours before the exam, so many students had come to the city a day in advance to get proper rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-norms-broken-outside-some-nda-exam-centres-in-chandigarh/story-7n5l3GScIYgfgGPGqKrPzM.html
07-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: On day one of DU entrance exams, special arrangements at centres, some students skip||Two months late, and with a hoard of precautions to prevent the spread of Covid-19, entrance tests for admissions to Delhi University began on Sunday, across 24 cities.The test (DUET) is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to nine undergraduate courses and all postgraduate and MPhil and PhD programmes in the Delhi University. Around 220,000 candidates are expected to appear in the examinations, which will be on till September 11, and DU officials said around 70% of expected candidates turned up on the first day.Candidates were, on day one, welcomed by a unique examination experience, even as cases in the city continued to creep up. For one, examination slots were staggered, to avoid crowds. Upon entering centres, candidates were asked to dispose of their face masks and handed fresh ones.Komal Chaudhary, 20, who travelled from Gurugram to Kalkaji in a taxi for the Zoology MSc entrance exam, said she was satisfied with the protocols followed at her examination centre. “I was initially scared for my safety, wondering if social distancing guidelines would be followed during the exam. Officials at the centre checked my temperature and asked that I sanitise my hands before entering the hall. There was a quick registration process, before we were given our room numbers,” she said.“We were made to sit on alternate seats and keep our masks on. After we finished the test, we were asked to leave the room one-at-a-time and were told to sanitise our hands before leaving the centre as well,” Chaudhary added.Entrance exams for 37 courses were held on Sunday in three slots — 8am to 10am, 12pm to 2pm and 4pm to 6pm.Despite the protocols, the fear of health risks persisted among aspirants across the country, some of whom skipped the tests entirely. Shalini, 23, a resident of Naraina, said, “Initially, I had decided to skip the exams because of the prevailing [Covid-19] situation. But my father insisted I appear in the entrance exam. I am still scared, and will isolate myself for a few days now.”Gaurav Rajput, 21, a resident of Uttam Nagar, said he had to return home before he reached the centre after developing a mild fever. “I had to appear for the MA political science entrance exam at the Mundka centre. I had a slight fever since Saturday night, and my temperature rose while I was on the way to the centre. Our admit cards said students with fever would not be allowed at the exam centres. I had to get off the bus mid-way. In normal circumstances, students with slight fever are allowed at the exam centres, but things are different amid the pandemic. I have informed my college teachers and will also write to the DU administration about my situation,” he said.Arpitha, a resident of Kozhikode in Kerala, had to appear for the LLM entrance test in Thiruvananthapuram — nearly 400km away, but had to give the exam a miss because of scant public transport options in the state due to the pandemic.“Four of my friends also decided not to appear in the exam on Sunday for the same reason. We were really scared because Covid-19 cases in Thiruvananthapuram are increasing with every passing day. We could not take the risk of travelling there,” she said.DU dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said the number of examination centres was increased this year in view of the pandemic. “While there were exam centres in 18 cities last year, this year we had centres in 24 cities. The NTA also shifted many students’ centres at their requests. At least 65% to 70% of students appeared in the DUET on the first day,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-on-day-one-of-du-entrance-exams-special-arrangements-at-centres-some-students-skipped-the-exam/story-bRs6qh04OdxhMXx6Fs4nxM.html
07-09-2020||Gurugram||Only 0.6 percent of recovered Covid-19 patients in Gurugram have donated plasma||Since its inauguration on July 30, the district’s plasma bank has seen only 75 patients come forward to donate blood after recovering from Covid-19, health officials said. That is only 0.6 percent of the 11,243 patients who have already recovered from the illness in Gurugram so far. The numbers, however, have started to pick up. With the number of reported infections in the district steadily rising — at a growth rate of about two percent, and clocking well over 200 new positives each day — the district health department over the weekend made an appeal to those who have recovered, to come forward and donate antibody-rich plasma, which be administered to moderate patients opting for plasma therapy, as a mode of treatment.Officials, however, said that over the past week the number of donors consenting to donate plasma has increased. By August 30, a month after opening, the bank had taken plasma samples from about 40 donors. The remaining 35 donors have come forward in the past week itself.“We are getting four to five new donors each day now, but it has taken a lot of effort. We make at least 150 calls per day, so that’s a conversion rate of about three percent. People are very hesitant, despite the fact that the blood bank is located nowhere near a Covid treatment facility,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, nodal officer in charge of the project.Kesarwani added that a team of 15 volunteers, belonging to organisations such as the District Red Cross Society and the Cannwinn Foundation, are involved “in some capacity or the other” in keeping Gurugram’s plasma bank running, including providing pick up and drop services to donors, and cold calling recovered patients to seek plasma donations. “We have also prepared a standard set of FAQs, which are provided to all recovered patients. It has helped to clear up some of their apprehensions,” Kesarwani added.While health department officials were reluctant to point to one singular reason as to why people are refusing to donate, they said that it is likely due to fear of revisiting hospitals and medical centres, particularly after having endured the ordeal of recovery. They also said that stigma associated around the illness could very well be holding back some donors. “For this reason we have put out an appeal through the public relations office over the weekend,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/only-0-6-percent-of-recovered-covid-19-patients-in-gurugram-have-donated-plasma/story-9UDdi20SnpFwZc9BnQxEyN.html
07-09-2020||Gurugram||DMRC conducts dry run on Yellow Line, Rapid Metro||In the run-up to the resumption of Metro services in a graded manner from Monday, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) conducted a dry run on the Yellow Line and the Rapid Metro Line in collaboration with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Gurugram Police on Sunday.The Gurugram police had deployed around 50 police personnel at the five Yellow Line Metro stations in Gurugram—Guru Dronacharya, Sikandarpur, MG Road, Iffco Chowk, Huda City Centre in the rehearsal. The Gurugram police said the police personnel will help in managing the entry of commuters, prevent overcrowding outside Metro stations apart from effectively managing parking areas. Everything would be done in coordination with CISF with whom the responsibility of providing security and managing crowd inside the stations primarily lies, said police officers how participated in the dress rehearsal.“A dry run was conducted on the Yellow Line and Rapid Metro, and trains ran on the two lines in the morning and evening to check the readiness of the entire system. The trains will be operational from Monday onwards,” a DMRC spokesperson said. The trains will remain run from 7am to 11am and 4pm to 8pm, and the Metro services will be made fully operational from September 12 onwards, DMRC said.The primary job of the Gururam police would be to ensure commuters follow the prescribed safeguards against Covid-19 such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing .“For now, around 50 personnel will be deployed at the Delhi Metro stations who will work in coordination with CISF. During the rehearsal, markings were made at a distance of one-metre for commuters to stand on,” said inspector Ramesh Kumar, station house officer, Metro police station.“Personnel from nearest police station will control the crowd and manage the parking space outside the Metro stations,” said KK Rao, police commissioner, Gurugram. The police said personnel from the nearest Metro stations will also oversee crowds outside eleven stations of Rapid Metro, which runs from Cyber Hub to Sector 56 along the Golf Course road.The Gurugram health department, which will provide medical assistance to the commuters, said it has installed notice boards details of the nearest urban health centres on all five metro stations on the Yellow Line which are expected to see heavy rush. Chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said that as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) prescribed by the DMRC all commuters will be screened and those who have flu-like symptoms or higher than normal body temperature would be asked to visit the nearest public health centre.“We also held a detailed meeting in which the medical officers were told that they must provide assistance to commuters, and samples for Covid-19 testing should be collected of symptomatic passengers at the health centres,” said Dr Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dmrc-conducts-dry-run-on-yellow-line-rapid-metro/story-GV44l5ghWaDqykjcHTcXPO.html

The police said a joint raid was conducted by a team of state crime branch and the Udyog Vihar police station, following which an FIR was registered against the main suspect, the mastermind running the business, on Saturday. Four employees of the call centre were questioned by the police while the alleged mastermind, whose name has been withheld by the police, managed to escape before the raid. The police have seized several computers, laptops and hard disks from the centre and have initiated a probe. A police official from the state crime branch, requesting anonymity, said, “During investigation of a similar case in June 2019, a suspect, identified as Naveen Kumar, was arrested for luring job seekers by making fictitious claims of getting them placements in leading companies and charging a recruitment fee from them. The suspect was taken on a five-day remand last week, and based on the inputs, the raid was conducted in Udyog Vihar Phase 4 in Sector 18.” The police said four employees, who were detained, told the police that their job was to “cold call” unemployed people and offer them a subscription, which would help them land a job. Satbir Singh, station house officer (SHO), Udyog Vihar police station, said, “Preliminary probe has found that the call centre charged ₹6,899 per person as a fee for registration on their job portal and promised them premium jobs to unsuspecting unemployed persons. They said that some seniors had shared with them a database of unemployed people over email, which they used for “cold calls”. The employees were let off after questioning. The prime suspect, who was running the company, escaped from the spot.” The police said the suspect also offered to “spruce up” the resumes of people with the promise of landing interviews at IT firms. The employees failed to produce any licence issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for running the call centre. A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66 b, 66 c and 66 D of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act at Udyog Vihar police station on Saturday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/illegal-call-centre-promising-false-job-offers-busted-in-gurugram/story-EoAx0aR5a8jtztqN7p9wJM.html

07-09-2020||City||Gurugram might witness another spell of light rain today||Gurugram: The city might witness another spell of light rain on Monday, after which rainfall activity is expected to decrease for the next few days in the region, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Tuesday. According to the agency, rainfall activity over northwest India is likely to decrease with light to moderate, isolated to scattered rainfall across the region after which it is expected to decrease further in the next four-five days.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi, said there is a possibility of light rain this week in the national capital region. “Gurugram and Faridabad saw more rainfall activity on Saturday but with the monsoon trough shifting around Meerut and surrounding areas, light rain can be expected in NCR,” said Srivastava. The minimum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 23 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature stood at 35.5 degrees Celsius — a marginal drop from Saturday’s 36.6 degrees Celsius. Gurugram’s maximum temperature is expected to stay around 35 degrees on Monday. As per the weekly forecast, cloudy sky with thundershowers and one or two spells of rain are expected on Monday. Air quality in the city remained ‘satisfactory’ on Sunday, recording 60 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was an improvement from the previous day’s recording of 74, in the ‘satisfactory’ category. The improvement in air quality was attributed largely to an increase in wind speed and light rainfall Saturday evening.The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s most prominent pollutant, on Sunday was 67.75 µg/m³, according to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan.

07-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Woman arrested for murder of husband||Two days after police arrested a 24-year-old man for allegedly kidnapping, killing and dumping the body of a cab driver, police arrested victim’s wife on Sunday. The woman was identified as 25-year-old Sunita, a resident of Sector 5. Sector 5 station house officer Rajender Kumar said she and the Sukhbir, who was arrested on Friday, had conspired to kill him along with his friend in Narwana town in Jind. “The accomplice is yet to be arrested but he is hiding in Jind area,” he said. Police on Friday had exhumed the body of the victim from a seven-feet long drain near Narwana in Jind, some 186 kilometres from Gurugram. The victim was identified by his first name as Suresh (27), and lived with his wife and two children. Suspecting Sukhbir and Sunita of having an affair, Suresh had earlier allegedly assaulted his wife and threatened Sukhbir. On April 12, in an apparent bid to sort out “confusion”, Sukhbir had called Suresh to Jind where he allegedly killed him with the help of his friend.Suspecting something amiss after not having heard from his son for almost five months, the victim’s father approached the police on September 1 and filed a missing person’s complaint. On Friday, police arrested Sukhbir who allegedly confessed to the crime. A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 302 (murder), 365 (kidnapping), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and sections of Arms Act of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 5 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-woman-arrested-for-murder-of-husband/story-jLJphpgAse5ooUMyel3W7M.html
07-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Why Golf Course Extension Road remains vulnerable to developing potholes||Gurugram: A high volume of heavy vehicle traffic as well as problems in the design of the Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) make it vulnerable to developing potholes frequently, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials said, adding that until a long-term solution is adopted, the problem will continue to persist.In October 2018, when GCER started developing potholes, GMDA did structural integrity tests on the 6.3-kilometre stretch between Ghata T-point and Vatika Chowk and found that the design was not sufficient to support the volume of traffic on it and the base of the road was weak, leading to its disintegration.Back then, V Umashankar, the then chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, had said that at the time of its construction, GCER was designed in a manner to sustain city-traffic. However, over time its role has become similar to a state highway and a lot of heavy vehicles ply on the road, which its surface is unable to withstand, hence the potholes. He had said that “re-carpeting is only staunching the wound; relaying is the larger, long-term solution,” adding that GMDA is working on a long-term road-widening project which will make the stretch signal-free.VS Kundu, the current CEO of GMDA, said the volume of vehicles on GCER is not an issue but it is the type of vehicles running on it that is the problem.“In terms of the total number of vehicles, GCER is not compromised. The problem is that the road was not designed to support the axle-weight of the heavy vehicles currently plying on it in large numbers. This is the case, especially with the carriageway carrying traffic between Vatika Chowk and Ghata,” said Kundu.Kundu said that an axle-weight capacity study of the stretch was done last year.“We found that vehicles, that are designed to carry a maximum load of eight tons, were generally found to be carrying four-five times this weight. Most vehicles were found carrying loads amounting to 30-40 tons. GCER is designed to sustain only 8-15 tons. It is being subjected to twice or thrice the total weight and the sub-surface of the road is unable to bear the load. Hence, the entire stretch crumbles quickly,” said Kundu.He further said that on the opposite carriageway, between Ghata and Vatika Chowk, the study found that most heavy vehicles travelled without any load and hence, the damage on the road-surface is comparatively lower.He added that hence, the strengthening of the stretch is needed for a long-term solution.Last year in September the Haryana government had approved GMDA’s detailed project report (DPR) for the redesigning of the stretch with two underpasses and three flyovers.“We wouldn’t be widening the six-lane stretch but redesigning it along with flyovers and laying a Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) road to support the weight of the heavy vehicles. Initially, the total cost of the project was around Rs 281 crore but now it would go in excess of Rs 300 crore. In March, during a GMDA meeting, we decided to redesign the stretch from Vatika Chowk to Kherki Daula as well. Thereby the entire Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) would be redesigned,” said Kundu. Most national highways, state highways and airport runways across the country are designed with PQC roads as it is able to bear heavy loads.The 13 kilometre-long SPR includes the entire GCER and the stretch between Vatika Chowk and Kherki Daula toll.Kundu said that due to the coronavirus outbreak, the follow-up on the decision taken during the meeting in March was delayed. However, two weeks ago, an internationally certified road design company was allocated the task of reviewing the design from Ghata and Vatika Chowk as well as working on the redesign of the stretch from Vatika Chowk to Kherki Daula. He said the company has been given six weeks to complete both tasks and the entire initiative is being done through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. As changes have been made to the original project, an approval from the Haryana government will once again be sought, he added.A GMDA traffic study found that the average number of vehicles plying on GCER was around 4,100 per hour vehicles in June 2018, which rose to 4,600 vehicles per hour in June last year. The study further projected that by June 2028, the average number of vehicles per hour will be in excess of 7,000 while by June 2038 it will be around 11,500.Sarika Panda, a city road-safety expert with Naggaro, a software development and technology consulting company, said that until the redesigning is done, GMDA should divert heavy vehicles away from the road“Heavy vehicles can be easily diverted to the Sohna Road, Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway or Kundli–Manesar–Palwal Expressway that are all designed to sustain the load of heavy vehicles. Until then GMDA can fill the potholes across GCER and make it operational for only light-weight vehicles,” said Bhatt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-why-golf-course-extension-road-remains-vulnerable-to-developing-potholes/story-fzGJPJCK8cD61K9IeB6vqL.html

07-09-2020||Gurugram||Over 350 potholes on Golf Course Extension Road make life difficult for commuters||A 6km stretch of Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) — between Vatika Chowk and Faridabad Road — is riddled with at least 350 potholes, making this stretch risky for commuters and motorists, said the police. At least, six accidents have been reported on this stretch in the last two days. Two people were severely injured, after a motorcyclist lost control of his vehicle and rammed a jersey barrier on Saturday night, said police officials. According to police officials, this year 14 accidents have been reported so far on this stretch. In 2019, 46 accidents were reported. Most accidents involve two wheelers, said the police, adding that four people have died so far this year on the GECR. In 2019, a total of 16 people died, while in 2018, 14 fatalities were recorded. Commuters allege that the stretch is particularly unsafe for two-wheelers and is in the urgent need of repair. The traffic volume on the road is also high as many residential societies, corporate offices and high-end automobile showrooms are located on this stretch. A large number of commuters from Delhi and Faridabad also use this road to reach Sohna Road and other parts of the city. The road also has several junctions with traffic merging from various directions, such as sectors 56, 57, 49, 50, 51 and 61 and Gurugram-Faridabad Road.Commuters allege that, during peak hours, it takes around 20 minutes to cross the stretch due to the presence of the potholes. The road also serves as an important link for commuters travelling towards Delhi and Faridabad from the Golf Course Extension Road, the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and Sohna Road. Commuters say this stretch provides an easier access to Faridabad, Golf Course Road, MG Road, DLF Phase-1, Sector 54, Aya Nagar and Chattarpur in Delhi, and helps them to bypass other congested stretches of the city such as the Mehrauli-Gurugram (MG) Road and the Golf Course Road. According to safety experts, the presence of potholes, some of which are as large as three or four feet, coupled with lack of streetlights have added to the unsafety of the stretch.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based road safety expert, said, “Cities are focused on building more roads but maintaining the infrastructure of the existing roads should be the first priority. This is because inadequate maintenance often results in jeopardising the safety and security of road users. This is the exactly what the issue in Golf Course Extension Road is. Potholes and blind spots are leading to frequent accidents.”“This stretch houses some of the most high-end liquor stores, along with the swanky drinking places, called ahataas. It is risky to drive at night as the stretch is full of potholes and requires immediate repair,” said Nitin Sirohi, a senior MNC executive and a resident of Emaar Palm Drive. According to the police, most of the commuters drive at high speeds during the night, which often leads to accidents when motorists lose control of their vehicles. “Mostly, bikers suffer accidents as the potholes are not visible from a distance. Only daily commuters are aware of it,” said Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar). “We have asked the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials to repair the road as soon as possible. We have also deployed six constables on each side of the stretch, apart from the night patrolling team,” Yadav said. Commenting on the condition of the stretch, Aman Yadav , ACP, said the police had temporarily repaired the bigger potholes during water logging in August to evade accidents. “There are nearly 350 potholes on both sides of the stretch of various sizes. Some of them are dangerous and need urgent repair”, he saidWhen asked about the issue, GMDA officials said the repair work has slowed down because of the arrival of the monsoon season. However, they are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of commuters. The officials added that repair work will restart from Monday. GMDA is also working towards relaying the entire stretch of the road entirely. However, until then, it is carrying out temporary repair work, said officials.Jitender Mittal, executive engineer of GMDA, said that have allocated a tender of ₹40 lakh for repairing the potholes permanently. “Presently we are repairing potholes temporarily but due to heavy rainfall, the road gets damaged time and again.Starting Monday, we will repair all the existing potholes to ensure that commuters do not suffer while travelling on the stretch,” he said. Earlier in November 2018 and March 2019, GMDA carried out extensive repair work on the stretch. However, within a few months the potholes reappeared again, said officials. A road structure test recently carried out by the GMDA officials found out that the damage of the road was extensive.Work on filling up the potholes will be completed by the second week of September. However, officials added that this is only a temporary fix and the authority is working towards a more permanent solution. A tender has already been alloted for this purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-350-potholes-on-golf-course-extension-road-make-life-difficult-for-commuters/story-jTzKUBz5RFbO82uJHiv71H.html

07-09-2020||City||Noida: Plantations along Eastern Preipheral Expressway reviewed||Noida: Senior officials of the district forest department inspected the health of planted laid during plantation drives held last month in the city and reviewed the green patches along the expressway.Officials from the state forest department visited the sites along the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, and inspected the plants, planted by the forest department over a patch of five hectares there. Stating that the plantation and saplings of over nine species, all of them over seven to eight feet tall, were found in good health, officials suggested bringing elements such as landscaping and gardens in future plantations.“It was a routine inspection to inspect greenery along the expressways. While the plants were in good health and would take next four to five years to develop crowns and contribute to the green cover of the city, there could be some elements that should be added in the future,” said NK Janoo, chief conservator, state forest department, Meerut. The inspection was held by RK Garg, principal chief conservator of forest, Lucknow, and Janoo, along with officials from the district forest department. Officials said future plantations drives, especially those along the expressways, should be done keeping aesthetics in mind, with elements such as landscaping. “It had been recommended that in future, plantations should have elements like landscaping, Vatikas or traditional gardens like Nakshatra Vatika, Panchvati Vatika and Dhanvantari Vatika, etc. These are gardens with specific patterns of certain species of plants that are aseptically good and reflect traditional heritage. For instance, in Nakshatra Vatika, there are plant species associated with constellations. We need to see beyond regular plantations in the future,” said Janoo. Earlier in August, the district saw massive plantation drive where, as per official records, over 9,62,000 saplings were planted through the help of various staff, paramilitary and hired help.“The patch inspected was developed for green cover along the expressways. There are different green patches along the expressways as well as other parts of the city. The area inspected was of five hectares and had 17,800 saplings of species like Arjun, Kanji, Kadamb, Rosewood, Jamun, etc. As suggested by the head of the department, in future we will add elements such as Vatika and landscaping in our plantations,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. Of its total geographical area of 1,282 sq km, Gautam Budh Nagar has 19.99 sq km (1.56 percent) of the area under green cover, while Noida city has a total of five moderate dense forests, (density 70%-40 %), while 15 are open forest (39%-10% density).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-plantations-along-eastern-preipheral-expressway-reviewed/story-7PrUfyqjBBoQ7a2eW5DZuK.html

The police personnel purportedly entered the premises of the Sector 20 police station in their motorcycles in speed, as per the video which was shared on social media.The Noida traffic police said that they will identify the two policemen in question and issues fines for not wearing helmets and speeding.The video was shot sometime in the evening by a person who was driving a car in the same direction as the two motorcyclists in police uniform. In the footage, the two men are purportedly seen coming from taking a turn at the Rajnigandha Chowk after coming from Sector 16 and speeding towards the Sector 20 police station. The car driver also allegedly sped his car and captured the two men on the sports motorcycles entering the Sector 20 police station.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Traffic, said in the footage the motorcycles’ registration numbers are not clearly visible. “The identity of the two policemen and the man driving in his car (who shot the video) is not established yet. We will get the matter investigated and issue fines to the two policemen (for not wearing a helmet and speeding). We have found that the person who made the video was also speeding, and a fine will be issued to him as well,” he said. RK Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station, said that he had not received any information from anyone about the incident. “We will investigate the matter and take suitable action. We will find out who were the policemen, and why were they riding the motorcycles without wearing a helmet,” he said when HT reached out to him for comment. Meanwhile, the Noida traffic police also said it plans to put end to the two-wheeler race which takes place on the Yamuna Expressway. Saha said that a group of Delhi-based motorcyclists organise a race on the Yamuna Expressway every Sunday.On Sunday, teams of Noida traffic police personnel were deployed at DND Flyway, Noida Entry gate in Sector 14A, and also at Zero Point in Greater Noida. “The teams were stationed at the three spots from 7 am. The police stopped 15 motorcyclists and asked them about their purpose of coming to Noida. They said they were planning to go for a race on Yamuna Expressway. The police team counseled them and asked them to return as racing is not permitted on the expressway,” he said. The bikers agreed and returned, said the Saha.“We had received information about the planned race, and some good Samaritans had also shared photos of such bikers before. Racing on Yamuna Expressway is unsafe and hence we decided to check them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-noida-cops-ride-motorcycles-without-helmet-traffic-police-to-issue-fines/story-fD0MLRr4IZKoimkLOT19fO.html

NMRC officials said that all 21 Metro stations of Aqua Line will also have stalls where commuters can buy masks.“Passengers will not be allowed to enter without mask. If passengers are found unmasked, later on trains or at stations, they will be fined ₹500. Passengers found spitting inside metro stations, trains or any other metro premises will be fined ₹100 for the first offence and ₹500 for any subsequent occurrence,” said Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC.The penalties will be imposed strictly by the NMRC staff to prevent the Covid-19 spread, the officials said. However, NMRC has not planned any fine in case people break social distancing norms.As per current plan, NMRC will run trains from 7 am to 11 am and 5 pm to 9 pm with a frequency of 15 minutes from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, the services will be available from 8 am to 11 am and from 5 pm to 9 pm.On Sunday, NMRC held a detailed inspection of the Aqua Line to avoid any last-minute glitches in its operation. Senior NMRC officials travelled in a rail motor trolley to check the tracks and signalling from the Depot station in Greater Noida to Sector 51 station in Noida. Sharma said that NMRC is also spreading the message of using cashless ticketing options among its commuters. “NMRC currently has three ticketing options -- smart card, QR code generated by NMRC’s mobile app, and paper generated QR code purchased from the Metro stations. We are encouraging commuters to use the first two options as much as possible to help in minimising human contact,” she said. Passengers will be screened by thermal sensors at the entry gates. “People having high temperature or fever will not be allowed. Each station has been given some PPE kits. In case, commuters need any medical help, the metro staff will call the health department and get them admitted in the nearest hospital,” Sharma said. To ensure adequate social distance, markings for standing of passengers have been made at one metre spacing in frisking zones, and at ticket counters and platforms. NMRC has a fleet of 19 trains, each with four coaches. However, only eight trains will run from Monday, the officials said, adding that two trains will be in standby mode and others have been kept in reserve. According to the officials, only 50 passengers will be allowed in a coach from Monday. Normally, a coach can ferry 250 commuters – with sitting and standing capacity. Meanwhile, Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC, urged passengers to follow the guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government. “I request passengers to follow social distancing norms. They should not sit on the seats where prohibitory stickers are pasted. They should use cashless mode for tickets. They must wear mask while commuting in Metro,” she said.Around 300 personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC ) will be deployed for the security of all stations and trains. “Six personnel, including one sub-inspector rank official, will be deployed at each station. We will also make coordination with the city police and seek their help if there is a crowd,” said Kalpana Saxena, commandant of 49th battalion PAC. NMRC also provides free e-rickshaws to connect Aqua Line’s Sector 51 station to Blue Line’s Sector 52 station of Delhi Metro. An e-rickshaw will ferry a maximum of two persons in one trip, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-nmrc-to-fine-500-for-not-wearing-mask-at-metro-stations/story-wM0aDNlst9BaJ0iN4ThWuI.html

07-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Crawford market accident: Car was not in accused’s name||Investigation into the Crawford market crash, which left five dead, has revealed that the driver had purchased the car online for ₹28,000 did not have the registration certificate (RC) in his name. The car had been sold twice before the accused, Ali Ibrahim Sayyed alias Diggi, 46, bought it. Sources from regional transport office (RTO) said the original owner may face legal problem for not transferring the vehicle’s RC to Sayyed’s name.According to RTO rules, when an owner sells a motor vehicle (two-wheeler or car), it is important to get the RC and insurance policy transferred in the name of the buyer. If he fails to do so, the owner runs the risk of facing legal problems if the vehicle is involved in any accident or is used in any criminal activity.An officer from Pydhonie police station said the car used by Sayyed changed hands twice this year but none of the buyers transferred the car documents in their names.As per RTO record, the owner of the vehicle is still Jyoti Babaria, a Parel resident. Babaria sold it to one Taufuq Taj and his friend Sunny Rajput in January.Rajput, who works at a private hospital, said, “We (Taj and Rajput) were looking for a car to learn driving. We found this car on an online exchange site and purchased it from Babaria for ₹32,000 on January 9.”“As lockdown started in March, we were unable drive it and decided to sell it. We posted an online advertisement for the same and we got call from Diggi in June. We sold the car to him for ₹28,000,” Rajput added.An officer said, “Jyoti didn’t transfer the RC in Taj or Rajput’s name, and they have submitted evidence to show they sold the car.” In the accident earlier last week, five people lost their lives and three people sustained grave injuries. All the injured are undergoing treatment and are said to be stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-crawford-market-accident-car-was-not-in-accused-s-name/story-pIIO5umvt4a6yBwyp3hBEP.html
07-09-2020||City||Administration to hold meetings with DMRC officials for opening of metro stations in Ghaziabad||The Ghaziabad district administration will soon meet with officials from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) before the resumption of Metro services in the district on September 9 (Blue Line) and 10 (Red Line). The two authorities will decide on which of the 10 stations will be allowed to operate considering the prevalent Covid-19 situation.A point of discussion will likely be on the presence of containment zones.According to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) protocol, stations in containment zones will not be opened. Nearly all of the 10 stations in Ghaziabad are close to containment zones.Ghaziabad has 284 containment zones, according to the list on the district administration’s website. HT had earlier reported that these zones were not fully contained with many residents and ward councillors saying that there were no restrictions on movement of people. The Blue Line between Dwarka and Vaishali has two major metro stations in Ghaziabad -- Vaishal and Kaushambi that serves residents in Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Vaishali and Kaushambi, among others, that fall under the police stations of Kaushambi, Indirapuram and Link Road . According to the official figures, the three police station areas comprise about 31% of the containment zones in Ghaziabad with Indirapuram police station having 60, Kausambi 24 and Link Road five. Many residents under these police stations areas make use of two stations at Vaishali and Kaushambi. “It is a major challenge for local authorities in Ghaziabad to ensure that movement of people from containment zones is restricted as per norms. There is hardly any restriction on ground level nowadays. The only way of restricting people from containment zones from moving to metro network is to ensure strict enforcement is taken up in containment zones,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments RWA. The Red Line stations -- Shahid Nagar, Rajbagh, Shyam Park, Mohan Nagar, Arthala, Hindon and New Bus Stand -- are better placed as, unlike the Blue Line stations that are located very close to containment zones, these are further away and located on the median of the Grand Trunk Road. The police stations closest to the Red Line are Kotwali and Sahibabad that have only 27 containment zones under their jurisdiction. However, a lot depends on the enforcement of the containment strategies.Containment zones are areas where fresh Covid-19 cases emerge and strict perimeter control is enforced for a period of minimum of 14 days during which the movement of people, except for essential services, is restricted. “There are chances of spread of infection once people mix more and take up travel with any transport system including metro. The administration should take up enhanced screening and surveillance in containment zones and also spread more awareness. We are hopeful that metro will minutely screen passengers at stations. Finally, it is also up to residents to follow health protocols,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta declined comments over the issue. “The issue of closing/opening of stations with regard to containment zones will be discussed with the respective station in-charges of metro stations. We will soon be holding meeting with them over the issue and thereafter a decision will be taken up,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. A DMRC spokesperson did not offer any immediate comment over the issue but said that the list of stations (in Ghaziabad) which will be opened for operation will be issued in advance. An official in DMRC said that it will not be possible for them to check whether a passenger arriving at a station was from a containment zone or not. “We expect the local authorities to ensure residents in containment zones do not move out,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/administration-to-hold-meetings-with-dmrc-officials-for-opening-of-metro-stations-in-ghaziabad/story-Q4VjFA7O4CJ1Tm2biWbQVO.html

07-09-2020||Mumbai||Only 19% Indians willing to travel this festive season due to Covid-19, finds survey||Only 19% citizens are willing to travel this festive season (October-December), and of those who travel, only 23% are willing to commute by a flight, car or taxi, reveals a survey by a social media and community platform. The survey of 25,000 people from 239 districts of India, also stated that most people do not want to make their bookings till they get closer to their travel date.The survey conducted by LocalCircles, (a community social media platform that enables citizens to escalate issues for policy and enforcement interventions) revealed that 66% of their respondents were men while 34% respondents were women. 61% respondents were from tier-1 cities, 28% from tier-2 and 11% respondents were from tier-3 and 4 cities and rural districts.With Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath festival, all incidentally falling between October and November, people in many parts of India usually plan their travel back home or vacations during this time every year. However, this year seems to look drastically different due to Covid-19.When asked about the kind of travel they plan to undertake in the upcoming festive season, 69% respondents in the survey said that they will not be travelling this year and would stay at home, 3% said they will travel to a holiday destination, 13% said they will visit family and friends, while another 3% said they will do both. The remaining 12% said that they were unsure about what they would do and hence were yet to make a decision.Nishant Pitti, co-founder of EaseMyTrip said, “This year travel booking will be completely different unlike last year for the festive season. Currently people are not booking tickets in advance due to flight ticket prices being capped and uncertainty for refunds. Airlines like Vistara and GoAir have not refunded money to customers for tickets that were booked during the nationwide lockdown and have asked them to reuse the same money for travel later. As flight business is picking up, we feel that during festival times flights will get good responses as consumers think that airfares won’t increase due to cap on them.”Though India opened domestic air travel on May 25, daily Covid-19 cases have continued to rise during this period. The Unlock 4.0 came into effect on September 1 with relaxation in quarantine restrictions by most states, however, airline officials say that people are being cautious and unwilling to travel.MakeMyTrip, however, said that they have seen an increase in the number of flight searches for flights between metro to non-metro and metro to metro routes. Its spokesperson said, “As the festive season begins October onwards, people who could not travel back home in the earlier phases of the unlock –are now looking forward to visiting the home to celebrate festivities with their loved ones. We are already noticing an increase in searches for flights between metro to non-metro and metro to metro routes. Some of these routes include Bengaluru–Kolkata, Mumbai–Varanasi and Bangalore-Patna among others. However, as caseloads continue to rise in the country, the majority of travellers are preferring to book closer to the date of travel depending on various factors such as quarantine guidelines, number of cases in a particular state etc.”“With the recommencement of flight operations, the demand for domestic routes is picking up. We are witnessing more bookings being made for near future i.e., next two weeks. Popular metro and non-metro routes in demand include Patna, Varanasi, Lucknow and Bangalore. We can expect booking enquires to have a double-digit growth during the festive season of October-December this year,” said a spokesperson for Yatra company, a travel web portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-19-indians-willing-to-travel-this-festive-season-due-to-covid-19-finds-survey/story-VkbGbD1KviM04z4FcIJKgP.html

We are making arrangements for their accommodation till the time they do not get permanent citizenship. We are also providing them assistance in getting employment,” DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said. He added that all the cost would be borne by the management committee. He also thanked the Central government, particularly home minister Amit Shah, for facilitating visas for these families.“There are 138 persons in 31 rooms living over here. We are providing them with all the basic amenities. We will also try to have the children enrolled in Guru Harkishan Public Schools and will teach them free of cost if the need arises,” Harjit S Bedi, chief VC, gurdwara, Motibagh, said.Bedi said that the persons could stay in the gurdwara for as long as they need to. “In the case of earning bread and butter, they need to be emotionally secure. In the case of residential, they are secure over here,” he added.Balbir Singh, 63, one of the Afghan Sikhs who along with his family were brought here by the Union government following attacks faced by minorities in the country, said that he was grateful to the gurdwara for looking after him and his family.“We left everything, including our houses in Afghanistan. Our lives were in danger, but now, we feel safe here,” he added.The ministry of external affairs recently announced that India has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India.The decision comes after a terror attack at a gurdwara in Kabul’s Shor Bazaar in March killed at least 25 members of the community.Once a community of nearly 250,000 people, the Sikh and Hindu community in Afghanistan has endured years of discrimination and violence from extremists, and the community is now estimated to comprise fewer than 100 families across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/200-afghan-sikh-families-put-up-in-gurdwaras-across-delhi/story-Shz4zNlOL5HCLWuzMaa2NO.html

The family, from Nahacha Khadak village, decided to undergo rapid antigen tests after the result of one of their neighbours came positive on Saturday morning. The girl’s father went to the zilla parishad’s lab testing centre to inquire about the process. As he was asked to take an appointment for the tests, the girl’s father registered the names of his family members and left. In the evening, the family received a call from the centre to inform them that the girl was Covid-positive. They then immediately informed the authorities concerned that she never underwent testing. During inquiry, the authorities learnt that the lab technician at the centre had used the empty vial with the girl’s name to store samples of another person. S Bansode, Murbad’s medical officer, said, “Most of our staff have tested positive for the virus and we are short-staffed. The person on duty registered the names of those who had to undergo tests at a later slot directly on the vials instead of writing them in the register. He first stuck the name stickers on the vials and then added the samples when the patients visited the centre. This caused a lot of confusion as the samples were misplaced or put in wrong vials. Some other patient’s samples were added to the vial with the girl’s name.” Bansode said that the lab in-charge has been transferred with immediate effect after the incident came to light. The girl’s father, aged 42, said, “A lab employee was taking down the names of everyone who wanted to take the test and allotting time slots. I was asked to come at 4pm and he took the names of my family members who had to undergo the test. We could not go on Saturday and decided to go on Monday instead, as none of us had any symptoms. But on Saturday evening, we got a call from the lab saying that my 10-year-old daughter had tested positive and an ambulance would be coming to our home to take her to a Covid-19 facility.” The family panicked after the call as their daughter never got tested. “I immediately called the local medical officer and informed them about the incident. He promised to investigate the matter and we were later told that the lab had made a mistake,” the girl’s father said. Murbad, a small town about 50km from Thane, had begun to witness a sudden spike in Covid cases after Ganeshotsav, following which the local governing body has initiated antigen testing at the centre. Until August 22 (Ganesh Chaturthi), there were 478 cases. However, as locals came together for the festivities, the figures surged, said authorities. In the past 10 days, the cases rose to 679. At least 60 to 80 tests are conducted every day in the village, of which 25 to 30 come positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lab-says-result-of-10-year-old-from-thane-district-came-positive-for-covid-her-family-says-she-didn-t-take-the-test/story-wQH4OBZr2Rt0RrphzJIhtM.html

After the family in Modinagar alerted the medical college, Meerut district magistrate Anil Dhingra initiated an inquiry, which will be fast tracked and a report submitted by Monday. A number of district administration officials and health department officials were also dispatched to probe the incident. The Modinagar resident was identified as Gurbachan Lal, 85, while the Kankarkhera resident was identified as Yash Pal, 55. Dr Raj Kumar, chief medical officer of Meerut confirmed that both had died on Saturday and were Covid-19 positive patients. “My father was admitted to a private hospital in Meerut and he was diagnosed as Covid-19 positive. From there, he was referred to the medical college at Meerut. On Saturday, we got a call from the medical college that my father had succumbed. We reached the hospital and brought the body. On Sunday, when the funeral was about to start , we opened the body bag for one last time, only to figure out that it was someone else’s body,” said Naresh Kumar, Lal’s son. “The documents attached with the body mentioned the correct name and address, but the body in the bag was of someone else. We were shocked. We immediately called up the staff at Meerut Medical College and mentioned about the gaffe. The staff, instead of admitting their mistake, questioned us as to why we opened the bag. We then decided to call up senior officials and brought the incident to their notice. They admitted their mistake,” he added. The family said they were distraught as they could not see Lal for one last time. They also came to know that body that had gone family in Meerut, who had performed the funeral by then. “We acknowledge that the bodies got swapped due to the alleged negligence on part of our staff. I received the preliminary inquiry report on Sunday evening in which it has been mentioned that there was laxity on part of one nurse and she has been removed from duty and attached to another department. The final report of the inquiry committee will be received on Monday. We will take strict action against anyone found who is found negligent,” said Dr Gyanendra Singh, principal of LLRMMC. He also confirmed that the funeral of Lal had been performed by the other family in Meerut, by the time authorities were alee\rted.. “Our officers spoke to both the families. The body with the family in Modinagar was brought to Meerut where the actual family then performed the funeral. The ashes of the deceased from Modinagar were handed over to his family . It is a serious lapse and should not have happened,” he added. Ajay Tiwari, additional district magistrate (city) at Meerut, said that an inquiry has been initiated on directions of the district magistrate. “The complete report of the inquiry committee has been sought on Monday. We are ensuring a transparent probe and it is being done by senior officers of the non-Covid wing of the hospital along with officials of the involving district administration officers,” he said. As per the initial findings, the goof up took place as the slips/tags attached to the bodies got exchanged somehow and the bodies were sent to Modinagar and Meerut in bags along with the incorrect slips, said officials from the health department at Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bodies-of-covid-19-victims-swapped-at-meerut-medical-college-probe-ordered/story-bH7QqUD5pU9HG7W68uSD0K.html

07-09-2020||City||Mumbai civic body says despite relaxing rules, citizens still don’t get tested for Covid-19 on their own||Two months after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) allowed anybody to get tested for Covid without a prescription, the civic body said it was challenging to get citizens to do a test on their own. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in its revised testing advisory to states on Saturday, too paved the way for walk-in tests. Starting July 7, BMC relaxed the testing norms, removing the clause that made prescription from a registered medical practitioner mandatory. BMC officials, however, claimed the number of people getting tested in private laboratories on their own is not substantial.The civic body has been under pressure to increase the number of tests being undertaken daily to get an accurate estimate of the spread of the infection. According to BMC officials, nearly 60-70% of the patients, who test positive for Covid-19, are found through their contact-tracing efforts. So far, BMC has not segregated data on those who have got tested on their own and those tested by the civic body. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal told HT, “People are reluctant, and many are not ready to take the test. This is a big challenge and a major hurdle too. However, we have been taking all measures to increase testing by organising camps and door-to-door screening. I have also set targets for ward officers.” Chahal added, “On Saturday, we did around 12,000 tests and this was one of the highest single-day testing until now. We have conducted testing of more than 8 lakh samples, and maximum are by using the RT-PCR method.”“Till now, around 90,000 tests have been conducted using the rapid antigen kits,” he said. In the past five months, BMC has traced over 20 lakh citizens, which includes both high- and low-risk contacts. As of Friday, BMC had conducted 8.13 lakh tests. The one-lakh-test mark was crossed on May 6, two lakh on June 1, three lakh on June 24, four lakh on July 14, five lakh on July 29, six lakh on August 9, seven lakh on August 22 and eight lakh on September 03. Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant from Mumbai, said, “There will be some reluctance or opposition from citizens over getting tested for Covid-19, and this is solely out of fear. But the authorities had to relax the testing guidelines, which has been done now in case of ICMR. Also, the authorities need to ensure they reach out to maximum citizens in a focused manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-says-despite-relaxing-rules-citizens-still-don-t-get-tested-for-covid-19-on-their-own/story-iLJLHZeveixcakwriZ8WyJ.html
07-09-2020||City||With Covid-19 on priority, Ghaziabad’s focus off other seasonal diseases||Cases of seasonal diseases such as typhoid, malaria, dengue and swine flu, commonly reported from the district during the monsoon and the months after, have come down drastically in eight months of the current years as compared to the same period in 2018 and 2019. The health department records reveal that there were 637 cases overall of dengue, malaria, swine flu and typhoid in the first eight months of 2018. The figure shot up to 1,722 during the same period in 2019, but in 2020, only 88 such cases were reported so far. Officials of the district health department attributed the fall in numbers to regular sanitisation and fogging drives, as well as restricted movement of people during the lockdown months from March to June. The health department data for 2020 stated that there were only three cases of swine flu and 66 cases of typhoid in the month of January and no case of either disease in the seven months since then. But, upon further enquiries about the number of samples tested for the four ailments, district malaria officer GK Mishra provided data of six more cases of dengue and 13 more cases of malaria, but did not specify the month. The overall figure, accordingly, stood at 88 for the eight months in 2020. “Extensive sanitisation, anti-larvae and fogging activities have been taken up and these have resulted in fewer cases. The anti-larvae treatment is taken up regularly while fogging drives took place in March and April and will resume in September. Regular chlorination is also taken up which helped in reducing cases of typhoid, a water-borne disease,” Mishra said. According to records kept by the district fire department, the sanitisation activities started from April 2 in order to check spread of Covid-19. “Since then, we have taken up sanitisation of about 5,200 places which include 487 Covid hot spots, 923 market places, 1,355 high-rises and residential areas and about 2,350 other public places such as bus stands, banks, police posts and police stations. This activity has also helped in keeping a check on other infectious diseases,” Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer, said. Medical experts, however, raised questions over the low count of dengue, swine flu, malaria and typhoid during the current year. “The figures are very less when compared to previous years and it is unlikely that typhoid and malaria cases have drastically reduced this year. Either the testing was low or cases went unreported as health care workers were busy dealing with Covid-19. We can say that may be, an “outbreak” of swine flu and dengue has not happened so far this year,” Dr VB Jindal, president, Indian Medical Association, said. “But cases of malaria and typhoid have been reported to private hospitals although in fewer numbers,” he said. Dr Gyan Bharti, consultant, internal medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital in Ghaziabad, said, “Since everyone is focussed on Covid-19, people have also adopted better hygiene habits such as frequent washing of hands, use of sanitisers and masks etc. Also, the movement of people was restricted during the lockdown, which meant less physical interactions. All these factors may have helped reduce the number of infections but we cannot say that cases have stopped coming in,” said “In August alone, we had 10-12 patients diagnosed with dengue and another two or three patients with typhoid. So, the overall figures in the district could be higher ,” he said. Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, admitted that there was less focus on other diseases owing to Covid-19 activities which are ongoing. “The reduced number for seasonal diseases could be result of lower testing. These four diseases are common in the district but numbers seem fewer as our focus is on Covid-19. I have directed the health department to ramp up testing of the four ailments as they may prove life-threatening if treatment is delayed. I have directed that all patients of severe acute respiratory illness be tested for H1N1 (swine flu) as well as Covid-19 as symptoms are similar for these diseases,” he said. “The cases have started coming in and six cases of dengue and 13 of malaria were reported in the past couple of days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-covid-19-on-priority-ghaziabad-s-focus-off-other-seasonal-diseases/story-VecU1bU7auInBXDizxuiuI.html

07-09-2020||Mumbai||Class 10, 12 supplementary exams may be postponed: Maharashtra education department||The state education department is likely to push the supplementary exams for Class 10 and 12 students to November, considering the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state and the resultant lockdown. While the department is yet to come up with a circular to that effect, officials said that a postponement is likely. “While the earlier plan was to conduct these exams in October, it is being reconsidered given the ongoing pandemic. With cases in the state growing, it might not be safe to conduct the exams soon. Discussions are on to see if they can be conducted post the Diwali break in November,” said an official from the education department. In August, as per a letter sent to the secretaries of all divisional boards, the Maharashtra State Board has proposed to hold supplementary exams from October 6 to 23. The proposed schedule for Class 12 exams was October 6 to 29. However, till date, the board has not made any official announcement regarding the issue. “A decision will be announced soon,” said a board official.Every year, the state board allows students who have failed to clear their Class 10 and 12 board exams, to appear for supplementary exams, which are held in July. The results of these exams are declared in August and students who pass can join junior colleges in the same academic year. The move is to ensure that students do not lose out on a year. However, this year, due to the delay in declaring board results due to the Covid-19 situation, these exams have not been announced so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/class-10-12-supplementary-exams-may-be-postponed-maharashtra-education-department/story-4Sp0Xdqwhjto1IS0fHv5pJ.html

07-09-2020||Mumbai||Awaiting Maharashtra government policy for final-year exams: MUHS tells Bombay HC||The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it is awaiting the policy of the state government for conducting final-year exams of postgraduate medical students after a student approached the HC seeking directions to the authorities to declare dates and conduct final-year exams of MD and MS courses. The state on Thursday informed the court that as students and examiners were involved in Covid duties, a policy was being framed to ensure that the future of the students did not suffer.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice VG Bisht while hearing a petition filed by Dr Nishant Gabbur through video conferencing was informed by advocates Vishwanath Patil and Kewal Ahya that Gabbur, who is from Akkalkot, Solapur and is pursuing MS (general surgery) at Seth GS Medical College in Mumbai, had appeared for the entrance test held for DM/MCh conducted by the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh on June 21. Patil submitted that Gabbur had stood second in all India ranking in general category for neurosurgery and had been granted a provisional appointment/ admission letter by the institute on June 30. After Gabbur informed the institute that he was facing a difficulty in joining the course, it allowed him to join by July 6.Patil further submitted that Gabbur and another student Ajinkya Rewatkar who had secured a seat in AIIMS, Delhi for MCh Neurosurgery wrote to MUHS seeking to secure their future, but as there was no response Gabbur was left with no option but to approach the HC. “The petitioner is caught in a dilemma and a situation beyond his control as the MUHS has decided to postpone graduate and PG examinations that were scheduled on June 18. MUHS has not resolved the situation, thereby hanging the career of petitioner at jeopardy with risk of losing one precious year and the entire process of preparation and reappearing for entrance tests.”Patil submitted that there were hundreds of postgraduate medical students like Gabbur who were placed in a similar situation, and hence the court should issue directions to MUHS to ensure that the future of such students was secured.Assistant government pleader Jyoti Chavan submitted that as postgraduate students were involved in Covid-19 duties, the government was framing a policy for conducting final-year exams for them and meetings are being held for the same. Chavan then sought time on the grounds that the process involved preparation of schedule ensuring that all safety norms were adhered to and said the state would inform the court about it in the next hearing.After hearing the submissions the court observed that all steps taken by MUHS and PGIMER would be bound by the decision of the court and posted the matter for hearing on July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/awaiting-maharashtra-government-policy-for-final-year-exams-muhs-tells-bombay-hc/story-XH6BpXjdBD35134kGONuuO.html
07-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid patients aged between 50 and 60 can be in home quarantine in Mumbai, says BMC||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s decision to mandate institutional quarantine for Covid-19 patients above the age of 50 drew criticism, the decision has now been revoked. Patients in the age group of 50-60 can be permitted home quarantine. However, the earlier decision to institutionally quarantine patients over the age of 60 will still prevail. The decision was made in a state review meeting headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday.“A circular regarding the amendment in quarantine rules will be issued in a day or two,” said a senior civic official.A circular issued by BMC’s health department on August 20 said that Covid-19 patients over 50 or anyone with co-morbidities, irrespective of their age, will now have to go to Covid care centre-2 facilities (institutional quarantine) for treatment and isolation. Till then, the earlier guidelines allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients below 60 with no co-morbidities and those having separate toilet facilities in their homes.However, the amendment to the earlier guideline led to criticism as patients above 50 who showed no symptoms and could have been home quarantined still had to be admitted to institutional quarantine. This issue was brought up in the state review meeting wherein directions to revoke the quarantine rules were given.Even though the decision has been revoked, BMC has now decided to consult the family physicians of patients above 50 who test positive. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Our ward war rooms will now collect additional details from these patients about their family physicians who will be consulted with on a daily basis. Patients over 50 will be institutionally quarantined after their family doctors opine or if their condition worsens.”Kakani added that this is to ensure that the patients over 50 get immediate medical attention when needed.Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants, said, “I am yet to see the circular. However, the BMC needs to appoint health professionals to check on patients above 50 years of age. Patients should also be given pulse oximeters and their readings should be checked twice every day. A lot of health resources, such as beds, would be saved [more severe patients] if BMC invests in oximeters.”Meanwhile on Sunday, Mumbai reported 1,910 Covid-19 cases, following which the total tally reached 155,622. Of these, 23,939 are active cases. The death toll stands at 7,869 after 37 new deaths were reported. As per BMC’s data, of the 37 deaths, 10 were of patients between 40 and 60 years, while the remaining 27 patients who died were above 60 years of age. The case fatality ratio of the city is 5%, while the recovery rate stands at 79%. The fatality rate of Mumbai is way above the national mortality rate of 1.8% and Maharashtra’s average mortality rate of 2.97%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/patients-in-mumbai-aged-between-50-and-60-years-can-be-in-home-quarantine-says-municipal-corporation/story-ORulbuHbEsosm7vodvHvzJ.html

Sena has been miffed with Ranaut after she said that Mumbai feels like Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). On Sunday, Ranaut also posted a video on Twitter stating that she will come to Mumbai on September 9, despite receiving threats. “In a country where women are being tortured and raped every day, a parliamentarian using such language shows this society’s mentality. No one called Aamir Khan or Naseeruddin Shah ‘haramkhor’ when they said that they are scared of living in this country,” she said in her video. Ranaut’s comments about Mumbai and the city police had sparked political outbursts and controversy on Friday, with the parties in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) slamming the actor. State home minister Anil Deshmukh had also said that Ranaut does not have any right to stay in Mumbai or Maharashtra. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also been forced to distance itself from the actor’s remarks and said they do not support her statements made against the city or the state. Ranaut had reacted by posting a series of tweets challenging the state government to try and stop her and referring to the MVA as the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/let-kangana-ranaut-apologise-to-mumbai-and-maharashtra-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-on-his-haramkhor-comment/story-axoe0wGPbrMdBfMt4pOZbL.html

As per vigilance officials, the racket has brought to the fore the rampant corruption in the excise department as it involves a number of officers who are allegedly taking monthly bribes from businessmen and transporters for ferrying goods in and out of the state without paying the goods and services tax (GST). The bureau had registered an FIR in the case on August 21 after the arrest of six persons, including four excise officers. The VB has now added seven more names to the FIR, as per the documents accessed by HT.

With these fresh FIRs, half of the 16-member mobile wing of the excise department --- that is responsible for tracking GST evasion --- has been booked. Many more are under the VB lens. “The racket is widespread. We suspect involvement of many officials. A raid at a house of an AETC in Pathankot left vigilance officials in a tizzy. The palatial house had imported wood and marble. The bungalow of AETC Bajwa had a climate-control swimming pool. An AETC from Patiala, who is under arrest has invested money in Canada ,” said a VB official, who is part of the probe, pleading anonymity. “During custodial interrogation, an ETO told us that all ETOs used to give Rs 25,000 per month to the DETC,” said another VB official, who did not want to be named. “We have proposed to open disproportionate assets case against most accused,” said officials.

Rhea was allowed to leave the NCB office around 6.15pm. Meanwhile, NCB arrested ninth person, Khar resident Anuj Keshwani, in the case on Sunday. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14, leading to doubts about whether it was a suicide. His father, KK Singh, filed an FIR with the Bihar Police, alleging abetment and suspicious money transfers. The arrests of two drug peddlers on a specific input led NCB to Rhea’s brother Showik, bringing in the drug angle. Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB, said, “The investigation has not been completed due to her late arrival. We will summon her again tomorrow and the investigation will continue.” Also read: Taapsee Pannu, Swara Bhasker react to Rhea Chakraborty being mobbed at NCB office: ‘Witness our lowest, shameful witch hunt’Rhea’s advocate and senior counsel Satish Maneshinde said, “Rhea is ready for arrest as this is a witch hunt and if loving someone is a crime, she will face the consequences of her love. Being innocent, she has not approached any court for anticipatory bail in all the cases foisted by Bihar Police, now with CBI, ED and NCB.” Meanwhile, Keshwani was arrested for allegedly supplying drugs to Kaizan Ebrahim, who was arrested on Friday. “During interrogation, Ebrahim confessed that he used to buy drugs from Keshwani,” said KPS Malhotra, deputy director of NCB. In the search at Keshwani’s residence, officials seized 590gm of hashish, 0.64gm of LSD sheets, 304gm of marijuana, including imported marijuana joints and capsules, and ₹1,85,200 and 5000 Indonesian rupiah. “The quantity can be termed commercial under the NDPS Act,” said an official.

He has been remanded in NCB custody till September 9. NCB on Friday arrested Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, and two Bandra residents and drug peddlers – Abdel Basit Parihar, 23, and Ebrahim. The other three arrested for drug peddling are Zaid Vilatra, 20 (arrested on Thursday), Abbas Lakhani, and Karan Arora (arrested on August 27-28). NCB officials told the court they wanted Sawant’s custody to confront him with other suspects, including Showik, Miranda and Vilatra. According to NCB officers, on March 17, on Showik’s instructions, Sawant went with Miranda to get 5gm of marijuana from Vilatra. On April 17, Rhea and Showik instructed Sawant to receive a delivery of 10gm of hashish from Ebrahim near Mont Blanc building, said NCB officials. On May 1, Showik had reportedly asked him to receive marijuana from a person named Dwayne, and had received 50gm of marijuana from Dwayne on May 2. NCB officers claimed that in the first week of June, Sawant received 100gm of marijuana from a delivery boy, Rishikesh Pawar. However, Sawant’s lawyer Rajendra Rathod argued that he was just an employee of Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-rhea-chakraborty-quizzed-for-six-hours-by-narcotics-control-bureau/story-KF28XKOSn3eL00QoyQ789O.html

Students of IIT-Madras are among the worst-affected, as almost eight companies withdrew as many as 28 job offers during the lockdown. “Several companies also ended up postponing the date of joining for many other students,” said Professor CS Shankar Ram, advisor (training & placement), IIT-Madras. At IIT-Bombay, 22 students lost the job offers made to them during the placement drives. “Some of these students have secured employment elsewhere and steps are being taken to reemploy them in other companies,” BV Ravi Shankar, training and placement officer, IIT-Bombay, said. At IIT-Mandi and IIT-Roorkee, only one company each pulled back the job offers made. Only one student lost the job in IIT-Mandi but at IIT-Guwahati, three students’ job offers were revoked during the lockdown. A senior official from IIT-Delhi confirmed that the number of job offers being revoked by companies this year were in two digit numbers. While some other IITs refused to divulge the exact details on the number of job offers revoked, they confirmed that their respective placement cells are working on ensuring that affected students are helped with other job offers in the second phase of placements. Meanwhile, deferred joining dates by employers have also added to students’ woes. “The pandemic has affected the joining date of several students. Usually, the graduating students from IIT-Mandi join companies in July. But this year, with a slight delay in the final semester completion, the joining date was postponed to August for most offers. A few companies also deferred the joining date to January 2021. We are in touch with the companies and are confident that our students will join them by January,” said Dr Sunny Zafar, advisor (career and placement cell), IIT-Mandi. “Given that the pandemic has hit the country’s economy and that some companies have withdrawn offers, there is a lot of anxiety on whether my recruiter will make good on the promise,” said a student from IIT-Bombay, whose joining date has been deferred. Vinayak Narayan Kulkarni, head (centre for career development), IIT-Guwahati, said that owing to the extended lockdown, several recruiters have requested students to start work in virtual mode for the time being. While most IITs recorded a notable increase in offers received during the first phase of placement drives in December 2019, the second phase that kicked off in January has not been very successful. At IIT-Bombay, 1,171 students were placed in the first phase — the highest in the past couple of years. In comparison, only 36 students were placed in the second phase. “The second phase was impacted due to Covid-19. We have conducted more interviews online this year due to pandemic and fewer selections were possible,” said Shankar. Keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation, almost all IITs are planning to conduct placement drives virtually this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indian-institutes-of-technology-students-stare-at-uncertain-times-firms-withdraw-job-offers-defer-joining-dates/story-yXkJYLPW1b6JCpuG11AzMK.html

Among the seven detained is the wife of one of the dead attackers and the two brothers of another. Jbabli said that a preliminary investigation showed that the attackers had developed online links with foreign networks to find out how to make explosives.Sousse was the site of Tunisia’s deadliest extremist attack in 2015, when a massacre killed 38 people, most of them British tourists. That attack dealt a heavy blow to Tunisia’s tourism sector, a pillar of the North African nation’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tunisia-arrests-7-suspects-after-deadly-weekend-attack/story-V2WOCRngbfrYO3KJzaV5BO.html
07-09-2020||World||Putin critic Navalny has come out of coma: Berlin hospital||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been removed from a medically induced coma and is responding to speech, Berlin’s Charite hospital said on Monday.The hospital, which has been treating Navalny since he was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month, said his condition has improved and he is being weaned off mechanical ventilation.“It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,” Charite said in a statement.Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. It made an emergency landing in Omsk so that Navalny could be stretchered off.Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her government has concluded Navalny, 44, was poisoned with Novichok, the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018.Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.The incident has put the future of Germany’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Russia in doubt as a growing number of polticians call for support for the project to be withdrawn unless Russia helps to clear up the circumstances around Navalny’s poisioning.Merkel’s spokesman said on Monday she does not rule out imposing sanctions on the pipeline in response to the suspected poisoning.Novichok is a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.Britain says Russia used Novichok to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the city of Salisbury two years ago. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack, which the Skripals survived. A member of the public was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-critic-navalny-has-come-out-of-coma-berlin-hospital/story-VUpWJ7pRRy93ZmIH0jggDI.html
07-09-2020||World||Greece to boost military amid tension with neighbour Turkey||Greece will be bolstering its military with new armament programmes, a boost to military personnel and the development of the country’s defence industry, the government spokesman said Monday, as a tense stand-off with neighbouring Turkey has led to concerns of open conflict between the two NATO allies.Ankara is currently facing off against Greece and Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece and Turkey have deployed naval and air forces to assert their competing claims in the region.“The Turkish leadership is unleashing, on a near daily basis, threats of war and makes provocative statements against Greece,” Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said. “We respond with political, diplomatic and operational readiness, determined to do whatever is necessary to protect our sovereign rights.” Petsas said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis would be announcing details of plans to upgrade the country’s military, during his annual state of the economy speech on Saturday.“We are in contact with friendly countries in order to reinforce the equipment of our armed forces,” Petsas said. Last week, Greece raised 2.5 billion euros (USD 2.96 billion) in a bond auction as the country seeks to increase military spending and raise funds for businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Greek media have reported the purchases may include French-made Rafale fighter jets and at least one French frigate. Petsas said Mitsotakis would be meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday on the sidelines of a meeting in Corsica of European Union Mediterranean countries.Last Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Greece to enter talks over disputed eastern Mediterranean territorial claims or face the consequences.“They’re either going to understand the language of politics and diplomacy, or in the field with painful experiences,” he said.Greece and Turkey have come to the brink of war three times since the mid-1970s, including once over exploration rights in the Aegean Sea.The current dispute escalated when Turkey sent seismic research vessel Oruc Reis, accompanied by warships, to prospect for oil and gas reserves in an area between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete that Athens claims as its own continental shelf.Greece sent its own warships to the area and put its armed forces on alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-to-boost-military-amid-tension-with-neighbour-turkey/story-3ZLeJcX5fK8PypgI6qPyrN.html
07-09-2020||World||Afghan negotiators wait in Kabul as start of peace talks faces delays: Reports||Afghan negotiators have pushed back a planned trip to Doha for long-awaited peace talks with the Taliban as logistical issues are still being worked on in the Qatari capital, delaying the start of the talks, a government and a diplomatic source said on Monday.After months of delays largely due to a disagreement over prisoner demands by the insurgent Taliban, a government decision to set most prisoners free last week led the major players involved to expect talks would finally begin.Negotiators had initially expected to fly to Doha late last week in anticipation of talks starting as soon as Monday.However the team would not leave on Monday, one government and one diplomatic source told Reuters.One of the sources, a senior government official, said the negotiating team may fly on Tuesday.He added that the cause of the delay was partly due to the Taliban and officials in Doha sorting out final logistical questions over the opening ceremony, including who should be given time to speak and how flags should be arranged.These matters carry symbolic weight for the two sides, each of whom have questioned each other’s legitimacy to present themselves as governing powers.The second issue was finalising plans for around six prisoners to leave Afghan prisons and be transferred to Qatar, in a compromise struck with the Taliban last week, the two sources said. Western governments have objected to their release. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that there were no “major issues” causing the delay, adding that they were waiting for the six prisoners to be released, but technical teams from both sides were working on the issue.Major players including United States Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has helped usher the talks since Washington signed a troop withdrawal pact with the Taliban in February, are also in Doha in advance of the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-negotiators-wait-in-kabul-as-start-of-peace-talks-faces-delays-reports/story-jxEm99TSP1DRpXYh2h8DhM.html
07-09-2020||World||Belarus activist goes missing, colleagues fear detention||A leading opposition activist and several other members of an opposition council in Belarus went missing Monday and their colleagues feared they were detained as part of the authorities’ efforts to squelch nearly a month of protests against the re-election of the country’s authoritarian leader.Maria Kolesnikova, a member of the Coordination Council created by the opposition to facilitate talks with President Alexander Lukashenko on a transition of power, was reportedly put on a minibus in the capital, Minsk, and driven away by unidentified people.Her disappearance follows a massive rally Sunday that drew an estimated 100,000 protesters pushing for the resignation of Lukashenko, who extended his 26-year rule in the Aug. 9 election that the opposition sees as rigged.A council member, Maxim Znak, said Kolesnikova’s colleagues fear she was detained. Two other members of the council also couldn’t be reached on Monday, according to Znak.Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted that Kolesnikova’s disappearance is part of the Belarusian authorities’ effort to “cynically eliminate one by one” and called for her immediate release.The Belarusian Interior Ministry said it hasn’t detained Kolesnikova, while other law enforcement agencies have kept mum.After a brutal crackdown in the first few days after the vote that stoked international outrage and swelled the ranks of protesters, the authorities have switched to threats and selective arrests of opposition activists and demonstrators.Sunday’s demonstrations in Minsk and other cities went on despite the authorities’ warning that participants could face reprisals. The Interior Ministry said 633 people were detained Sunday for taking part in unsanctioned protests.Targeting the protest leaders, Belarusian prosecutors have opened a criminal probe of the Coordination Council that opposition activists set up after the election to try to negotiate a transition of power. Two of its members were given 10-day jail sentences on charges of staging unsanctioned protests last week. One of them, Olga Kovalkova, said she was pressured to leave for Poland over the weekend after being threatened with a longer jail term.Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger in the election, who moved to Lithuania a day after the vote under pressure from authorities, said Monday that Kolesnikova’s disappearance marked another attempt by the government to intimidate the opposition.“It’s an attempt to derail the work of the Coordination Council, but we will not be stopped,” she said. “The more they try to scare us, the more people will take to the streets. We will continue our struggle and push for the release of all political prisoners and a new, fair election.” Last week, Kolesnikova announced the creation of a new party, Together.She said the move will help overcome the current crisis, but the party founders’ call for constitutional changes has stunned some other opposition council members, who argued that it could divert attention from the main goal of pushing for Lukashenko to step down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-activist-goes-missing-colleagues-fear-detention/story-v5ximYjAVvTZYgS0v2bPeO.html
07-09-2020||World||Journalists for US media face possible expulsion from China||China is delaying the renewal of press cards for at least five journalists working at four US media outlets, an organisation of foreign correspondents said on Monday, making them vulnerable to expulsion in apparent retribution for Washington’s targeting of Chinese reporters working in the United States.China’s foreign ministry responded by saying applications for renewal were being processed and those reporters involved would not have their lives in China “affected in any way”. However, ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian also accused the US of being “arrogant and unreasonable” in talks about the matter and “not addressing China’s normal and reasonable concerns and demands at all”.“If the U.S. government truly cares about American journalists, it should extend visas for all Chinese journalists as soon as possible, instead of taking journalists from the two countries as hostages for the certain politicians’ political interests,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.Atlanta-based CNN said its China correspondent was among those given a letter authorizing him to continue reporting for the next two months instead of the usual one-year press card.He was told the move was unrelated to his reporting but was merely a reciprocal measure in response to the actions of the Trump administration toward Chinese media, making it the latest manifestation of the deteriorating state of US-China relations that have fallen to their lowest level in decades.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China, or FCCC, said The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have also been targeted. It did not name the fourth outlet, but said more foreign journalists are expected to receive similar treatment. While the targeted outlets are all American, the journalists involved are of various nationalities.Zhao did not say what future actions China might take, but said “all the options are on the table, and the US side knows that very well”.“If the US insists on going down the wrong path and continuously making mistakes, China will have to make the necessary and legitimate responses to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights,” he said.China’s move comes after the US capped the number of Chinese citizens who could be employed by Chinese media outlets and placed them on 90-day visas. China first responded in March by expelling reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Those affected have been both US and non-US citizens.Official press cards are used to obtain residency permits usually good for one year, while the letters issued by the Chinese foreign ministry “could be revoked at any time, thus putting (the journalists) at constant threat of expulsion,” the FCCC said in a statement.The US moves were fed by complaints that Chinese journalists working for state media acted more as propagandists and agents for the Communist Party than as genuine reporters. The US had already required those outlets to register as foreign entities with the US, similar to consulates and embassies.They also come against the backdrop of worsening US-China relations on a range of issues, including human rights, trade, technology, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Chinese treatment of its Muslim minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.Relations hit a new low in July when the US ordered China to close its consulate in Houston and China demanded the shuttering of the US mission in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Beijing’s latest actions have “turned accredited foreign journalists in China into pawns in a wider diplomatic conflict,” the FCCC statement said, calling on Beijing to “halt this cycle of tit-for-tat reprisals in what is quickly becoming the darkest year yet for media freedoms”.A record 17 foreign journalists were expelled from China in the first half of this year alone by having their press credentials withdrawn, while others have had their residency permits shortened to as little as one month, the club said.The FCCC has also documented increasing harassment and surveillance of foreign journalists in China, including physical assault and cyberattacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-for-us-media-face-possible-expulsion-from-china/story-XVDF48zU6WcLpWlzOZ9rXJ.html
07-09-2020||World||China dismisses New Delhi’s concerns over 5 missing Indians in Arunachal Pradesh||China on Monday shrugged off the Indian army’s concern over five missing civilians in Arunachal Pradesh, saying Beijing has never recognised the state which it claims is part of south Tibet.The Indian army had asked China over the weekend whether the missing Indians were in the custody of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“China’s position on the eastern section of the China and India boundary and China’s southern Tibet is consistent and clear. We have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established on the Chinese territory,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said Monday at the regular ministry briefing.“Regarding the specifics, you mentioned I am not aware of it now,” Zhao said responding to a query about the missing Indians. The Indian Army had contacted its Chinese counterpart about the five missing civilians, who were engaged as guides and porters by the Indian army in the Upper Subansiri district on the Sino-India border, on Saturday.Those allegedly kidnapped have been identified as Toch Singkam, Prasat Ringling, Dongtu Ebiya, Tanu Baker and Ngaru Diri. They had gone hunting in a jungle when they were allegedly kidnapped by the PLA.In February, China had strongly objected to home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, saying the visit had violated its territorial sovereignty and “sabotaged” mutual trust with India.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet and routinely, and sharply, criticises the visit of any Indian official visiting the region.In November, the Chinese foreign ministry had similarly slammed Indian defence minister, Rajnath Singh’s visit to the state to review the security situation in the frontier border region.Relations between India and China have hit a multi-decade low since clashes in Ladakh in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers. Both sides have since stepped up monitoring of their largely unsettled 3,488 km border.“We spoke with them (the PLA) on the hotline and told them that it’s suspected that some people have crossed across to your side and we will be grateful if you could hand them over back, as per what we do normally,” Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, an Indian Army spokesperson, told news agency Reuters.“There is no earmarked line going through the forest or the mountains, so they keep moving here and there. So they might have gone there. It’s a very normal thing,” he said, adding they were yet to hear back from the Chinese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-new-delhi-s-concerns-over-5-missing-indians-in-arunachal-pradesh/story-Ranf7BjrHWVHcahD8lY89L.html
07-09-2020||World||WikiLeaks’ Assange in UK court to fight US extradition bid||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a London court on Monday to fight a US extradition request, at a high-stakes hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.Assange, who has spent almost a year and a half in a British prison, sat in the dock at the Old Bailey criminal court and formally refused the US demand he be extradited to face trial on espionage charges. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and maroon tie, with glasses perched atop his neatly trimmed white hair.Several dozen supporters, including fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, gathered outside the courthouse, chanting, banging drums and calling his prosecution a threat to press freedom.“Julian Assange is the trigger, he is shining the light on all the corruption in the world,” Westwood said.American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges over Wikileaks’ publication of secret US military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.American authorities allege that Assange conspired with US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.In a new indictment filed in June, US prosecutors also say he conspired with members of hacking organizations and sought to recruit hackers to provide WikiLeaks with classified information. That indictment expanded the US case against Assange but did not add any new charges.Assange’s lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists around the world at risk.They argue that Assange is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and say the leaked documents exposed US military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes — such as the publications Julian has been charged for — should be protected from prosecution,” Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said before the hearing.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of U.K. and Swedish authorities — but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison as he awaits the extradition decision.Supporters say the ordeal has harmed Assange’s physical and mental health, leaving him with depression, dental problems and a serious shoulder ailment. The hearing is expected to include expert psychiatric evidence about his mental state.Journalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request. Amnesty International said Assange was “the target of a negative public campaign by US officials at the highest levels.”The extradition hearing opened in February but was put on hold when the U.K. went into lockdown in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is resuming with social distancing measures in court and video feeds so that journalists and observers can watch remotely.The case is due to run until early October. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is expected to take weeks or even months to consider her verdict, with the losing side likely to appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-assange-in-uk-court-to-fight-us-extradition-bid/story-c86XokyezzkQgkyYvms4fI.html
07-09-2020||World||Berlin chair protest to back calls for Greek camp evacuation||Activists are setting up thousands of chairs outside the German parliament in Berlin to underline their calls to take in migrants from an overcrowded camp on a Greek island.The 13,000 chairs being set up in front of the Reichstag building on Monday are meant to symbolize the inhabitants of the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, as well the readiness of some German cities and states to take migrants in.Sea-rescue activist groups that back Monday’s action say the first confirmed coronavirus case at Moria adds urgency to long-standing calls for the camp’s evacuation.Greek authorities last week imposed a 14-day quarantine on Moria after one man who had been living in a tent outside the camp fence tested positive for the virus. As of Aug. 31, the Moria camp housed 12,714 people, several times its capacity of 2,757.Germany’s federal government has agreed to take in a total of 243 children from camps in Greece who need medical treatment, as well their closest relatives. So far, 99 of the children have arrived. It also has taken in 53 unaccompanied children evacuated from the camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berlin-chair-protest-to-back-calls-for-greek-camp-evacuation/story-X5NFkT4EAVMPAuivXbkIFP.html
07-09-2020||World||China shows off Covid-19 vaccines for first time||China has put its homegrown coronavirus vaccines on display for the first time, as the country where the contagion was discovered looks to shape the narrative surrounding the pandemic.High hopes hang on the small vials of liquid on show at a Beijing trade fair this week -- vaccine candidates produced by Chinese companies Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.Neither has hit the market yet but the makers hope they will be approved after all-important phase 3 trials as early as year-end.A Sinovac representative told AFP his firm has already “completed the construction of a vaccine factory” able to produce 300 million doses a year.On Monday, people at the trade fair crowded around booths showing the potential game-changing vaccines.China, which is facing a storm of foreign criticism over its early handling of the pandemic, has been trying to repurpose the story of Covid-19.State media and officials are now emphasising the revival of Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the deadly pathogen surfaced, as a success story in the fight against the virus.They are also touting progress on domestic vaccines as a sign of Chinese leadership and resilience in the face of an unprecedented health threat that has pummelled the global economy.In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to make any potential vaccine developed by China a “global public good”.The potential vaccines on display are among nearly 10 worldwide to enter phase 3 trials, typically the last step ahead of regulatory approval, as countries race to stub out the virus and reboot battered economies.Sinopharm said it anticipates the antibodies from its jab to last between one and three years -- although the final result will only be known after the trials.China’s nationalistic tabloid Global Times reported last month that “the price of the vaccines will not be high”.Every two doses should cost below 1,000 yuan ($146), the report said, citing Sinopharm’s chairman, who told media he has already been injected with one of the candidate vaccines.China’s official Xinhua news agency reported Monday that another vaccine candidate, developed by Chinese military scientists, can deal with mutations in the coronavirus.As of last month, at least 5.7 billion doses of the vaccines under development around the world had been pre-ordered.But the World Health Organization has warned that widespread immunisation against Covid-19 may not be on the cards until the middle of next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shows-off-covid-19-vaccines-for-first-time/story-dGgWVXYEmDfGQUrh6DlvGI.html
07-09-2020||World||UK police arrest man over string of stabbings in Birmingham||British police arrested a 27-year-old man early Monday on suspicion of murder and seven counts of attempted murder following a string of stabbings in a busy nightlife district in the central England city of Birmingham over the weekend.West Midlands Police said the suspect remains in custody after being arrested at around 4 a.m.The arrest follows a large-scale police manhunt in the wake of the stabbings in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police released CCTV footage of the man they said was wanted on suspicion of murder.A 23-year-old man was killed in the attacks and a man and a woman, ages 19 and 32, remain critically ill in hospital after suffering serious stab wounds.Following the arrest, Birmingham Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Steve Graham, said one line of enquiry “ultimately led us to an address in the Selly Oak area this morning where a man was arrested.”“Clearly this is a crucial development but our investigation continues,” he added.Local police have faced criticism of their response to the attacks, notably how the attacker was able to wander the city during his 90-minute rampage. The victims appeared to have been chosen at random.West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has urged people to avoid speculating over any motives behind the attacks and to “remain calm but vigilant.”The stabbings took place at a time when nightlife is gradually resuming across city centers in the U.K. following the national coronavirus lockdown.Official statistics show knife crime is on the rise in the U.K., where most guns are outlawed, although the number of homicides with blades fell in 2019 from the year before.Britain also has seen several recent extremist knife attacks, including a stabbing rampage in a city park in Reading, near London, in June that killed three people. A Libyan man has been charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-arrest-man-over-string-of-stabbings-in-birmingham/story-yfmbuIwAMZOyT14kKQxOCP.html
07-09-2020||World||Australia reports nine coronavirus-related deaths, daily infection count drops||Australia on Monday recorded nine new coronavirus deaths and 47 fresh cases, the lowest single-day spike in new infections in the last two months, health officials said. All the fatalities and 41 of the new cases were reported from Victoria, which is in a stage four lockdown since August 2. Monday’s tally of new cases is the lowest since June 26 in Australia. On Sunday, Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews announced a five-step strategy to lift the current restrictions. This plan will be in effect from September 13 to November 23, after which the state will need to maintain a “Covid-free” status for 14 days to finally be declared as “Covid-normal”. The present stage four lockdown will go on till September 28. Andrews’ roadmap aims to keep daily new cases between 30 and 50 till September 28 and fewer than five by late October. Andrews defended the gradual lifting of restrictions, saying “you cannot run out of (this) lockdown because you will be running into a third wave, resulting in another lockdown.” So far, Victoria has recorded 19,550 Covid-19 cases, while the death toll stands at 675. Andrews said, “These are difficult times, but to go from 725 cases to 41 cases in a month -- that demonstrates this strategy is working, the sacrifices that we are making are worth something.” He added, “I want that (sacrifices) to count and that’s why we simply can’t open up as quickly as everyone would like us to.” “I would like to open up much more quickly than we can, but none of us have the luxury. None of us — not me, not any Victorian — has the luxury of letting our frustration get the better of us. That’s not a recipe for anything other than a third wave,” he added. On Victoria’s virus roadmap, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the state’s decision to extend the lockdown was “hard and crushing news” for Victorians. “It is vital to the national interest to restore Victoria to a Covid-safe environment, where we can reopen our economy and reasonably restore the liberties of all Australians, whether in Victoria or anywhere else,” he said. “The proposed roadmap will come at a further economic cost. While this needs to be weighed up against mitigating the risk of further community outbreak, it is also true that the continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting on mental health,” Morrison said on Sunday. Meanwhile, New South Wales recorded four new coronavirus cases, including three healthcare workers at Liverpool and Concord Hospitals. Queensland reported two new cases in the last 24 hours. The coronavirus has so far claimed 762 lives with 26,319 confirmed infections in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-reports-nine-coronavirus-related-deaths-daily-infection-count-drops/story-7TrC8ld4N1ZGt2B5HxUncK.html
07-09-2020||World||India now second behind US in coronavirus cases amid economic pain||India’s increasing coronavirus caseload made the Asian giant the world’s second-worst-hit country behind the United States on Monday, as its efforts to head off economic disaster from the pandemic gain urgency.The 90,802 cases added in the past 24 hours pushed India’s total past Brazil with more than 4.2 million cases. India is now behind only the United States, where more than 6.2 million people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University.India’s Health Ministry on Monday also reported 1,016 new deaths for a total of 71,642, the third-highest national toll.The world’s second-most populous country with 1.4 billion people, India has been recording the world’s largest daily increases in coronavirus cases for almost a month. Despite over 2 million new cases in the past month and the virus spreading through the country’s smaller towns and villages, the Indian government has continued relaxing restrictions to try and resuscitate the economy.On Monday, the Delhi Metro, which serves India’s sprawling capital, New Delhi, and adjoining areas, resumed operations after remaining shuttered for more than five months. The commuters were scarce and stations deserted. Only asymptomatic people were allowed to board the trains, with masks, social distancing and temperature checks mandatory.Security personnel used metal detectors attached to rods to ensure social distancing during frisking at the stations, and commuters were allowed to enter only after sanitizing their hands.New Delhi’s streets have already returned to their normal bustle, and people are again flocking to markets. The city’s bars will reopen on Wednesday.The reopenings come after India’s economy shrank faster than any other major nation’s, nearly 24% in the last quarter.India’s economic pain dates to the demonetization of the nation’s currency in 2016 and a hasty rollout of a goods and services tax the next year. But the strict virus lockdown that started on March 24 further exacerbated the economic woes.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered everyone in the country to stay indoors, the whole economy shut down within four hours. Millions lost their jobs instantly and tens of thousands of migrant workers, out of money and fearing starvation, poured out of cities and headed back to villages. The unprecedented migration not only hollowed out India’s economy but also spread the virus to the far reaches of the country.Now, as cases surge, most of the country, except in high-risk areas, has already opened up, with authorities saying they have little choice.“While lives are important, livelihoods are equally important,” Rajesh Bhushan, the top official of India’s federal health ministry, said at a news briefing last week.Almost 60% of India’s virus cases are now coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, the nation’s most populous state. But infections are also returning to areas that had managed to slow the spread of the virus, offsetting marginal gains.Initially hit hard by the virus, New Delhi had seemed to turn the tide through its aggressive screening for patients. But after reopening steadily, the state has reported a recent surge in cases and fatalities. The reopening of the metro is expected to further worsen the situation, experts fear.The recent surge in cases also highlights the risks of India’s strategy on relying too heavily on rapid tests that screen for antigens or viral proteins. These tests are cheap, yield results in minutes and have allowed India to test over a million people a day.But they are also less precise and likely to miss infected people, said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert of Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India.India also says its recovery rate is 77.3% and that the fatality rate has declined to around 1.72%.But the economic crisis means that people in India, especially the poor who were inordinately impacted by the harsh lockdown, have to go out and work. They are also less likely to have access to good healthcare.The virus has already deepened misery in the country’s vast hinterlands and poorer states, where surges have crippled the underfunded healthcare system and stretched resources.S.P. Kalantri, a public health specialist, said India’s poor face a “desperate choice” between “an immediate death versus a death that could come any time.”“The disease is already there in the villages,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-now-second-behind-us-in-coronavirus-cases-amid-economic-pain/story-0uTygELcN934YpLfsrGlkI.html
07-09-2020||World||India re-opens metro trains, overtakes Brazil with second-highest virus cases||India restarted city metro services Monday after a nearly six-month hiatus as the vast nation overtook Brazil to become the second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases, behind only the United States.Despite warnings that it could eventually overtake the US, India has been steadily re-opening its pandemic-battered economy.Masked commuters sat in mostly empty coaches and flashed victory signs to journalists early Monday at metro stations in the capital New Delhi -- one of the most badly hit cities along with financial hub Mumbai.Passengers can only sit on alternate seats, and after undergoing thermal screening.“There was no problems commuting in the metro. Social distancing is being followed and... people are using facemasks and sanitising,” passenger Deepak Kumar, who took the subway to work in Delhi, told AFP.“For our lives to move on, we have to get out of our homes... so this is a good move by the government to start the metro trains.”The resumption of metro services came as the South Asian nation recorded 4.2 million infections since the pandemic began, health ministry data showed.It surpassed Brazil’s total, making it the second-highest tally behind the United States’ 6.25 million.India has also recorded 71,642 deaths, fewer than the 126,203 in Brazil and 188,540 in the US.Many experts, however, say it is not testing enough people and not properly recording many deaths, meaning the real numbers may be much higher.- ‘Alarming’ -Since August the country of 1.3 billion people, home to some of the world’s most densely populated cities, has been reporting the highest single-day rises in the world.On Monday it reported an increase of more than 90,000 cases.Its caseload had moved past four million on Saturday, only 13 days after hitting three million.Delhi, a city teeming with 20 million people, recorded 3,256 new infections on Sunday -- its highest single-day spike in 73 days. It was also the first time cases crossed the 3,000 mark during this period.Virologist Shahid Jameel, who heads the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, said the key factor to watch is the growth rate in infections, which he called “quite alarming”.“Over the past two weeks, the... average has moved from about 65,000 cases per day to about 83,000 cases per day, that is about a 27 percent increase over two weeks or about two percent per day,” Jameel told AFP.India has been testing more than 10 million people per day on average, with plans to ramp it up further.The Indian Council of Medical Research, the scientific agency leading the government’s response, on Friday revised the testing criteria, allowing anyone to get a test without a doctor’s letter.Jameel said the move was overdue.“This will uncover more asymptomatic people, who are the real source of this expansion in India. There should also be more testing in rural districts and villages, since over two-thirds of the cases are coming from there,” he said.The re-opening of subway services was part of an effort by the government to gradually restart economic activity after the strict lockdown imposed from late March saw growth contract by a record 23.9 percent in April to June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-re-opens-metro-trains-overtakes-brazil-with-second-highest-virus-cases/story-WH3cPzefVe50jW4GutmvvM.html
07-09-2020||World||EU seeks details after report UK may renege on Brexit terms||The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator said Monday that he will seek clarification from London about a report that Britain might be planning to renege on commitments it has made during negotiations on its departure from the bloc, as concern mounts that trust between the sides is evaporating.The Financial Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is planning domestic legislation that would water down commitments to maintaining an open border between the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland that it has already signed up to.The border guarantee was a key part of the legally binding divorce agreement sealed last year. It’s seen as vital to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Britain left the bloc on Jan. 31 and a transition period meant to sort out a trade agreement to soften the economic blow of Brexit expires on Dec. 31.“This protocol is a condition for preserving peace and for protecting the integrity of the single market. It’s also a pre-condition for confidence between us because everything that has been signed in the past must be respected,” EU negotiator Michel Barnier told French radio France Inter.Barnier said he would ask for details from his British counterpart, David Frost, “to better understand the government’s intentions.” The two sides are meeting in London from Tuesday for their eighth round of negotiations. Barnier said last week he was “worried and disappointed” by the lack of progress.Johnson is talking tough ahead of the negotiations. In remarks released in advance by his office, he is expected to say later on Monday that Britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insist that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the U.K.”He is also set to say that an agreement must be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for Oct. 15. Barnier and the trade committee at the European Parliament, which must also endorse any agreement, insist that the negotiations must conclude before the end of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-details-after-report-uk-may-renege-on-brexit-terms/story-Gpen4Dou2bU0mOx2c0fQkO.html
07-09-2020||World||US Navy searches for missing Nimitz sailor in Arabian Sea||The US Navy searched through the night into Monday morning for a sailor who went missing from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during its patrol of the northern Arabian Sea amid tensions with Iran.The crew aboard the Nimitz sounded a “man overboard” alert at 6:47 p.m. on Sunday, after being unable to find the sailor aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, said Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the US Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. That was after an extensive search of the Nimitz, America’s oldest carrier in active service that carries some 5,000 sailors and Marines.The Nimitz, the guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton and other 5th Fleet personnel continued their search on Monday, Rebarich said. She declined to identify the missing sailor, citing Navy policy.The Nimitz, whose homeport is Bremerton, Washington, has been in the Arabian Sea since late July. It replaced the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which had spent months in the Arabian Sea on its deployment that saw the carrier break the Navy’s previous at-sea record. Navy officials have limited port calls due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The Nimitz’s arrival in the Mideast saw Iran conduct a live-fire drill targeting a mockup aircraft carrier resembling it.The drill underlined the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the US after a series of escalating incidents last year led to an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Tehran responded to that strike by firing ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American forces in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-searches-for-missing-nimitz-sailor-in-arabian-sea/story-Qugmh0Tvhs5ddrxgaGWzbJ.html
07-09-2020||World||China targets press cards for some US media: Reports||China has reportedly suspended full renewal of press accreditation for some journalists at US media outlets in apparent retribution for Washington’s targeting of Chinese reporters working in the United States.The moves are the latest manifestation of the deteriorating state of US-China relations that have fallen to their lowest level in decades.Atlanta-based CNN said in a story on its website that China correspondent David Culver was among those told of the new arrangement while applying to renew his foreign ministry-issued press credentials.CNN said he was given a letter authorizing him to continue reporting for the next two months instead of the usual one-year press card. He was told the move was unrelated to his reporting but was merely a reciprocal measure in response to the actions of the Trump administration toward Chinese media.There was no immediate response from China’s foreign ministry.CNN and The New York Times reported that other US media have also been targeted. China’s move comes after the US capped the number of Chinese citizens who could be employed by some Chinese media outlets at 100 and placed all on 90-day visas.China first responded in March by expelling reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Those affected have been both US and non-US citizens.The US moves were fed by complaints that Chinese journalists working for state media acted more as propagandists and agents for the Communist Party than as genuine reporters. The US had already required those outlets to register as foreign entities with the US, similar to consulates and embassies.They also come against the backdrop of worsening US-China relations on a range of issues, including human rights, trade, technology, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Chinese treatment of its Muslim minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targets-press-cards-for-some-us-media-reports/story-8AGYcECGCQEs4lZSBwAkHK.html

We will hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for that,” Pompeo was quoted as saying in a State Department tweet on Sunday (local time).Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times with the two countries sparring over a range of issues including Beijing’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea and the Chinese government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis.Pompeo has said recently that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a clear and intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbours from the Taiwan Strait to the Himalayas and beyond and hoped for a peaceful resolution of the situation on the India-China border.Last Wednesday, the top US diplomat said the Department of State will now require senior Chinese diplomats in the US to receive approval to visit American university campuses and to meet with local government officials.

07-09-2020||World||Californians dodged blackouts but wildfires may cut power anyway||California once again evaded rolling blackouts Sunday after residents dramatically curbed electricity use during a record-breaking heat wave -- but the state’s energy crisis is far from over.The sweltering temperatures are fueling wildfires that have, just this weekend, taken down power plants, forced evacuations and cut power to about 70,000 homes and businesses. Even when the heat begins to dissipate on Monday, offshore winds forecast to hit Northern California will stoke the risk of more fires, likely forcing even more outages.Such is life in a changing climate: More extreme weather inciting more frequent blazes, and an electric grid struggling to cope with unprecedented heat. San Francisco on Sunday hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), smashing a prior record of 92 set in 1904, according to the National Weather Service. Los Angeles reached 111 and San Diego topped 100, also records.The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid, credited consumers with averting what would have been the largest blackout in state history and the third round of rolling outages in less than a month. But for some Californians, dialing back their air conditioners won’t be enough to keep the lights on as wildfires rage across the state.Utility giant PG&E Corp. warned that more than 100,000 customers may go dark late Monday in parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Sierra Nevada foothills in a bid to keep its power lines from igniting fires. It’s the first time this fire season that PG&E has warned of shutoffs.Last year, when California’s utilities first began carrying out widespread blackouts like this, some homes and businesses were left in the dark for days. That drew outrage from state and local officials, triggered investigations and prompted PG&E to reassess the scope of future shutoffs.Years of deadly fires started by PG&E’s wires in wind storms forced California’s largest utility to declare bankruptcy last year. The company emerged in July after agreeing to pay $25.5 billion to settle wildfire lawsuits. The state has since set up a wildfire liabilities fund, essentially an insurance pool for the region’s utilities, but just one catastrophic blaze could wipe it out.Wreaking HavocThe latest blazes are already wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which has scorched 45,500 acres and is not contained, knocked out transmission from a hydro plant on Saturday. Another fire in Southern California cut off a solar farm, the California ISO said. Together, the blazes sucked 1.6 gigawatts from the power system, enough to power 1.2 million homes. While half of that had been re-connected by midday Sunday, another fire took out 500-600 megawatts.By Sunday evening, the heat had also taken down a 900-megawatt transmission line from Oregon, prompting the grid operator to call a Stage 2 emergency -- the last step before rolling blackouts. Southern California electricity prices briefly jumped to $1,164 a megawatt-hour while prices in Northern California surged to the highest level since January.Over the next two hours, officials called on consumers to turn off lights and appliances, to keep the grid from collapsing. It worked, but the ISO warned that it isn’t over yet.“Temperatures tomorrow will continue to be hot throughout the western U.S.,” the grid operator said in a statement. “The ISO is also monitoring numerous wildfires that may impact electrical lines.”Unprecedented HeatThe Department of Energy earlier Sunday issued an emergency order allowing several more power plants to produce as much electricity as possible over the next seven days, even if doing so would otherwise violate anti-pollution rules. At the ISO’s request, the agency said it was authorizing power plants in the City of Industry, El Segundo and Long Beach to run at their maximum output levels -- even though it may unleash additional air pollution. In a statement, agency spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said California policymakers should “evaluate why the grid is not able to handle extreme stress, which could be alleviated with the support of greater baseload power generation and natural gas supply.”One thing that has made California’s grid so vulnerable to soaring demand is the state’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes. The state’s utilities have commissioned large battery packs to pick up the slack, but most of the batteries haven’t been installed yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/californians-dodged-blackouts-but-wildfires-may-cut-power-anyway/story-Aue5YQosUo1kezz2CLPxvM.html
07-09-2020||World||Typhoon lashes South Korea after battering Japanese islands||A powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in South Korea on Monday after battering islands in southern Japan. More than 20 people were injured.The Korea Meteorological Administration warned of “very heavy rain and very strong winds” as Typhoon Haishen, packing maximum winds of 126 kilometers (78) miles per hour, made landfall in the southeastern port city of Ulsan. The weather agency said the typhoon, the third to hit the peninsula in as many weeks, was weakening and would likely be downgraded to a tropical storm within 24 hours.Cars struggled to navigate flooded roads in Ulsan and other coastal cities such as Busan, Sokcho and Gangneung. Emergency workers scrambled to clean up toppled trees and damaged traffic signs, buildings, and other structures. The Ministry of the Interior and Safety said a person in Busan was injured after a car flipped in strong winds, but it didn’t immediately provide further reports of casualties.At least 318 flights in and out of the southern island province of Jeju and across the mainland were canceled, according to the Korea Airports Corporation. Some bridges and railroad sections were shut down, thousands of fishing boats and other vessels were moved to safety, and more than 1,600 residents in the southern mainland regions were evacuated due to the possibility of landslides and other concerns.Workers as of Monday morning had restored power to 11,523 of the 17,620 households that had lost electricity in the southern mainland areas and Jeju.Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, plowed through Okinawa and other southern Japanese islands over the weekend. Traffic was still paralyzed in places, bullet trains were suspended and most domestic flights in and out of airports in southwestern Japan were canceled Monday.Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said at least 20 people, including two seriously, were injured. As of Monday morning, about half a million homes were still out of power.Regional officials in Miyazaki said rescue workers were looking for four people missing after a mudslide hit the mountainous village of Shiiba earlier Monday. A fifth person who was rescued at the site was seriously injured. NHK public television, citing its own tally, reported 37 injuries in the Kyushu region.The storm by late Monday was expected to reach North Korea’s northeastern region, which was battered by Typhoon Maysak last week, inflicting further pain on an economy ravaged by U.S.-led sanctions, border closures from the coronavirus pandemic and chronic food shortages.The North’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un visited typhoon-stricken areas, fired a top regional official for poor readiness, and promised to send 12,000 workers from Pyongyang to help with recovery efforts. The North said Maysak destroyed more than 1,000 houses and inundated public buildings and farmland. It didn’t immediately report any casualties caused by Haishen.Maysak damaged roads and buildings and left at least one person dead in South Korea. In addition, a livestock cargo ship sank off Japan’s coast as Maysak passed. Two of its 43 crew members were rescued and one body was recovered before the search was halted because of Haishen. The ship was transporting 5,800 cows from New Zealand to China.___Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-lashes-south-korea-after-battering-japanese-islands/story-sU6vI56sbHoxWdmY5WS4FP.html

07-09-2020||World||Germany raises pressure on Russia in Navalny poisoning probe||Germany on Sunday increased the pressure on Russia over the poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, warning that a lack of support by Moscow in the investigation could “force” Germany to rethink the fate of a German-Russian gas pipeline project.“I hope the Russians won’t force us to change our position regarding the Nord Stream 2” pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.Maas also said “if there won’t be any contributions from the Russian side regarding the investigation in the coming days, we will have to consult with our partners.” He did not exclude possible sanctions against Russia, telling the newspaper that such measures should be “pinpointed effectively.” However, Maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm German and European companies as well as Russia.“Whoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences,” he said. “More than 100 companies from 12 European countries are involved (in the construction), about half of them from Germany.” The German government has come under growing pressure to use the joint German-Russian pipeline project as leverage in getting Russia to provide answers on Navalny. The Nord Stream 2 project would deliver Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea when completed, bypassing Ukraine.Navalny, a Kremlin critic and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to Moscow on August 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk. He has been in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany for treatment on August 22.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Navalny’s poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics and called for a full investigation.German authorities say tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities previously identified the nerve agent, developed during the Soviet era, as the poison used to target former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018.“We have high expectations from the Russians to bring light into this severe crime,” Maas said. “If they have nothing to do with this attack, then it’s in their own interest to put the facts on the table.” France also added pressure on Sunday, suggesting the possibility of sanctions if Moscow fails to quickly respond to European demands for answers about Navalny’s poisoning.“It’s a serious situation. It’s serious firstly because it’s the poisoning of another opposition figure. And it’s serious because the substance that was used, Novichok, is banned,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking on France Inter radio.“(The Russians) must now tell us the truth so that we can act accordingly ... When we say quickly, it’s quickly, that’s to say a week, now. It’s a traumatizing event for everyone,” he said.Putin’s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and said last week that Germany hadn’t provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician’s condition.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reiterated Moscow’s claim Sunday that Germany hadn’t provided any evidence since Russia requested it in late August.“Dear Mr. Maas, if the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is sincere in its statements, then it should itself be interested in preparing a response to the request of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia as soon as possible,” Zakharova wrote in a Facebook posting.Maas rejected that accusation later Sunday, saying Germany had long agreed to Russia’s request and had told the country’s ambassador to Berlin so last week.“There is no reason why we shouldn’t agree to this request and therefore this is another one of their smoke grenades — we have seen several of those during the last days and I’m afraid there will be more in coming days,” Maas told ARD public Television.Merkel personally offered the country’s assistance in treating Navalny. He’s now in stable condition at Berlin’s Charite hospital, but doctors expect a long recovery and haven’t ruled out that the 44-year-old could face long-term effects to his health from the poisoning.Merkel has previously rejected the idea that the Navalny case be linked to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.The US has long opposed the project, which has been increasingly a source of friction between Berlin and Washington. In August, three Republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a Baltic Sea port located in Merkel’s parliamentary constituency over its part in Nord Stream 2. The Mukran port is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction.The US argues the project will endanger European security by making Germany overly dependent on Russian gas. It’s also opposed by Ukraine and Poland, which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the Baltic, as well as some other European nations.In addition to the security concerns, the US also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-raises-pressure-on-russia-in-navalny-poisoning-probe/story-WJy8ReNuUPUhCkz4GzBdBL.html
07-09-2020||World||Johnson says UK will quit Brexit talks if no deal by Oct 15||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked tough on Sunday ahead of a crucial round of post-Brexit trade talks with the European Union, saying Britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insisting that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the UK”. With talks deadlocked, Johnson said an agreement would only be possible if EU negotiators are prepared to “rethink their current positions”. The EU, in turn, accuses Britain of failing to negotiate seriously. Britain left the now 27-nation EU on January 31, three-and-a-half years after the country narrowly voted to end more than four decades of membership. That political departure will be followed by an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on December 31 and the UK leaves the EU’s single market and customs union. Without a deal, the New Year will bring tariffs and other economic barriers between the UK and the bloc, its biggest trading partner. Johnson said the country would “prosper mightily” even if Britain had “a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s” -- the UK government’s preferred description of a no-deal Brexit. British chief negotiator David Frost and his counterpart Michel Barnier are due to meet in London starting Tuesday for the eighth round of negotiations. The key sticking points are European boats’ access to UK fishing waters and state aid to industries. The EU is determined to ensure a “level playing field” for competition so British firms can’t undercut the bloc’s environmental or workplace standards or pump public money into UK industries. Britain accuses the bloc of making demands that it has not imposed on other countries it has free trade deals with, such as Canada. Frost told the Mail on Sunday newspaper that Britain was “not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws.”. “We are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things,” he said. The EU says a deal has to be struck before November to allow time for parliamentary approval and legal vetting before the transition period expires. Johnson gave an even shorter deadline, saying an agreement needed to be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for October 15. “If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,” he said. Barnier said last week he was “worried and disappointed” by the lack of progress and said the UK had not “engaged constructively”. Without a deal, British freight firms have warned there could be logjams at ports and supplies of key goods in Britain could be “severely disrupted” starting January 1. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Sunday that talks were “not going well” and dismissed British attempts to drive a wedge between EU nations on issues such as fishing. Le Drian said the 27 nations remained united. “We would prefer a deal, but a deal on the basis of our mandate,” he told France Inter radio. “There is room for action, but the whole package, including the fishing package, needs to be taken up in order to avoid a ‘no deal.’“ (AP) HMB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-says-uk-will-quit-brexit-talks-if-no-deal-by-oct-15/story-m7Pk5fYrgGIXdTfySz8cGK.html
07-09-2020||World||Record-breaking heat may cut power to 9 million Californians||As many as 9 million Californians could lose power Sunday evening as record-breaking heat taxes the electric grid and rampant wildfires knock out power plants and transmission lines.The blazes have already cut electricity to more than 60,000 customers, most of them in Los Angeles, San Diego and Fresno counties -- in some cases for as long as 36 hours. The real test will come after 5 p.m. when electricity demand is forecast to peak and the state’s solar production begins to wane. Without significant conservation, rolling blackouts will begin, plunging scores of people into darkness for the third time in less than a month.“Today is sizing up to be the most challenging day of the year,” said Eric Schmitt, vice president of operations at the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid.The crisis comes just three weeks after an August heat wave triggered California’s first rotating blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis and fueled hundreds of wildfires across the state. As climate change contributes to more extreme weather, the region’s heat, wildfire and blackout woes are only getting worse.Unprecedented heatThe heat gripping the state is unprecedented. San Francisco hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) Sunday, smashing a prior record of 92 set in 1904, according to the National Weather Service. Los Angeles reached 111 and San Diego topped 100, also records.“Temperatures during this current heat storm are expected to peak today, pushing demand for energy beyond levels of available supply,” the California ISO said in a statement Sunday. “There is currently not a sufficient supply of energy to meet the high amounts of demand during the heatwave.”With the state predicting a massive, 4-gigawatt electricity shortfall starting Sunday evening, the Department of Energy on Sunday issued an emergency order allowing several more power plants to produce as much electricity as possible over the next seven days, even if doing so would otherwise violate anti-pollution rules.In the meantime, wildfires are wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire yesterday knocked out transmission from a hydro plant, while a fire in Southern California cut off a solar farm, the California ISO said. Together, the blazes sucked 1.6 gigawatts from the power system, enough to power 1.2 million homes.About half of that had been re-connected by midday Sunday -- and then another fire in Southern California cut out 500-600 megawatts.Wholesale electricity prices in the southern part of the state spiked to the highest level in nearly a year, diverging sharply from prices in Northern California.At the state grid operator’s request, the Energy Department said it was authorizing power plants in the City of Industry, El Segundo and Long Beach to run at their maximum output levels -- even though it may unleash additional air pollution. In a statement, agency spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said California policymakers should “evaluate why the grid is not able to handle extreme stress, which could be alleviated with the support of greater baseload power generation and natural gas supply.”One thing that has made California’s grid so vulnerable to soaring demand is the state’s rapid shift away from natural gas.

The state’s utilities have commissioned large battery packs to pick up the slack, but most of the batteries haven’t been installed yet.Shut-offsThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported Sunday that some of those who lost power could be without it for 36 hours. Some of LADWP’s equipment was running at 200% of capacity due to the extreme demand for power, and the high night-time temperatures weren’t letting the gear cool off.Utility giant PG&E Corp. which powers much of Northern and Central California, warned on Saturday that it may decide to cut power to about 103,000 customers in parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Sierra Nevada foothills starting late Monday to keep its power lines from igniting fires. Hot, dry winds are forecast to blow across the region, threatening to knock tree limbs into power lines.This is the first time PG&E has warned of shutoffs during this year’s fire season. Last year, when California’s utilities first began carrying out widespread blackouts like this, some homes and businesses were left in the dark for days. That drew outrage from state and local officials, triggered investigations and prompted PG&E to reassess the scope of future shutoffs.The utility’s weather models show that warm, offshore winds will develop Monday evening on the heels of the heat wave. The soaring temperatures will further dry out grass, bushes and other vegetation, PG&E said.Years of deadly fires started by PG&E’s wires in wind storms forced California’s largest utility to declare bankruptcy last year. The company emerged in July after agreeing to pay $25.5 billion to settle wildfire lawsuits. The state has since set up a wildfire liabilities fund, essentially an insurance pool for the region’s utilities, but just one catastrophic blaze could wipe it out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-breaking-heat-may-cut-power-to-9-million-californians/story-oYZi76ShetjXEceY3jJuXP.html
07-09-2020||World||Hundreds detained as security forces crack down on mass protest in Belarus||Security forces in Belarus detained scores of protesters and were filmed beating a man as he lay on the street, as the authorities launched a crackdown on mass demonstrations against President Alexander Lukashenko.Nearly a month after an election which Lukashenko’s opponents say he rigged, tens of thousands of people marched through Minsk, many decked out in red-and-white opposition colours and shouting “go away!” and “you’re a rat!”.The authorities had laid barbed wire on the streets, and deployed military vehicles, prisoner vans, water cannons, helmeted riot police and plain clothes officers with masks and truncheons to try to contain the demonstrations. At least 100 people were detained, the Russian news agency Interfax quoted the government as saying, while the human rights group Spring-96 put the figure at more than 200. Local media also showed protests and detentions in other cities.A witness said the harsh treatment of the protesters appeared to mark an escalation by the authorities after weeks of comparative restraint, although the violence was not as widespread and indiscriminate as in the protests’ first days.Footage from local media outlet TUT.BY showed a masked man beating a protester as he lay on the ground. Plain clothes officers could be seen smashing the glass door of a cafe to get at protesters sheltering inside. “We ran into a cafe to hide from the riot police, they broke the glass, burst inside, pulled out three people, beat at least one,” Evgeny, a 28-year-old protester, said while waiters cleaned up the smashed glass.Jumping into the riverA witness described helmeted security forces and men in plain clothes detaining at least two dozen protesters near President Alexander Lukashenko’s residence, and beating and kicking another man as he lay on the ground.Some protesters left chanting “we’ll be back”.An ambulance arrived at another cafe, where another witness said a man had been beaten by men with truncheons and could only walk with difficulty.TUT.BY described people jumping into the Svislach River to escape the police in Minsk. Protests also took place outside the capital. In the city of Brest near the Polish border, video footage from TUT.BY showed women shouting “shame” at masked members of the security forces who dragged people away. Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces.“They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,” he said, according to the official Belta news agency.Lukashenko, in power since 1994, denies electoral fraud. Buoyed by a show of support from traditional ally Russia, he has rejected calls for new elections.Demonstrations have carried on throughout the four weeks since the election, gaining in size on the weekends and drawing tens of thousands of people each Sunday. Western countries have had to balance sympathy with the Belarusian pro-democracy movement against a desire not to provoke Moscow. The crisis has tested European resolve at a moment when countries are also weighing how to respond to the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.In an interview published in the Financial Times on Sunday, Lithuania’s foreign minister urged the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus and counter Russia’s influence or risk undermining the credibility of its foreign policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-detained-as-security-forces-crack-down-on-mass-protest-in-belarus/story-wsFaqGre2sJQ3bZ3IkDEoK.html
07-09-2020||World||Trump on defensive as critics seize on reports he insulted US veterans||President Donald Trump was on the defensive on Sunday over his attitude toward the US military following media reports that he had disparaged fallen veterans, which could harm his campaign for re-election on Nov. 3. Democratic and Republican opponents alike over the weekend seized on the reports - which said that Trump had called US soldiers buried in Europe “losers” - to attack his record on the military on news shows and in political ads.“It breaks your heart,” US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the reported comments in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday.Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, a Republican, told ABC’s “This Week” that the remarks, if true, were “despicable.” Hagel said the reports were “credible” because they were consistent with previous public remarks Trump had made denigrating military personnel, including former US Defense Secretary James Mattis.“It will resonate” with the military, he added.Retired US Army Colonel Jeff McCausland, a former National Security Council official, wrote in an op-ed for NBC News on Sunday that Trump over the years had demonstrated “a clear pattern of disrespect toward the military.”The furor over the Sept. 3 report in The Atlantic could dent support for Trump among service members, a key constituency for the Republican which largely backed him in 2016.The Atlantic reported that Trump made the disparaging remarks after canceling a visit to an American cemetery during a November 2018 trip to France, an account the president denied on Thursday and on Sunday said was “disinformation.”“They will say anything, like their recent lies about me and the Military, and hope that it sticks,” he tweeted, referring to the media and the Democratic Party, whose nominee Joe Biden is vying for the presidency in November.The Atlantic has stood by its report, which cited four unnamed people with firsthand knowledge of the matter and which was later confirmed by several other media outlets. Bloomberg on Sunday reported that Trump spent the extra free time in Paris selecting artwork to ship from the US ambassador’s residence to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Bloomberg report.Former Vice President Biden, whose late son Beau served in Iraq, on Sunday capitalized upon the uproar to highlight his own record of military support with a advertisement aimed at areas with large numbers of military personnel in battleground states. The ad will air nationwide on Sunday night during cable television news programs and on Facebook and Instagram throughout the week as part of a broader $47 million campaign, a spokesman told Reuters on Sunday.The Lincoln Project, a prominent Republican-backed group opposing Trump’s re-election, on Saturday released a new video attacking the president’s comments and broader record on the military. Trump has never served and avoided the draft for the Vietnam war citing bone spurs in his feet. “He’s a draft-dodger in chief who despises the men and women he supposedly leads. He insults their deaths and injuries with his contempt,” it said.Military spendingTrump has repeatedly touted his administration’s spending on the military while also moving to pull American troops out of conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, as well as out of allied countries such as Germany. More recently, he has said he would block the Pentagon’s plan to cut military healthcare by $2.2 billion and reverse its plan to close the Stars and Stripes military newspaper.Nevertheless, a Military Times poll of roughly 1,000 active-duty service members taken late July to early August and published last week, before the latest reports, showed waning military support for Trump and a slight preference for Biden. Several top administration officials, including US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, have rallied to Trump’s defense as the controversy has grown in recent days.On Sunday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he had never heard the president disparage the military or veterans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House that Trump supported the military “100%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-on-defensive-as-critics-seize-on-reports-he-insulted-us-veterans/story-oeUmhph85JtBHPXOTOD2IP.html

At 12:45 a.m. (1545 GMT on Sunday) on Monday its centre was in the East China Sea, about 110 km (68 miles) southeast of the Goto Islands, west of Nagasaki, according to Japan’s meteorological agency.“This typhoon is headed toward and may potentially make landfall in Kyushu, bringing record rains, winds, waves and high tides,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a meeting with cabinet ministers earlier. “I am asking that people exercise the utmost caution.” The storm was forecast to carry top sustained winds of up to 216 km per hour (134 mph) by Monday, the meteorological agency said. Authorities urged evacuations for people in areas across seven prefectures in southern Japan, public broadcaster NHK said, an effort that was complicated by social distancing that meant evacuation centres could take fewer people than normal.Trees on Yakushima, an island 100 km (60 miles) south of Kagoshima city, could be seen shaking violently in strong winds and driving rain, in a post on Twitter.Elderly citizens wearing face masks due to the coronavirus outbreak were gathering at evacuation centres in Kagoshima and other parts of southern Japan, footage on NHK showed.The typhoon has cut power to some 180,000 homes, NHK said adding that public transport services were all stopped in the affected prefectures.Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said two injuries had been reported.Heading for Korean PeninsulaThe typhoon was headed north by northwest at 30 kph, the meteorological agency said, forecast to approach the Goto Islands west of Nagasaki around 3 a.m. on Monday (1800 GMT on Sunday) and then move to the Korean peninsula. One evacuation centre in Miyazaki reached capacity and stopped accepting evacuees as a precaution against the coronavirus, according to NHK.Airlines have cancelled more than 500 flights departing from Okinawa and southern Japan, NHK said. Bullet train service in southern and western Japan was suspended, it said.Japan’s coastguard on Saturday suspended for a second day its search for crew missing from a ship that capsized in the East China Sea last week with a cargo of cattle. Typhoon Haishen follows Typhoon Maysak, which smashed into the Korean peninsula on Thursday, leaving at least two dead and thousands temporarily without power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-without-power-as-typhoon-haishen-batters-japan/story-Ai8EJVJvHpszygyIz0idlK.html

Sanctions could be imposed on Russia unless it provides clarification in the “next few days,” he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.But the British foreign secretary said for now, the U.K.’s focus is on an investigation because the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law. Russia “can’t just say ‘this is a domestic issue, it is just our internal affairs,’” Raab said.Speaking earlier to the BBC, Navalny’s chief of staff urged Western countries to respond by targeting Russian financial assets.“The only way to make it painful for them is of course to start taking measures against their assets,” Leonid Volkov said. “They have enormous assets in the west.”(Updates with Volkov comment in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-probe-into-pure-gangsterism-navalny-poisoning/story-m3FmwThNvOQ4ViFoslZEmN.html

Jaishankar will be the second senior Indian minister to visit Iran in less than a week, with defence minister Rajnath Singh having made a stopover in Tehran on Sunday for talks with his Iranian counterpart Brig Gen Amir Hatami that focused on bilateral cooperation and regional security issues. The two foreign ministers are expected to meet on Tuesday afternoon to review bilateral ties and the regional situation, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. There was no official word on the stopover in Tehran from the external affairs ministry. The back-to-back visits to Tehran by the Indian cabinet ministers come close on the heels of reports that China and Iran are close to an agreement for a 25-year strategic partnership in trade, politics and security. They also come at a time when Indian is attempting to work more closely with Iran to increase the economic viability of the strategic Chabahar port. The evolving situation in Afghanistan, where an intra-Afghan dialogue is set to get underway, is also expected to figure in the talks between Jaishankar and Zarif. Jaishankar last visited Iran in December 2019 and had spoken to Zarif in April. This will be his first visit abroad since foreign travel by ministers was curtailed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides participating in the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow on September 10, Jaishankar is expected to hold bilateral meetings with some counterparts. However, most of the focus will be on his expected meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. Jaishankar told an online event on Monday that his position for this meeting will be built around certain principles, including how peace and tranquillity on the border with China over the past 30 years has allowed the rest of the bilateral relationship to progress. He also said the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) cannot be delinked from the overall bilateral relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-set-to-make-stopover-in-iran-en-route-to-russia-for-meeting-of-sco-foreign-ministers/story-VQ3IsQ4BEPNb4iPZYgp1iL.html

The matter figured in a phone conversation between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Bangladeshi counterpart AK Abdul Momen. Jaishankar tweeted the two sides had agreed to hold the JCC meeting “very soon” but there were no details from the external affairs ministry. “Warm conversation with FM Dr AK Abdul Momen of Bangladesh. Agreed to hold our Joint Consultative Commission very soon. Will continue to work closely to reach the ambitious goals set by our leaders,” Jaishankar tweeted. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the two sides are expected to hold the JCC meeting via video conference in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders also discussed recent initiatives to improve connectivity between the two countries, including the operationalisation of the Daukandi-Sonamura inland waterway route on September 5 with the trial run of a vessel carrying cement from the Bangladeshi side to the northeastern state of Tripura, the people said. The last JCC meeting was held in New Delhi in February last year, when Momen and his then Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj led their respective sides. Momen told the BSS news agency in Dhaka that he and Jaishankar ageed in principle during their conversation to hold the JCC meeting virtually. BSS reported Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud bin Momen is unlikely to visit New Delhi ahead of the JCC meeting. At the last JCC meeting, the two sides had signed four MoUs to strengthen multifaceted cooperation. These MoUs covered the mid-career training of 1,800 Bangladeshi government employees, cooperation between AYUSH and the Bangladesh health ministry in the field of medicinal plants, cooperation between the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and cooperation with the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority to facilitate investments in an Indian economic zone in Mongla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-b-desh-to-hold-joint-body-meeting-review-bilateral-ties/story-MIe3m5fIgy7L6sNjzLOZ3O.html
07-09-2020||India||Amid standoff, Army looks to upgrade fleet of infantry vehicles||NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has sought to upgrade its infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) with night-fighting capability to fill a critical operational void in its mechanised infantry fleet at a time of heightened military tensions between Indian and China in the Ladakh sector, officials familiar with the development said on Monday. The army on September 4 invited expression of interest (EoI) from Indian vendors for developing prototype and subsequent procurement of upgraded armament for its BMP-2/2K ICVs inducted almost 35 years ago. “The terrain along our borders lends itself to conduct large-scale mechanised operations and the belligerence of our adversaries on the borders, necessitate that our capabilities are adequately built up to match the threat,” the EOI said. The army has deployed its ICVs along with tanks and artillery pieces in the Ladakh sector, where the two nuclear powers have been locked in a border row for more than four months. The army said the armament system on BMP-2/2K --- the mainstay of the mechanised infantry --- is “night blind as on date” and needs to be upgraded with modern sights to fill capability gaps. Former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd) said, “The BMP-2/2k is an excellent combat platform armed with advanced weapons. But it’s critical to equip the fleet with night-fighting capability to optimize its impact in the battlefield.” According to the army, the current armament sighting system on the ICVs is based on image intensifier technology which is not fit for modern day warfare due to its vast limitations. “The present system is also deficient of modernised fire control system and automatic target tracker which adversely affects the capability of BMP-2/2K to fight both during day and night. All these aspects are critical requirements for mechanised infantry to operate in armour intensive battlefield,” the EOI said. The army is planning to upgrade 811 ICVs with third-generation thermal imager-based gunner sight, modern thermal imager-based commander sight, modernised fire control system and automatic target tracker. Vendors have been asked to submit their responses to the EOI in six weeks. If the multi-stage process progresses smoothly, user trials could take place in two years. In June, the defence ministry placed an order with the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for 156 BMP 2/2k ICVs for the army’s mechanised forces. The ICVs will be manufactured by Ordnance Factory Medak in Telangana at an estimated cost of Rs 1,094 crore. The induction of the ICVs will be completed by 2023 and “the existing deficiency in the mechanised infantry battalions will be mitigated,” the ministry had then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-standoff-army-looks-to-upgrade-fleet-of-infantry-vehicles/story-Dr5mRBB9MyzMU3rMGdhOtO.html
07-09-2020||India||PM: NEP nation’s policy, not govt’s||The new National Education Policy (NEP) focuses on passion, practicality and performance, and is a major step towards moving away from a “one size fits all” approach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday as he emphasised that “maximum flexibility” should be shown in implementing it.Speaking at the Governors’ Conference on Education, Modi said NEP was accepted nationwide as it was brought after elaborate discussions and consultations with people. He said the policy belonged to the nation and should be implemented collectively.“The interference of the government in education policy should be kept at a minimum. The more teachers, parents and students are involved in it, the more relevant it becomes,” the PM said.This is not a government’s NEP but the people’s—the country’s education policy—he added.While referring to the importance of vocational education in the new policy, Modi said for an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), skill development was key.“The NEP focuses more on learning than study. It focuses more on practically, passion and performance. In one way, this is a major step towards getting rid of the one size fits all approach to our education system,” he said.“For a very long time, our children have been bogged down by social pressure and the weight of school bags. These issues have been dealt with in the NEP,” the PM said.The NEP was approved by the Union Cabinet in July to replace the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems. But some of the sweeping reforms proposed -- such as teaching up to Class 5 in a child’s mother tongue or a single regulator for higher education institutions -- have been criticised by opposition parties. In his speech, the PM said because such a major reform was being ushered in, it was natural for people to have doubts. “We have to collectively address all doubts. The vision of flexibility with which this policy was brought... We will have to show in a similar way maximum flexibility in implementing it,” he told the conference.He suggested appropriate “flexibility” in the implementation of the policy. “Before September 25, there should be several virtual conferences so that our understanding of NEP keeps improving,” he said.The conference was also attended by President Ram Nath Kovind, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, and governors and education ministers of XXXX states. In his speech, Kovind said both Centre and states will have to increase funding in research and innovation to give impetus to a large economy like India. “To give impetus to a large and vibrant economy like India, it is necessary to encourage knowledge-creation and research. The central and state governments will have to increase the percentage of investment in research and innovation,” he said.Bengal opposes NEPBengal said it will not implement the NEP as the policy undermined the country’s federal structure while Tamil Nadu opposed a proposal to make National Testing Agency as only body for conducting entrance examination to all higher education institutions. Jharkhand opposed the policy saying it would be lead to further privatisation of education. Bihar sought Central financial assistance to meet objectives of NEP.States ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the policy, saying it would transform the education sector and make students ready for the job market. Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said he objected to the Centre’s decision of not including Bengali in the list of classical languages. “There is no question of implementing NEP in the state for the time being. More discussions need to be held on the matter with all stakeholders. We have expressed our reservations about certain aspects of the NEP, as they undermine the country’s federal structure and the role of the states,” he told reporters after the meeting.Tamil Nadu higher education minister K P Anbalagan opposed the National Testing Agency holding all entrance examinations saying it would discourage rural students. Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said NEP encouraged more privatisation and commercialisation of education.Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, who also holds additional charge of Madhya Pradesh, said both states have constituted task force to study the NEP and will submit its recommendations shortly on how to implement the policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-nep-nation-s-policy-not-govt-s/story-KVBeeyYXrWSm4ortE4jH2O.html

Jaishankar, who is set to meet Wang on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow on September 10, said the failure to observe several understandings on border management dating back to 1993 raises “very important questions” about the status of ties with China. “If peace and tranquillity on the border is not a given, then it cannot be that the rest of the relationship continues on the same basis, because clearly peace and tranquillity is the basis for the relationship,” he said while participating in an online interaction organised by The Indian Express newspaper to mark the release of his book ‘The India Way’. Jaishankar declined to go into details of exactly what he would discuss with his Chinese counterpart but said his position would be built around certain broad principles, including how peace and tranquillity on the border over the past 30 years had allowed the rest of the relationship to progress. During this period, China had emerged as India’s second largest trade partner despite the existence of some differences and problems, he noted. He emphasised that “the state of the border cannot be delinked from the state of the relationship”, and the standoff had brought into focus a number of understandings with China on border management which go back to 1993, he said. These understandings stipulate that both countries will keep forces at a minimum level at the border and also shape the behaviour of the troops and restraints on them, he added. “If these [understandings] are not observed, then it raises very, very important questions,” Jaishankar said. The “very serious situation” at the LAC since the beginning of May calls for “very deep conversations between the two sides at a political level”, he added. Jaishankar will meet Wang less than a week after a meeting between the defence ministers of the two countries on the sidelines of the SCO defence ministers’ meet in Moscow. That meeting was unable to take the troubled disengagement process forward, and several rounds of political and diplomatic talks too haven’t produced results. Acknowledging the existing problems, competition and “difficult recent history” between India and China, Jaishankar dismissed the contention that New Delhi had misread Beijing’s intentions. He pointed to the two informal summits that were held after an understanding was reached in June 2017 and said these meetings had focused on issues of sovereignty, security, connectivity and economy after the leaders felt the need to engage directly. These conversations had also focused on “how to find accommodation”, he said. Jaishankar also acknowledged that both sides will now maintain their positions and the key issue is to reach an understanding on disengagement. “I have a very practical issue right now, which is an issue of disengagement and de-escalation,” he said. He said he had left the issue of the future relationship with China open-ended in his book. “India and China must try to find mutual accommodation because their ability to do that will determine [whether this is an] Asian century or not,” he said. Jaishankar also spoke on other issues such as Brexit, the Covid-19 crisis and the stalled relationship with Pakistan, saying this wasn’t a question of “zero diplomacy”. Given Pakistan’s “attachment to cross-border terrorism”, it would be wrong for New Delhi to allow Islamabad to set the agenda and pace for talks, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-of-border-can-t-be-delinked-from-state-of-relationship-with-china-jaishankar/story-BibLAYMLrFdp4lp2aq6krJ.html

The induction of the ICVs will be completed by 2023 and “the existing deficiency in the mechanised infantry battalions will be mitigated,” the ministry had then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-border-row-army-seeks-to-upgrade-night-blind-infantry-combat-vehicles/story-fljQPIb4nNO3Qbe3HJfPMI.html
07-09-2020||India||Kerala health inspector rapes nurse who wanted a Covid-negative certificate: Police||A Kerala health inspector has been arrested on charges of raping a 44-year-old nurse who had approached him for a coronavirus-negative certificate, police said.The woman had been ordered to go into quarantine last month after she returned home to the state capital from north Kerala where she was working as a home nurse. She had tested negative after the two-week quarantine but she needed the negative certificate to return to work as a nurse.This is the second incident of rape involving a state employee working in the health sector. On Saturday last, a 22-year-old woman complained that the driver of a state-run ambulance service tasked to take her to hospital raped her on the way.The nurse told the police that when she approached the junior health inspector after her quarantine period was over, he insisted that she meet him at his house in Thiruvananthapuram district’s Pangode. According to her complaint, when she went, he forced her to spend the day with him and raped her. She alleged that he threatened to tell the police that she had jumped quarantine if she didn’t comply. He also assaulted her.Inspector P Suneesh who is investigating the case said the health official also physically assaulted her.“A medical examination confirmed sexual assault. He was booked under different sections of the Indian Penal Code including rape, illegal detention and assault,” the police officer said.Kerala health minister KK Shailaja said the state government would take stringent action against the offender.“Health workers are toiling day in and out these days. But such unfortunate incidents will give a negative impression and portray their work in a bad light. We will take stringent action against the offenders and ensure such sad incidents do not recur,” said Shailaja. On Saturday night a young patient was allegedly sexually assaulted by an ambulance driver in central Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district on the way to a hospital. The suspect was arrested within hours of the crime that set off a war of words between the ruling party and the opposition. The opposition Congress and BJP have sought the resignation of the health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-health-inspector-rapes-nurse-who-wanted-a-covid-negative-certificate-police/story-2V6ZJemeBQhjoWCOwGKOxK.html
07-09-2020||India||ED arrests Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar for money laundering||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday arrested former ICICI Bank MD-CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar in connection with its money laundering probe against the couple and companies run by them, people familiar with the development said. Officials said that Deepak Kochhar was arrested in Mumbai after he was called for questioning on Monday and will be produced in a court on Tuesday morning. He was confronted with several documents linked to alleged money laundering in his companies after which he was put under arrest, an officer said requesting anonymity. Deepak Kochhar’s arrest is the first in the multi-agency investigation launched against his wife in January last year for decisions taken by her as the head of a private bank in giving loans to the Videocon Group in lieu of bribes allegedly paid in their companies. Chanda Kochhar had stepped down from ICICI Bank on October 4, 2018, after allegations of irregularities surfaced against her. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is also investigating Chanda Kochhar and Deepak Kochhar for alleged corruption. In its FIR registered in January last year, CBI had alleged that six high value loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were given by ICICI Bank to Videocon group of companies between 2009 and 2011. It has been alleged that a payment of Rs 64 crore was made into a Deepak Kochhar company - NuPower Renewables by Videocon in 2009, which was a quid pro quo from Dhoot for a loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon. While attaching properties worth Rs 78.15 crore belonging to Kochhars in January this year, ED had said that an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Limited, was transferred to M/s Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL, earlier known as M/s NuPower Renewables Limited, a company of Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar) by VIL on September 8, 2009, just one day after disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank”. “Further, net revenue of Rs. 10.65 crores was generated by NRL from these tainted funds,” it added. The agency termed the flat at CCI Chambers, Churchgate, where Chanda Kochhar lives, was an “illegal gain”; she has lived there since 1997, as it was owned by a Videocon entity – QTAPL (Quality Appliances Pvt Ltd; now named Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd) from 2009 till 2016. “It is noticed that Chanda Kochhar and Venugopal N Dhoot are known to each other whereas family members of Chanda Kochhar are having joint holding in certain companies with the persons of Videocon group viz in NRPL (NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd) and SEPL (Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd). The nexus is evident from the changes in the shareholding patterns in the specified companies into and amongst such persons under a design and plan,” said an ED report in possession of HT. The agency added that these suspected transfer of funds and changes in the companies have taken place both at the “corporate level” and at the “individual level”. However, in an investigation report filed in a Delhi court, as first reported by HT in April 2019, ED had claimed that it was investigating a total of 24 loans aggregating Rs 7,862 crore that were given by the bank to Videocon Group between 2009 and 2018. Both the agencies decided to look at quid-pro-quos between Videocon Group chief Venugopal Dhoot and Kochhars after it emerged that former was an investor in Kochhar’s husband, Deepak Kochhar’s company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-chanda-kochhar-s-husband-deepak-kochhar-for-money-laundering/story-XBdJ3vfWx6R9nk2I0uOWKO.html
07-09-2020||India||India’s monsoon rains turn patchy, to pick up later this month||Monsoon rains, which turned patchy in the first week of September, will pick up in the second half of the month, the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.India, where nearly half of the country’s farmland lacks irrigation, has so far received 7% above average rainfall since June 1, when the monsoon arrived on the southernmost Kerala coast, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of the IMD.The IMD defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 88 cm for the entire four-month season beginning in June.Higher rains in the latter part of September will make up for the shortfall in the first half of the month, and cumulative rainfall during the entire season will be in line with IMD’s earlier forecast, Mohapatra said.In its revised forecast issued on June 1, IMD said India was likely to receive above average monsoon rains for the second straight year in 2020.After arriving on June 1, the monsoon covered the entire country by June 26, nearly two weeks earlier than usual, spurring crop sowing in the world’s top producer of farm goods.India received 17% above average rains in June, but July rains were 10% below average. The monsoon again picked up in August, delivering 27% above average rains.Monsoon rains were 31% below average in the week to Sept. 2.Rains have been evenly distributed across India.Of the 36 meteorological subdivisions of India, the monsoon has been either average or above average in 33 this year, Mohapatra said.“Rains are likely to gather momentum later this month, but as of now we haven’t made an assessment when the monsoon will start withdrawing,” he said.The IMD treats dry weather conditions for five straight days in western India to be the primary criterion signifying the retreat of the monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-monsoon-rains-turn-patchy-to-pick-up-later-this-month/story-PDs1GtHzu9MLUdD8dd4WuJ.html
07-09-2020||India||‘Criticised for being too selective in allowing projects that hurt environment’: Former PM Manmohan Singh||Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said his government was criticised by industrialists and others for being too selective in allowing projects that impacted the wildlife habitat, and asserted that during his tenure India was an active voice in international forums on environment issues and made positive contribution to the protection of the planet. “In India, during the time that I was Prime Minister, we were conscious of our duty to accelerate economic development and raise the standard of living of our people, especially those in poverty. This is, after all, the first priority of any government,” Singh said while presenting the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development for 2019 to British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. “At the same time, we were very selective in allowing projects that impacted the wilderness or the habitat of wildlife. Indeed, we were criticised by industrialists and those who thought we were being too restrictive. But I believe that if a proper balance is not firmly held, the results are deleterious and self-defeating,” he added. “We were also an active voice in international forums and discussions on issues concerning the environment and I like to think we made positive contributions to the protection of the planet,” the former Prime Minister said. Singh conferred the award on Sir David at a virtual event. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were also present during the online function. The former Prime Minister expressed concern over the destruction of environment across the world. “How acute the situation is cannot be clearer than from the pandemic that has gripped the earth, coincidently almost exactly one century after the great influenza epidemic. To some, this is nature’s way of telling humankind to loosen its tightening grip on the resources of the earth, to be less exploitative, to respect the needs of the natural world, especially the animal kingdom, more and slow down the pace of environmental destruction,” he said. “But it doesn’t need an epidemic to tell us that we are not in good shape. Climate change, the assault on the oceans, the pollution of the atmosphere, the junk floating about in space, the reduction of forest cover, the extinction of life in rivers, the reduction of natural habitat for any life other than humans – all this is evident to anyone who has eyes to see,” added Singh. Sir David Attenborough was named the recipient of the award in November last year. His name was selected by an international jury chaired by former President Pranab Mukherjee, who died last week. “To be sure there is an acute dilemma here. Millions of us live in abject poverty. Millions around the world do not have access to enough food, clean water and surroundings, a minimum acceptable standard of living. In the name of development, nature bears the brunt, with its long-term crippling effects on that very quality of life we are trying to improve,” the former Prime Minister said. “But like Sir David, I believe that it is possible for us to respect boundaries, to be aware always of the costs of economic development, and to refrain from excesses, from ignorant or willful actions that ultimately rebound on us,” he added. In her speech, Sonia Gandhi described Sir David as one of Nature’s “most staunch conscience keepers” for over half a century “Sir David is already well known to us all through his prodigious creativity in educating the humankind with brilliant films and books about the natural world. And he has, of late, been the most sensible voice warning us that we, more than anything else, are responsible for the accelerating threat to the environment on our planet,” she said. “When environmental protection has become all the more imperative, when climate change and continued loss of bio-diversity is threatening livelihoods and public health, indeed life on earth, there could not have been a more appropriate choice for an award in her name than Sir David,” added Sonia Gandhi. She said Indira Gandhi despite being born in a political family saw herself as a child of nature, developing a special affinity for mountains, forests, birds and animals from an early age. “As Prime Minister, she became an unwavering champion of environmental protection long before that cause had become popular both in India and abroad. While helping India accelerate the pace of investment and expand its economic infrastructure, she was very sensitive to the imperative of maintaining what she would often call ‘ecological balance’. Her political innings were a search for that balance and a journey of educating her colleagues and the people to preserve that balance,” Sonia Gandhi added. “It is not a surprise, therefore, to find that the legal and institutional framework India now has for protecting its wonderful bio-diversity had been put in place during her tenure as Prime Minister. It bears her personal imprimatur,” the Congress chief said. Describing Sir David as the world’s leading authority on the natural world, she said his passion has been inspiring and is also to reiterate what we all acknowledge. Accepting the award, Sir David said, “We have to change from being nationalists to being international”. He said the world is heading towards an unprecedented crisis. “We have taken over the natural world and are destroying it,” he added. The Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development was instituted in the memory of the former Prime Minister by a trust in her name in 1986. It consists of a monetary award of Rs 25 lakh along with a citation. The award is given to individuals or organisations who work towards ensuring international peace and development, ensuring that scientific discoveries are used to further the scope of freedom and better humanity, and creating new international economic order. Sir David’s work has received widespread recognition across the world. Apart from his knighthood, he has received awards from the Royal Geographical Society, UNESCO’s Kalinga Prize, the Micheal Faraday Prize, the Descartes Prize and Fellowship of the Royal Society, and several Emmy and BAFTA awards. Sir David’s current series with the BBC Natural History Unit - Seven Worlds, One Planet - is broadcast on BBC One on Sunday nights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criticised-for-being-too-selective-in-allowing-projects-that-hurt-environment-former-pm-manmohan-singh/story-Hthwiqw0yEzOavCt8cL82J.html

Both of them have been questioned by the ED multiple times.She is being probed for alleged irregularities in the granting of loans to the Videocon Group.The probes started after a whistle-blower complaint alleged that Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon had invested in a company along with Deepak Kochhar and then transferred his holdings to the latter. The complaint linked this to loans issued by the bank to Videocon.The bank’s board initially backed Chanda Kochhar. However, she stepped down on October 4, 2018. The bank’s board sacked her in January last year, treating her exit as termination.Kochhar defended herself before ED in March 2019 saying the loans were given on merit and have no link with her husband’s business.The ED is probing 24 loans aggregating Rs 7,862 crore during Chanda Kochhar’s tenure as the CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank. The agency believes these loans were given “illegally and criminally” by the bank to the conglomerate when Kochhar was in charge between 2009 and 2018.According to an internal investigation report of ED, reviewed by HT, these loans were sanctioned by the private bank to Videocon Group companies between May 2009 and June 2017.Some of these loans were as high as Rs 2,870 crore (April, 26, 2012, to Videocon Industries Limited [VIL] and its group companies); the most recent was on June 28, 2017 (Rs 166.4 crore to VIL).Other big loans now being investigated by ED include a Rs 536 crore loan to VIL on September 15, 2016; a Rs 881.4 crore loan, also to VIL, on October 31, 2011; Rs 236 crore to VIL on December 23, 2015; and Rs 180 crore to Videocon Hydrocarbons Holdings Ltd on September 30, 2014.CBI and ED both allege that the payment of Rs 64 crore into a Deepak Kochhar company, NuPower Renewables, in 2009 was a quid pro quo from Dhoot for a loan to VIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-deepak-kochhar-husband-of-icici-bank-s-former-ceo-chanda-kochhar-over-money-laundering-charges/story-VMpYr8dtGNJ4BPrr3dAftM.html

Ragini has been arrested in a drug case by the Bengaluru Central Crime Branch and is one of the 12 people named in an FIR filed at the Cottonpet police station in this regard.She along with other accused have been charged under various sections of IPC including 120b (criminal conspiracy) and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1985 under sections 21, 21C, 27A, 27B, and section 29.Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police Crime told the media, “She was produced before the court via video conference. We had sought 10 days of her custody but they have provided her custody to us till Friday.” The public prosecutor told the judge that Ragini had been uncooperative during interrogation citing health reasons and therefore sought 10 days additional custody.In a surprise move though, Ragini through her family has changed her advocate. Senior lawyer Sudarshan who was representing Ragini confirmed that her family through her father had given a written note asking him to retire from the case.The political battle between Congress and BJP continued on the issue of Ragini having campaigned for some of the candidates of the ruling party during elections. Even as Congress spokesperson M Lakshman said that Ragini was a brand ambassador of the BJP, horticulture minister K C Narayana Gowda for whom she had campaigned distanced himself from her. “Neither I nor the party invited her. Some well-wishers of mine invited her and she came and campaigned. The party has nothing to do with her.”Chief minister BS Yediyurappa speaking to the media too reiterated that there was “ no question of protecting anybody”. “Our goal is to put an end to the (drugs) business which is having a bad impact on students and youth. We are doing whatever is necessary (to fight the drug menace).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-drug-probe-court-extends-actor-ragini-dwivedi-s-police-custody-till-friday/story-vDSOHvMD3DpJjEbE5M9VXL.html
07-09-2020||India||2 men who implicated Rhea Chakraborty’s brother in drugs case retract statements||Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar, the two accused who had implicated Rhea Chakraborty’s brother and Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda and domestic help Dipesh Swant, have retracted their statements given to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).The NCB had arrested Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar on August 3. They were remanded in NCB custody. On Saturday, their lawyer Taraq Sayyed requested a Mumbai magistrate to release them on bail, insisting that the statements made by them while in NCB custody should be disregarded as the two had been arm-twisted by the probe agency.Also Read: Rhea Chakraborty files complaint against Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Priyanka Singh“We filed applications when they were produced before the court where they retracted the statements given before NCB officers, and we sought bail for them. This is a bailable offence. Also, the amount of narcotic substance involved is in small quantity which entitles the accused to bail,” said Taraq Sayyed.The magistrate, however, had rejected their bail request. Vilatra and Parihar on Saturday filed a fresh bail request before a special court constituted to try cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The two accused also told the NDPS judge that they had made their statements to the NCB under duress.The NDPS special court hasn’t ruled on their bail request yet. After the NCB insisted that it needed to interrogate the two to build their case, the judge put off the hearing and decided to take up the bail request hearing on Thursday.Also Read: Rhea Chakraborty back at Narcotics Bureau for Day 2 of questioningVilatra and Parihar were arrested by the NCB in the ongoing probe into the allegations of drug use by the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The agency had first arrested Abbas Ali Lakhani (21) with 46 grams of ganja on August 28. On the basis of information given by Lakhani, his supplier Karn Arora was arrested with 13 grams of ganja. Later on the information provided by the two, NCB had arrested Vilatra and Parihar on August 3. NCB had claimed that Parihar had admitted to having purchased marijuana on the instruction of Rhea Chhakraborty’s brother Showik and supplied it to Samuel Miranda.Lawyers say that once an accused retracts his statement, its evidentiary value becomes questionable, and that the courts will have to look into various aspects. But this may not always be an automatic process and would depend on the peculiar circumstances of the case.Rizwan Merchant, a noted lawyer practising criminal law, said, “Once the statement given by the accused is retracted, the evidential value of what is stated becomes questionable. The court will have to see independent evidence other than the statement which can support the prosecution’s case. In Rajput’s case, the conversation on an App can be looked into if it has independent corroboration.” Avdhut Chimalkar, noted lawyer who appeared as special public prosecutor in the case registered against former Narcotics Control Bureau zonal director and senior IPS officer Saji Mohan, explained: “When the accused retracts the statement, the court has to look into various aspects which include the contents. There are contents which are in the exclusive knowledge of the accused, which could not have been even imagined by the investigating officer – in such circumstances the retraction may not be accepted. Further, the accused gives a statement after their arrest and later they retract their statement after the consultation of their lawyer, such retraction may also not be accepted by the court. Of course this has to be proved by leading evidence.” Saji Mohan, who was found in possession of 12 kilograms of heroin, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-men-who-implicated-rhea-chakraborty-s-brother-in-drugs-case-retract-statements/story-Wh26SUqb88dToMJPdbMeMO.html
07-09-2020||India||China using Pakistan for military logistics facilities: US Defence report||The US Department of Defence in its annual report to Congress on ‘Military and Security Developments involving the People’s Republic of China 2020’ has stated that Pakistan is among the countries, which have been chosen by the Beijing for “military logistics facilities”.According to the Defence Department’s report published last week, the PRC is seeking to establish a robust overseas logistics and basing infrastructure to allow the PLA to project and sustain military power at greater distances.“Beyond its current base in Djibouti, the PRC is very likely already considering and planning for additional overseas military logistics facilities to support naval, air and ground forces. The PRC has likely considered locations for PLA military logistics facilities in Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola and Tajikistan,” read the report.The Department further stated that China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) projects in Pakistan dealing with pipelines and port construction intend to decrease Beijing’s reliance on transporting energy resources through strategic chokepoints, such as the Strait of Malacca.“In support of its national strategy, the PRC pursues a range of goals through OBOR to include strengthening its territorial integrity, increasing its energy security and expanding its international influence. Given the Party views the PRC’s security and development interests as complementary, the PRC leverages OBOR to invest in projects along China’s western and southern periphery to improve stability and diminish threats along its borders. Similarly, OBOR projects associated with pipelines and port construction in Pakistan intend to decrease China’s reliance on transporting energy resources through strategic chokepoints, such as the Strait of Malacca,” the department said.China’s Strategic Support Force (SSF) runs tracking, telemetry and command stations in Namibia, Pakistan and Argentina, The Pentagon noted.Further, China has increased its bilateral and multilateral engagement with foreign militaries, including Russia, Pakistan, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as it will improve the PLA’s ability to organise and manage combined operations that integrate foreign forces.“The PRC uses multilateral forums and international organizations to generate new opportunities to expand its influence, strengthen its political influence, promotes strategic messaging that portrays it as a responsible global actor, advance its development interests and limit outside interference in and criticism of its initiatives,” the report said.“Towards these ends, the PRC has embraced multilateral organizations suchas Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as forums and initiatives such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, the “17+1” initiative between China and 17 Central and Eastern European countries, and the Belt and Road Forum,” the report read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-using-pakistan-for-military-logistics-facilities-us-defence-report/story-DnvYw71pHmC8DiT3Z3Ie8N.html
07-09-2020||India||‘Incident happened’: Arunachal Pradesh police on abduction of 5 men in region||Arunachal Pradesh police on Monday confirmed that the alleged abduction of five men from the state by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) last week did take place. “I spoke to the family members of the 5 missing youths, but till date they have not lodged any formal complaint. In fact, the incident has happened. I can only tell you that much,” Taru Gussar, Superintendent of Police, Upper Subansiri district told HT. The 5 young men from Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for the Indian Army, had gone missing on Thursday reportedly from Sera-7 on the Indian side of the McMohan line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Two other men who were with the missing five reportedly managed to ‘escape’. “According to a statement by relatives of the young men and the people accompanying them who have come back, they have not seen the abduction themselves. But they assume that these 5 young men have been abducted by the Chinese,” Gussar said. “It is difficult to say whether the incident happened on the Indian side or the Chinese side. We are in constant touch with the Indian Army. They are doing their own investigation and the local police are also trying to gather whatever information possible,” he added. On Monday, China’s state affiliated Global Times tweeted quoting Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian-“China has never recognized so called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’, which is China’s south Tibet region, and we have no details to release yet about questions on the Indian Army sending messages to PLA about five missing Indians in the region”. The matter about the missing men came to light after a brother of one of the 5 men wrote about it on social media. Though the family members were yet to lodge complaints with the police, two politicians from the state Tapir Gao, BJP Lok Sabha MP from Arunachal East and Ninong Ering, Congress MLA from Pasighat tweeted about it. A police team sent to the border on Saturday to verify the incident is yet to report on it. The Indian Army, who had engaged the youths as porters, is also yet to give any update. On Sunday evening, Union sports minister and BJP MP from Arunchal West Kiren Rijiju tweeted that the Indian Army has sent a hotline message to PLA about the missing men, but was yet to get any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incident-happened-arunachal-pradesh-police-on-abduction-of-5-men-in-region/story-RIWZOFypR3QSnq55UbPAQO.html

Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-maneuvering hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. India could develop hypersonic cruise missiles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines in about four years, a top government officer said on the condition of anonymity. Mach 6 translates into a speed of 7,408 kmph. IN PICS:| DRDO successfully test fires hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle“The DRDO has successfully demonstrated the hypersonic air-breathing scramjet technology with the flight test of HSTDV at 1103 hours from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam launch complex at Wheeler Island off the coast of Odisha on Monday,” the defence ministry statement said. An improvement over the ramjet technology, the scramjet engine operates efficiently at hypersonic speeds and allows supersonic combustion. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds in excess of Mach 5. The hypersonic cruise vehicle was launched using a proven solid rocket motor that took it to an altitude of 30 km where the aerodynamic heat shields were separated at a hypersonic Mach number, the statement said. “The cruise vehicle separated from the launch vehicle and the air intake opened as planned. The hypersonic combustion sustained and the cruise vehicle continued on its desired flight path at a velocity of six times the speed of sound or nearly 2 km/second for more than 20 seconds,” the statement said. The first test of the HSTDV in June 2019 failed to meet mission parameters. Developing hypersonic missiles will require the cruise vehicle to travel at speeds above Mach 6 for a few 100 seconds for the weapon to strike its target, said a second official, requesting anonymity. “Critical events like fuel injection and auto ignition of scramjet demonstrated technological maturity. The scramjet engine performed in a text book manner,” the statement said. The parameters of launch and cruise vehicle, including the scramjet engine, were monitored by multiple tracking radars, electro-optical systems and telemetry stations, with the engine working efficiently at high dynamic pressure and very high temperature, it added. A warship was deployed in the Bay of Bengal to monitor the performance during the cruise phase of hypersonic vehicle. All the performance parameters indicated a “resounding success” of the mission, the statement said. “This marks a technological breakthrough for the country. The successful mission will enable us to develop many more critical technologies and pave the way for hypersonic vehicle development,” DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy told Hindustan Times. The flight test has proven a raft of critical technologies including aerodynamic configuration for hypersonic maneuvers, use of scramjet propulsion for ignition and sustained combustion at hypersonic flow, thermo-structural characterisation of high temperature materials and separation mechanism at hypersonic velocities, the defence ministry said. With hypersonic vehicles being the key to defeating missile defences, the successful flight of the technology demonstrator vehicle is an important milestone, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “This has been some time in the making and the challenge now is to make a time-bound transition to the prototype testing phase. China is quite ahead in hypersonics and India cannot afford to lag behind,” Bahadur said. The dual-use hypersonic technology has non-military applications too --- it can be used for launching satellites and developing commercial planes, experts said. Defence minister Rajnath, who spoke with scientists associated with the critical project, congratulated the DRDO on the “landmark achievement” towards realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. “The DRDO has today successfully flight tested the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle using the indigenously developed scramjet propulsion system. With this success, all critical technologies are now established to progress to the next phase,” defence minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter. Reddy congratulated the scientists, researchers and other personnel associated with the mission for their “resolute and unwavering efforts” towards strengthening the country’s defence capabilities. Why is the successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) significant? It paves the way for India to develop hypersonic weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6). The weapon will be integrated into the hypersonic vehicle. Which other countries have developed hypersonic technology? Only the US, Russia and China have developed technologies to field hypersonic weapons that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. India could develop hypersonic missiles in four years. What will the development of hypersonic missiles entail? In Monday’s test, the cruise vehicle continued on its flight path at Mach 6 speeds or nearly 2 km/second for more than 20 seconds. The next challenge for India will be ensure the cruise vehicle can travel at those speeds for a few 100 seconds for the weapon to strike its target. What are the main challenges for hypersonic flights? Extremely high temperatures and aerodynamic forces make hypersonic flights tricky. The successful flight test proved several critical technologies including aerodynamic configuration for hypersonic maneuvers, use of scramjet propulsion for ignition and separation mechanism at speeds in excess of Mach 6. Why are hypersonic vehicles powered by scramjet engines? An improvement over the ramjet technology, the scramjet engine operates efficiently at hypersonic speeds and allows supersonic combustion. Ramjet engines are efficient at supersonic speeds of around Mach 3 but their performance drops when the vehicle hits hypersonic speeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-takes-first-step-towards-developing-hypersonic-missiles/story-lwpdbN7LhNkgyd4it2KjeN.html

07-09-2020||India||Presence of antibodies may not guarantee protection from Covid-19, say scientists||The presence of antibodies indicates previous exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may not always translate into protection against the disease, say scientists, citing imponderables such as what kind of antibodies, how many and how long they last.   As worries over India’s Covid-19 spike mount – the country added 90,062 cases on Monday to take its tally past the 42-lakh mark – scientists are grappling with the pivotal issue of antibodies and trying to understand how they impact on the progression of the disease. But the jury is still out there with several studies and hypotheses but no consensus yet. The only thing that can be said with any degree of uncertainty is that antibodies is a sign that the person has already been infected with the novel coronavirus, the scientists said. Immunologist Satyajit Rath said he would prefer to “wait and see” where the evidence goes.Antibody presence in itself tells us nothing about disease progression in individuals, said the scientist from New Delhi’s National Institute of Immunology (NII).There are neutralising antibodies (nAbs) and also ‘simple’ antibodies. While nAbs produced against the novel coronavirus can block its entry into the host cell, other antibodies are also generated against many parts of the virus, added Vineeta Bal from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER).  The ‘simple’ antibodies are an indication of host response to viral presence but are not that useful to stop further spread of the virus, Bal told PTI.“Simple presence of antibodies is a clear indication of previous exposure to SARS-CoV2 but does not necessarily guarantee protection from the disease in the absence of neutralising antibodies,” the immunologist added.“Presence of nAbs in sufficient concentrations and for longer period is the most likely indicator of protection of the individual from next exposure leading to illness i.e. Covid-19,” she explained.Bal also noted that there is no consensus on what levels of nAbs are ‘protective’ from the public health perspective or to ensure that plasma therapy is likely to be useful.Different sero-survey tests have been conducted in India in the last few months with the aim of indicating the actual number of infected cases in the country.  A sero-survey involves testing the blood serum of a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies against that infection to know who has been infected in the past and has now recovered.  Surveys carried across metros suggest that Covid-19 cases are far more than actually reported.According to Rath, one of the many problems in looking for easy patterns in the serological evidence is that not everyone is using the same antibody tests.“In fact, all antibody tests in the market are not against the same viral protein target, and some investigators use only one target, others use more. And it is possible that tests differ in their sensitivity,” Rath told PTI.The scientist also noted that most surveys are reporting people as just ‘positive’ or ‘negative’, and not analysing antibody levels present in the blood.  So far, the limited evidence available does indicate that these antibody tests seem to correlate with “protective” antibody levels too. However, there is not much that can be said to individual people about their risk of reinfection or their level of protection.  Different studies, including one published recently in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, have also suggested that people infected with Covid-19 develop neutralising antibodies that can protect them from reinfection.  However, reinfection cases reported recently from across the world have dented that optimism.  Shining more light on the issue, Bal said reinfection of an individual does not mean he or she becomes ill with Covid-19.Even the presence of enough nAbs capable of neutralising a variant virus will not necessarily prevent infection, said Bal. However, in all probability, such a person with ‘protective immunity’ is likely to handle subsequent infections -- including what is currently reported as reinfection -- better and with less morbidity than otherwise.  “Reinfections should not be equated with disease due to repeat exposure to the same or related virus,” she said, adding that the recent case of reinfection in the person in Hong Kong was discovered due to screening test rather than symptoms.While it is not clearly known whether people who generate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are protected from reinfection, scientists also don’t know how long those antibodies persist.A study published in the NEJM journal on September 1 found that antibodies against the new coronavirus endure in the body for four months after infection, countering earlier evidence suggesting these important immune molecules disappear quickly.The study measured the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood of roughly 30,000 people, including more than 1,200 who had tested positive for the virus and recovered from Covid-19 in Iceland.Around 90 per cent of the recovered people had antibodies against the virus.“Based on the Iceland study, we know that antibodies generated by natural infection can last for four months, maybe longer,” said Bal.At the moment, there is no idea what percentage of previously exposed people will be susceptible to antibody mediated enhancement of the disease (ADE) when re-exposed to a variant of SARS-CoV-2 or a related virus, she added.ADE is a phenomenon in which the binding of a virus to antibodies enhances its entry into host cells followed by its replication. It is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies.Rath noted that the Iceland study seems to be quite thorough in many respects, and shows antibody persistence till about four months.  “Is this going to be the case everywhere? I have no guess to offer I am afraid… As far as disease progression in communities goes, the antibody evidence does tell us how much the virus has spread and in which locations-communities, although we need to do much more detailed and repeated sero-surveys to be able to learn anything more than ‘it has spread quite a bit, or maybe a lot’,” Rath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/presence-of-antibodies-may-not-guarantee-protection-from-covid-19-say-scientists/story-SPoKj5xUVVXL9vzaVMtDNN.html

07-09-2020||India||Ram Madhav attends Tibetan soldier’s funeral in Ladakh||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ram Madhav’s presence at the official funeral of a Tibetan soldier from the secretive Special Frontier Force (SFF) on Monday created a flutter in diplomatic and political circles amid the border standoff with China. BJP MP from Jamyang, Tsering Namgyal, attended the funeral with Ram Madhav at Choglamasar, Ladakh, around 7.30am, the former’s personal secretary said. Namgyal’s secretary said Ram Madhav had reached Leh on Sunday where he attended and addressed the first executive meeting of the newly formed unit of the BJP in the UT of Ladakh. “Hon’ble National General Secretary Bharatiya Janata Party arrives at BJP Head Quarters Leh, Ladakh for the inaugural State Executive Meeting,” Namgyal had posted on his Twitter handle on Sunday. The funeral of SFF company leader Nyima Tenzin, killed in a landmine blast in an operation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) during August 29-30, was held at Leh in the Union Territory of Ladakh. The funeral cortege was joined by scores of cars and motorcycles and people waving the Indian and Tibetan flags. Tenzin’s coffin, carried in an army truck, was draped in the Indian tricolour and Tibetan flag, which were handed over to his widow at the funeral. Experts noted this was probably the first time an SFF personnel who died in action was given a public funeral, complete with military honours and a volley of shots by a ceremonial guard. BJP national general secretary Madhav posted photos of the funeral and paid tribute to Tenzin on Twitter but subsequently deleted the tweet. Screenshots of his tweet, which were widely shared, showed he had posted: “Attended [the] funeral of SFF Coy Ldr Nyima Tenzin, a Tibetan who laid down his life protecting our borders in Ladakh, and laid a wreath as a tribute. Let [the] sacrifices of such valiant soldiers bring peace along the Indo-Tibetan border. That will be [the] real tribute to all martyrs.” People present at the funeral shouted slogans such as “Bharat Mata ki jai”, “Tibet desh ki jai”, “Vikas Regiment zindabad” and “We salute Tenzin”. SFF is also known as Establishment 22 and Vikas Regiment. Banners put up at the funeral site by SFF ex-servicemen described Tenzin as a soldier who “sacrificed his life to protect his second homeland India fighting common enemy China”. Madhav spoke to the media at the funeral, saying in Hindi that he hoped Tenzin’s sacrifice “will bring peace to the border” and that “efforts are on to end the tension”. He added, “We hope peace will be restored soon.” People familiar with developments said Madhav hadn’t attended the funeral as a representative of the government. On Sunday, Madhav began a two-day visit to the Union Territory that was carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir after its special status was scrapped in August 2019. However, the move marks a shift from the government’s reported decision in early 2018 asking officials and leaders to skip events which were being organised at the time to mark the Dalai Lama’s 60 years in exile. As the government worked to improve ties with China, especially through the mechanism of informal summits, the Tibet issue was largely sidelined. SFF was raised with former Tibetan guerrillas in 1962 and went on to see action during the 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh and the 1999 Kargil conflict. It is led by army officers and most of its personnel are men of Tibetan origin. Senior journalist and political analyst of J&K and Ladakh UTs, Zafar Choudhary said, “Ram Madhav’s presence at the funeral and choice of words in his tweet was clearly a signal to China that India would like to see Tibet a disputed territory. He mentioned desire for peace along “India-Tibet border” instead of “India-China border”. However, his decision to delete the tweet soon after suggests that the Government or the entire party may not be in complete agreement with him on giving China such a strong message”. Amitabh Mathur, a former special secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) who advised the government on issues related to Tibet, said it made sense for India to use a force such as SFF in the current scenario because of the special skills of its personnel. “They are used to operating at high altitudes and it would be an enormous waste if they are kept away from the terrain where they are most useful,” he said. However, he said the Indian side will have to ensure that their use is followed up with other messages that reach the overall Tibetan community, and a consistent policy. “There has to be some sort of gesture, an overt sign and this message should reach the Tibetans in Tibet,” he added.

But while the pandemic has claimed lives in all states and union territories—Mizoram in the country’s northeast has been an exception. The small state with a population of 10.91 lakh (2011 census), which recorded 1,114 Covid-19 positive cases till Sunday, is yet to witness any death due to the disease. “Fortunately, we have had not Covid-19 deaths in our state yet. One reason for that could be the fact that most of the cases we have had till now have been of young people and very few above the age of 50,” said Dr. Eric Zomawia, mission director of National Health Mission (NHM) Mizoram. “We have noticed that most patients in Mizoram have had no co-morbidity and been largely asymptomatic. Due to proper care at the hospitals and Covid-19 centres, they have been recovering well,” he added. Mizoram recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 24, when a 50-year-old pastor who had returned from a trip to Netherlands, tested positive. After spending over a month in hospital he was found negative on April 27. The state didn’t record any positive case after the first case for over two months when 12 new cases were recorded on June 2 nearly a month after the ban on inter-state movement was lifted on May 4. “We have been lucky that most patients have been asymptomatic. As on Monday, we have 382 active cases, but none of them are admitted in intensive care unit (ICU),” said Mizoram health secretary H Lalengmawia. When the Covid-19 pandemic started in the country, Mizoram didn’t have a testing laboratory and had to rely on labs in neighbouring states for tests. Now the state has one RT-PCR lab and another where True-Nat tests are conducted. Till Sunday, 45,073 tests had been conducted across the state. The positivity rate in the state is just 2.47%. The state has conducted nearly 41,000 tests per million population, till Sunday. “We were one of the first states to start screening at airports and also sealed the state’s international border points with Bangladesh and Myanmar very early preventing movement of people from those countries,” said Lalengmawia. “The Mizo society is a very disciplined one and all guidelines issued by the state government regarding restrictions and safety have been scrupulously followed by the general public. That has helped us in containing the pandemic to manageable proportions,” he added. Unlike most other states, civil society groups and the church (Mizoram has a Christian population of around 87%) have actively joined hands with the government in ensuring compliance of Covid-19-related guidelines and helping in tackling the disease. “We have been working with close coordination with Young Mizo Association (YMA), the largest organization in the state, which is helping us in manning the borders as well as implementation of lockdown guidelines across the state through its units,” said Lalengmawia. “As Mizoram is a largely Christian community, the church is also playing a crucial role allowing us to set up quarantine centres in churches and schools run by them,” he added. President of YMA Vanlalruata told HT that their organization, which has around 4.6 lakh members within and outside the state, has been actively involved since March in implementing government’s guidelines on Covid-19 both at the state’s borders and across the state. “We have more 1,000 churches across Mizoram and several of them are being used as quarantine centres,” said Rev. K Lalrinmawia, executive secretary of Mizoram Presbyterian Church (MPC), the largest church body in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-deaths-across-india-mizoram-is-yet-to-record-any-fatality/story-TZEI60rks1pkFFBYtQIsmK.html

Interestingly, the Congress is the alliance partner of the JMM-led government in Jharkhand. However, the party that claims Right to Information (RTI) as the brainchild of Manmohan Singh government, appears helpless in the eastern state where it is in power.The posts of information commissioners (ICs) became vacant one by one in Jharkhand state information commission (JSIC) over the years.The JSIC continued with acting chief information commissioner (CIC) Himanshu Chaudhary and two ICs for nearly three years in the past, as the previous BJP government was reluctant to fill in the vacancies.Cases piled up and the purpose of the flagship scheme - to bring in transparency in government functioning - got defeated. About 6,000 appeals were pending, it was learnt.It became all the more critical in May this year when the state commission became headless after the term of acting chief information commissioner (CIC) Himanshu Chaudhary ended. Interestingly, there was no permanent CIC in Jharkhand after the completion of Aditya Swaroop’s term.Upon completing his term in May, Chaudhary had told chief minister Hemant Soren to fill the vacancies at the earliest. He told the media that he could dispose of 4,414 cases after hearing out a total of 29,832 appeals and fixed penalties in 198 cases.After Chaudhary’sdeparture, about 30 employees of JSIC are practically without work.Significantly, it (absence of CIC) impacted the employees who are not regular. The salary payment of two on contract, four daily wage earners and 10 home guard jawans deputed in JSIC were on hold since June in want of the disbursing officer - the CIC.Personnel department joint secretary Sudhir Kumar Ranjan said the government in January had advertised for the posts. “We have received applications as well but the matter remains pending in want of clear cut directives from the government and the state assembly,” he said.Elaborating, he said the delay was caused as there was no leader of the opposition (LoP) in Jharkhand.According to the RTI Act 2005, there should be at least five ICs besides the CIC in state information commission. The posts are filled up through a process that includes scrutiny of applications by a committee comprising the chief minister as chairperson, a cabinet rank minister and the LoP. After scrutiny and selection, the list is sent to Raj Bhawan for governor’s approval following which appointments are made, he said.The Hemant Soren government has nominated transport minister Champai Soren as a member but the committee is incomplete without the LoP, said Ranjan. He said the department also approached the state assembly underlining the provision, which has the mention that the leader of the largest group can also be nominated in absence of the LoP. He said the assembly has not replied till date.BJP state president Deepak Prakash said the JMM-led coalition government was delaying it intentionally. “It’s a conspiracy to keep information under the carpet,” he said, adding that the government does not want people to know its “misdeeds”.Prakash said the BJP has already elected Babulal Marandi the LoP and the delay was therefore uncalled for. The assembly was deliberately keeping the matter in abeyance, he said.JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said the issue of the LoP was in the domain of the assembly speaker and therefore the party should not comment on it.Congress state president and minister in the Hemant Soren cabinet said his party supports the RTI. “It is useful for common people, the pandemic due to the spread of coronavirus might have delayed the process of filling the vacancies,” he said.Whatever might be the reason, the defunct JSIC has brought to fore the debate of transparency, besides the issue of salary due to 16 staff there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rti-in-poor-shape-in-jharkhand-where-it-is-a-coalition-partner/story-kmbr1g4cLLoinhtJjOftLP.html

Gupta is also the chairperson of the medical board formed in Rajput’s death case.A five-member medical board of forensic experts was formed by AIIMS in August to look into the autopsy files related to Rajput’s death, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) approached the hospital for assistance.“We will look into the possibility of murder. However, all probable angles will be thoroughly examined,” Dr Gupta had told PTI.He had said the team will evaluate the injury pattern on Rajput’s body and correlate it with circumstantial evidence. “The preserved viscera will be examined and the anti-depressants that were given to Rajput will also be analysed at the AIIMS laboratory,” Gupta said.CBI had approached AIIMS for its medico-legal opinion in the case. In a letter to the premier medical institute, the central probe agency said it will provide the team of forensic experts with the necessary medical papers, post-mortem reports, videographs and viscera reports at the earliest.Meanwhile, actor Rhea Chakraborty is being questioned by officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Mumbai or the second day as part of its ongoing investigation related to the Rajput death case. Chakraborty was also interrogated by the NCB on Sunday.NCB has arrested Rhea’s brother Showik and Rajput’s house keeping staff Samuel Miranda for their role in the procurement and handling of drugs. They have also arrested Dipesh Sawant, Rajput’s house help, among other people.Sawant, NCB officials have said, is an active member of a drug syndicate connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-aiims-forensic-team-conducts-test-to-check-for-poisoning/story-y38eTZhrQVRCjPbzcHv9KK.html
07-09-2020||India||Monsoon likely to continue, more rain from third week of September: IMD||The country is likely to see normal to above normal rainfall in September, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Monday. In the second week of September, monsoon rain is likely to be deficient in most parts of the country, including northwest and central India. But it is likely to resume after September 17.“We have indicated in our weekly weather update that withdrawal of monsoon may begin from western parts of Rajasthan in the week ending September 18. But we are also expecting a low-pressure area to develop over west central Bay of Bengal around that time. So, while withdrawal of monsoon may begin, but we are still studying as to when it’s likely to completely withdraw. We are expecting normal to above normal rain in Kerala, Karnataka and coastal areas of Maharashtra around and after September 17,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, in a press conference on Monday.The usual date for monsoon to begin withdrawing is September 17.Also Read: Warmer Arabian Sea led to intense rain in AugustHe added that the intra-seasonal variability of monsoon rain was high this year, with June receiving excess rain; July seeing a deficit and August recording excess rain by a very high margin. “Active MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation—the MJO is characterised as an eastward movement of clouds and rainfall near the equator that recurs every 30 to 60 days) and cold El Nino neutral conditions also favoured good rain in August. Rain in September is likely to be normal or above normal,” Mohapatra added.A cool El Nino neutral phase indicates that the sea’s surface temperature is cooler than normal in the tropical Pacific Ocean. It is usually linked to above-normal monsoon rain in India.Also Read: After rain reduces, Mumbai faces heat; pollution levels rise“This year, the good monsoon should have helped farmers and the output must be very good. We don’t have an assessment as to how it will impact the economy,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences. Monsoon rain over the country is 8% in excess since June 1 with 1% in excess over east and northeast India; 10% deficient over northwest India; 16% in excess over central India and 21% in excess over the south peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-continue-more-rain-from-third-week-of-september-imd/story-jjtarxDWw3vG5HjkMeVsdI.html

Santosh Trivedi (32), the priest, had started the protest on June 12. He used to sit outside the temple and meditate as a mark of protest. He has been demanding the dissolution of the Board which was formed following the passage of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019. Vinod Shukla, the president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, said, “We have been protesting for months, but the state government has not paid any heed to our demands. Even in such extreme temperatures in Kedarnath, Trivedi would protest bare-chested outside the shrine and eat only one meal a day. His health condition has worsened. He has been admitted to AIIMS in Rishikesh for treatment.” Shukla said the public in the Kedarnath valley is angry with the state government’s lack of response. He threatened to intensify protests across all the Char Dham shrines, if anything untoward happens to Trivedi. Vineet Kumar, an official from State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), said they received a call from police in the early morning on Monday about the worsening health condition of a member of the Kedarnath temple committee. “A team rushed to the shrine and brought the priest to Lincholi on a stretcher, from where he was airlifted to Dehradun for treatment,” said the SDRF official. Harish Thapliyal, the public relations officer (PRO) at AIIMS, Rishikesh, said that Trivedi was admitted to the hospital on Monday at around 11.30 am with abdominal pain. “A priest from Kedarnath, Santosh Trivedi, was admitted to the hospital at around 11.30 am on Monday. He complained of pain in his lower abdomen and was administered medicines accordingly. Doctors have taken his swab samples for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) test as per the protocol. He is being examined further,” said Thapliyal. BD Singh, additional chief executive officer (CEO) of the Board, said that they have learnt about the priest’s worsening health condition and are taking updates from police and SDRF. “We have learnt that the priest’s health condition has worsened. We are in touch with the authorities concerned. Uttarakhand high court has given a judgement in the favour of the state government. Despite the verdict, the priests have been demanding the dissolution of the Board and all their rights are preserved. They must give up their protests and point out which parts of Act that they disagree with. A solution can be found based on their objections,” said Singh.On June 21, the high court had dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha (RS) member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and 51 other shrines through the formation of the Board. The court had ruled that the ownership of the temple properties would vest in Char Dham shrines and power of the Board would be confined to the administration and management of the properties. Last December, the Uttarakhand assembly had passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill. In January, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent for the Act. Aggrieved priests had threatened that they would move the court against the Act, as they claimed to have been kept in the dark about the new law. They had alleged that the state government took the step to ensure its control over shrine-related issues and bypassed the powerful priest community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-at-kedarnath-shrine-since-june-priest-airlifted-to-aiims-as-his-health-deteriorates/story-37mhWvn9AksMmEtcCztJ9O.html
07-09-2020||India||Colour-coded e-pass system to ensure maximum 400 passengers board a metro train||A colour-coded e-pass system using a mobile phone has been developed by a technology solutions company here for ensuring that a maximum of 400 passengers board a Metro Railway train in the city to maintain Covid-19 health safety protocol after it resumes service.Sanjay Chatterjee, network and security solutions head of Ideation Technology, which was asked by the Metro authorities to develop the system, said that a bot-based (web robot) technology will be used to generate e-passes that will be colour-coded to ensure that only authorised passengers enter the stations at a given time in order to maintain the maximum passenger count.“The main challenge was to come up with a solution which can be easily used by people - those who have smartphones and also those who have analogue phones; without installing any app,” he told PTI.“So we came up with a simple technology, we have developed a system similar to that of Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger, wherein one can start it by just clicking open a link,” Chatterjee said.He said that a bot is being used for the purpose wherein it will ask the intending passenger his or her name, the boarding station, destination and the preferred time slot.A passenger will be given a total of five questions, including one on language option, which he has to answer using the link in the mobile phone.Chatterjee said that the passengers will have three language options - Bengali, Hindi and English.“The Metro authorities have told us that a maximum of 400 passengers can be carried in a train at any point of time, based on that either the chosen time slot will be given and if the number of passengers has already reached the threshold, a different time slot will be asked for from the intending passenger,” he said, adding that the process will not take more than 10 to 12 seconds.Chatterjee said that on the basis of availability, QR code will be generated immediately and e-pass will be given online to the user.He said that the e-passes will be colour coded based on the hourly time slots.“The colour code will help easy validation by security personnel of the e-passes as per the time slots and thus avoid queues at the entry points at stations,” Chatterjee said.He said that for example, if yellow colour code is being used for a particular hour slot, a passenger with a different colour-coded e-pass will not be allowed to enter a station at the time.The West Bengal government last week proposed developing a system to issue e-passes to commuters for entering Metro Railway stations during a meeting between senior Metro and state officials to ensure maintenance of social distancing norms.Senior officials of the Metro Railway and the state government met for the second time on Friday last to discuss the modalities regarding maintaining social distancing norms and crowd management, according to a Metro spokesperson.The developer of the system for issuing e-passes explained it to the committee during the meeting, the spokesperson said.Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi has said that the final date for resumption of the city’s rapid transit system will be fixed shortly.The Union Home Ministry has issued Unlock 4 guidelines under which Metro railway services in cities will be allowed to resume from September 7 in a graded manner.The West Bengal government had written to the Railway Board seeking resumption of Metro and suburban train services in a limited manner maintaining the norms of physical distancing and health and hygiene protocols.The state government has also issued an order allowing the Metro authorities to resume services in the city in a graded manner from September 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/colour-coded-e-pass-system-to-ensure-maximum-400-passengers-board-a-metro-train/story-zhynHtX30nxgfN1NomZjwI.html

The two leaders are meeting on the sidelines of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) ministerial hosted by Russian Federation. The time of the meeting is being finalised.While EAM Jaishankar will arrive in Moscow on Tuesday evening with desk officers of China division, Foreign minister Wang will reach the next day to discuss the border escalation in Ladakh. The much awaited meeting of foreign ministers is expected to record a forward movement towards complete disengagement and de-escalation of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with the Indian side insistent upon China to follow bilateral agreements and protocols since 1993.Although Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met his Chinese counterpart Gen Wei Fenghe on the same platform on September 5, but the talks did not yield any result with both sides merely stating their formal positions. The meeting took place after Indian Army troops pre-empted a PLA aggression on south of Pangong Tso on August 29-30 and occupied the Rezang La ridgeline without either yielding to Chinese show of military strength or allowing them to cross the Indian perception of Line of Actual Control (LAC). Also Watch | Chinese army kidnapped 5 youths from Arunachal Pradesh: Congress leaderDuring the meeting, foreign minister Jaishankar will remind his Chinese counterpart to implement the past bilateral agreements in letter and spirit including keeping minimum forces along the 3488km LAC. He will also demand that PLA forces restore status quo ante at Gogra-Hot Springs, Finger 4 relief feature on the north bank of Pangong Tso.Since the Indian pre-emption on August 29-30, the Xi Jinping regime has been asking the Indian Army to withdraw from their new positions south of Pangong Tso. It is understood that the Chinese Communist Government’s move to deflect domestic discontent by invoking nationalism in Ladakh and South China Sea has not worked. According to China watchers, the PLA aggression in Ladakh will continue till such time CCP General Secretary XI is able to control the internal dissent whether it be on count of language as in Inner Mongolia, floods, economy or coronavirus which initiated from Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-minister-wang-yi-reaching-moscow-to-discuss-total-disengagement-in-ladakh-with-jaishankar/story-K9rfl23TUR8Yu7tO4CPuIM.html

These migratory birds come to the water streams and water bodies in Jodhpur every year by flying thousands of kilometers for a pleasant stay during the winter.So far, four swarms of kurjaa have reached Khichan village in Jodhpur district.“Last year the first swarm of kurjaa reached on September 4, but on September 1 this year, three swarms were sighted together. More than 350 kurjaa have come here in four swarms in the last six days,” said a local bird watcher Sewaram Mali.He said that in the next few days, there is a possibility that thousands of these winged guests will reach the Jodhpur village.They usually arrive in Jodhpur in the first week of September and begin retiring to home places by the last week of March.Wildlife expert Dr Hem Singh Gehlot said it was a pleasantly good sign that migratory birds have started knocking the water bodies of Jodhpur. He said every year, about 100 species of migratory birds fly into India, either in search of food or to escape the severe winter of their native habitat.In Indian subcontinent, majority of migratory birds are winter migrants, he said, adding the winter migrants from central Asia and Siberia, Asia Minor, Arabia, Central and NE Asia, East Asia, Mongolia, North Eastern China, Europe and Arctic region, arrive through different migratory routes in the country during September to March.Demoiselle crane is one of Avian migrant species which fly over distances of thousands of kilometers in order to find the best ecological conditions and habitats for feeding, breeding and raising their young, he further said.The Demoiselle crane’s conservation status is “Least Concern” under version 3.1 of IUCN Red List Categories (2012).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-350-demoiselle-cranes-spotted-early-in-jodhpur-village/story-MyHfFbQZVgvGuRz0gQ9qyO.html

Choksi, a fugitive Indian-born fugitive businessman, who has taken the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in the Caribbean islands, is a key accused in the Rs13,500-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case along with his nephew Nirav Modi.Bad Boy Billionaires focuses on the fraud committed by many high-profile business tycoons in the country. The poster released by Netflix shows Modi; Subrata Roy, the managing worker and chairman of Sahara India Pariwar; Vijay Mallya, the chairman of United Breweries (UB) Group; and Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Satyam Computer Services.A two-member HC bench, comprising Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan, issued notice to the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) and Netflix on the appeal filed through advocate Vijay Aggarwal after Choksi was denied relief by a single judge, who had asked him to file a civil suit and dismissed the plea.Also Read: There’s no relief for the bad boy, Mehul ChoksiOn August 28, Justice Navin Chawla had dismissed a plea by Choksi, the uncle of diamantaire Modi, seeking a pre-release screening of Bad Boy Billionaires to be aired on Netflix on September 2 while stating that Choksi may file a civil suit seeking relief.Justice Chawla had said that the alleged infringement by him is a private right and cannot be granted by the court. The judge had also said that there are no regulations to control the content on the OTT.On Monday, Choksi’s counsel contended that his petition was dismissed on the ground that it is a private right and the matter is not maintainable even though it is his constitutional right.He said that Choksi is facing trial and in some of the cases where he is a co-accused, a charge sheet has been filed. He contended that Choksi’s case and trial would be prejudiced if the docuseries is aired. He said that Choksi is under investigation and has a right to fair trial and investigation.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, who appeared for Netflix, opposed the plea stating that the single judge has dismissed the plea stating that a civil suit. He said that the plea is not maintainable as no party can come to the court in a bid to satisfy him.The court issued notice to the respondents seeking to know their stand and posted the matter for the next hearing on September 23.The petition said that Choksi got to know of the documentary’s release on August 24 when he saw the trailer following which he was flooded with phone calls from across the world. The callers, including from Delhi, asked Choksi whether he was part of the documentary and to solicit his comments.The petition stated that Choksi feared that his name could be used in connection with Modi in the documentary even though his relation to the fugitive diamantaire is only that of an uncle and a nephew.The petition also stated the series might have an episode on Choksi, which could lead to a media trial. It cited that the petitioner has the right to free and fair trial and such a documentary would cause serious prejudice to his case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-boy-billionaires-delhi-hc-seeks-response-from-centre-netflix-on-mehul-choksi-plea/story-7f5ARRjToEVfbfi9SnW6PP.html

This indigenous technology will pave the way towards development of missiles travelling at six times the speed of sound (Mach 6).The test of Hypersonic Test Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV), developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was conducted at 11.03 am today using the Agni missile booster and lasted for five minutes.People aware of the development said this test means that the DRDO will have the capacity to develop a hypersonic missile with scramjet engine in next five years, which will have the capacity to travel at more than two kilometres per second. The test was led by DRDO chief Satheesh Reddy and his hypersonic missile team. The HSTDV performed on all parametres, including combustion chamber pressure, air intake and control guidance, the agency said.Watch: India successfully tests hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicleAt 11.03 am, the Agni missile booster took the hypersonic vehicle to height of 30 km after which the latter separated. Thereafter, the vehicle’s air intake opened and that led to successfully firing of the test scramjet engine. The combustion lasted for more than 20 seconds with the vehicle achieving a speed of Mach 6. “The vehicle performed successfully on all the pre-determined parametres including the ability to handle combustion temperatures of over 2500 degrees Celsius as well as air speed,” said a senior official.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO immediately after the test and praised their efforts to indigenously build a scramjet engine.He said that it is a landmark achievement towards realising the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India).“The @DRDO_India has today successfully flight tested the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle using the indigenously developed scramjet propulsion system. With this success, all critical technologies are now established to progress to the next phase,” Singh tweeted. The @DRDO_India has today successfully flight tested the Hypersonic Technology Demontrator Vehicle using the indigenously developed scramjet propulsion system. With this success, all critical technologies are now established to progress to the next phase.“I congratulate to DRDO on this landmark achievement towards realising the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.

With this mission, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has demonstrated capabilities for developing highly complex technology that will serve as the building block for next generation hypersonic weapons that can travel at six times the speed of sound, the officials said. The first flight test of the HSTDV last June was unsuccessful. DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy congratulated all the scientists, researchers and other personnel associated with the mission for their resolute and unwavering efforts towards strengthening the country’s defence capabilities. “The DRDO has today successfully flight tested the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle using the indigenously developed scramjet propulsion system.

07-09-2020||India||Ram temple construction committee chairman Nripendra Mishra’s visit to Ayodhya begins today||Nripendra Misra, the chairman of Ram Mandir construction committee, will visit Ayodhya on Monday to review preparations for the construction of the shrine. Misra along with the members of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust will inspect the Ram Janmabhoomi campus and will meet engineers of the Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the construction company that has been awarded the contract of the project.Also read: Heavy casagrande machine reaches Ayodhya for Ram Mandir constructionDuring his two-day visit, Misra will also discuss the temple’s layout plan with architects Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura – the sons of Chandrakant Sompura, the main architect of the Ram Mandir. The Sompuras are expected to reach Ayodhya from Ahmedabad on Tuesday. If the Sompuras cannot reach Ayodhya on Tuesday, then a virtual meeting is likely to be held to discuss the modalities about the construction of the temple. The Trust is set to start the construction of the Ram Mandir after the ongoing 16-day pitra paksha ends on September 17. Hindus express gratitude to their ancestors during this period, especially through food offerings. L&T is preparing to lay the foundation of the Ram Mandir, which is spread across 12,879 square metres, in the Ram Janmabhoomi campus. Around 1,200 pillars will be laid at around 100 feet (ft) below the surface for the temple’s foundation as first layer. The pillars are made of stone and no iron will be used. There will be another layer of foundation after the stone pillars.“Construction work of the Ram Mandir will start after pitra paksha,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust. Around 100 labourers will be engaged to lay the foundation of the shrine. The labourers will undergo coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests and thermal scanning before they are allowed entry to the Ram Janmabhoomi campus. The Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) approved the layouts of the Ram Mandir and the Ram Janmabhoomi campus last week. The ADA handed over the layouts to the members of the Trust on September 4 after the latter deposited a fee of Rs 2.11 crore in its bank account. The Ram Mandir will be 360 ft long, 235 ft wide and 161 ft high. The shrine will have five domes. State-of-the-art technology will be used to lay the temple’s foundation in a bid to preserve it for over 1,500 years and the structure for another 1,000 years. Experts from the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) in Roorkee and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Madras have been roped in to make the temple’s foundation strong and ensure that it can withstand earthquakes and other natural calamities. On November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court (SC) had ruled in favour of construction of the Ram Mandir that ended decades-old Ayodhya title suit dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-construction-committee-chairman-nripendra-mishra-s-visit-to-ayodhya-begins-today/story-RUiM48pL8PWbmGQe8OIaLM.html

Being innocent, she has not approached any court for anticipatory bail in all the cases foisted by Bihar police now with CBI, ED and NCB,” said Rhea’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde hours before her questioning began yesterday. Earlier on Saturday, Showik and Samuel Miranda were remanded in the NCB custody till September 9.In its remand application, the NCB said Showik had to be confronted “with other accused who are in its custody to uncover the linkages of network which indulged in selling and purchasing drugs”. The agency also said it needed Showik in custody to investigate the allegations against Rhea Chakraborty and Rajput’s manager Dipesh Sawant. The NCB said Showik was also needed to verify the financial trail.According to the NCB, during questioning, alleged drug peddler Abdel Basit Parihar, who was also arrested, had said he procured drugs from Vilatra and Ebrahim, on Showik’s instructions. He also claimed Showik told him to give drugs to Miranda. NCB officials said Showik’s phone messages include one in which he asked Miranda to pay Vilatra Rs 10,000 for 5 gm of ‘bud’, a curated form of marijuana.A senior officer from NCB said, “We conducted searches at Miranda’s and Showik’s homes and collected some evidence. The investigation is at a preliminary stage and details of the evidence can’t be revealed at the moment.”Meanwhile, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned Rajput’s sister Meetu Singh. Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14, with investigators launching a probe into the possibility of suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-back-at-narcotics-bureau-for-day-2-of-questioning/story-3pN3NlChT3OUnMu1cxJQPM.html

India has been reporting over 1,000 deaths for almost a week now and the total toll crossed the 70,000 mark on Sunday.So far, 71,647 people have died of Covid-19, according to the data of HT dashboard.India’s CFR is much lower than the global average of 3.2%. The United Kingdom’s (UK) CFR has been the highest at 12%, followed by Mexico (10.6%).Experts believe that even with the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, the CFR is unlikely to go up. “The number of tests being done in the country has gone up exponentially, which means we are detecting more cases. This is the reason we are reporting over 80,000 Covid-19 cases daily. However, a high proportion of this is those who are asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms and are unlikely to die,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor, department of pulmonology, Safdarjung Hospital.“Doctors have a better understanding of the disease and treatment protocols have been standardised. A capacity for oxygen and ICU beds has also been made. These measures are likely to keep the CFR in check,” he said.The Union ministry for health and family health (MoH&FW) has been guiding six states such as West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Puducherry, Jharkhand, and Delhi that have shown a recent surge in Covid-19 cases. The states and union territories (UTs) have been advised to implement stringent containment, ramp up testing, effective monitoring of those under home isolation, early hospitalisation for those in need of medical support, and efficient infection control in healthcare facilities. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-s-death-rate-has-reduced-by-0-43-in-a-month/story-xsqQtezeQOt6bqFKM54WIO.html

It removed over 1,000 pieces of shoes, slippers, sandals, as well as, bulbs, plastic waste, construction debris, and thermocol from the forests last Sunday.Also read: Water from artificial immersion sites, Plaster of Paris idols dumped directly into Thane creek by civic bodyThe marine litter gets stuck in tall breathing roots of mangrove as it makes its way from the sea or creeks.“We are following a systematic clean-up process wherein the entire waste collected is segregated into different categories. While some of the footwear can be reused, others can be sent back to the rubber industry. Segregated plastic waste and thermocol can be recycled separately by the civic body,” said Environment Life founder Dharmesh Barai. He added maximum waste consists of thermocol or thermocol-based products.Barai said Environment Life will continue its drive every Sunday and would like to spread awareness among Navi Mumbai citizens to join them. “Some of these areas may not be accessible but those that are, if cleaned properly, can be turned into tourism spots where mangrove boardwalks or nurseries can be set up,” he said.Mumbai’s mangrove forests (6,600 hectares) are estimated to have around 50,000 tons of plastic waste strewn due to improper waste treatment. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) In July directed the Maharashtra government to come up with an action plan to reduce waste choking mangrove forests and coastal wetlands in Mumbai.“We are working with local municipal corporations and the mangrove cell to submit the draft action plan to the NGT by October 7, the next date of hearing,” said a Maharashtra Pollution Control Board official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-kg-trash-removed-every-week-in-mumbai-mangrove-clean-up/story-zVSMwvi6ET1FYXGz1GhgMM.html

07-09-2020||India||Differences surface in Bengal BJP over induction of new faces in youth front||A cold war is raging in the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over induction of new leaders in state Yuva Morcha, the youth front. Differences cropped up recently after Saumitra Khan, a member of the Lok Sabha and the state Yuva Morcha president, announced the list of members in the youth front’s new state committee. Senior party leaders, who did not want to be quoted, said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh declared the list null and void as he wanted some changes. Khan had to publish a new list in which Prakash Das, a youth leader known to be close to Ghosh, has been named the Morcha general secretary. “A section of central leaders want Shankudeb Panda, who defected from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and is known to be close to national executive member Mukul Roy, to be the Morcha general secretary,” a state BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. He said that BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who looks after the organisation in Bengal and also wants Panda’s induction, had a discussion with Ghosh on Saturday. “But Ghosh is not willing to change his decision,” he added. “In a Rightist party, a lot of people can eye the same post but the decision of the leadership is final. The matter has been sorted. Panda will be inducted somewhere else,” a senior leader close to Ghosh told HT on Sunday. Anupam Hazra, the former TMC Lok Sabha MP from Bolpur who defected to the BJP in March 2019 and was defeated by TMC’s Mimi Chakraborty in the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency, has been made a vice-president in the Yuva Morcha. A section of BJP leaders said his name too was discussed for the post of general secretary but Ghosh was opposed to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-surface-in-bengal-bjp-over-induction-of-new-faces-in-youth-front/story-ONi4u3X0VhN5h86KSbloXJ.html
07-09-2020||India||Can Delhi sustain its clean air, blue sky days?||The world — based on a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last December — will observe the International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies for the first time on Monday.The UNGA note, dated January 22, on the observance of September 7 as a day for clean air, states that air pollution is the single-greatest environmental risk to human health.Delhi for the first time in years has recorded several blue-sky “good” air days since March 25, when nation-wide lockdown restrictions were enforced in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Later, this been followed by a favourable monsoon with some intense spells of rain and strong wind.But Delhi’s acid test begins in September when meteorological conditions change, emissions rise with the re-opening up of various sectors after lockdown restrictions, while the crop stubble burning begins in neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh (UP), Haryana and Punjab in October.There were only two “good” air days in 2017 followed by two days last year.This year, there have been five good air days (March 28) (during the first week of the Covid-19 induced lockdown) with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 45; on August 13 after heavy rain, the AQI was recorded 50; August 20, again when Delhi received very heavy rainfall, the AQI was 50; August 24, the AQI was 45 and the lowest air quality index (AQI) in five years was recorded this August on August 31 with AQI of only 41.“By end-September the meteorological conditions change. Wind direction changes from south-westerly and north-easterly to predominantly north-westerly. Wind speed also reduces. There may have been reduction in emission load this year because normal vehicular traffic has not yet resumed,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist at air pollution division of India Meteorological Department (IMD).This year ensuring farmers don’t set crop stubble on fire in Punjab, Haryana, UP, an annual activity to dispose crop stubble from kharif season, may be very difficult. This is because small farmers are already affected by Covid-19-led economic slowdown and may not have the means to hire machines and tractors for straw management. The Centre had launched a Rs- 1,150 crore scheme in 2018 to subsidise farm straw-management machinery in the north-western states, where rampant paddy-straw burning contributes to air pollution in Delhi every year.“We have filled forms to claim a 50% subsidy on straw management machinery being offered by the government. The subsidy hasn’t come through yet. But small farmers will burn crop stubble. They cannot afford machinery and tractors in the midst of a pandemic. The machine has to be mounted on a tractor and there are diesel costs also,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) had claimed last year that there was a 50% reduction in the agricultural area, where crop residue burning takes place. But an analysis by Hiren Jethva, a research scientist with Universities Space Research Association at (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre, suggested that there was hardly any reduction.“We have disbursed the money this year also to states to ensure farmers get subsidised straw management machinery. By October 15, those machines should be in place. We are expecting a reduction in stubble burning cases. Over 50% reduction in area with crop stubble burning has been recorded,” said Trilochan Mohapatra, director-general, ICAR. The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) is also considering a request by the Union power ministry to defer the deadline for thermal power plants to meet air pollution norms by 2022, another two years. Thermal power plants are one of the largest sources of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) pollution in India. The MoEFCC had notified superior emission standards for thermal power plants in December 2015 for implementation by the end of 2017. The deadline was delayed to 2022 because of resistance from the thermal power industry.“Delhi has taken several steps such as closing of all thermal power plants; stopping truck entry; phasing out more than 10-year-old diesel vehicles among others. But this is the right time to take stock of the gaps. Delhi needs to scale up its public transportation and vehicle electrification programme massively. It needs to streamline its waste sector through better segregation and recycling in a bid to ensure that waste is not burnt. It has to move all industries to clean fuel,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a not-for-profit public interest research and advocacy organisation based in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-delhi-sustain-its-clean-air-blue-sky-days/story-ftHa6fB7mEg9SgJvpf3XHP.html

He was accompanied by SS Panwar, ADG (WC) and NS Jamwal, IG BSF, Jammu Frontier,” said an official spokesperson.The DG was briefed by ID Singh, DIG Rajouri and field commanders on the LoC regarding the operational preparedness and situation.Appreciating the measures adopted by the troops while maintaining domination, the DG emphasised on meeting the security challenges more effectively.Lauding the excellent synergy amongst all the security forces, the DG exhorted all ranks to maintain a high standard of discipline and professionalism. He also addressed Sainik Sammelan in the BSF Paloura Camp Jammu and said that since Pakistan and China were planning against India, the BSF’s role became more important in guarding the borders. “This is a very crucial time for all, as both our neighbouring countries are planning against us. So, our role has become more important now as we are the first line of Indian defence,” the spokesperson quoted the DG as saying.He was very appreciative of the vigilant BSF jawans who guard the nation’s border 24x7 defying all hostile conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-china-planning-against-us-bsf-chief-to-jawans-on-visit-to-loc/story-EYkDZLzPuEUwfBQKxq8fOO.html
07-09-2020||India||Covid-19: As metro services set to resume, air flow poses biggest health challenge||Delhi Metro officials have made widespread changes to how air conditioning and ventilation systems work inside trains and at underground stations in an attempt to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infections. But the way the air flows, particularly in coaches, and how the virus floats around, continues to pose a threat for users.The risks also depend on how well people are able to maintain distance from one another and whether they adhere to Covid-safe precautions such as wearing masks.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTo mitigate this risk in part, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has decided to increase the rate at which fresh air is pumped into train coaches and open ventilation vents at underground stations more often to ensure stale air escapes. Inside a metro coach, this will result in the air being refreshed every 2 minutes, 33 seconds. Two recent studies show contrasting results on how close environment public travel risks can be mitigated and, conversely, allowed to result into a major outbreak. The first, published in Jama Network Open on September 1, showed the transmission of the virus from one person to 23 others on a bus packed with 67 people in China. None of the passengers wore a mask.The second, published on September 5 in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, showed that in a flight full of 310 people, six asymptomatic Covid-19 infected people spread the virus only to 1 other person. All passengers wore masks except for when they had meals and used lavatories.Researchers have previously pointed to how air flows are a possible factor. In a bus, much like in a metro train, overhead ducts create a bigger area of air circulation than in flights in which air conditioning vents on the top and bottom create a restricted, vertical draft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-as-metro-services-set-to-resume-air-flow-poses-biggest-health-challenge/story-WXpo3CUHCCvdpDRHCGnP2N.html
07-09-2020||India||India calls China’s bluff in Chushul||After the Indian Army called the bluff of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on the Rezang La ridgeline on August 29-30, India is prepared for the long haul in Ladakh with clear-cut directions to front-line troops not to yield to any Chinese intimidation.While both the military and diplomatic channels are open between the two countries, the Indian Army riposte in the last week of August must have had a sobering effect on the adversary with the situation attaining criticality at the Rezang La ridgeline in the Chushul sector.Although psychological warfare through media is the key element of Chinese military strategy, the situation report to the PLA headquarters in Beijing on the August 30 military moves must have made the Western Theatre Command realise the mood of Indian Army’s specialized troops and armour. The new Indian military posture is aimed at repelling any PLA move to unilaterally change the alignment of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in pursuit of its 1960 claim green line.Also read: In Chushul’s forbidding heights, locals supply water, other essentials to Indian troopsThe Indian position on the Ladakh border was strongly conveyed by defence minister Rajnath Singh to his Chinese counterpart on the side lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in Moscow; the stand shall be reiterated by external affairs minister S Jaishankar when he meets his counterpart on the same platform on September 10. There is a strong possibility of a meeting between the Indian and Chinese Special Representatives on the boundary issue later if Beijing still is committed to the bilateral peace and tranquility agreements. The situation on the ground is that China has increased the PLA’s strength by 60% since the Galwan Valley flare-up on June 15 while its leaders talk about peace.According to China watchers, the PLA’s aggression will continue till the November US Presidential elections and the Ladakh push from Galwan to Pangong Tso was part of Chinea’s strategic positioning to punish India for its perceived close relationship with the US. “ The climatic conditions in Ladakh in October will ensure that troops only fight for their survival rather than fight against the adversary with polar temperatures and killer winds. The Chinese posture will also depend on whether there is a change of regime in US and what will be its policy towards Beijing,” said a senior official, who didn’t want to be named.What is left unsaid is that the PLA’s aggression in Ladakh was part of the preparations to celebrate 100 years of the Chinese Communist Party next year, where the middle kingdom will be showcased as a new global power with a Xiaokang (moderately prosperous) society and a modern socialist country.It is clearly evident that the Chinese did not anticipate the Indian Army’s reaction in Ladakh as well as the political, military, diplomatic and economic cost of land between Finger 4 and Finger 8 relief features on Pangong Tso that PLA occupied by perfidy last May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-china-s-bluff-in-chushul/story-0waGo9iTB3XIkjCA2EQSPM.html

As on 31 December, 2019, there were 4,78,600 inmates lodged in different prisons in India while they had a collective capacity to house only about 4,03,700 inmates. This means the number of prisoners was 118.5% of the prison capacity, the highest since 2010. While this is only one percentage point more than the number in 2018, a state-wise analysis shows that the number of states and union territories reporting overcrowded prisons has increased from 18 in 2018 to 21 in 2019. Eleven states have reported overcrowded prisons for five consecutive years. Prisons in Delhi were the most overcrowded among all states and union territories – there were about 17,500 prisoners lodged in jails with a collective capacity of about 10,000, which is a prison overcrowding rate of 175%. Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand followed next in overcrowding at 168% and 159% respectively. Overcrowded prisons are more of a concern at present as the Covid-19 infection continues to spread in the country with about 3.5 million confirmed cases reported by August 30. The infection has been reported to have spread in multiple prison premises as well. This is a matter of concern also because nearly every eighth prisoner in India is a person above the age of 50, the age group which is at a higher risk of developing severe complications and dying due to the Covid-19 infection. “It’s stupid but it’s not surprising,” said Neha Singhal of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy regarding the overcrowded prisons. “Prisons are grossly overcrowded and they urgently need to be de-congested. Prisons are often difficult to manage as it is, but the current circumstances will make management an absolute nightmare,” she said.Singhal said maintaining social distancing norms is impossible in an overcrowded prison. “There’s no way for them to be physically far from each other because there’s just not enough space. I have spoken to a lot of prisoners and they barely have any space when they are sleeping and are forced to share mattresses,” she said.Prisoners are also at a high risk of getting infected with an infection because of continued movement of prisoners in and out of prison premises and the fact that prisoners getting admitted and released is a continuous process. In 2019, an average of over 12,000 inmates visited courts everyday while around 1,300 were moved out of prisons everyday for medical attendance. In 2019, an average of 4,100 undertrials and 11 convicts were released from prisons every day while around 5,200 people were admitted to prisons every day.These numbers would be lower this year because of various steps taken by prison authorities to prevent outbreak of the disease inside prisons. It is possible to release a section of prisoners, especially those who are undergoing trial, on bail or parole. In 2019, 69% of all prisoners were undertrials. This figure has increased slightly in the last four years. “Prisons by design are not roomy spaces and when they are crowded the space for each prisoner becomes even less,” said Leah Verghese, research manager at civil society group Daksh. Verghese said she was surprised that many states did not make concerted effort to decongest prisons. “Releasing undertrials, those who are accused of less serious offences and those above the age of 60 seemed like an obvious solution to the overcrowding problem,” she said.“Every time an undertrial is admitted there is a risk that they will infect other inmates and staff,” said Verghese. “Undertrials and convicts share the same space thus putting everyone’s health at risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prison-overcrowding-in-2019-highest-in-10-years/story-Mm8VGVG0J12zFvqC9rRFZJ.html
07-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The beginning of the week is a good time to catch up — on numbers, science, trends, and the rare good news (if any) related to the coronavirus disease.90446: This is the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in India on Saturday, according to the HT dashboard. No country has crossed 80,000 cases a day. India will likely do fewer cases on Sunday — numbers fall off over the weekend in most parts of the world. India also overtook Brazil on Sunday to become the country with the second highest number of Covid-19 cases, after the US. And towards the end of last week, it overtook Mexico to become the one with the third highest number of Covid-19 fatalities. How high is that 90,446 number? According to worldometers.info, it is higher than the total number of cases seen by countries ranked 35 and lower in its listing. As testing increases, India could see a further rise in cases. Purely in terms of the trajectory of the pandemic’s run, India is unique — but it isn’t the kind of distinctiveness of which the country can be proud.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe mink: An earlier instalment of this column (Dispatch 49 on May 8) looked at the animals of the Covid-19 pandemic. One more can now be added to the list — the mink, a relative of the otter and the ferret that is widely farmed across Europe for its fur. There have been outbreaks in mink farms in the Netherlands, Spain, and in Utah in the US. According to a study published on pre-print server bioRxiv, and conducted by researchers from the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, genomic studies showed that the workers at the farms passed on the coronavirus disease to minks, which then passed them back to other workers. Already, the Netherlands has moved forward a planned closure of the mink farms set for 2024 to March next year. And about time too — for years, activists have been trying to get governments around the world to do just this. The research from the Netherlands needs to be peer-reviewed, but it merits a much closer look — it suggests that the Sars-CoV-2 virus can jump from humans to animals (anthropozoonotic) and then from animals back to humans (zoonotic).Tennis, anyone?: Anyone but poor Kristina Mladenovic. Days after she lost a match she should have won at the US Open and spoke of the “nightmare” she was living in and the “abominable way” in which players were being treated — Mladenovic was isolated because she was exposed to an infected player within the bio-bubble — she and her partner, the top seeds in the women’s draw, were disqualified on Saturday. This was after the county where the players’ hotel is located said its rules do not allow her to play in the tournament. The experience with so-called bio-bubbles in sport has been mostly positive. They would appear to have worked in cricket in England and the Caribbean, the Premier League, and also the NBA; but the US Open is clearly having all sorts of trouble with its own. It will be interesting to see how the Indian Premier League’s bio-bubble works. As HT’s sports desk wrote in a recent article: “What makes the IPL different from some of the other bio-bubbles is how spread out it is.” The report pointed out how self-contained the bio-bubbles for the cricket series in England, the Caribbean Premier League, and the NBA have been. In contrast, it said, “the IPL has eight teams camping in different hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and travelling every day for practice”.The vaccine: The mathematical chances of a vaccine for Covid-19 being developed soon (another topic covered in an earlier instalment of this column, (Dispatch 111 on July 22) became stronger through August. At the beginning of September, according to a report in Nature, there were 321 vaccine candidates, with 32 of them in clinical trials. In April, there were only 115 vaccine candidates. But the best news regarding vaccines came in a Friday report by the Wall Street Journal that said some leading vaccine makers were preparing a public pledge that would reaffirm their commitment to following the due process of clinical trials and “not seeking government approval” till they were convinced the vaccines were safe and effective. The companies named in the article include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna — and the pledge comes against the backdrop of vaccine development becoming increasingly political, leading to fears that governments could rush through with vaccines before they are ready, much like Russia has done with the Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-bda2uZKb8lGdXYJ67M5FwM.html
07-09-2020||India||The rise and fall of two UP strongmen||They built their empires at the intersection of crime and politics, dominating their bastions in Uttar Pradesh with money and muscle power. Their fiefdom invoked fear among commoners and their names inspired awe among followers. But all that is in the past. Lodged in jails outside the state, Atiq Ahmad and Mukhtar Ansari, the once-feared gangsters clad in white kurta-pyjama, are now mere spectators to the gradual implosion of their empires. Their men are hounded by police; their gun licenses are being cancelled and their properties seized; and their clout is diminishing. For the bahubalis (as the musclemen were called), what remains is a past of prominence, one that is constructed by a complex web of crime and politics but, nonetheless, is an important chapter in UP’s social landscape. ERODING SUPPORT BASE Ahmad, now 60, is said to have committed his first murder in 1979. And there was no looking back for him in the world of crime. A five-time legislator and a one-time parliamentarian, Ahmad has 96 criminal cases against him. He has been named in cases of murder, abductions, illegal mining, extortion, intimidation and fraud, among others. He started calling the shots in the Allahabad (now Prayagraj) region after the death of his rival, Shaukat Ilahi, in a police encounter in 1989. Incidentally, he made his debut in representative politics in the same year, winning the Allahabad West assembly seat as an independent candidate. Not only Allahabad, Ahmad was able to make his presence felt from Kaushambi to Chitrakoot and from Lucknow to Kanpur. He retained the Allahabad West seat twice (1991 and 1993) as an independent candidate. In 1996, he contested on a Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket and won. He joined the Apna Dal in 1999 and won the seat again in 2002. In 2003, Ahmad returned to the SP. In 2004, he became a parliamentarian from the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency, a seat once held by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. “Atiq Ahmad was an important leader of the party and served as its UP president,” Pallavi Patel, the acting national president of the Apna Dal (Kamerawadi), said, commenting on his stint in the party. She added that the party formed by her late father, Sone Lal Patel, followed the path of issue-based politics and took decisions that it felt served the common man. “I am not aware of any efforts by him in the recent past to rejoin the party. Even now if he approaches the party, the party leadership will look into it and decide on its merit.” Ahmad’s downfall began in 2007 during the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)’s rule, when police mounted pressure on him and his brother, Ashraf. They eventually surrendered in 2008, but were released in 2013, a year after the SP came back to power. Ahmad contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 from Shravasti but lost. Gradually, differences surfaced between Ahmad and the SP. Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav avoided him on stage at a public meeting in Kaushambi in May 2016. Dan Bahadur ‘Madhur’, the long-serving Prayagraj district spokesperson of the SP, said his party distanced itself from Ahmad after Akhilesh Yadav took over as its national president in January 2017. “Even today, we are following the same path of clean politics,” he said. Ahmad was arrested in February 2017 from the Naini area in Prayagraj in connection with an attack on employees of a state university at the fag end of the SP’s rule. The action came after the Allahabad high court pulled up the police for their failure to arrest him.But Ahmad’s political ambitions were not over. From jail, he filed nomination from the Varanasi constituency against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 and got 855 votes. In June 2019, Ahmad was shifted to an Ahmedabad jail on the orders of the Supreme Court. Back home, his younger brother, Ashraf, is behind the bars after his arrest in July 2020. His eldest son, Umar, is absconding. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has announced a reward of Rs 2 lakh for information leading to Umar’s arrest. Many of Ahmad’s men have been put behind the bars and regular raids are being carried out to track down others. “Some new names will be added to the list of his gang members soon as many youngsters joined him in recent years,” said Civil Lines circle officer Brajnarayan Singh, who is part of the operation against Ahmad and his gang. The administration has cancelled 30-odd gun licenses linked to Ahmad and his men. At present, he is left with just one gun license — that of a pistol, according to Abhishek Dixit, the Prayagraj senior superintendent of police. The Prayagraj district administration recently ordered the attachment of seven of his immovable properties worth around Rs 60 crore. Another 17 properties have been identified for action even as 16 firms linked to Ahmad and his gang are under scrutiny. Of the many charges against him, Ahmad is accused of protecting the criminals involved in the gan-grape of some madrasa students in 2007. The incident kicked off a massive protest by locals. In December 2016, Ahmad and his men allegedly attacked employees of Sam Higginbottom Institute of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS) when he could not meet the vice-chancellor to urge him to reconsider the expulsion of two students who were caught cheating in exams. A first information report (FIR) was lodged against him and he was arrested in February 2017. Earlier, in 2008, he was arrested for the 2005 murder of BSP legislator Raju Pal but granted bail. “Many of his gang members have been arrested and put behind the bars. They have been shifted to different prisons across the state,” Dinesh Kumar Singh, Prayagraj superintendent of police (city), said. FACING THE HEAT A BSP legislator, Ansari has been lodged in a jail in Punjab’s Ropar since January 2019; his reign in eastern UP is all but over. His named was linked to a murder in the late 1980s, but there was no evidence, said a retired police officer who did not want to be named. At the dawn of the 90s, Ansari, who was involved in property business and contract work, began expanding his network in the world of crime. In November 2005, he was linked to the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Krishnanad Rai; Ansari was in jail when the incident occurred. In July 2019, he was acquitted by a special CBI court. In 2009, Ansari, who faces 48 FIRs including 10 murder cases, was again named in the killing of Ajai Prakash Singh, a contractor, in Mau. This time too, Ansari was acquitted, by a local court in Ghazipur in 2017. An eyewitness to Singh’s murder, Ram Singh Maurya, was killed in 2010. Ansari was booked for his alleged role in the incident. The case is under trial in a special court for MPs/MLAs. He successfully contested his first assembly election on a BSP ticket from the Mau seat in 1996. Denied the party’s ticket in 2002, he contested as an independent and won the seat in 2002. He retained his seat as an independent in 2007.Later that year, he rejoined the BSP and unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary election against BJP stalwart Murli Manohar Joshi in 2009. In 2010, Ansari was expelled from the BSP for his alleged criminal links. He floated the Quami Ekta Dal later that year, contested the 2012 assembly election from Mau as its candidate and won. In January 2017, he returned to the BSP, which fielded him from Mau in the 2017 assembly elections. Ansari won again. The 57-year-old still appears to have the support of the local BSP unit. “The action against Ansari and his associates is full of political vendetta,” the party’s Mau president, Rajiv Kumar Raju, said. At his peak, Ansari was active across eastern UP, including Varanasi, Mau, Ghazipur, Ballia and Chandauli, and the adjoining areas of neighbouring Bihar. In January 2019, he was arrested for allegedly making an extortion call to a Mohali-based builder, who lodged a case. Ansari was arrested in that case and shifted to Punjab’s Ropar jail from Banda, where he was incarcerated in March 2017 in a separate case. He has been behind the bars since 2005 and lodged in several jails across the state on different charges.In May 2020, police stepped up operations against Ansari and his gang. Seventy-two arms licenses linked to him and his accomplices were suspended, properties worth Rs 66 crore seized, and an extortion racket that supplied crores of rupees annually to Ansari and his associates was busted, according to the police.“Ninety-seven criminals, including shooters, henchmen and Ansari’s allies were arrested during the drive. Action was taken against 75 of them under the Gangster Act, and all of them were sent to jail,” said Braj Bhushan, additional director general (ADG), Varanasi zone. Those arrested included illegal traders of fish (four gangs), members of the extortion gang, and people linked to an illegal slaughter house and two criminal gangs. “While the illegal fish traders and the extortion gang supported the Ansari gang financially, the criminal gangs used to commit crime at the instance of the Ansari gang,” Bhushan said. The recent drive picked up pace after the registration of a case on June 1 against Ansari and five others in connection with them obtaining four arms licenses by furnishing fake addresses 19 years ago, Mau superintendent of police Anurag Arya said. “The drive against hardcore criminals, gangsters, and their gangs will be accelerated further,” said ADG Bhushan. STATE-WIDE CAMPAIGN“The action against the mafia in the state is happening following chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s strict instruction against criminals,” additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said. Underscoring the tough stand the BJP government has adopted, a tweet by the chief minister’s office in Hindi said on Friday: “Be it mafia or any other criminal, the UP government under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, with its zero-tolerance policy, is fully committed to putting a full-stop in wrongdoings of such elements.” Soon after coming to the power in March 2017, the BJP government launched a drive against the hardcore criminals and gangsters, said the Kashi region BJP vice-president, Dharmendra Singh. “Under the drive, action has been taken against a number of criminals and gangsters. The state government has a clear policy to eliminate crime from the state,” he said. But the opposition SP is not convinced; it alleged that the administration was taking selective action. “The ill-gotten and illegally acquired properties must be taken back by the government; encroachment on land must be freed from illegal possession. If the government is doing it under a legally sanctioned process, then nobody should have any objections. The action of the government must not be based on pick-and-choose mechanism,” said SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi. “The recent drive against ill-gotten properties is carried out in a partisan manner. No action is being taken against those who are in the BJP or its sympathizers with it. Law must be equally applied to all irrespective of political affiliations. Criminals are criminals. They do not become innocent by joining the BJP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-rise-and-fall-of-two-up-strongmen/story-J1fqeP8KpmZUR1kuTLu0gO.html
07-09-2020||India||Kesavananda Bharati, seer behind ‘basic structure of Constitution’ case, dies aged 79 at his Kerala ashram||Kesavananda Bharati, who filed the famous constitutional case leading to birth of the legal doctrine of “Basic Structure”, passed away on Sunday morning at his ashram, Sri Edneer Mutt ,in the Kasaragod district of north Kerala. Bharati, who had been suffering breathing and heart ailments, was 79.Over the years, the name of Bharati had become synonymous with constitutional law after a 13-judge bench of the Supreme Court on April 24, 1973 delivered its historic verdict in the case known as Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Keralam in which it was held that the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution of India is circumscribed by what is known as Basic Structure of the Constitution. In other words, the court ruled that Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, but such amendment cannot in any manner deface or distort the basic features of the charter such as democracy, federalism, supremacy of the Constitution, secularism, and separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary.Bharati took over as the pontiff of Sri Edneer Mutt, a Hindu monastic institution, when he was 19. Bharati was in his late 20s or early 30s when the mutt’s properties were sought to be acquired by the Kerala government, triggering the landmark case.“He spent his entire life as a religious leader but he has left back for the country a legal doctrine which has endured to keep the country together in the face of a lot of autocratic governments with a huge majority,” senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.“Very rarely does a litigant attain immortality for the cause he or she espoused and the redefining moment brought by the judgment. His Holiness Kesavananda will be to India, what (Oilver) Brown is to the US (judgment against racial segregation in public schools) and (May) Donoghue to the United Kingdom (judgment on negligence which empowered consumers). Swamiji may have departed, but the doctrine of Basic Structure will remain forever (hopefully),” senior advocate KV Viswanathan told HT.“Bharati was revered as a God-like figure. He treated everyone with much affection and care. My stay at the Mutt afforded me the opportunity to experience his hospitality and affection,” said advocate Raghul Sudheesh, a Kerala high court lawyer who had visited the mutt in 2011 to interview Bharati.What did Bharati challenge?He initiated the case on March 21, 1970 challenging the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act 1969. Later, three constitutional amendments – 24th, 25th and 29th – were passed by the Parliament and they became a subject matter of challenge on the grounds that they violated his fundamental right to practice and propagate religion (Article 25), freedom of religious denomination to manage its religious affairs including managing and administering its property (Article 26) and right to property (Article 31) and right to acquire and hold property [Article 19(1)(f)]. He had mounted the challenge after the land reforms law enacted by the Kerala government threatened to strip his mutt of its property, which was the source of income for the ashram. “His petition before the Supreme Court was part of his battle for survival of the mutt which he headed. The government was going to acquire the properties of the mutt which was its main source of income,” Sudheesh said.Noted lawyer Nani Palkhivala appeared for Bharati before a 13-judge bench of the Supreme Court. However, it was senior counsel MK Nambiar, father of current attorney general KK Venugopal ,who managed the case on behalf of Bharati and who engaged lawyers in Delhi to argue the case. It marked the only instance in the Supreme Court when a bench of 13 judges (which was the full strength of the apex court at that point of time) sat to decide a case.The case remains the longest heard before the Supreme Court; it lasted for 69 days between October 31, 1972 and March 23, 1973.Significance of the caseHow did a property case become a watershed moment in the constitutional jurisprudence of the country?The case assumed significance due to the debate which started around 10 years prior to it relating to the extent of the power possessed by Parliament to amend the Constitution of India.Two Articles in the Constitution were at the centre of this debate – Articles 13 and 368. Article 13 states that Parliament cannot make any law which violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. Article 368 empowers Parliament to make amendments to the Constitution.The issue, which came up before the court as early as 1964 in the case of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, was whether the word “law” under Article 13 included within its scope a constitutional amendment under Article 368.If a constitutional amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the meaning of Article 13, then it would automatically follow that Parliament cannot amend the Constitution to take away any fundamental right. In Sajjan Singh, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the word “law” in Article 13 does not include a constitutional amendment under Article 368. This meant Parliament has unfettered power to amend the Constitution.This position was overturned in 1967 by an 11-jugde bench of the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Golaknath v. State of Punjab. In this judgment, it was held that an amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the definition of Article 13. This was seen as a major erosion of Parliament’s rights to implement the people’s mandate. The Indira Gandhi government saw this stance as a challenge to the will of the elected majority.In 1971, it enacted the Constitution (Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Act which expressly provided that the bar under Article 13 will not apply to any amendment made to the Constitution under Article 368. This meant that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution, including fundamental rights.Later, by the 25th amendment to the Constitution, Parliament in 1972 curtailed the right to property under Article 31, which was a fundamental right back then (Article 31 was later removed from the list of fundamental rights).The 29th amendment put the Kerala land reforms law beyond the purview of judicial reviewCourt’s judgmentThe court upheld the validity of all the three constitutional amendments - 24th, 25th and 29th – which were under challenge.It also overruled the judgment in Golaknath case and held that a constitutional amendment is not “law” within the meaning of Article 13. Thus, it was ruled that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution.This seemed to be a victory for the government. However, it was not. The power to amend any part of the Constitution, which the court said that Parliament possessed, came with a rider -- it should not infringe upon the Basic Structure of the Constitution.Thus, the takeaway from the judgment was that Parliament could not do as it pleases with the Constitution. Any law made by it, including constitutional amendments, should not violate the ethos and basic features of the Constitution and the Supreme Court will be the final arbiter on whether there is any such transgression into the Basic Structure.The court also did not given any exhaustive list of what would constitute the Basic Structure of the Constitution. This was left open-ended and has been time and again used to strike down constitutional amendments that the Supreme Court felt distorted the Constitution.Consequences“Kesavananda doctrine swung against the government by the narrowest of majorities of 7:6 with justice HR Khanna signing against the government in favour of the doctrine. It foreshadowed the coming of the Emergency because soon after the judgment, justices KS Hegde, AN Grover and JM Shelat were superseded for the post of Chief Justice of India and justice AN Ray who was junior to them was appointed to the post,” Sanjay Hegde said.Justice Hegde, Shelat and Grover had ruled against the government while justice Ray had favoured the government. As for Bharati, the mutt lost its properties since the laws challenged by it were upheld.“He believed that the outcome of the case was destiny and God’s decision. What concerned him most was that he mutt lost its source of income and had to depend on donations. He was, however, happy that the case became landmark judgment and felt good about fighting to protect the Mutt and its properties,” Sudheesh said.A Carnatic and Hindustani vocalist, he wrote many devotional songs and plays and was also a patron of Kannada art and culture. The mutt manages many educational institutions. It also runs a Veda Pathasala which imparted lessons in Advaitha and Vedic lessons to many students. In 2018, Bharati was honoured with the justice V R Krishna Iyer award. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed his condolences. “He was a revolutionary who made rich contributions in cultural and educational spheres,” Vijayan said in a message. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan tweeted that the nation will always remember “his valuable contributions and teachings and they will continue to enlighten people.”(K Ramesh Babu contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kesavananda-bharati-seer-behind-basic-structure-of-constitution-case-dies-aged-79-at-his-kerala-ashram/story-epboHW2HkeboWAg7Y9XmCP.html
07-09-2020||India||Air tickets booked before Covid-19 lockdown may be refunded||Airlines will provide refunds for cancelled travel during the nationwide lockdown on tickets booked in advance, the Centre has proposed in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, reiterating that similar returns will be processed for bookings made during the period of curbs.On June 12, the apex court, while hearing a plea filed by NGO Pravasi Legal Cell, asked the Centre, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and airlines to discuss full refunds of tickets for domestic and international flights that were cancelled due to the travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court after the deliberations, the civil aviation ministry and DGCA have proposed that all passengers will be entitled to refund of their tickets booked before March 25 within 15 days.“If the tickets have been booked during the first lockdown period, that is March 25, to April 14, 2020 for the journeys to be undertaken in both first and second lockdown period that is from March 25 to May 3, 2020, in all such cases, full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately (this is being mandated vide MoCA’s OM dated April 16, 2020 as the airlines were not supposed to book such tickets),” said the affidavit, seen by HT.“For all other cases, the airlines shall make all endeavors to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days.”The scheme also said that if an airline is not in a financial position to pay immediately, the fare amount shall be kept in a “credit shell” to be availed by the passenger for travel by the same airline on any route before March 31, 2021. This option is not available to foreign carriers, who must refund the amount within 15 days, according to the proposal.If the passenger does not wish to travel, the credit shell can be transferred to another person, it added. If the amount is unused, interest will accrue every month on this amount and the same is to be refunded in full after March 31, 2021, according to the proposal.A notification by DGCA from April 16 previously referred to full refund of tickets booked during the lockdown period. However, people who booked tickets prior to this date had approached the Supreme Court seeking refunds. On June 12, the court directed the Centre to find a solution after consulting airline operators and travel agents. A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan will consider the Centre’s affidavit when it takes up the petitions on September 9.In an interview to HT on May 7, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said that his ministry had issued a directive to airlines to reimburse passengers who had booked tickets during the lockdown period. He said the government will need to look at the interest of the passengers primarily, but also look at the situation of the airlines.Advocate Jose Abraham, who is representing Pravasi Legal Cell, told HT: “Almost 95% of petitioners before the court had booked tickets before the lockdown started. The April 16 notification of DGCA was of no consequence to us. Even the credit shell proposed under it contained rigid terms. The present solution of the DGCA has balanced the interests of passengers by protecting their money and allowed flexible terms on credit shell.”Officials of the civil aviation ministry and DGCA held two rounds of discussions with airline operators on July 2 and 8 before finalising the proposal. The affidavit stated that non-refund of fares and creating of involuntary credit shell by airlines was a clear violation of the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) and passenger charter. “Any such enforcement action would further restrict/reduce their (airline) operations and thus any such enforcement action may further jeopardize the possibilities of generation of cash by the airline which can further adversely affect/delay the refund cycle,” the affidavit said. This scheme will be applicable to Indian carriers who are liable for refund on all domestic and international routes. Even for tickets booked through travel agents, the credit shell will be in the name of the passenger and the refunds, if any, will be transferred by the travel agent to the passengers. “The above proposal is formulated by the respondent (Centre) as an exception keeping in view the precipitating problems during Covid-19 pandemic and is without prejudice to the regulatory framework as provided in the CARs referred to above,” the affidavit said.

07-09-2020||India||Forces told to begin large-scale breeding of K9s to meet demand||In his Mann ki Baat radio address last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated the role dogs have played over the years in protecting national security. Around the same time, the ground was already being laid for strengthening dog squads of security forces across the country. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) recently issued guidelines asking the Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) to undertake large-scale breeding of Police Service K9s, or PSKs, not only to meet their own requirements but also for other central/state police forces. The three paramilitary forces, which have well-established dog breeding and training centres (DB&TCs) and specialized veterinary officers, have been asked to diversify PSKs by introducing breeds like the Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, Belgian Shepherd Malinois, Working Line German Shepherd, Beagle, Dutch Shepherd, Blood Hound and other breeds in Indian K9 units. They have been given permission to procure quality K9 breeding stock from the open market or import it, if necessary, to meet the requirement of security forces, according to the guidelines reviewed by HT. According to official government data, state police forces had 1,470 sniffer dogs and 790 tracker dogs and the central armed police forces (or paramilitary forces) 1,702 sniffer dogs and 407 tracker dogs in 2019. BSF, which guards India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, had the highest number of 108 tracker dogs and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had the most number of 445 sniffer dogs to check for explosives at airports, metro stations and other sensitive installations. The army has over 1,200 trained dogs. The number of trained dogs in Indian armed forces and police departments for internal security duties, counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir, states where Maoist rebels are active, the northeast and border areas is very low, experts say.Former CRPF director general K Durga Prasad said :“It’s an undisputed fact that dogs do excellent jobs in anti-sabotage checks, camp security and sniffing explosives. Yet there is a huge shortage of dogs in all the forces as well as states’ police which needs to be fulfilled through scientific breeding.” MHA has ordered that the procurement of pops as young as three months should not be allowed. Currently, the pups are procured at the age of three months, which the ministry feels is too young an age for evaluating their aptitude for police duties. “Pups should be reared by DB&TCs till they become ‘young adult’ when their behaviours and personalities could be evaluated to ascertain the levels of prerequisite traits needed for preparing proficient PSKs,” the MHA guidelines say. For young adult dogs, known as Green Dogs, screening is mandatory to ascertain their suitability for training as proficient PSKs, it adds. Green Dogs sold to other forces must be given basic/tactical obedience training between the ages of six and months and must be environmentally stable and affable enough to perform police duties, according to the MHA. The guidelines add that the K9 Behaviour Assessment Test (BAT) will be one of the criteria in determining their Estimated Breeding Value (EBVs) to plan and undertake future breeding programmes based on scientific principles of animal breeding and genetics. DB&TCs have been asked to prepare strategies for PSK breeding to meet the requirement of security organizations. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which has a full-fledged DB&TC as well, will continue breeding of pups, especially Belgian Malinois, to meet its own requirements. “The decision is aimed at increasing the role of canines in armed forces and police and to provide best genetic quality, trainable dogs for all forces deployed in different terrains or states,” said an officer at one of the DB&TCs, requesting anonymity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-told-to-begin-large-scale-breeding-of-k9s-to-meet-demand/story-UI98HnRO925DIFSGDYtXLO.html

She was escorted by police personnel amid a heavy presence television camera crews.“The investigation has not been completed due to her late arrival. We will summon her again tomorrow (Monday) and the investigation will continue,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of the NCB.Also read: Taapsee Pannu, Swara Bhasker react to Rhea Chakraborty being mobbed at NCB office: ‘Witness our lowest, shameful witch hunt’Hours before Chakraborty’s questioning began, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde said: “Rhea is ready for arrest as this is a witch hunt and if loving someone is a crime, she will face the consequences of her love. Being innocent, she has not approached any court for anticipatory bail in all the cases foisted by Bihar police now with CBI, ED and NCB.”Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14, with investigators launching a probe into the possibility of suicide.On August 19, the Supreme Court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate the case related to the actor’s death, while holding that the FIR registered in Patna was legitimate. The agency has registered an FIR against Chakraborty and others in connection with the actor’s death after the Centre accepted the Bihar government’s recommendation to transfer the probe in the matter from Patna.The Enforcement Directorate on July 31 registered an Enforcement Case Information Report in the actor’s death case after an FIR was filed by Rajput’s father KK Singh against Chakraborty in Bihar on July 28.The NCB on Saturday arrested Dipesh Sawant, a member of actor Rajput’s personal staff, as part of its investigation into allegations of drug abuse. Earlier on Saturday, Chakraborty’s brother, Showik, and Rajput’s house manager, Samuel Miranda, were remanded in NCB custody till September 9.On Sunday, the NCB arrested Khar resident Anuj Keshwani, the ninth person to be held in the case. Keshwani was arrested for allegedly supplying drugs to Kaizan Ibrahim, who was arrested in the case on Friday. “During interrogation, Ibrahim confessed that he used to buy drugs from Keshwani. Now we will question him to trace the further link,” said KPS Malhotra, deputy director of the NCB.The NCB on Friday arrested Showik, Miranda, and two Bandra residents – Abdel Basit Parihar, 23, and Ibrahim.

07-09-2020||India||Key Congress panel headed by Manmohan Singh hasn’t met in 2 months||A Congress consultative committee, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, mandated to meet every day to discuss and formulate the party’s stand on current issues, has not met for over two months, people familiar with the matter said. The last meeting of the 11-member panel was held in July, a Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity. “That day, the panel discussed the Chinese transgressions in eastern Ladakh and deliberated on the party’s stand on the border standoff,” said the functionary. “There were some differences among the members on how the party should articulate its stand on the issue,” he added. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had on April 18, in the midst of the lockdown ordered to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), constituted the group to deliberate on issues related to the pandemic and other current matters. Apart from the former Prime Minister, the group comprises former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary in-charge of the organisation, KC Venugopal, and former union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Jairam Ramesh. Other members of the group are Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate and Rohan Gupta. Surjewala is also the convenor of the group. In a press release, the party had then said the consultative committee will meet virtually every day to deliberate on matters of current concern and formulate the party’s stand on various issues. The panel was also supposed to give suggestions to the government on health and economic challenges in the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19. In the past, the group discussed the revival of micro, small and medium enterprises, crop procurement, issues related to migrant workers, the lockdown exit strategy and the state of the economy. A member of the committee said on condition of anonymity that the panel could not meet after July as the party kept discussing issues through other forums. “This panel was formed to strategise the party’s response to current issues during the Covid-19 times,” he added. Meanwhile, the Congress would formulate its strategy for the monsoon session of Parliament, beginning September 14, at a meeting on Tuesday. The meeting will be attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh, KC Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh, Manickam Tagore and Ravneet Singh Bittu. This will be the first time that some of the 23 signatories to a letter to the party president seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation will come face-to-face with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi after the stormy Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on August 24. Four out of the 23 signatories who are CWC members – Azad, Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada – came under fire from other colleagues at the meeting for writing the letter. After chairing the meeting, Sonia Gandhi, who is also the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP), is likely to travel abroad for a routine health check-up, a party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-cong-panel-headed-by-manmohan-hasn-t-met-in-2-months/story-KNa2ClklGKYYT9hjhuZp1L.html
07-09-2020||India||Delhi govt clinics work overtime to ramp up Covid-19 testing||Seven people wearing face masks stood in front of a small window to get their names listed to undergo a rapid antigen test for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at a government-run clinic in south-east Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan.At a walking distance from the Nizamuddin railway station and the inter-state bus terminus in Sarai Kale Khan, the centre has ramped up testing to perform up to 150 tests a day.Apart from people visiting the centre to get tested – this includes not only the people from the neighbourhood but also people travelling from other states -- staff at the clinic encourages all visitors, including companions of patients, to get tested.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the number of Covid-19 cases rise in the city, the Delhi government is ramping up testing. As on Sunday, with 3,256 cases Delhi saw the highest single day increase in the number of new cases since June end. The number of daily tests has gone from an average of 15,719 tests a day in mid-August to 30,202 tests on average during the past week.Among the people who got tested on Friday was a 42-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, who had accompanied her neighbour to get her baby immunised.“I accompanied my friend who was coming here to get her baby immunised. The doctor asked us to get tested for corona and I turned out to be positive. I do not have any fever or cough. I haven’t stepped out of my house in days. I don’t know how I got the infection,” said the woman. After receiving her report, she was asked by the staff to call her husband and all three of her children to the clinic to get tested.If there is a doubt about the result thrown up by a rapid antigen test , all government-run clinics where samples are collected also have the viral transport media and sample collection kit needed for performing a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that’s considered the most accurate method of diagnosing Covid-19.“We are linked to GB Pant Polyclinic or the Nehru homeopathy hospital nearby where the samples can be tested. If we have a strong suspicion that a person has the infection and still tests negative, we collect an RT-PCR sample,” said a doctor on duty, requesting anonymity.“We also have several DTC bus drivers who come to get tested from time to time. Each day, we get about 10-15 people who get tested for the want of a certificate for joining back at work or travelling. The number of tests goes up on the days that we do immunisation because we ask the family members who accompany the children to get tested,” said the doctor at the clinic quoted above.The dispensary extends monetary incentives to accredited social health activists and Anganwadi workers for motivating people to get themselves tested.Not enough peopleNot all dispensaries have as many takers for testing as the clinic at Sarai Kale Khan. A dispensary in Garhi village, near Greater Kailash, conducts only about 70 to 80 tests a day. “We have the capacity, but almost everyone living around the dispensary has been tested, those who are willing to get tested anyway. It is very difficult to increase the testing further but we are trying,” said a lab technician working at the dispensary.At Shahid Hemu Kalani school in Lajpat Nagar, the sample collection team has to wait till 5pm on some days to complete their target of a 100 tests a day. “The timing is actually till 2 o clock, but we do not leave till we have completed collecting all 100 samples. Yesterday, we were here till 5pm. Usually, it is the people from Lajpat Nagar, Jangpura, and Ashram. Most people come here after hearing announcements made by the district authorities, referred by the nearby MCD {Municipal Corporation of Delhi} hospital, or through word of mouth,” the doctor issuing the reports said, requesting anonymity.The centre is only equipped to do rapid antigen tests. A guard sits at the gate with a sanitiser, directing people to a tent that has been set up with a few chairs outside the school building for those who come to get tested. They are called in one by one and taken to a classroom for sample collection.Motivating people and addressing their concerns are some of the ways in which the government is trying to increase testing.“We have a population of 50 to 60 lakh people in our district, we have done 1 or 2 lakh tests so far. So, it is not like we have covered the entire population. There are still people that we need to test and we have to motivate them,” said an official from north district., requesting anonymityAnother official, from east district, said, also on condition of anonymity: “The problem is that many people either do not know where the tests are happening or they are scared to come to the testing centre. The fear for most is that they have to wait for a long time and they might get exposed at the dispensary itself. To address these fears, we have started giving numbers to people and ask them to come to the centre only at the specified time. And, then their sample can be collected within 10 to 15 minutes. They do not have to wait.”Camps and special drivesApart from the 300 ‘fixed’ centres, the government has also been carrying our special drives and holding camps to reach out to more people, especially the “special surveillance groups” such as migrant workers, auto-rickshaw drivers and vegetable vendors.“For us, the passengers coming to the station are the special surveillance group and we keep going to the station and testing them from time to time, apart from those who come to the dispensary,” said the doctor from the Sarai Kale Khan dispensary. At a dispensary in Sriniwaspuri, where the testing facility is unavailable, people are referred to Okhla Mandi nearby for testing.“A camp is held there every morning from 6 to 10 am. We refer those who come to us to get tested there,” said a nurse at the clinic.A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to text messages and calls requesting comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-clinics-work-overtime-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing/story-wazEswWXTUuh7tSVTdagIM.html
07-09-2020||India||GST not a tax system, it is an attack on India’s poor: Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the second major assault on India’s unorganised economy after demonetisation was the “faulty” Goods and Services Tax (GST). He further alleged that GST was not a tax system but an attack on India’s poor, and called upon countrymen to stand united against it. The video was the third part of Gandhi’s fresh series on economy. He had earlier released a five-part series on Chinese aggression in Ladakh. “GST was UPA’s (Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s) idea. One tax, minimal tax, standard and simple tax. NDA’s (the ruling National Democratic Alliance’s) GST is completely different,” Gandhi said in his latest video message. The Congress argues that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA has badly conceptualised GST.“Small and medium businesses cannot pay this tax. The big companies can easily pay it by putting 5-10-15 accountants to do the job. Why are there four different rates? This is because the government wants those who have the means to be able to easily change GST, and those who don’t have means, cannot do anything about GST,” he said in the 2.27-minute video. “Who has the means? India’s biggest 15-20 industrialists. So, whatever tax law they want to change can easily be done in this GST regime,” added Gandhi. Also Read: Modi dispensation’s thinking - minimum govt, maximum privatisation: Rahul GandhiThe former Congress chief also attacked the government for its “failure” to pay the GST compensation to states. “And what is the result of NDA’s GST? Today, the government of India is unable to provide the GST compensation money to the states. The states are unable to give money to state employees, teachers, etc,” he said. “Hence this GST is an absolute failure. Not only is it unsuccessful, it is an attack on the poor and on the small and medium businesses,” Gandhi added. Gandhi urged the people to recognise this attack and stand against it together. “GST is not a tax system, it is an attack on India’s poor. It is an attack on small shopkeepers, small and medium businesses, farmers and labourers. ​We have to recognise this attack and stand against it together,” he said. Gandhi’s latest video series comes in the wake of the Indian economy’s decline by a record 23.9% in the first quarter of April to June in the current financial year of 2020-21. The deceleration reflected the economic impact of the 68-day Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions in the first quarter.  Gandhi has often described the GST as “Gabbar Singh Tax”, a pun on the name of the villain in the famous Bollywood movie Sholay, insisting that it is flawed and needs to be reformed and changed. Also Read: Note ban meant to hurt informal sector: Rahul GandhiBJP spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said, “Across globe single indirect tax is considered as a mega reform. India’s GST has subsumed more than 13 indirect taxes into one online tax system for ease of compliances. With its online registration, filing of returns, payment, assessment and refund, it removes subjectivity and harassment to small assesses. It has successfully reduced the incidence of taxes on the consumers also with input tax credit.”He went on to say that more than 60% of small businesses are in the informal sector and were facing continuous harassment from local inspectors, which is now a history. “All MSMEs are coming into formalisation segments which is important for 97% of our labour force’s social well-being. Establishment of the GST council is a landmark for our federal structure, where all decisions are taken collectively,” he said. Agarwal termed it “initial hiccups”, adding: “A country like Australia took more than six years for implementation. It’s the need of the hour, globally implemented as a progressive reform.”In the first video, Gandhi alleged that the central government has destroyed the economy by repeatedly assaulting the informal sector and the latest attack on it was the coronavirus-induced lockdown. In the second video, Gandhi alleged that the government’s hidden agenda behind demonetization, which saw the scrapping of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, was to deliberately harm India’s informal sector, which survives on liquid cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-not-a-tax-system-it-is-an-attack-on-india-s-poor-rahul-gandhi/story-7nXI9osy9utumhBxJ0z1jP.html
07-09-2020||Editorials||Planning a green future for Delhi||According to a report in The Indian Express, the Delhi 2041 Master Plan will have a “blue-green policy”. The groundwork for Delhi’s master plan is happening at a critical juncture with the pandemic forcing city governments across the world to rethink not just the way citizens will live in the future, but also how public and private resources will be used to respond to the social and economic challenges that the disease has brought to the fore. The Delhi master plan will not only shape the future of the Capital by laying down planning guidelines, but also shape its response to a post-Covid-19 world.One lesson of the Covid-19-hit world has been that cities have to be sustainable, and Delhi Development Authority (DDA)’s promise of formulating a “blue-green policy” offers hope. By pursuing a “blue-green policy”, DDA aims to bring water management and green infrastructure (vegetation, soils, and other elements and practices to restore some of the natural processes required to create healthier urban environments) together. It also focuses on cycling infrastructure to reduce pollution, and vertical growth in unauthorised colonies to make it less dense. These promised steps are important because water management, reuse and recycling, sanitation, and good public hygiene have now become non-negotiable, thanks to the climate crisis and Covid-19. But the Delhi master plan needs citizens’ participation to make it robust and functional. DDA has chalked out a series of activities to engage with stakeholder groups. These groups must ensure that the master plan’s core principles — sustainability, inclusivity and equity — are not lost, as authorities balance competing socio-political-economic interests while drawing up the new plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/planning-a-green-future-for-delhi/story-de6noAP1wgqqgvShHeRiGP.html
07-09-2020||Editorials||With the number of cases increasing, the health infra will be truly tested||On Friday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed four million. By Sunday, India overtook Brazil to become the world’s second-worst hit country. But none of this comes as a surprise. India has been reporting the most daily cases in the world since early August, and has had the world’s worst-recorded case trajectory since August end. The most important figure through any pandemic, however, is the number of lives lost to it. India’s case fatality rate of 1.7% is significantly better than not only the global average of 3.2%, but also the United States and Brazil — both around 3%. This has been the primary driver of the Centre’s argument that India has handled the pandemic better than other similarly-hit nations. But despite that, more than 70,000 people have died from Covid-19. This is a significant number, and begs the question if there are things the government could have done differently to prevent the loss of lives. When the first (and hardest) lockdown shut the country down on March 25, India had 500 active cases and 10 deaths. Since then, these curbs have been gradually relaxed in seven subsequent phases. Today, when there are more than 860,000 active cases, a majority of economic activities have resumed. An argument can be made that this lockdown came in reverse order. Curbs could have been applied lightly at first, and then gradually strengthened when daily cases rose. In such a system, India would have the hardest phase of the lockdown today. But such an argument is easier to make in retrospect. In March, the world knew little about Covid-19. In a situation where experts were (and still are) learning how to fight the pandemic, a hard lockdown was one of the few concepts that had unanimous scientific backing. The government says it bought India time to strengthen its health care infrastructure, particularly in regions that needed it the most. This claim, though, will be put to the harshest test in the coming weeks. As India’s daily cases continue to set world records, the bulk of the latest infections have come from the hinterland at a time when malaria and dengue spike in these regions. Saving lives, not just in proportion of total Covid-19 cases, but also in absolute numbers, from this point will get tougher by the day, and how the government handles this will determine how well the country has truly fared against the pandemic — and how well it put the lockdown to use in terms of building health infrastructure and capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-as-numbers-spike-the-health-infra-will-be-truly-tested-now/story-i5jCY2jOnGK3X4prhiiS1M.html
