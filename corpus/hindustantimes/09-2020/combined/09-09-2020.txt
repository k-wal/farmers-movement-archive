The rule of sub-judice as a legal term can be found in section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, the gist of which is that if a suit is pending in a court, another suit which is directly and substantially the same cannot be tried by the same court or another court.This principle has been adopted by Parliament and the rules relating to motions, resolutions, petitions, questions contain the same. Under this, a matter which is under the consideration of a court of law should not be taken up as a subject matter of a motion, resolution, petition or questions. Thus, it can be seen that the rule of sub-judice imposes restrictions on the right of Members of Parliament to raise matters in the House.Legislatures in our country have the absolute privilege to discuss any matter of public importance. The Constitution provides for freedom of speech in the legislature. But legislatures have imposed on themselves the sub-judice restriction in consideration of the fact that deliberations in a House on a matter which is before the court might influence the latter. However, this restriction has stirred a debate because it has the effect of preventing the Houses from discussing important public issues merely because the matter is before a court of law. GV Mavalankar, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, laid down the right approach to be adopted on this issue, “The chair has to ensure that no discussion in the House should prejudice the courts of justice, the chair has also to see that the House is not debarred from discussing an urgent matter of public importance”.A committee of presiding officers under the chairmanship of VS Page, the then chairman of the Maharashtra Legislative Council, had suggested in 1968 that freedom of speech is a primary right, whereas the rule of sub-judice is a self-imposed restriction. So, where need be, the latter must give way to the former.This approach was followed by the presiding officers of Parliament. Parliament, for example, discussed many scams in the past although those issues were before the court. Committees were appointed to investigate those scams. In this context, it is noteworthy that rule 388 of the House rules provides for the suspension of any rule to enable the House to discuss a matter. Thus, the rule of sub-judice can also be suspended in an appropriate context; it is neither absolute nor immutable.In the context of the direction issued by the presiding officers of Parliament, it must be said that no rule relating to committees mentions sub-judice or imposes restrictions on this ground on the subjects selected by the committees. In fact, the rule of sub-judice in the House has lost much of its relevance over a period of time. Initially, the Houses of Parliament might have thought that a discussion on the floor of the House might influence the courts, and thus it might interfere with the dispensation of justice. But there is no empirical evidence that the courts were influenced by a debate in the House or by an investigation by a committee of the House. Further, the courts examine strictly the legal aspects of a matter brought before them and determine the culpability of a person on the basis of clear evidence. They do not examine the political, economic and other dimensions of the issue. A committee of Parliament, on the other hand, looks at all other dimensions comprehensively and submits a report to the House. The committees are recommendatory bodies which make recommendations and not issue decrees.Therefore, the sub-judice rule cannot be interpreted to imply that the Houses of Parliament or their committees cannot debate or investigate any matter which is before the court. The scope of examination, the conclusions arrived at by the committees, the status of recommendations all clearly indicate that the committees operate in a different field. The courts decide legal issues. The committees do not deal with legal matters alone. The courts do not decide issues on the basis of debates in Parliament or investigation by a committee. In fact, even in the case of courts, one Bench is often not influenced by another Bench of the same court. The recent judgment of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on the subclassification within the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is a case in point. A five-judge Bench held earlier that subclassification is against the Constitution. The new five-judge Bench held that it is constitutionally valid. The fear that a debate in Parliament or an investigation by a committee will influence the judges is imaginary.The Speaker’s direction is binding on the chairmen. Therefore, they can’t take up a matter which is sub-judice. Nevertheless, it must be noted that no rule in the rules of procedure of the House prohibits a committee from examining a matter on the ground that it is before the court. The rule of sub-judice is a needless restriction on the freedom of speech in the House. The restrictions on the committees are not sanctioned either by the Constitution or by the rules of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-curtail-free-speech-in-parliament/story-422zH8HtFFvf6h2ZQzcA5J.html
09-09-2020||News||Bridging the power gap with China||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on September 4, “We have an unprecedented situation on the India-China border, we have never had this sort of situation since 1962”. He demanded a reversion “to the status quo that existed before such aggressive actions took place”. However, neither he nor anyone else in government, nor official statements of military-to-military talks nor of diplomatic engagements has given a comprehensive account of either the “situation” or how the status quo has been broken.Details that have appeared in the media have been based on off-the-record briefings or leaks. Official statements have been imprecise. For instance, the ministry of defence statement on the defence minister’s recent discussions with his Chinese counterpart in Moscow held China responsible for the current difficulties for attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. Have these attempts succeeded? If not, what is implied by reversion as demanded by the foreign secretary? While the precise nature of China’s territorial transgressions has not been officially clarified, what is clear is that Beijing’s actions have “transgressed the territory of trust”, as former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh accused Pakistan of doing in violating the Line of Control (LoC) during the Kargil conflict. And, this transgression by China has been enormous and grave. It follows then that India’s China policy, which was put in place in 1988 by Rajiv Gandhi and maintained by all successive governments, is no longer valid for its very premise was trust. That approach rested on a peaceful Line of Actual Control (LAC), finding a solution to the border problem, and uninhibited development of India-China relations in other areas, including trade. In seeking elements to guide the formulation of a fresh policy, it is essential to admit the great overall power differential between India and China. A comparison, in the regional context, admittedly crude though not simplistic, is the following: Pakistan is to India what currently India is to China. The crucial word is currently, for while Pakistan’s resource potential will remain permanently inferior to that of India, that is not true of India vis-à-vis China. India has a lot to catch up but it has the wherewithal to effectively bridge the gap which has grown over the past four decades. This will require a national consensus, but it can and must be done. As long the Pakistan-India-China power differentials remain as they are now, it would be useful to consider Pakistan’s India policy. It is rooted in permanent confrontation and a general avoidance of developing cooperative mechanisms including in the commercial and economic spheres. Significantly, in 1996, the then Chinese president Jiang Zemin advised Pakistan to pursue the Sino-Indian model of relations — to normalise and advance relations in other spheres while addressing mutual differences.Jiang Zemin’s views were disregarded because the Pakistan army obviously felt that commercial and economic relations would give India leverage to cause disruptions in case of open hostilities and even otherwise. Further, such a web of ties would be a disincentive for India to address the Jammu and Kashmir issue. Pakistan decided to continue to rely on essentially a three-pronged approach: The development of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, maintaining an effective military balance along LoC, and the instrument of terror. The overall consequence of its India policy has contributed immensely to Pakistan’s impoverishment over the past three decades.It would obviously be necessary to avoid the pitfalls of Pakistan’s India policy. Certainly, the use of terror or low-intensity conflict in dealing with a larger neighbour, even if possible, is counterproductive. But there is a need to pay far greater attention to upgrade India’s strategic programme to develop manifest deterrence through a triad. The hardening of defences all along LAC to prevent Chinese adventurism has to be undertaken on a priority basis. This will require financial investments but that cannot be avoided despite the current economic troubles.The other elements of China policy need greater consideration and dexterity. These relate to economic and commercial ties. Currently, India’s dependence on some supply chains emanating from China has strategic implications. This applies to a range of industries such as pharmaceuticals. These have to be reduced to a minimum and domestic production, as envisaged in Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar (self-reliance) programme, has to be fostered on an urgent basis. Other sources have to be developed even at a greater cost but the trade door should not be shut. Greater and open cooperation with major countries equally troubled by Chinese aggressiveness and lack of respect for global rules has to be actively cultivated. India must give up its traditional reluctance rooted in ideology, bearing in mind that it is too large to act as any power’s subordinate ally. Finally, the Sino-Pak nexus has to be addressed through working on the vulnerabilities of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/bridging-the-power-gap-with-china/story-4OalcjuIms94RUIiHIR4AN.html
09-09-2020||News||An Academic Bank of Credit will transform Indian education||The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) has introduced innovative concepts to improve access, equity and quality education in India. It is forward-looking and student-centric, giving students the freedom to choose disciplines, colleges and universities. This freedom is envisioned through the choice-based credit system, multiple entry-multiple exit (MEME) options in a programme and, most importantly, the establishment of an Academic Bank of Credit (ABC). ABC will digitally store academic credits earned from recognised higher education institutions (HEIs) and allow for credit redemption in order to be awarded a certificate, diploma or degree. ABC is an online entity to be established and managed by the ministry of education. It will function much like a commercial bank with students as account-holders to whom the bank provides services, including credit accumulation, credit transfer, credit redemption through the opening, closure and validation of accounts. Students who pursue education as freelancers can also accumulate credits. These credits can be deposited to student accounts. After the accumulation of credits, a student can redeem these in order to get any academic degree. It works on the principle of MEME as well as “anytime learning, anywhere learning, and any level learning”. It can facilitate the integration of campuses by creating student mobility within the university system. ABC can also help integrate skills into a credit-based system by providing a credit recognition mechanism. It will, however, not give awards, degrees or certificates. Opening an account with ABC is not mandatory.Its objectives include promoting student-centricity in higher education and enabling them to select courses, departments or institutions; allowing students to choose a pace for their studies along with associated cost, and enabling MEME for students to complete their degrees as per their preferences; and permitting teaching-learning activities with increased integration of campuses to facilitate lifelong learning among formal and informal students for full-time and part-time modes. Students who may or may not have been enrolled in HEI but wish to pursue an education and consolidate their academic records for employment or other purposes can register with ABC. It enables a student to accumulate institutional credits from numerous sources into a single account. It will maintain academic records and issue an official transcript. This transcript will be recognised by all the member-universities of ABC. If students are working towards a qualification, they will have to accumulate sufficient credits to gain the total credit value of the qualification. Students may be able to transfer their credits as part of one study programme to another, offered by the same institution, and/or transfer credit when moving from one institution to another. How students can transfer credits is determined by each institution’s assessment regulations. However, the transfer of credits between HEIs of similar categories will be allowed to ensure quality. For instance, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) A-grade credits can be transferred to other A grades and to B or C grades. However, credits earned from HEI with lower NAAC grades may not be transferred at the same value to higher NAAC grade institutions. ABC can be operationalised under a standard framework such as the National Academic Depository under the aegis of the ministry of education. A participating institution/university will have to formally qualify and agree to be a part of ABC. The credits earned will be recorded with an approved national agency and will have a fully-defined shelf life for its value in the award of a degree/diploma/post-graduate diploma/certificates. ABC is a revolutionary step which will promote access, equity, quality, flexibility, mobility, collaboration, transparency, and integration to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of India’s education system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/an-academic-bank-of-credit-will-transform-indian-education/story-iHUdmNX0Qf1CQ0BVUXyqbP.html
09-09-2020||News||Air pollution can intensify Covid-19||As India faces a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, it is critical to employ all reasonable strategies to decrease transmission and to lower the number of severe infections which burden the health care system. Reducing air pollution is one such strategy that may be more important for India than any other country globally. So far, the spread of the pandemic has occurred during spring and summer when air pollution is relatively mild, but the interaction of high winter pollution levels with Covid-19 infections can have serious consequences.India has some of the highest exposures to air pollution in the world and faces a double impact from outdoor air pollution in cities and throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, plus household air pollution from the millions of chulhas in daily use especially in rural areas. Covid-19 is a respiratory infection, and we know from other such infections that air pollution can worsen their severity through its impact on the immune response. In 2019, nearly 200,000 respiratory infection deaths in India were linked to air pollution exposure. Simply put, air pollution may be an important factor that moves a mild Covid-19 infection to one that requires acute medical care. Although direct evidence of the impact of air pollution on Covid-19 is limited, and more time will be needed to conduct proper studies, evidence from the SARS epidemic in 2003 (caused by a similar virus) indicated a link between air pollution and increased mortality. Evidence from multiple countries, including studies from India, shows consistent associations between both short-term exposure to air pollution and hospitalisation for pneumonia infections (in children), and between long-term exposure and several types of respiratory infections in children. Studies of short-term increases in air pollution suggest a worsening severity of co-incident respiratory infections. This co-exposure interaction is supported by mechanistic studies which show how air pollution reduces the immune response to respiratory infections. For example, in the lower airways, where respiratory infections are most damaging, immune cells called macrophages can digest and destroy viruses and bacteria, but under conditions of air pollution exposure, these cells become filled up with particles and are no longer effective against the infection. Emerging research also suggests the air pollution may alter lung cells to increase the number of Sars-CoV-2 virus receptors. In addition, another group of studies indicates that longer-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of infections, especially in those with pre-existing chronic lung disease. In this case, air pollution can lead to permanent structural changes in the lungs that erode a person’s reserves. An infection that might lead to mild symptoms in a healthy person results in severe impact in those with chronic lung disease. This may be one reason that many of the same diseases caused by air pollution are also present in the majority of people with Covid-19 infections severe enough to require hospitalisation.Along with these roles in increasing susceptibility to infections and worsening infection severity, some reports also suggest a role of air pollution in increasing transmission of the virus. Studies have detected the presence of the virus on air pollution particles, but this does not mean these particles are themselves infectious and current evidence does not suggest that the virus hitching a ride on air pollution particles is an important route of transmission. Further, there is little evidence to indicate that infections occur outdoors except when people are in very close proximity. Although there is no direct evidence, there is a plausible pathway by which air pollution may enhance transmission by making it more likely that an infected individual will cough.So, what does this all mean for India? From one perspective, the current timing of the pandemic in India during the months of the year when air pollution is at its lowest levels suggests a window of opportunity during which concerted actions to reduce virus transmission may be effective in “flattening the curve”. However, timing is important, as winter typically brings much higher levels of air pollution and the potential for the interaction with Covid-19 infections to lead to far larger impacts. Thus it is critical, even as economic activity increases, to accelerate the air pollution control measures already described in the National Clean Air Programme. Actions such as agricultural (stubble) burning that may lead to episodes need to be either curtailed entirely or managed in a way that is timed with tightening of pandemic management measures. In the future, full-scale lockdowns are unlikely, but may be replaced by on-again/off-again measures that could be targeted towards periods of high and low air pollution, to balance Covid-19 cases and air pollution against economic activity and employment. More rapid expansion of LPG use may reduce household pollution. There has never been a more important time for action on air pollution. Efforts implemented today will have immediate impact related to Covid-19 and will also continue to bear dividends long into the future via benefits on diabetes and chronic heart and lung diseases. What’s more, actions taken to improve air quality will benefit everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/air-pollution-can-intensify-covid-19/story-tmm1uBrK8yqX5r3dUhZzRO.html
09-09-2020||News||Shinzo Abe redefined India-Japan ties | Opinion||From capturing global strategic imagination with his “Confluence of the Two Seas” speech in the Indian Parliament to articulating the India-Japan Indo-Pacific Vision 2025 — the Shinzo Abe era is defined by high-powered diplomacy that delivered.As the challenges to the liberal order grew, India and Japan turned their geopolitical and geo-economic concerns into concerted actions. They advanced issue-based alignments, be it defending the rules-based order through Japan-United States (US)-India (JAI) and Quad or designing the Australia-India-Japan Supply Chain Resilience Initiative.China’s rise, alliance politics and hedging against American abandonment shaped Tokyo’s policy discourse. Abe’s strategic calculations manifested internal and external balancing. He rewired Japan’s post-war security posture, reinforced the US-Japan alliance, and wove a network of strategic partnerships across Indo-Pacific. Abe envisaged Tokyo’s role in the international system as a stabiliser and a rules-promoter. His Indo-Pacific Vision remained anchored on rule of law, freedom of navigation and over flight, trade liberalisation, and multilateralism.As Japan conceptualised universal value- based strategic designs, India has been accorded primacy in the Arc of Freedom and Prosperity, Asia’s Democratic Security Diamond, and the Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Abe’s strategic imagination was complemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Act East policy. Mutuality of values and convergence of strategic interests added qualitative depth. Much of the dynamism draws from the personal comradery between the two leaders. The high-resolution optics — from shinkansen ride to Kobe and private dinner at Yamanashi home, Ganga aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat and road show to Sabarmati Ashram — Abe has left a deep impression in Indian public memory. The leaders pushed for collective responsibility in securing the global maritime commons. Firming up maritime security cooperation with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, advancing maritime domain awareness, finalising reciprocal support concerning logistics, supplies, and services through Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), and augmenting interoperability within Indo-Pacific navies through Malabar exercises enabled greater leeway in managing a range of shared challenges.The Abe era also played an instrumental role in enabling India’s economic modernisation. Tokyo is not just a leading source of Official Development Assistance (ODA), but also a top source of foreign direct investment. From mega industrial corridors, high- speed rail and modernising urban rapid transport system, Japanese development assistance has been an enabler. But it is not just mega projects in economic epicentres, Abe has successfully steered development assistance in strategic peripheries, including the Northeast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan’s commitment to the Northeast is projected through the upcoming industrial township in Assam to road connectivity projects that advances quality infrastructure and links the Northeast to the regional value chains and markets of Southeast Asia.Abe drove infrastructure financing to engineer new frontiers of growth by seizing the international infrastructure market and buttressing strategic partnerships across Southeast and South Asia. Abe designed Japan’s Expanded Partnership for Quality Infrastructure initiative, which served as a win-win formulation for Delhi as it intersected with the Make in India initiative. Fostering economic linkages, industrial networks and connectivity by employing collective capabilities with other like-minded countries has led to joint projects in a few Bay of Bengal states. In navigating the geopolitics of Indo-Pacific, India-Japan prioritised the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) centrality and coordinated strategic agendas in the Asean-led multilateral frameworks. In shaping geo-economics, the Abe administration favoured India’s membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), even though India has had unresolved outstanding issues. But there have been some misses as well. Trade balance and progress in high-technology trade needs more attention. As Abe eased Japan’s arms export policy, the latitude for defence technology cooperation has been redefined. Key policy documents and business lobbies in Japan have prioritised markets such as India, but trade in defence technology is a relatively new domain. While cooperative research on Unmanned Ground Vehicle/robotics have been undertaken, concluding the maiden G2G defence equipment cooperation has proved challenging.As Delhi gears up for a post-Abe leadership, India’s ascendency in Japan’s strategic frame will endure and outlive the Abe administration. This is primarily because the variables that pushed Tokyo to incorporate Delhi in its Indo-Pacific matrix will perhaps become even more urgent, given the geopolitics and geo-economics of the post-Covid-19 world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/shinzo-abe-redefined-india-japan-ties/story-vnqdjO8Ey65GAi48VZbXjI.html
09-09-2020||News||What will drive India’s next economic transformation, writes Amitabh Kant||With global supply chains being reforged, India must position itself as a vital link in this new order. Governments across the world are encouraging countries to shift their manufacturing out of China. A strong export orientation, cost-competitive manufacturing and creation of domestic champions is the need of the hour. An Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) will not be possible without growing exports to serve global markets. Therefore, global orientation is imperative. At the same time, India imports a large number of commodities that are available in abundance within India itself. Take coal for instance. Despite having some of the largest reserves in the world, India still imported coal worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2018-19. Now, with commercial coal mining a reality, we should see steady reductions in our import bills. Defence is another area where India has been a large importer. A gradual import substitution of 101 items worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore over the next five years has already been announced and a bold move of increasing FDI limits from 49% to 74% also announced. India has an abundance of minerals which can go into making metals like aluminium which has strategic future uses and super-alloys needed for defence production and in a range of industries. Providing a reform-based stimulus to the economy during the Covid-19-induced recession, historic reforms were announced in the agriculture sector and the coal sector was de-monopolised, paving the way for private sector investment. A conducive business environment will enable both domestic and foreign investment. However, there are a few critical elements that must be addressed to create a business environment that is the envy of the world. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s vision for an Atmanirbhar Bharat hinges decisively on the success we are able to achieve in our manufacturing sector. We must move away from capital-linked subsidies to production-linked incentives. And this has been showing encouraging results. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobile phone manufacturing has been showing impressive results. Several other PLI schemes have been announced. This is one of the vital cogs in enabling large-scale, low-cost manufacturing. While imposing tariffs on imports seems like an easy solution to reducing imports, the effect is some time the opposite of what was expected. If duties are raised on critical inputs for exports, then the cost of exports would rise, making them uncompetitive in global markets. Even if duties are imposed on consumer goods, the duties should contain a sunset clause and be phased out in a clearly-defined timeline, allowing the domestic industry to grow.Land and labour have been the traditional constraints in achieving scale in manufacturing. Multiple labour laws at the central government-level will be subsumed into four labour codes, with three set to be tabled in the coming monsoon session of Parliament. Another vital element is that of easing the regulatory burden. India has already made progress in this regard, as evidenced by our jump of 79 positions in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Rankings. Going forward, delays in clearances and multiple permissions must become a thing of the past. The states must take the lead and cooperate on this front. India’s high cost of logistics relative to other competing nations has been a disadvantage. The central government will continue its push towards elevating India’s infrastructure to world-class standards through the National Infrastructure Pipeline. Our port turnaround time stands at approximately 60 hours, despite significant improvements in the past years. Digitisation of our ports will be critical in reducing our turnaround time.India’s domestic market will serve as the base of an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Combined with world class infrastructure and a conducive business environment, India will attract both domestic and foreign investments in manufacturing. These investments will, in turn, promote high quality, cost-competitive manufacturing, leading to India taking its rightful place in global value chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-will-drive-india-s-next-economic-transformation/story-xIQi61gZgF9Lnsa19IVimK.html

09-09-2020||City||Armed with gadgets and apps, schools gear up for online term-end exams||Gurugram: After conducting classes virtually for roughly six months, schools across the city are now gearing up for online half-yearly examinations. Aided by myriad tech and online platforms, schools are pivoting towards newer ways of examination and assessments. Schools have been experimenting with online tests for the past few months and will using them for the term-end assessment tests that start by next week in most places. At Kunskapsskolan International, tests are being conducted through a web platform. The portal works across browsers and devices and can be accessed by students through an exam key. It allows teachers to check answer sheets online if it has been typed or make corrections alongside scanned answer scripts shared by students. “The students get an exam key through which they log in to the platform. They can choose between doing the exam on the platform by typing it out or doing it on pen and paper and uploading the answer scripts after scanning,” said Ramanjit Khinda, school headmistress. Khinda said the school was mostly using the pen and paper option to ensure students improve their handwriting. Manav Rachna International School, whose half-early examinations are slated to take place in October, will use MS Teams. Surabhi Joshi, vice-principal, said the online exams had facilitated a constant cycle of feedback and provided results at a short notice. “There are options through which we can take regular shorts tests. In the MCQ-based test, we can pre-feed the answers due to which students get instant results,” Joshi said. At Heritage Xperiential Learning School, assessments -- a blend of questions that require both long and short textual input from students -- have been place taking through the school’s online Learning Management System. The completed answer sheets are submitted to teachers as PDF files which students generate using readily available scanning applications. “Each segment of assessment has time assigned for reading, writing, and uploading of answer scripts separately. Two teachers invigilate each testing session and monitor the students closely,” said Neena Kaul, school principal. While most online testing platforms offer certain safety features to ensure unfair means are not used, school administrators said that they were not fool-proof. “There is a safety feature in the platform being used by us. If the student clicks on any other window during the exam, the exam gets locked for the student. However, there are times when students are thrown out due to connectivity issues as well,” said Khinda. In view of these challenges, most schools are relying on academic trust and sincerity, and making students and parents sign undertakings. Lotus Valley International School has taken an undertaking from parents for examinations that start next week. “While cameras will stay on during the exam, a little monitoring at home also helps. We have taken an undertaking from parents to monitor their children from home. Teachers will be monitoring the exams as they take place,” said Anita Malhotra, school principal. Khinda said school holds discussions prior to the exams to reiterate the importance of academic sincerity. “We have discussions with the students wherein we share our thoughts and motivations about conducting exams. Students are encouraged to be fair to themselves and the examination process,” she said. Rashmi Malik, principal, Salwan Public School, Sector 15, said online exams came with a gamut of options ranging from Google forms to quizzes to more sophisticated platforms, which could eventually way for a blended model of education. “If there’s an 80 marks paper, we divide it into 40 marks of MCQ and 40 marks of subjective answers or other combinations. Testing can also be made interesting,” said Malik. The school has also undertaken a new initiative wherein students have been asked to create five questions whose answers cannot be found on Google. “If children are able to create such questions, they may get some extra marks. Due to initiative, children are going into the depth of the topics to come up with unique questions. At the same time, a bank of such questions is being formed for teachers,” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/armed-with-gadgets-and-apps-schools-gear-up-for-online-term-end-exams/story-CltC0JYiB64EqBp172b9BK.html
09-09-2020||Gurugram||Joint survey of Gurugram-Faridabad metro project conducted, station near Ghata to be proposed||Keeping in mind future population growth, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) will propose an additional metro station near Ghata village to the 32-km Gurugram-Faridabad Metro project that will connect the twin cities. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram, said they had conducted a field survey from Vatika Chowk to Bata Chowk along the entire alignment of the project, studying location of stations, how much land was required for these stations and other related aspects. “We have decided to propose that an additional station be included in the alignment near the confluence of Golf Course road and Ghata village as the population is expected to rise significantly and the metro station is needed there,” he said. The survey, following directions from the Haryana chief secretary, was jointly done by HSVP, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation (HMRTC).The Gurugram-Faridabad light metro rail project -- between Vatika Chowk on Sohna road with Bata Chowk in Faridabad-- will cost Rs 5900 crore and was initially planned to have 11 stations, five in Faridabad and six in Gurugram. The stations planned are at Bata Chowk, Aravali Golf Course, Badkhal Enclave, Pali Stone Crusher Zone, Police Chowki Manger — all in Faridabad — and Mandi village, Sector 56, Rosewood city, South City 2, Sushant Lok III and Vatika Chowk along Golf Course road in Gurugram, said a senior HSVP official.. Six of these metro stations will be elevated while two would be underground, they added. HSVP Gurugram administrator Yadav also said they would also look into a demand from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for eight to 10 acres to build a metro depot near DLF Golf Course. “We will look into the ownership of the land and take steps to make it available to DMRC,” he said. The Gurugram-Faridabad metro route will be constructed on the central verge of Golf Course extension road and on major parts of Gurugram Faridabad road as a result of which the requirement of land is minimal for the track and would be needed for construction of metro stations and the train depot, said officials. The Gurugram-Faridabad metro project was announced by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in 2016. The detailed project report has been prepared by DMRC and was handed over to HMRTC in June this year. The metro corridor will boost public transport between the twin cities in a major way and also reduce the road traffic on Gurugram Faridabad road. When asked about the proposed survey, a DMRC spokesperson said that the Delhi Metro was a contractor for the project and was not authorised to comment on the matter.Nadim Akhtar, advisor, planning, HMRTC did not respond to phone call and messages to seek a response in this matter. Box The proposed Light Metro rail between Gurugram and Faridabad will be 32.14 KM long. It will have eight stations but HSVP has decided to propose an additional station near Ghata village. The metro depot in Gurugram is being planned near DLF Gold Course. Five stations will be located in Faridabad and four including one proposed in Gurugram. The train will start from Bata Chowk in Faridabad and it will conclude at Vatika Chowk on Sohna road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/joint-survey-of-gurugram-faridabad-metro-project-conducted-station-near-ghata-to-be-proposed/story-UwKCz0H5lyKSja1YDyOHfP.html
09-09-2020||City||Gurugram: MCG plans to adopt measures taken by Indore civic body||Gurugram: To improve the city’s cleanliness and hygiene, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to adopt several measures taken by the Indore Municipal Corporation, said officials on Wednesday. For the purpose, MCG will be conducting a workshop on Swachh Survekshan 2021 at the Sector 27 community centre on Thursday where a few examples of the Indore model would also be shown to the officials and councillors.In the 2020 Swachh Survekshan, Gurugram finished with a rank of 62 out of 382 cities across India. Indore was ranked first for the fourth consecutive year. In February, a team of MCG officials and councillors had toured Indore to study its cleanliness model. Mayor Madhu Azad said that MCG had planned to introduce various measures in the city soon after. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, these plans had to be deferred.“Our visit earlier this year gave us first-hand experience of Indore’s cleanliness model. We had planned to introduce several measures, which the Indore Municipal Corporation had adopted, into Gurugram right away, but these had to be put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, we are looking to introduce these measures once again,” said Azad.Azad said that one of the key learnings for MCG was regarding the cleanliness measures adopted at the household level.“In Indore, waste is segregated at source. There are different bins in each household for organic and inorganic waste, and incorrect dumping invites heavy penalties. The city also has a strong mechanism for composting organic waste. If these are followed by all Gurugram residents, then the city’s cleanliness levels will improve drastically,” said Azad. The fine in Gurugram for this violation is only Rs 100. In Indore, it is Rs 1000 for households and Rs 5,000 for commercial buildings, the officials said.As per the MCG officials, Thursday’s workshop would be carried out in two batches. The first half would be for officials of the MCG, municipal committees of Sohna, Pataudi, Farrukhnagar and Hailey Mandi, while the other would be for councillors from these areas.Harbhajan Singh, a consultant with MCG, said that few examples of the Indore cleanliness model will be shown to the officials during the workshop while ways to improve various criteria such as door-to-door collection of waste, waste segregation, construction and demolition waste, plastic waste, composting, and cleaning of roads and markets would also be discussed extensively.The officials said that MCG is looking to also replicate Indore’s practice of taking attendance of sanitation workers through biometric machines, keeping a track on waste collection, cleaning of roads and markets at night, processing gas from waste which can be used as fuel in public buses, and removing large garbage bins from public spaces. Another key feature the officials said that MCG wants to replicate is to charge Rs 2 for every guest during weddings. “The rationale behind charging fees for weddings is for municipal workers to pick up all the garbage and clean the wedding premises. Barring the making fuel from waste, all the remaining measures can be achieved in a short duration and MCG has also introduced a few measures towards this end,” an MCG official privy to the matter said.The official said that in February, MCG introduced the Swachh Nagar app in Sector 38, in which barcodes were installed outside a few selected households. In this model, a sanitation worker after collecting waste scanned the barcode outside the house and filled details such as the type of waste collected, the time of collection, whether the household owner was absent or if the door of the house was locked. These information would then immediately reach the senior officers of the civic body. The official further said that MCG is yet to take a final call on whether the fines for the dumping of waste incorrectly would be increased in the city. However, he said that the matter is under consideration.Last month, on a pilot basis, MCG had handed out smart hand bands to a few sanitation workers to keep a track on their whereabouts. In regards to the cleaning of roads and public places at night, on August 31, MCG officials said that a target of daily cleaning of more than 200 kilometres of roads had been set, for which 10 sweeping machines were recently procured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-plans-to-adopt-measures-taken-by-indore-civic-body/story-yD0E4PuEgPwhQawevUdwrO.html
09-09-2020||City||Drinking in public places: Gurugram police forms teams to check menace||Gurugram: Acting on complaints against open drinking in the city, the police on Wednesday formed special teams that will conduct raids to crackdown on people drinking in public spaces. The police said that anyone who is found consuming alcohol in public will be arrested on the spot. The police said they have received over 200 complaints against people drinking in the open from different areas in the city in the last one month. Many residents and market associations of different sectors have complained to excise officials and the police against the menace in markets at different areas that include sectors 56, 30 and 14, Golf Course Road, and Golf Course Extension Road. The menace has become more rampant since the lockdown norms were eased, the police said, adding that the areas have been identified and they plan to start raids from Wednesday night. KK Rao, commissioner of police, Gurugram, said that eatery shops in HUDA sector markets now receive high footfalls during the evening. The liquor shops have also opened but the ahataas (drinking places along with liquor vends) are still shut, due to which people buy liquor and either consume it in their cars or near the roadside food carts, he said. “We have already booked around 200 people under the Excise Act in the last one-and-a-half months, but people are still violating the rules leaving other visitors in distress,” Rao said.The police commissioner said they have formed three teams from each police station to visit markets in plain clothes to check the situation and to take prompt action against the violators. “Those found drinking will be arrested on the spot and will have to spend a night in police lock-up. We will share the offenders’ pictures on social media if found creating any nuisance in public places,” he said. The liquor shops reopened in the city on May 6, after the state government announced a series of relaxations in the wake of the Unlock 3.0 guidelines issued by the Centre. The drinking places (ahataas) near liquor vends, however, are still shut across the state. The Haryana excise and taxation department on August 27 had allowed restaurants and hotels to serve liquor at tables along with food, though bars continue to remain closed. In an order issued by the department, restaurant and hotel owners have been asked to get their liquor licences renewed for the current financial year. The police said they have directed the shopkeepers and cart owners not to allow people to drink in open near their outlets, but some shop owners are encouraging open drinking and also serving them. Sumeet Bhatnagar, a shopkeeper at Sector 56 HUDA market, said that the market association has complained to the police against the drinking menace that has become rampant in the last one month. “The families visiting the market do not feel comfortable crossing the stretch due to the open drinking here. This is a major security concern for most of the residents and shopkeepers,” he said. Ashmi Saini, a dentist who runs a clinic in Sector 56 market, said that families have stopped visiting the market after sunset as there are usually some inebriated men who create a nuisance. “These men order for snacks and sit in the open on the stools provided by the cart owners who serve them food, and soda, water and glasses to consume liquor,” she said. Residents said that drinking outside shops and in cars creates a sense of insecurity while visiting residential markets, particularly when they are out with their families. In Sector 14, residents alleged that the crowd after 8 pm in the market consists of mostly men who park their cars and drink inside. “The waiters are familiar with them and quickly take their orders and serve them food. Such people also play loud musing in their cars and they are many times seen scuffling with each other after several drinks down,” said Yajuvender Kadiyan, a former captain of Indian Army. The residents alleged that those indulging in such practices take to residential areas as these are safer and the police do not check all the parked vehicles. “Besides consuming alcohol, some men are often seen getting into fights over the bets. They often abuse each other and create a nuisance, making it difficult to even cross that stretch. They mostly sit outside the shops and have no fear of police patrolling,” said Kavita Yadav, a resident of Sector 23. The residents alleged that they have complained to the police in person and also informed them on the police helpline, but no action has been taken. However, the police said they are taking action against these illegal activities which have reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drinking-in-public-places-gurugram-police-form-teams-to-check-menace/story-Y2GnXkjcG99K8qwAzc23TL.html
09-09-2020||City||Gurugram: To bring down case count, admin, health dept focus on families living with Covid-positive patients||Gurugram: In light of the district having the highest number of Covid-19 patients recuperating in home isolation in Haryana (according to the state health department data), health officials said complacency in following home quarantine and isolation norms is one of the main factors leading to further transmission of coronavirus to other members of an infected person’s family.As the number of active cases is climbing, the health department, as part of its revised strategy to curb the same, is now focusing on proper quarantine of the family members of infected persons as many people are getting infected within their homes after one family member tests positive. Till August 29, at least 81% of the people infected in Gurugram were under home isolation. This increased to 89.45% on Wednesday. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that health care workers as well as ASHA and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) workers have started house-to-house surveillance to create awareness and identify symptomatic cases. “Our ground team is active again to create awareness among people, especially in congested areas to follow basic norms for preventing coronavirus infection,” said Yadav. In the last week of August, the union ministry of health and family welfare released a manual for surveillance teams. It stresses upon house-to-house search for suspected cases and contact tracing, information to be given to the community on hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing and stigma. “People are no longer following basic health hygiene even if they are home isolated. Others within the same family are also not focusing on quarantine, which is leading to rapid transmission of infection. Most of the new cases that are being reported are those where the entire family is infected,” said Yadav.As per the health department’s strategy, family members of an infected person have to be kept under home quarantine for 14 days and high-risk contacts (with co-morbidities) suspected of contracting the virus are to be shifted to Covid care centres to prevent mortality, Yadav said.To facilitate awareness, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on Wednesday flagged off three battery-operated rickshaws, which will move around the city and announce messages on quarantine, isolation, social distance, wearing of masks and sanitisation. He said that awareness generation is critical to counter Covid-19. “All over the country and in the region we are noticing a resurgence in coronavirus cases. There are multiple aspects to it such as movement having increased, and even people are complacent in following the basic norms to prevent infection. To address such issues the focus is now on creating awareness,” said Khatri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-to-bring-down-case-count-admin-health-dept-focus-on-families-living-with-covid-positive-patients/story-KhVoMrnDdAhaclZNXvL8RO.html

A five-member technical committee — that visited the site on August 21 for an inspection of damaged structures — has said in its report that there seemed to be no failure of structure but it seems that load bearing capacity of the site had not been tested. Dr Abhay Shrivastava, disaster management expert, who was a member of the committee, said that it was observed that foundation of the buildings were not laid at hard form strata and erection was not done under technical supervision. “A visit to the sites and discussion with locals revealed that heavy waterlogging has been witnessed in Sector 27 in the past also. There was a need to do a more thorough micro-level zoning, while plotting such areas. Also it was observed that all three plots, where the structures had got tilted, had a vacant plot adjacent to them where waterlogging had taken place that damaged the foundations of these four-storeyed houses. Simply put, these structures did not have enough strength to bear the load,” said Srivastava. The committee in its report has said that keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter and possibility of damage to the adjoining houses, its members visited all the sites on August 21 and minutely studied the structures and took photographs of the tilted buildings. The survey of the house in sector 27 revealed that there was no damage to its structure but the building had collapsed due to foundation failure. In sector 46 also, the team found no cracks in the structure but observed that tilt was caused either due to weak foundation or it was not designed in respect of load bearing capacity. The report further said that the structure in sector 47 was also found damaged due to weak foundation. Jitender Yadav, HSVP, administrator, Gurugram said that he has received the report and it will be studied in detail. “The recommendations will be implemented after discussion with all stakeholders to prevent such incidents in future,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/weak-foundation-inability-to-bear-load-led-to-tilting-of-hsvp-buildings-after-rain-finds-probe-committee/story-6vWpXZXgvkdiTdXa9fuJbK.html

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh smart grid project remains a non-starter, officials blame pandemic||Even after the central government sanctioned ₹241 crore for the pan-city smart grid project, it remains a non-starter in Chandigarh. After missing several deadlines, even the pilot project to install 30,000 smart meters in the city made a little headway.After failing to appoint a consultant for the smart grid project, the UT administration has now again invited applications for the same. It was in July when the UT power department had invited firms to provide consultancy for the project. The ‘Project Design and Management Agency’ is to be appointed for the implementation stage and for the post-implementation handholding, capacity building and vendor management support.The smart grid project entails full automation ranging from power distribution to bill generation. Under it, all ordinary electricity meters in the city will be replaced with about 2.25 lakh smart meters, the existing grid substations will be renovated and upgraded with equipment which is compatible with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) centre, besides modernising power lines and transformers. The Centre had sanctioned ₹241 crore in March this year after several rounds of meetings spanning over last one year. The project will allow the power department to monitor, gather and process real-time electricity data and directly interact with devices such as sensors through human-machine interface software. It will help department employees sitting at the centre to access live information on power cuts, outages and manage emergent power needs of a locality. Bills will be also be generated from this centre. Fresh deadline for pilot projectCurrently, the UT electricity department is undertaking a pilot smart grid project covering city’s 30 sq km. But after failing to complete the project by June this year, the department has now set a fresh deadline of December-end.After much delay in starting the implementation of the project, the department finally had in October last year allotted the work for installing 30,000 smart meters in four sectors (29, 31, 47, and 48), six villages (Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Raipur Kalan, Makhanmajra, and Daria), and the industrial area.But so far, only around 4,500 smart meters have been installed. SCADA centre, which is also a part of the pilot project, is yet to become operational as well. Even though a SCADA centre has been set up in Sector 18, it is yet to become operational. “The installation of all required machinery and other equipment is yet to be done at the SCADA building. Without an operational SCADA centre, the smart meters are of no use,” said a department official who is not authorised to speak with media.Department officials blamed the coronavirus pandemic for the delay in the completion of the pilot project and commencement of the pan-city smart grid project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-smart-grid-project-remains-a-non-starter-officials-blame-pandemic/story-ahvm971EsufE7360IfYjbL.html
09-09-2020||City||Yuvraj intends to play for Punjab in T20 tourney||Chandigarh Cricketer Yuvraj Singh’s fans could be in for a pleasant surprise in the coming domestic season if he walks in to bat for Punjab in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. The swashbuckler southpaw, who led India to the 2011 World Cup triumph, is considering to come out of retirement on Punjab Cricket Association secretary Puneet Bali’s request.The Chandigarh-born 38-year-old cricketer had quit the game in 2019, but remained associated as mentor with Punjab. In the last two months, Yuvraj conducted two long camps with young cricketers, including Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh and Prabhsimran Singh in Mohali and Mullanpur.Yuvraj batted fluently with the youngsters. During one of the T20 practice games, Yuvraj smacked a 36-ball 81 and one of his sixes covered 140 metres over the long-on. “He batted superbly. I could see a glimpse of young and dashing Yuvi in those sixes. He was batting like a dream. The boys were so excited,” said former cricketer and Punjab team manager Girish Bhanot.This knock prompted PCA secretary Puneet Bali to ask Yuvraj to re-consider his retirement and play for Punjab. “It would be great to have him play for Punjab again and also mentor the team. The way he played was very impressive during the practice games,” said Bali. Yuvraj had expressed his desire to play for international leagues like Canada League and T-10 Dubai League but due to the pandemic, they have not been organised. On Wednesday, Yuvraj expressed his desire to get back in action for Punjab in the T20s as he could not refuse Bali’s request. In this regard, Yuvraj has written a letter to BCCI chief and his former captain Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah, seeking permission to make a comeback.The BCCI’s reply on Yuvraj’s request is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yuvraj-intends-to-play-for-punjab-in-t20-tourney/story-8mjCdQQ8Msn8aKfjyMhgzJ.html

09-09-2020||City||Mohali grapples with shortage of beds for critical Covid patients||As Mohali struggles to stem rising cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which went past 5,500 on Wednesday, the district reels under acute shortage of beds for critical patients who fall under the Level-3 category. At Gian Sagar hospital in Banur — the designated Covid facility of Mohali — only 10 beds have been dedicated to critical patients, while for others with less-serious condition, 300 beds have been allocated. The Mohali civil hospital does not have ventilator facility.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “We have few beds for L-3 patients in Gian Sagar. We have been referring critical patients to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala and PGIMER and GMCH-32 in Chandigarh. In case the need arises, we send such patients to private hospitals in Mohali as well.”However, most of the private hospitals in Mohali have five to six beds for L-3 patients and all of them are occupied. Mohali has already logged 124 deaths in past five months. Among those who succumbed to the virus were 70 senior citizens, while 116 people had comorbidities. According to data provided by the administration, 80% of the victims suffered from diabetes and hypertension. Other had liver infections, kidney failures, cancer, heart diseases, asthma and respiratory problems.How are Covid facilities categorisedThe Mohali administration has created a dedicated chain of Covid-19 hospitals in the district — L-1, L-2 and L-3. Facilities under L-1 category deal with uncomplicated cases of Covid-19, such as Chandigarh University in Gharuan that has 100 beds. Cases which require more attention are sent to L-2 category hospitals, such as Gian Sagar that has 300 beds, whereas critical patients are shifted for specialised treatment to hospitals equipped to handle L-3 category cases. Gian Sagar hospital medical superintendent Dr SPS Goraya said they have only 10 beds for L-3 cases, 50 for L-2 and at least 250 for L-1 category patients. “We have requested the authorities concerned to add more beds for L-3 patients,” he added. A senior doctor of the Mohali civil hospital, who was not authorised to speak with media, said they were facing issues due to the admission of L-3 patients. “L-2 patients are generally bedridden and put on drip or need oxygen support. Patients of L-1 category, meanwhile, are generally asymptomatic and have a tendency to roam around the ward. So, we need to make extra efforts to control them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-grapples-with-shortage-of-beds-for-critical-covid-patients/story-WrTDQ1pyUrFGrPKVLBOSYP.html
09-09-2020||Noida||Temperature will rise over the week in Noida, Ghaziabad, predicts IMD||With no rains in the region expected for the next five days, areas including Noida and Ghaziabad will see rise in temperature over the next two days, the weather department said. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the skies will remain partly cloudy and there are no chances of rains until September 17. The direct sunlight and lack of moisture in the air due to unfavourable weather conditions will lead to more heat, with the mercury likely to soar by around three degrees.“Weather conditions for rains are highly unlikely. It’s not just the national capital region or western Uttar Pradesh but entire north-west India. The moisture is also low because there are no favourable easterly winds. Due to this, cloudiness will drop over the region over two-to-three days and mercury will rise,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that while the mercury will rise, the humidity will drop from present 90 to 80% to around 70%. “The maximum temperatures are likely to spike to 38 degrees Celsius in next two-to-three days. However, respite is likely next week, as there could be light rain showers in the region between September 16 and 18,” Srivastava added. The region, including parts of Noida and Ghaziabad, saw drizzle towards September 7. Heavy rain, around 70mm, was last seen on August 28. According to weather analysts, though the rainfall is dropping, the withdrawal of the monsoon will be clarified by September 17.“For now there are no signs of monsoon withdrawal, however, rainfall has dropped in the rest of north-west India. Usually, the withdrawal starts from the second half of September and it starts from Rajasthan. Even in Rajasthan areas, the rainfall has dropped but we will be in clear position to predict monsoon withdrawal by September 16 to 17,” said Srivastava.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature of the region was recorded at 35.6 degrees, two notches above the season’s average, against 35.3 degrees a day earlier.

Passengers can also avoid the hassle of filling physical copies of self-declaration,” he said.DIAL said passengers seeking exemption under the five specific categories will need to fill the forms available on the Delhi Airport website -- www.newdelhiairport.in.Supporting documents along with a copy of their passports have to be submitted at least 72 hours before boarding their flights. However, this time cap does not apply to passengers submitting the self-declaration form.The online forms have been developed in collaboration with the ministry of civil aviation, ministry of health and family welfare, ministry of external affairs and governments of various states and union territories, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh, DIAL said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-45k-applied-for-quarantine-exemption-at-delhi-airport-27k-allowed/story-wEJ2iwiFgg88vX6t8bZsHK.html
09-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: Health dept issues guidelines for disposal of bio-medical waste for patients in home isolation||Following reports of hazardous bio-medical waste disposal in rural areas, the health department has issued guidelines for patients in home quarantine and their caretakers. A letter issued by the health department said there was no facility to dispose of waste of home-isolated patients in rural areas and therefore the department had decided to issue guidelines to ensure safe disposal of bio-medical waste. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said the patients’ and their caretakers’ waste should be kept wrapped in newspaper for 72 hours and disposed of like normal waste after that. Dishes and clothes should be washed by the patient himself with hot water and soap and dried in the sun. Masks, gloves and other disposable items should be heated and washed with soap and dried in the sun and then disposed of along with general waste. Instructions have been issued to registered respiratory therapists’ (RRT) team to guide patients. Khanna civil hospital senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Gulati said, “The municipal committee will collect the waste in rural areas and give it to the company assigned with the task of disposing of waste.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-health-dept-issues-guidelines-for-disposal-of-bio-medical-waste-for-patients-in-home-isolation/story-1AV9zMEPWmUnayJkWRBKnJ.html

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Hospital occupancy by outsiders a worry as cases surge in Chandigarh||Amid the steep surge in coronavirus cases in the city, the occupancy of critical care beds in dedicated Covid hospitals has set the alarm bells ringing for health authorities as more than half of them are taken up by outsiders.The UT health authorities said they have made a provision of around 700 beds for moderate and severe patients in three hospitals — Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Government Multi-specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16.However, as many as 381 beds are currently under use, and 162 of these are occupied by local patients.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said they have 251 Covid patients in Nehru Hospital Extension, out of which only 79 belong to Chandigarh, as 82 are from Punjab, 43 from Haryana, 27 from Himachal Pradesh, and eight from Uttar Pradesh.Similarly, out of the 130 bed occupants in GMCH-32, nearly one-third are from Punjab.Detailed discussion on issueDuring the review meeting of UT administration, health officials and PGIMER authorities, a detailed discussion was held on the issue.The PGIMER director said they had set up a 300-bed facility for Covid patients in Chandigarh, however, most of it has been occupied by outsiders reporting in the emergency ward who turn out to be infected when tested.Stating that they are actively considering to expand the Covid facility, Dr Jagat Ram said being a central government institute, they cannot deny treatment to people from other states.“Non-Covid healthcare system cannot be ignored any more. We have to strike a balance between the virus patients and those coming to the hospital with other ailments. We will see what can be done amid the rising cases,” he said.PGIMER told to prioritise locals: UT officialA senior UT official said, “PGIMER has been told to take up the matter with the central government and also augment the facility by turning Infosys Sarai into a hospital.” The officer added that it has been clarified to PGIMER that priority must be given to Chandigarh patients, while non-critical patients should be made to avail facilities locally in districts and that the patient inflow from neighbouring states must be regulated.Additional beds in the pipelineUT health secretary Arun Gupta said they are trying to increase Covid testing and add more beds for patients needing hospitalisation.“Around 150 beds with oxygen supply will be readied in GMSH-16. Similarly, more beds will be made available in GMCH-32 and Sector 48 civil hospital, but the area of concern remains that patients from outside the city are also getting admitted here, which is beyond our control,” Gupta said.He added that though most infected persons are in home isolation and very few are requiring hospitalisation, the rise in active caseload will also increase the need of beds.Out of 2,484 active cases in Chandigarh, 1,614 are in home isolation, while the remaining are in city’s four Covid care centres — Ayurvedic College in Sector 47, two hostels of Panjab University and Sood Dharamshala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hospital-occupancy-by-outsiders-a-worry-as-cases-surge-in-chandigarh/story-G1UdP9BzbMtmsymCoreIrO.html
09-09-2020||Noida||Integrated control room launched for better waste management in Noida||The Noida authority on Wednesday launched an integrated control room for the better management of solid waste in the city. The objective of the ‘Integrated Control and Command Centre’ is to monitor the waste collection, transportation, and remediation of the waste at Sector 145 plant located off the Noida-Greater Noida expressway, said authority officials.“We want to provide a clean and healthy environment for all who visit and live in this city. This centre will increase the effectiveness of our efforts multi-fold and help our employees improve the quality of life for residents,” Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority, said after inaugurating the facility.The authority has built the control room with the support from HCL Foundation in its Sector 39 building.“HCL is committed to support the Noida authority in its mission of creating a clean, safe, beautiful and pollution-free city for every resident. To make this a reality, the state-of-the-art Integrated Control and Command Centre will help streamline city’s solid waste management mechanism. This is in continuation to our efforts to raise awareness among residents around proper waste disposal and segregation,” said Alok Varma, director, Project Clean Noida of HCL Foundation.The authority has also started a mobile application -- ‘Citizen Grievance Redressal’ -- to address issues raised by the residents. The application has identified 18 grievance categories as defined by the Swachh Bharat Mission.“The grievances, such as including open dumping, dead animal management, open urination and defecation, among others, will be addressed via this mobile application. With the help of this app, any citizen can register a complaint and get the issue related to sanitation resolved,” said a Noida authority official, on condition of anonymity.According to the officials, the authority will deploy six staff members at the control room to coordinate with the employees working at the ground. As per the authority, at least 4,000 sanitation employees work daily to keep the city clean. The authority has started the integrated control room to further improve the sanitation services in the city as the health department is upbeat after securing 25th spot in swachh survey in 2020 and wants to win first position in Uttar Pradesh. Noida has 165 sectors and 65 villages, where 900 metric tonne waste is produced daily. The authority started door-to-door waste collection with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines that crush the waste to transport it easily for remediation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/integrated-control-room-launched-for-better-waste-management-in-noida/story-iVDffqVRnQpTSOx1TfD91I.html
09-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad scores high in implementation of home isolation protocols||A weekly state report for monitoring the home isolation protocols in Ghaziabad said that the district was performing well as far as implementation of home isolation was concerned but has some shortfalls when it comes to provision of supplies to the patients who are isolated at home. According to official records of the district health department, till the evening of September 9, the district had 9,950 Covid-19 cases. Of these, 1,596 were active patients till September 9. Of the total number of active patients, at least 674 are in home isolation. The weekly survey was conducted with feedback from 88 patients in home isolation. The weekly state monitoring report, from September 1 to September 7, shared by the district officials on Wednesday states that the Ghaziabad district saw 94% of its Covid patients had been visited by rapid response team of the health department. Also, of the total number of patients surveyed, at least 83% said the rapid response teams had physically checked their health status.“Our home isolation setup is getting better day by day and Ghaziabad figures among the top districts in the Meerut division when it comes to implementation of home isolation protocols. Our rapid response teams are ensuring that patients in home isolation strictly follow protocols and remain safe when it comes to their health . We are constantly trying to improve,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. The home isolation facility was initiated by the UP government on July 21 for asymptomatic patients, who were allowed to remain at home if they fulfilled certain conditions like having pulse oxi-meter, thermometers, besides having availability of a care giver and adherence to other health protocols. The weekly survey report has indicated that only 88% patients had oxi-meter while 95% patients had thermometers. It also said that only 86% and 89% had been provided hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin tablets by the health teams, respectively. The state government in its protocols had mandated that patients in home isolation as well as their family members including the care giver should be provided with HCQ and Ivermectin as prophylactic medicines to fight Covid-19. The district health department officials said that they have sufficient stock of both the medicines and the rapid response teams had been instructed to ensure that every patient in home isolation had a pulse oxi-meter as well as thermometer. “During visits, our rapid response teams check if patients have thermometers and pulse oxi-meters available with them. It is on this basis that teams stationed at the integrated control and command centre take daily feedback and note down the health status of patients. We have sufficient stock of HCQ and Ivermectin and it will be provided to all patients,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Every small detail is checked with the patients and it is only after this that they are allowed home isolation. Since this survey is based on tele calls to patients, it is possible that some details sometimes get omitted or not mentioned. Otherwise, our patients in home isolation are doing well,” he added. After getting the nod last month, home isolation has been the preferred choice for asymptomatic patients of Covid-19 and it has led to reduction in number of people admitted to L1 category Covid-19 hospitals in Ghaziabad. According to official records on September 9, there were 1996 patients who were allowed home isolation and 1,322 had been discharged as per norms. About 136 of the home isolated patients had also been referred to various healthcare facilities after they developed health complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-scores-high-in-implementation-of-home-isolation-protocols/story-EUMEbJPf3tgbLfgL3fzveL.html

The first 1,000 positive cases were recorded in 99 days while the last thousand took just seven days. According to official figures, with 238 new positive cases (beating the previous highest number of cases in a day on Tuesday) and one death reported on Wednesday, GB Nagar’s overall tally has gone to 9,356. In March and April, 38 and 100 cases were reported in the district, respectively. In May, 315 positive cases were recorded and 1,759 in June. The surge began in July, when 2,794 cases were reported in a month followed by 2,864 in August. In September, the Covid-19 infection appears to be moving in top gear with 1,486 new cases in just first nine days. Covid-19 deaths peaked in July with 20 fatalities. While no death was recorded in March and April, there were seven deaths in May, 15 in June, three in August and three in September till Wednesday. District magistrate Suhas LY said with all economic activities coming back on track, the main aim of the administration is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) to the minimum possible level. “We have got success in this connection. GB Nagar district’s CFR is 0.51%, which is much better than the national CFR of 1.72% and the state CFR of 1.44%. It clearly indicates our sampling rate and recovery rate are increasing. Not only that, GB Nagar has the lowest mortality rate among the districts of the state,” he said. The DM said the administration is leaving no stone unturned to implement stringent containment rules. “We have ramped up testing and started effective monitoring of patients under home isolation. Early hospitalisation for patients needing medical support and efficient infection control in healthcare facilities are our top priorities.” The district administration, on Wednesday, declared a fresh list of 384 containment zones, including 362 in category-1 (where there is only one case) and other 22 in category-2 (more than one case). Under category-1, a containment zone in urban areas will have a 250-metre radius or the entire mohalla (floor, in case the patient resides in a society), while in category-2, there will be an added 250-metre buffer zone (tower and common facilities, in case of a society). “In rural areas, the village will be taken as a containment zone if there is one case. If there is more than one case, the adjoining village will be a buffer zone,” said the DM. GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said several measures were being taken to increase surveillance and minimise the fatality rate. “Due to the continuous effort of our doctors and paramedics, GB Nagar has one of the lowest case fatality rates (CFR) of 0.51% in the country. Less than 19% of our cases remain as over 81% of the total positive cases have been cured. We are trying to give best possible drugs and treatment to all patients, irrespective of their financial position. Plasma therapy has been used successfully by GIMS and recently, a private plasma bank has been set up in Noida, which will provide free plasma to poor patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/from-first-covid-19-positive-case-gb-nagar-reaches-9-000-mark-in-184-days/story-oAzPAYTLgyIDsIzoAwIs4K.html

PU has already decided to scrap the undergraduate entrance tests that were scheduled for October this year.The decision to scrap the law entrance, which was taken on August 11 in view of Covid-19 outbreak, was challenged by two aspirants Navya Raj and Saurav Rao. They had argued that the premise not to hold the entrance is not valid when PU was taking such exams for other courses. Class 12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course would be neither reasonable nor reliable, they had contended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/uils-five-year-law-entrance-conducting-exam-not-possible-amid-pandemic-says-pu-panel/story-88ogJf3jd99Jt62goAAHoJ.html

09-09-2020||Noida||Akshay Kalra murder case: Residents’ associations in Noida demand arrests||A group of residents on Wednesday held a meeting at Stellar Park Society in Noida’s Sector 62, demanding that arrests be made in the murder case of Akshay Kalra, the 24-year-old student who was critically injured while resisting car robbery outside his house in the area on September 2 and died two days later at a private hospital. Residents said that even after a week, the Noida police have not been able to find a concrete clue in this case.S K Gupta, the convener of the Coordination Committee of residents’ welfare association (RWA) federation Sector 62, said that 47 high-rise societies are members of this committee. “All members and residents are concerned over the safety and security of residents since Kalra’s death. So we planned the meeting wherein members of some societies shared their opinions on phone and through whatsapp. Members of 25 residential societies participated in the meeting in person,” he said.Gupta said that the police did a good job by rushing Kalra to a hospital. “However, they should have immediately sealed Noida’s borders and launched a manhunt. But they did not do so and the suspect(s) managed to escape with the car. The police have not shared with us any concrete clue they got in this case. We are planning to meet the Noida police commissioner over the issue,” Gupta said.Pradeep Mishra, RWA president of Stellar Park, said residents also demand that the police install CCTV cameras at various places to ensure safety of commuters. Kalra’s father Gulshan also attended the meeting. “Police had earlier assured us that the case will be solved soon. But they have not made any arrest. We hope the criminals are brought to book,” he said.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, meanwhile said that the police have mapped the city and already made a project to install CCTV cameras at different places under the Safe City Project. “The Central and state governments will fund the project at a 60:40 ratio. The police have also improved night patrolling in Noida. We are also changing the patrolling routes and improving the presence of police personnel on roads,” he said.On investigation in the Kalra murder case, Singh said 50 personnel in ten teams are conducting searches in western Uttar Pradesh district such as Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr and Meerut, as well as in neighbouring Delhi, Haryana and Jaipur. “We have scanned about 30 cameras from the route Kalra took that night. We hope to solve the case soon,” he said. The student was left critically injured after resisting unidentified carjackers who fled with his SUV just about 100 metres from his home in Sector 62. He had left his house in Stellar Park, a housing society in Noida’s Sector 62, in a white Hyundai Creta car at 10.45pm. However, sometime later, a police team found him unconscious on the road with several injuries. His wallet was also missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/akshay-kalra-murder-case-residents-associations-in-noida-demand-arrests/story-avs9RkWopFiM3uXdIj0kpN.html
09-09-2020||City||Parents’ association claims their fee protest sabotaged, cops lodge FIR||The Ghaziabad police on Wednesday cleared a parents’ protest outside the district headquarters, claiming they had to test them for Covid-19. Other parents, however, claim that the test was just an excuse to prevent them from making their “legitimate” demands heard.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Tuesday had lent her support to the protest and, in a Facebook post, asked that the government intervene.The Ghaziabad parents’ association had been on a hunger strike since September 2, demanding the waiver of school quarterly fee for the lockdown period when many of them had lost their jobs or suffered a pay cut. They also demanded that school fees should be based on online education and not regular fees.On Tuesday, its president Seema Tyagi was admitted to hospital after her health deteriorated. On Wednesday 7am, police picked up the four protesting parents, including a woman, and took them to MMG Hospital for the test. “We suspected that the protesters had come in contact with a circle officer who was posted on duty at the site and tested positive for Covid-19. So, we took them for Covid-19 testing. Further, since the protest was in violation of prohibitory orders, the district officials gave a police complaint on the basis of which we registered an FIR,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). The FIR included IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life). GPA members, however, suspected the removal was planned and said they could not contact those who had been picked up.“One of the four is a woman who is diabetic and her husband was frantically searching for her to give her medicines but none of them could be found at the police station, police line or the MMG Hospital. Once the parents were picked up, the cops also took away our tents, generators sets and other items which we had hired. It is a planned action against the parents as the district officials have no answers to our demands,” said Seema Tyagi from a private hospital in Kavi Nagar. She said that it was surprising that the administration woke up to their protest only on Wednesday. “We had given the administration a written intimation of our protest about 15 days ago. Suddenly, they found our protest illegal on Wednesday. It is also surprising that the police took away only four parents for testing and no other persons or police personnel deployed at the site. There were hundreds of people who had come to the site to support us,” Tyagi said. “In case any of our four members turn positive for Covid-19 we will get them retested. We have lost trust in the health department’s reports.”When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey referred the matter to Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city) who did not respond to repeated calls for comment. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr. NK Gupta said that the district administration sought his opinion for testing the protesters. “I opined that everyone must be tested and not specifically just four persons,” he said. MMG Hospital chief medical superintendent Dr Anurag Bhargava said, “All four were tested negative on the TrueNat machine. Till the time their test reports came, they were made to stay in holding area,” he said. A holding area is where people who are awaiting their test results are made to wait. Till Wednesday late evening, HT could not reach the four persons for comment.Congress supportThe Congress in the afternoon gathered near Ghanta Ghar and tried to block the road in protest. “We came to support the parents’ protest. The action against them is totally unacceptable,” said Bijender Yadav, Ghaziabad district president from the Congress. SP (city)Verma said that the police so far did not lodge any FIR against the Congress protesters but may act if the administration complains. “They were trying to block the main road at Ghanta Ghar but were from doing so. About five or six of them were picked up and later let off. As of now there is no FIR lodged,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-association-claims-their-fee-protest-sabotaged-cops-lodge-fir/story-Ysjc5WWAdKkc3wclPaDJpI.html

It has also finalised the outer structure of all its elevated stations in the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor. The 82km RRTS route will connect the three cities through 24 stations, 21 of which are in Uttar Pradesh. The project will run high speed trains and estimates to have ridership of about 800,000 daily passengers. “The contours of the outer structure of the stations have been finalised. The buildings will be environment friendly and sustainable while giving a unique look,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief public relations officer (PRO) of NCRTC. The officials said that the RRTS station facade will be modular, easy to fabricate and erect. They will comprise of diamond shaped panels to give 3D effect to the external facade. “Each station will be energy efficient with availability of ample natural sunlight and equipped with solar panels besides having exquisite aesthetic appeal. It will have diagonal structure in the facade which signifies mobility, a sense of motion which is the basis of high speed RRTS trains,” said an officer from NCRTC. Officials added that the outer design was finalised for all 20 elevated stations, the rest are underground stations with one in Delhi and three in Meerut. They added that the aesthetically appealing external envelope will be combination of perforated metal sheet, louvres, corrugated sheet, glass panel and polycarbonate roofing which will give unique identity to RRTS stations. All the stations will be designed with solar panels on roof and will be energy efficient and studded with environment friendly lighting fixtures will full compliance to Indian Green Building Council guidelines “The RRTS stations will be unique and bigger than the metro stations as we will be deploying nine coach trains to the network. The work for construction of stations has started and the project has started taking shape at ground level as we have started with placing of pre-cast segments over the pillars (like in the metro network) with the help of two launcher machines,” the officer said. The pre-cast segments for the RRTS project are being constructed at a site in Vasundhara. The entire RRTS project is pegged at Rs 30274 crore and proposed to run high speed trains between Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut with a speed of about 180kmph. The NCRTC has already identified a priority stretch of 17km in Ghaziabad (Sahibabad to Duhai) for which the work started initially while the works have also started for the other 33km connecting stretch from Duhai to Shatabdipuram in Meerut. The priority section is scheduled for commissioning in March, 2023 while the entire 82km long corridor (Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut) will be put into operations by March, 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncrtc-finalises-outer-structure-of-all-elevated-rapid-rail-stations/story-ybuK9hIRCmS1W9fxrVnRsJ.html
09-09-2020||City||Commuters cautious, virus vigil strict as Blue Line comes back to life||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday, after a near six month pause, reopened services on its Blue line network, which connects multiple stations in Noida and Ghaziabad and caters to a large passenger base. Blue Line, which runs from Dwarka Sector 21 to Noida Electronic City and Vaishali, experienced low ridership on Day 1 of its reopening, something that Metro officials had expected. Officials and passengers, however, hoped that the ridership will pick up once the frequency of trains increase and other lines in the network open up.At present, the Blue line has been opened for graded passenger operation only between 7am to 11am and 4pm to 8pm. The DMRC has so far opened up the Yellow line, Pink line and the Blue line of the Metro system which together witnessed a total ridership of about 33,000 between 7am to 11am. A DMRC spokesperson said that the Yellow line accounted for 21,900 passengers, Blue line 9,600 and the Pink line saw a ridership of 1,800 between 7am to 11am on Wednesday. At the Blue line’s Electronic City station in Noida, security personnel and Metro staff could be spotted armed in safety gear, marshalling passengers or checking them in. At the entry gates, the temperature of every passenger was checked, with the travellers also being required to compulsorily sanitise their bag/luggage before being allowed to get on trains. As part of the travel guidelines issued for reopening of Metro systems, commuters are also required to sanitize their hands via an automatic machine and then be frisked before being given entry to stations. On Wednesday commuters expressed satisfaction and said they were happy that the Metro services had finally resumed.hubham Kumar, a resident of Delhi, said that he faced absolutely no inconvenience in commuting on Wednesday. “I had boarded the Metro at Rajiv Chowk and came to Noida’s Sector 61. The commute was smooth and hassle free,” he said. Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Sector 49, said “I boarded the Metro at City Centre and got down at Electronic City. There was absolutely no crowd and the safety measures in place are satisfactory,” he said. The other branch of the Blue line network terminates in Ghaziabad, with two stations at Kaushambi and Vaishali. At the Vaishali station in Ghaziabad, the day started on a dull note with only a handful of passengers using the Metro in the morning hours. The number, however, picked up significantly later with passengers spotted waiting in long serpentine queues that snaked their way almost to the main road outside the station.“The long queues were result of strict checks being done at the station. All social distancing norms were in place and every passenger while entering the station was asked to sanitize their hands. So, this led to the delay and queues started forming,” said Saurabh Kumar, one of the passengers who boarded the Metro train at Vaishali. Anuj Agarwal, another commuter, said that Metro was the lifeline of NCR and now that it had been reopened it would solve the issue of commuting between Delhi and Gurugram. “I am going to Gurugram to join my office. All these days I had opted to work from home as commuting would have been difficult. But with the Metro open now, I can go to my office. This will benefit thousands of residents who commute daily,” he said. At the station, many passengers on Wednesday were spotted downloading the ‘Arogya Setu’ app, which has been made mandatory by the DMRC in its guidelines issued for safe travel. Ghaziabad city is also connected to the Red line network of the DMRC, that has eight stations in the city. The DMRC on Wednesday said that they will be running 35 trains on Red Line (Rithala to Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda in Ghaziabad) and performing around 413 train trips during morning and evening hours from September 10 onwards. “The trips will be subsequently increased as the operational timing of services get extended on September 11 and September 12 with the opening of other Lines in a graded manner,” the DMRC spokesperson said in a statement. DMRC’s Blue line Sector 52 and Aqua Line’s (of the Noida Metro Rail Corporation) Sector 51 serve as interchange stations where free e-rickshaw service is provided for commuting. On Wednesday, as the Metro services reopened, there were very few takers for the e-rickshaw service. Shiv Kumar, an e-rickshaw driver, said that only two passengers can sit in a e-rickshaw at a time due to Covid safety norms. “We have separated the seats with a plastic sheet. This was the first day, hence we got about 10-12 commuters for interchange in the first half,” he said. Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said that NMRC does not keep a record of e-rickshaw commuters. Aqua Line had started its services on Monday registering ridership of 600 passengers on the first day. On Tuesday, it had recorded 725 passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commuters-cautious-virus-vigil-strict-as-blue-line-comes-back-to-life/story-skaj03fCeVYtUeBTtQfycI.html

It said there was no reason for the varsity to seek time till October-end to declare the results if comparative grading of the students was not required to done.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad asked the varsity to submit information on the number of students, and their subject streams, who have requested for comfort letters to travel abroad for studies. In the CGPA system, students are evaluated on the basis of the average of grade points obtained by them for all semesters after the completion of the course. Under the SGPA grading system, the students are graded on their performance in a single session or semester.The court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Joginder Sukhija, who sought early declaration of results as his daughter was seeking admission in a foreign university. The application was filed in a pending petition by a law student Prateek Sharma, who had sought better facilities for physically disabled students in the online examination.In his plea, Sukhija said the draft comfort letter that the varsity had mailed him, during the course of the hearing, will not suffice. He said the last date for enrolment at Cambridge University is October 10 whereas the draft letter refers to declaration of results by the end of October, 2020.On Wednesday, senior advocate BB Gupta and advocate Kamal Gupta, members of the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC), said the Cumulative Grade Point Assessment (CGPA) and Semester Grade Point Assessment (SGPA) do not require any comparative grading of students, and there does not appear any clarity in this regard from Delhi University.Senior advocate Sachin Datta said final-year postgraduate students are assigned marks on a percentage basis and not through grading. Professor Ajay Arora from the university, who is the grievance officer, told the court he received mails from 47 students for expeditious declaration of results. He said in his estimate, not more than 400 final-year students, both in undergraduate and postgraduate courses, would plan to travel abroad for further studies.The court then asked the varsity to clarify its stand on the evaluation process, while suggesting that the results should be declared by September 15 if the comparative method is not being used. It asked the university to file an affidavit and posted the matter till September 15.Delhi University acting dean (examination) DS Rawat wrote to all colleges on Wednesday, asking them to expedite the evaluation process. “I’m to inform you that the examination branch is in receipt of requests from students who have appeared for the first phase of OBE for an early declaration of results for the different undergraduate courses. Some students have taken up the matter with the court ...you are requested to advise your teachers to expedite the evaluation process so that the same is completed within 5-6 days. This may be treated as urgent since the examination branch has to produce the tentative schedule of the results before the court on 22.09.2020,” the dean said in the letter sent to all the principals of DU colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-wait-till-oct-end-to-declare-results-delhi-hc-tells-du/story-QmaGowTAe9RI7EOjHvHtOJ.html

At this stage restrictions are unlikely to help.”Earlier, on Tuesday, with record 377 Covid-19 cases surfacing in the city, the administration had declared 24 areas as micro-containment zones. UT administrator VPS Badnore on Wednesday expressed grave concern over the rising number of cases. He suggested that for early detection of symptomatic persons, the help of municipal councillors should be taken.Municipal commissioner KK Yadav was directed to set up a control room where councillors could call to share information about patients in their areas to facilitate testing, quarantine and transportation and admission to hospitals. Yadav assured it will be made operational within a day.Badnore also appealed to the councillors to collect information about symptomatic and suspected cases in their areas and inform the health authorities to ensure early detection and treatment and reduce fatalities. “The onus also lies on the citizens to join the battle against Covid. They should join hands with the administration and co-operate,” Badnore said.Meanwhile, Badnore was informed that acting on the UT’s request, the central government has supplied 30 additional ventilators to the city: 10 for the PGIMER and 20 for GMCH-32.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-fresh-curbs-planned-in-chandigarh-ut-adviser/story-kOt2DqjViS70h4tq9SgEeJ.html

09-09-2020||Delhi||Parents request CBSE to waive off registration fee of classes 10,12||The All India Parents Association (AIPA) has written to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), requesting it to waive off the registration fees for classes 10 and 12 this year in view of the financial problems due to the Covid-enforced lockdown. In CBSE-affiliated schools, students of classes 10 and 12 have to pay between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 registration fee, including practical charges and others. Students also have to pay Rs 500 as fine in case they do not pay the registration fee within the deadline.In a letter sent to CBSE on Tuesday, AIPA president Ashok Agarwal said, “In the unprecedented pandemic that this country is facing, many parents have lost their jobs and source of livelihood. However, instead of being considerate and helping the students and parents, the CBSE has chosen this time to put the parents and students under more duress by levying registration charges of approximately Rs 2,450 per student.”“Most of the students in government schools are from underprivileged backgrounds. Many parents are pulling out their kids from private schools as they are not being able to pay their tuition fees. Putting them under more financial stress will result in large scale exodus by students from schools… We hope that you will understand the enormity of this problem and withdraw the order (asking for the registration fee)” the letter added.Anu, a class 12 student at a government school in Delhi, said, “Both my brother and I are in Class 12 this year and have been told to submit Rs 2,500 each as the CBSE registration fee. Our father, who was working as a mechanic, lost his job amid the lockdown. We do not know what to do now.”A senior official at the CBSE said, “The board doesn’t receive any money for the exams from the government or any other agency. It won’t be possible for the board to waive the registration fee. How will we conduct the exams then? We work on a no profit and no loss basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parents-request-cbse-to-waive-off-registration-fee-of-classes-10-12/story-oW0gjygJ2CkZs08oYFnSQN.html

09-09-2020||City||Sisodia announces relief for artisans, cuts rents at govt tourism complexes||New Delhi: In a relief to artisans and craftsmen in Delhi, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said the Delhi government will cut rents at its tourism complexes and Dilli Haats and give concession in the pending amount. He said stalls at government tourism complexes will provided to artisans for just ₹500-600 a month. The decision was taken during the board meeting of the Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC). “Due to the Covid-19 epidemic and lockdown, artisans who could not manage to get stalls at Delhi Haat and other places because of high rentals will be provided slots at an economical rate. Under the regular course, anyone wanting to set up a stall would have to spend thousands or at times even a few lakhs, but now the same would be available only for ₹500-600 a month,” Sisodia said in a statement. He said it has been decided to waive off the entire rent amount for the lockdown months of food stall owners and vendors at Dilli Haat and other such complexes. “DTTDC is of the view this at this point, it is necessary to retain those vendors/operators who have been associated with it for a long time by giving relaxations to them,” Sisodia said. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, all properties leased by DTTDC were shut down from March 20. The institutions, including Delhi Haats (INA, Pitampura and Janakpuri), Garden of Five Senses, and Nature Bazar, among others, were thrown open from July 4. However, a lot of artisans set up shop only later. In Delhi Haat INA, 166 craft stalls have been allotted to artisans from across the country. It was also decided to distribute the 46 commercial stalls among the local craftsmen on a first-come, first-served basis, to allow business to pick up, it said. Artisans said the rents for craft shops range from ₹ 15,000-₹30,000 while for food stalls it ranges between ₹50,000 and ₹60,000. “We are not aware of the decision regarding the relaxations yet. Though consultations have been going on for long, we are yet to be communicated the same. Business is still slow, but if we get discount on rents, it will help us survive in a major way,” said a crafts stall owner at Dilli Haat, INA, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-announces-relief-for-artisans-cuts-rents-at-govt-tourism-complexes/story-6BZ0E4BAtZlarzYnF0yWXI.html

The two fled the crime scene but were caught late Tuesday night along with the murder weapon, said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya.Surya said the arrested men, identified by their first names as Sohail and Farhan, both aged 19 years, told the police that they murdered their friend Amaan over a monetary dispute. “Sohail had borrowed ₹1,000 from Amaan and was not returning it despite Amaan’s repeated demands. They often had arguments over that. Some days ago, Amaan had also assaulted him over the same issue,” the DCP said.On Tuesday, Sohail and Farhan called Amaan out of his home to sort out their differences. “An altercation broke out between them and the duo stabbed Amaan five to six times and fled. Amaan was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” a police officer said, requesting anonymity.A murder case was registered and the two suspects were caught after multiple searches in north-east Delhi late evening, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-murdered-by-two-friends-over-1-000-he-loaned-to-one-of-them/story-y1TJBPCGqwvEyX8WUdBfFJ.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Two held for abducting and killing man, fleeing with his phone, wallet to buy drugs||Two men, one of them an auto-rickshaw driver, have been arrested for allegedly abducting, robbing, and murdering a 48-year-old man, whose decomposed body was discovered from a drain in outer Delhi’s Bhalswa Dairy a fortnight ago, police said Wednesday.The two allegedly strangled the man, who worked as manager at a weighing scale shop in Alipur, just to rob him of his cellphone and wallet containing ₹200 to buy narcotic substances, a senior police officer, associated with the case, said. The police have recovered the manager’s stolen wallet and phone that the two had sold to a truck driver. The arrested men were identified as auto-rickshaw driver Mohammad Shakeel,30, and his friend Rinku,33, said deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Gaurav Sharma.Police said on August 25, Shekeel was driving his auto along with Rinku when they spotted the manager, Kale Shah Khan, waiting for public transport near the Bhalaswa dumping yard.“The manager asked them to drop him to Azadpur and they agreed. On the way, they allegedly stopped the vehicle, overpowered Khan, and strangled him with a towel. They dumped Khan’s body in a drain in Bhalswa Dairy area, took his cellphone and wallet, and fled, the DCP said.Sharma said on August 28, Khan’s employer Mohammad Abdul Ahmed filed a missing person complaint over Khan’s disappearance. Police inquiry revealed that Khan was untraceable since August 25, when he left his workplace for home. After finding that Khan’s cellphone was switched off, police put in on surveillance.While checking the list of unidentified bodies found in Delhi, the Alipur police learnt that a man’s body matching the descriptions of Khan was found in a drain in Bhalswa Dairy area on August 27. A murder case was already registered in connection with the recovery of the body at the Bhalswa Dairy police station, police said.As Khan’s wallet and cellphone were missing, the case was probed from robbery and personal enmity angles. Last week, the police got the first breakthrough when technical surveillance led them to truck driver Param Singh from Wazirabad, who had Khan’s stolen phone. Singh told them that he had purchased it from two men, but did not know their names or addresses, the officer said.“We kept our eyes on Singh. The trick worked as he searched for the suspects in Wazirabad and returned the phone to them, saying he wanted its original bill receipt. We laid a trap and caught the duo with the phone and also recovered Khan’s wallet,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-for-abducting-and-killing-man-fleeing-with-his-phone-wallet-to-buy-drugs/story-0uvJLae2Rk0I703Tgl47jL.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Woman arrested for cheating brothers on the pretext of providing govt jobs||Police on Wednesday said they have arrested a 57-year-old woman for allegedly cheating job aspirants in the name of providing them government jobs in Delhi. The woman, investigators said, has previously been involved in five similar cases of cheating and was arrested in these cases in the last one decade and let out on bail.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said that on Tuesday afternoon, the Hazrat Nizamuddin police received a call that “a woman cheat has been caught in Bhogal market.” A police team reached the spot and found that one Anita Dhiman alias Anita Panikar had been ‘caught’ by two brothers, who alleged that she had duped them of Rs 4.45 lakh in the name of providing government jobs to his daughter and son, said the DCP.The brothers alleged that in June 2020, they came in contact with Dhiman, who had convinced them that on payment of a certain sum of money, she could get jobs for their son and daughter in Delhi government, through VIP quota.“The brothers fell for her trap and gave her R4.45 lakh on the promise that she would get them the promised jobs. However, the woman neither kept her promise nor returned their money back. During enquiry, we learnt that she had also duped another person, one Kishan Jaiswal, of R1.35 lakh using the same modus operandi. Accordingly, we registered a case of cheating and arrested Dhiman,” said DCP Meena.During interrogation, DCP Meena said, the woman, who lives alone in a rented flat in Safdarjung Enclave area, told them that she needed the money because there were many criminal cases pending against her in a Delhi court.“She was earlier arrested in a cheating case registered with the Economic Offences Wing in 2009,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-arrested-for-cheating-brothers-on-the-pretext-of-providing-govt-jobs/story-Wx63xVXKNHajHhKYq6phmI.html

09-09-2020||City||2015 Behbal Kalan firing: Faridkot sessions judge asks IG to appear in person today over ‘plea for pardon’||Faridkot Ahead of taking a decision on the plea of special investigation team (SIT) to pardon a cop accused in the Behbal Kalan police firing case, the district and sessions court here on Wednesday directed SIT member, inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap, to appear in person on Thursday. Last week, the SIT had approached the court with a petition seeking pardon for prime accused inspector Pardeep Singh, the then reader to former Moga SSP Charanjit Sharma, as he wanted to turn an approver in the case. Later, Pardeep also recorded his statement before the duty magistrate.District and sessions judge Sumeet Malhotra on Wednesday directed IG Pratap to assist the court before a decision can be taken on the plea.Victim’s brother says ‘plea against public policy’Resham Singh, one of the prime witnesses and brother of firing victim Krishan Bhagwan Singh, on Wednesday filed an application, seeking permission to assist the court in proceedings initiated by prosecution to grant pardon to inspector Pardeep Singh. He said the prosecution application is “against public policy” and is likely to destroy the case completely.“The witnesses have given clear account of the role of all the accused at the place of occurrence. It is clearly deposed by the witnesses like DSP Harjinder Singh that it was Pardeep, who started the action at spot by slapping and abusing the protestors and subsequently giving kick blows to the peaceful protestors. Had Pardeep not resorted to slapping, abusing and giving kick blows the situation would not have turned violent at all. Also there were accounts of his role in fabrication of FIR and gunshots on the escort vehicle of SSP Sharma,” he added.“Witness Beant Singh in his statement said that it was Pardeep who fired at him on the direction of Sharma,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2015-behbal-kalan-firing-faridkot-sessions-judge-asks-ig-to-appear-in-person-today-over-plea-for-pardon/story-kqL00FHDqyR0rQRoEZtSIK.html

It is disheartening that Maharashtra government acted in such haste. This action, no doubt stems from political vendetta.

Over the past week, the jumbo facility has seen multiple complaints of mismanagement and witnessed numerous deaths including that of a TV9 Marathi news channel journalist Pandurang Raykar. Since then, the Pune district administration changed operating agency of the hospital and senior officials like divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar are daily conducting a review of the centre and visiting it. “Over the last couple of days, we were calling him, but he was not receiving our calls, so today I personally came to check his health status at the COEP Covid hospital. Here I got to know that a new system has been introduced wherein we can video call the patient. I spoke to him over video conferencing and appreciate the changes made at the facility for the relatives of the patients,” said Daundkar. On Wednesday, HT visited the facility to review the changes in place and how it is benefiting patients as well as their relatives. Bouncers have been removed from the security system and PMC security staff has now been deployed at the entrance gates. A dedicated cell of ‘patients enquiry room’ has been set up just next to the entrance gate, so that any relative can get proper guidance regarding patient treatment and other facilities. From the enquiry room, a video call is made and then relatives can directly see and talk with the patient. Another important thing which is started at the facility is the ‘help desk’ which guides relatives about the admission process or any other issues which they face. Also, a small counter has been established at the entrance gate where relatives can now give submit their food or any other parcel and luggage for their patients. Earlier, there was no such system in place and relatives had to fight with the security guards to give their belongings to the patient. Now to streamline the process this counter has been set up, proper details of the patient are mentioned on a coupon which is stuck to the parcel and then, sent inside the facility. Appreciating the changes made at the facility, Namrata Bhangale, a relative of a patient admitted at the facility, said, “Our patient has been admitted at the facility since the last eight days. In the initial days, we faced a lot of difficulties right from contacting the patient, what exact treatment has been given and also to give any parcel to him. As our patient is a senior citizen, he doesn’t have a mobile phone and so, we were not able to contact him inside the facility. We used to have daily arguments and fights with security guards at the gate. Now, all things have changed and we have been able to talk to him over video calls and can easily send our parcel to him.” However, there are some things which still need to be replaced at the facility. Construction material like drainage pipes, wires and other construction material has been lying all over the facility. Saurabh Rao, Pune divisional commissioner, said, “The earlier, Lifeline agency, was unable to handle the operations at the COEP Covid hospital and Medbros agency is incharge now. Additional staff from the Sassoon hospital has been deployed and our focus is to follow the treatment protocol properly so that there are good recoveries. The facility is very new as it was started around 10 days ago and some patients are still facing certain issues. But now we are streamlining all the things and soon there will be many changes including treatment protocols, reporting and data analysis. So, we are working on multiple things comfort, treatment and curing the patient, and most importantly complete facelift of the facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/coep-jumbo-covid-facility-implements-positive-changes-after-new-agency-takes-over/story-MKlhnJatXpoYhb8fueKVZP.html

However, the central drug regulator Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) issued a show cause notice to Serum institute of India (SII) for not informing them about AstraZeneca pausing the clinical trials in other countries and also for not submitting casualty analysis of the “reported serious adverse events”. Dr VG Somani, the Drugs Controller General of India in his show cause notice has asked SII as to why the permission granted for conducting phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in the country be not suspended till patient safety is established. On the show cause notice issued by the DCGI, SII, said, “We are going by DCGI’s direction and so far were not told to pause the trials. If DCGI has any safety concerns, we will follow their instructions and abide by the standard protocols.” Pune-based Serum institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine maker, has signed an agreement to manufacture the potential vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute of Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca announced a pause on clinical trials after a volunteer developed an unexplained illness in the UK, just hours after it joined eight other drug makers to make an unusual safety pledge. Earlier in the day, while clarifying on AstraZeneca putting on hold trials, SII clarified that the Indian trials of the Covishield vaccine candidate are continuing without any problems. Commenting on the reports of AstraZeneca putting on hold trials in UK, SII in a statement said, “We can’t comment much on trials in the UK. But they have been paused for further review and they hold to restart soon. The Indian trials are continuing and we have faced no issues at all.” Of the 100 volunteers, 34 were from Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and hospital in Pune, who have been administered vaccine shots after trials for phase 2 began in India on August 26. According to doctors at the medical college and hospital, none of the 34 volunteers have shown any sign of health-related complications, with all their vital parameters appearing normal. Besides Bharati Vidyapeeth, two other hospitals in Pune are carrying out trials, including the KEM. “We have completed the phase two trials of 100 enrolments in India, of which 34 were from Bharti Vidyapeeth. It’s been a week after the shots were given to 34 volunteers at our institute and none of them showed any adverse reaction,” said Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharti Vidyapeeth medical college and hospital. The KEM hospital, which carried out trials at its Vadhu campus, has also completed the process. A senior doctor at the hospital said, “We have given shots to some volunteers and none have shown any side effects so far,” said the doctor declining to share exact number of volunteers undergoing trial. Besides KEM, CS Medical College and hospital has been selected for Phase-2 trials. The entire data about volunteers and the results of trials, according to Lalwani, has been submitted to SII. The data in turn will be picked up by Data System Monitoring Board at Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) level for further review. “We have submitted the data about all the participants. We are now awaiting directions from SII. If there is any official communication, we will start enrolment for third phase,” said Lalwani.

The Centre on Tuesday ordered attachment of Pannun’s 57 kanal land at Khankot and Sultanwind area of Amritsar under Section 51-A of the stringent UAPA Act. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing a case against Pannun over a campaign launched by the SFJ under the banner of ‘Referendum 2020’, sealed 46 kanals of agriculture land and a residential plot in the village on Monday, a senior police official said.Pannun, who was designated a terrorist along with eight other men, has been running a campaign against India and motivating the Sikh youth in Punjab to join militancy, according to the government.Though Pannun is little known in the village, his family still owns property worth crores, including agriculture land, besides a school and a college, in the village.“We came to know that Pannun belonged to the village after his property was sealed. I never heard in the village about him before this,” said Subash Sehgal, a social activist from Khankot. The village’s former sarpanch Gurdarshan Singh Sandhu, 68, said, “I never saw Gurpatwant in the village, but his family migrated from Pakistan along with 35 other families. Our family was also among those.” He said, “Gurpatwant’s father Mohinder Singh Pannun had two elder brothers—Mohan Singh and Bhagwan Singh. Mohinder was a senior officer in the Punjab Mandi Board in Chandigarh. Mohinder Singh has two sons—Gurpatwant and Magwant. Mohinder’s family rarely visited the village. But Mohan and Bhagwan lived in the village. Mohan had two sons while Bhagwan was issueless. Mohan also left the village around three decades ago while Bhagwan died here around 20 years ago. We came to know that Mohan’s both sons had also died.”Sandhu, who remained the village sarpanch from 2003 to 2008, said, “Gurpatwant and Magwant have around 18 acres of land in our village while Daljit’s sons hold the possession of the around 30 acres. The two sons of Daljit, who also served as an ambassador in a foreign country, are also running a private school and a college in the village. But they have no contact with the local residents.”He said the 18-acre land belonging to Gurpatwant and Magwant was being tilled by one Bikramjit Singh of the village for the last 30 years. “Gurpatwant’s mother Amarjit Kaur had been collecting the land rent from Bikramjit. After Amarjit’s death, the rent was being paid to Magwant’s account,” he said.He said Bikramjit was unaware that the land which he had taken on rent belonged to Gurpatwant.A senior police official said, “Dalit’s sons (Gurpatwant’s cousins) have leased out land in Amritsar on which a shopping mall and a luxury hotel are built. A daughter of Pannun’s cousin is married in one of the influential political families in Amritsar. The family also has property worth crores in other areas of Punjab.”In a press release, the NIA on Tuesday said the SFJ was trying to hold meetings at certain places in the US and other countries to mobilise the Sikh diaspora for its illegal activities. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has repeatedly said Pannun has been operating at the behest of Pakistan’s ISI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurpatwant-pannun-s-family-migrated-from-pak-to-amritsar-village-during-partition/story-JM8U3NRLas5SjMNWLqlMAN.html

Jamwal briefed him about border domination grid, assessment on threat perception and measures undertaken to strengthen the border protection grid. Sinha interacted with BSF officers and commanders, and stressed that government recognises their unparalleled contribution towards national security. “He was satisfied with the measures taken by BSF to safeguard life and property of people and to prevent trans-border crimes. IG BSF requested the L-G to help BSF in clearing wild growth through MNREGA, and to urge farmers to carry out agricultural activities along the zero line ahead of fencing and timely completion of projects under the border works,” he said. Jamwal requested him to look into the matter of erratic power supply and prevent frequent breakdowns because it hampers border domination.

State Congress president Sunil Jakhar said about 1-lakh acres were affected in the two districts. He said the faulty design of the drain channel built during the previous SAD-BJP government was responsible for the flooding. Jakhar told reporters that chief minister Amarinder Singh had asked a ministerial panel to visit the affected areas. On Wednesday, HT had reported that standing cotton crop on about 17,000 hectares in Abohar area of Fazilka district was severely hit due to waterlogging. Abohar is Jakhar’s hometown and it was his first visit to the villages since the fields were deluged on August 21-22. Revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar said the assessment of crop loss and damage to houses has been ordered and the affected people will be duly compensated. He said the officials have also been instructed to provide more MGNREGS works to the eligible villagers as an additional measure to support them. Water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said the district authorities have been directed to appoint nodal officers to dewater the fields. “Instructions have been issued to install more transformers to expedite the dewatering exercise. It is important to ensure that sowing of wheat is not affected,” he said. Sarkaria said a long-term plan will be devised to strengthen the drainage. Sukhbir laments delay in relief Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and Ferozepur MP Sukhbir Singh Badal also visited several affected villages on Wednesday. He lamented the delay in announcing compensation to the flood-hit villagers. “No officer has been deputed to listen to the grievances of the people. There has been a delay in draining out water from the fields,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jakhar-two-ministers-visit-flood-hit-villages-in-fazilka-muktsar/story-GjRrn3hdOgv4bqv8wkZIQP.html

09-09-2020||City||Himachal assembly monsoon session: CM slams Congress for playing cheap politics amid corona crisis||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday slammed the Congress for ‘playing cheap politics’ during the Covid-19 crisis.“The Congress will be punished by the public for acting inappropriately in the times of this pandemic,” the CM said while replying to the adjournment motion moved by the opposition to discuss the situation arising amid to Covid-19 pandemic including rising unemployment and corruption in the state.Uproarious scenes were witnessed in the House as the Congress MLAs moved into the well and raised slogans against the state government.In his reply, the CM said while the BJP workers were moving door-to-door distributing masks, sanitizers and food, the Congress found an opportunity in disaster and sent fake details of funds worth ₹12 crore spent during the Covid times to its high command.“Even during a pandemic, the Congress leaders did not hesitate in robbing their own party, he said, adding that the assembly held discussion on Covid-19 crises for two days but the opposition did not make any positive suggestions to deal with the situation.The CM said the notice of adjournment motion was moved by the opposition party and for the first time in the history of the assembly, the proposal was accepted, but the opposition started running away from debate.The opposition did not raise a single problem related to corona and instead started discussing roads, water and other issues, he added.“We will apprise the public about the opposition’s attitude in the House and in 2022 the Congress will have lesser numbers in assembly compared to what it has today,” the CM said, adding that “the people are watching and will question the opposition as to what they did during Covid-19 crises.” Thakur said had the Congress been in power in the country and the state during the coronavirus times, they would not have let a chance to loot the public.He said the battle against Covid-19 was not over yet and precaution is the only way to deal with it. “Also, everyone needs to cooperate and contribute his bit in this battle but the opposition members are behaving irresponsibly,” he said.Thakur said the state government has got public support at every step. “If we are successful in this battle it is because the government has done a better job,” he said.The CM said a strong leadership like Prime Minister Narendra Modi was needed during this difficult period. “At the time of virus outbreak in Himachal, there was no testing facility in the state. Today, the testing capacity here has crossed 5,000 per day. The state had only 60 ventilators and now has 640 ventilators, 500 of which were given by the Centre,” the CM said, adding that Himachal ranked 25th among the states in terms of total cases. He said even a small state like Goa had 21,500 and 16,254 in Tripura. There are 6,372 cases of corona infection in Chandigarh. He said the worst situation in the whole country is Maharashtra.He said that the low number of fatalities in Himachal was because the number of cases was less and that was due to better strategy and management by the government.The CM said rapid antigen testing has also been started in the state. “At present, 1.60 lakh PPE kits and 3.5 lakh N-95 masks are available in the state. Our treatment and quarantine system was robust compared to other states,” he added.“The state also took the initiative of Active Case Finding which won accolades from the Prime Minister,” he said. The state government also facilitated the return of 4.53 lakh people who were stranded in the other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-assembly-monsoon-session-cm-slams-congress-for-playing-cheap-politics-amid-corona-crisis/story-wmSC4LwgfKaWr2DkwKYOCN.html

The opposition was demanding a discussion on the adjournment motion moved to discuss the Covid-19 crisis. As the House assembled for the day, Chauhan raised a point of order demanding speaker Vipin Singh Parmar to give opportunity to the Congress members to express their views on the crisis. However, the speaker turned down the request and called chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to reply on the adjournment motion. Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri repeatedly objected to the speaker’s move who tried to pacify the opposition saying that the day’s proceedings will be winded up by 5:00pm. Parmar said it is for the first time that an adjournment motion by the opposition has been accepted and discussion has begun on it. He said the adjournment motion under Rule 67 has never been discussed in the past. The adjournment motion of opposition on discussion of mismanagement, corruption and unemployment during the Covid-19 was accepted. As many as 28 members participated in the discussion which continued for 6 hours and 25 minutes. Agitated, the opposition raised slogans against the ruling and later trooped to the well of the house while the CM continued to reply. Amidst the disruption, Parmar asked the opposition to withdraw its resolution moved on the opening day of the session. However, the opposition members walked out from the assembly.While condemning the opposition’s behaviour, the CM said, “We will not only expose the Congress within the House but also outside the Vidhan Sabha. People will definitely punish them for the way they have been behaving during the Covid-19 crisis.” In his address to mediapersons outside the House, Agnihotri said, “We only tried to show mirror to the government. Instead of accepting the resolution, they tried to throttle the voice of the opposition.” He said the government should have adopted the resolution and the CM should have tendered the resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-assembly-monsoon-session-congress-stages-walkout-as-speaker-refuses-debate-on-covid-crisis/story-csEPIj7xLZavoikpA7YllJ.html

In a press conference held here, Mankotia said he has again written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard. Mankotia said he had hoped that the chief minister will respond to the letter written earlier by him by ordering a CBI investigation. “However, the CM said that no vigilance probe was being carried out which contradicts his own statement in which he stated that the vigilance bureau was looking into the allegations against the minister,” Mankotia alleged. He said only a thorough investigation can reveal the truth. “The minister and her family had purchased land measuring 1,000 kanal in Fatehpur area of Kangra district.

At least 12 houses were damaged on September 5. Those who have lost their houses and belongings are very poor and mostly work as labourers in Himachal Pradesh and other states.”The villagers have urged lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha to compensate and rehabilitate the families, who have lost their houses and fields to the landslide. The Udhampur district administration has evacuated 40 families so far. Basantgarh sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vivek Modi said, “As many as 12 houses were damaged in the landslide. We have prepared 12 files for necessary action. Majority of those affected have been accommodated by their relatives and friends. The administration has also accommodated a few families at a government school and a community hall.” The SDM said the authorities are assessing the damages. “The district commissioner will look into all the cases pertaining damage to houses, agricultural and horticultural land. At least a square km has come down,” he added. He said the villagers have proposed a survey of the entire area by experts from the Geological Survey of India. “Once the debris is cleared, experts will be roped in for the purpose. It was not a sliding zone and even the locals are shocked about what unfolded on September 5. Experts will trace the root cause but for now the restoration of the affected stretch is our priority,” the SDM said.The road link between Ramnagar to Basantgarh, especially from Majori onwards near Gandh Top remains snapped since September 5. “Though buses are plying on either side of Gandh Top, commuters have to cross one km long affected stretch on foot,” he said.“Regular traffic is affected because the road is sinking. Once debris is cleared, the PMGSY will restore the stretch,” the SDM added. According to a rough estimate, around 300 kanals of land (15 hectares) has been destroyed in the landslide. In 2014, as many as 40 villagers were buried alive in a landslide following incessant rains at Saddal village in Panchari Hills of Udhampur. Former MLA RS Pathania said, “A constant threat looms large over the remaining houses in the area and I fear that it is another Saddal in the making. Around 20 to 30 houses have developed cracks and hence cannot be used. The administration has so far not acted promptly. I have taken up the issue with the DC and lieutenant governor with a request to provide them an alternate land where they could be rehabilitated before the onset of winter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-s-gandh-top-landslide-villagers-live-under-constant-threat-demand-rehabilitation-before-winter/story-IUxfVWOKJwb3eA9ymqGDhN.html

While this move will provide construction material at reasonable rates to the public, it will also curtail illegal mining activities, said an official spokesperson quoting mines and geology minister Mool Chand Sharma. “Besides, it is also going to lend a hand in pulling up the contractors and leaseholders who have not cleared the lease money for years,” the minister said during a review meeting, directing the officers to recover the payment of dues from the leaseholders. The minister took a stock of the mining blocks which have been leased out or given on contract from November 2019 till now and the status of the mines opened during this time. “Several other important issues, including contracts and leases granted through auctions, lease granted through applications, stone crushers, mineral dealer licenses, short-term permits, illegal mining cases and vehicles seized during this time frame were discussed,” the spokesperson said.

The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) has decided to hold protests against the ordinances at Kurukshetra from September 10.In a statement, Hooda said that three ordinances-- Farming produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) ordinance, the Farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services ordinance and the Essential commodities (amendment) ordinance-- seek to remove protection given to the farmers. He said not only farmers but labourers, trade agents and small traders will also be impacted by them.“Everyone believes that without the protection of the minimum support price (MSP), these ordinances are against the interests of farmers. If the government wants to implement them, then it should ensure that no purchases are made below MSP,” said Hooda. The government should bring in a fourth ordinance to ensure that if any agency buys the crop of the farmer below the MSP, then legal action will be taken against it, said the leader of opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-cm-hooda-lends-support-to-farmers-agitation-against-central-ordinances/story-pgwt3xP38x5rFqL0CkNTSO.html

09-09-2020||Pune||Kabir Kala Manch: A cultural outfit ever in the cross hairs of law and order||The allegations against members of Pune-based Dalit-culture group Kabir Kala Manch in cases related to “Naxalism” have remained a constant regardless of which government is in power. Three Kabir Kala Manch members were arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for their links with “absconding accused” Milind Teltumbde and the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The NIA arrested three members - Sagar Gorkhe (32), Ramesh Gaichor(36), and Jyoti Jagtap (33) - in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case. The men were remanded to four days in police custody by a local court in Mumbai on Tuesday. Jagtap will be produced in court on Wednesday. So far, in addition to the nine activists, lawyers arrested by Pune police in the case, NIA has arrested Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha and Hanybabu Musaliyavirtil Tarayil. “The accused are members of Kabir Kala Manch, a frontal organisation of banned terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist). Also, it is established that during their visits (of members) in the jungle, they underwent weapon and explosive training and awareness programme on various topics related to the Maoist movement”, read a statement from NIA. However, manch members have said that the two men had willingly responded to NIA calls for questioning on Saturday itself. Moreover, Jagtap was allegedly arrested from a street near her house without notice, according to a KKM member. “They (Gaichor and Gorkhe) were threatened, “You have to become witness for the state under CRPC clause 164 and admit (falsely) that you went to the jungle in Gadchiroli and met Naxals there and that you have connections to Naxalites unless you agree to this we will arrest you,” read an earlier statement issued by the manch. “The government is once again starting an ‘arrest series’. In this case, police never had any evidences nor does it have today,” read another statement issued by the group. However, the group, which was formed 18 years ago - has witnessed such allegations in the past as well; the state government was that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) was in power at the central government. In 2011, two members of KKM - Siddhartha Bhosale and Deepak Dhengle - were among six people arrested under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Following their arrest, six more manch members were booked - Sachin Mali, his wife Sheetal Sathe, Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor, Prashant Kamble, and Santosh Shelar. In 2013, Bhosale and Dhengale were granted bail along with four others they were arrested with. Until then, Mali, Sathe, Shelar, Kamble, Gaichor, and Gorkhe remained underground. Weeks after Bhosale and Dhengale were released; Mali, Sathe, Gaichor and Gorkhe surfaced and were arrested. While Sathe was released owing to her pregnancy, the three others spent almost four years in jail. After their bail was rejected multiple times, the Supreme Court granted bail to the KKM members in January 2017. By the end of 2017, Elgar Parishad was followed by Bhima Koregaon violence where KKM members were booked in a second case. Kamble and Shelar are yet to be found. Gorkhe and Gaichor, meanwhile, have appeared in the Pune police charge sheet in 2018 Elgar Parishad case with allegedly strong evidence that shows their connection to Naxalites, according to police officials. “No matter who is in power, the ruling government becomes regressive. The likes of Bhide and Ekbote have been granted a safe haven. Be it by Pune police, Maharashtra state, or NIA. The picture is pretty clear. And if we really went to the jungles, why not prove it in the earlier case that is still awaiting trial? We Dalit Bahujan are soft targets,” said Rupali Jadhav of KKM. In a documentary made by an FTII student based on their work, Gorkhe is heard saying, “When we (wife) first met, we discussed that this (activist) life is tough. One can go to jail, there’s a struggle, protest, marches.” Another documentary by noted film-maker Anand Patwardhan and an internationally acclaimed film “Court” also tried to showcase the issue. While the documentary showcases a vulnerable side of the organisation, the police officials close to the case have a different narrative to present. “Angela Sontakke, wife of Milind Teltumbde, had held a training camp in a village in Pune in which KKM people had participated. There is a recorded statement by Amarnath Chandaliya (founding member of KKM) describing how Sudhir Dhawale (arrested earlier in Elgar case) infiltrated the group and pivoted it towards Naxal activities. Along with seized literature, there were statements from surrendered Naxalites that mentioned Gorkhe and Gaichor,” said an official close to the investigation. The 2011 case is awaiting trial in a court in Mumbai.

Saini, whose whereabouts are not known, had approached the high court on September 4 after a Mohali court had dismissed his plea. The detailed judgment was released on Wednesday. “The investigating agency has woken up and gathered courage to investigate its own officer and therefore, the vital pieces of evidence that would come handy in leading to leads would inch towards unravelling this puzzle which too has baffled the citizenry who are looking upon the justice system as a last resort to get justice,” the bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh said, observing why Saini’s custodial interrogation is warranted. Saini had claimed political victimisation and also that he was granted bail when the offence under kidnapping was registered in May. Hence, it should continue. FRESH EVIDENCE YET AT LARGE On the other hand, the prosecution said that fresh evidence had come to the fore and Saini had violated the condition set out in the bail that he won’t leave his Chandigarh house without intimation, but he is at large, leaving behind his security cover. The bench observed since the day of his disappearance, the Multani family has been making every effort to initiate the judicial process, which remained in oblivion to the constitutional rights of the family. “These things certainly are of much relevance and also substantiate the state’s allegations that he enjoyed unbridled powers,” it added, observing that there are many cases, which for political reasons or otherwise, remain buried for long and are unearthed with the passage of time. “…therefore, (it) does not discourage the investigating agency from laying off its hands from such grave crimes against humanity,” the bench said. ‘BLUE-EYED BOY WITH POLITICAL PATRONAGE’ The court took note of the state’s accusations that Saini had been a “blue-eyed boy with political patronage” and was “law unto himself”. It also took note of allegations against Saini in the abduction case of Vinod Kumar, a businessman, in 1994, for which trial is underway in a Delhi court. In that case, he is accused of ‘intimidating’ judges, and the investigating officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), who turned hostile. The bench observed that much evidence has come out in public due to the bail plea proceedings and there’s a need to “preserve the same from the prying eyes of Saini”. It added that in crimes such as those reported in the “dark days”, it would be committed with utmost secrecy and coming across witnesses would be a Herculean task. The court also did not accept the argument that the Supreme Court had already quashed a 2008 first information report in this case, observing that the family was given liberty to approach the authorities afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/if-granted-bail-former-punjab-dgp-likely-to-stifle-fair-probe-high-court-while-dismissing-saini-s-plea/story-IAnjxtZPb9cstqqrZqnQhI.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal orders hospitals to ramp up ICU beds; residents can now get tested for Covid-19 without prescriptions||With the number of Covid-19 cases continuing to rise in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday sought suggestions from all state government hospitals on increasing the number of beds, especially ICU beds. The chief minister also took stock of the city’s testing strategy, after which the state health department issued an order removing the need for prescriptions to get a Covid-19 test. During the meeting, Kejriwal directed all medical superintendents to further improve facilities in government hospitals. “Increasing the number of beds in hospitals was also discussed. The chief minister has asked all medical superintendents to suggest ways in which beds can be increased—with a focus on ICU and ventilator beds. The chief minister also directed officials to ensure hospitals do not err and prevent Covid-19 deaths as much as possible,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 43 lakh mark, Centre says 60% cases from five states aloneSoon after the meeting, special secretary (health) Udit Prakash Rai issued an order to simplify testing in the Capital and encourage more people to get tested. “Test-track-treat has been adopted to ensure early detection and containment of Covid-19 pandemic. In continuation of various measures undertaken by the Delhi government to augment Covid-19 testing and to ensure that it is more accessible than ever, it has been decided that henceforth there will be no requirement of a prescription from a qualified medical practitioner for Covid-19 testing in Delhi,” the order read. On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court said that a doctor’s prescription is not required for asymptomatic patients to get a Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test anymore. Until now, if an asymptomatic person wanted to get an RT-PCR test (which is considered the gold standard in Covid-19 testing) in Delhi, they had to produce a doctor’s prescription. Delhi residents, however, could get rapid antigen tests without a prescription. After the court order, Kejriwal had tweeted that he also had issued similar directions to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.

The Delhi government on Wednesday said it will follow the strategy ordered by the court. Wednesday’s meeting came a day after Delhi recorded 3,609 new Covid-19 cases on a single day—the highest single-day case count since June 24, 76 days ago, when 3,788 fresh cases were reported. Over the past week, Delhi has recorded 2,868 fresh cases every day on average. According to the government and experts, the spike in cases is primarily because of increased testing. The Delhi government conducted a record 45,797 tests for Covid-19 on Tuesday — days after Kejriwal announced that the number of tests will be ramped up to 40,000 a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-orders-hospital-chiefs-to-ramp-up-icu-beds-residents-can-now-get-tested-for-covid-19-without-prescriptions/story-4EHiI23GJhuyaoZuCz7ohK.html

Also read: Court declares 2 accused as ‘proclaimed offenders’ in cop’s murderHe challenged the ED’s remand through his advocate Uditi Bali. He cited that his remand was given to ED on August 28 for six days and he was required to be produced before the court on September 3. The plea cited that he was produced before the court on September 5 and again two days later when he was sent to judicial remand for another three days.Justice Yogesh Khanna will hear the case on Thursday. On Monday, additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat had extended Hussain’s custody by three days and allowed ED’s application of nine days for his custodial interrogation. The agency had earlier got Hussain’s custody for nine days. ED had sought Hussain’s custodial interrogation for another nine days because he had to be confronted with “a substantial number of persons” and voluminous documents related to the case. ED had raided Hussain’s premises in June. The agency is probing two separate cases regarding mobilising funds related to the Delhi riots. One case is linked to Hussain and the other is against Kerala’s Popular Front of India (PFI), known for its controversial and fundamentalist linkages.Delhi Police and ED have accused Hussain of laundering around Rs 1.10 crore via shell companies to fuel protests against the Citizen (Amendment) Act, (CAA), 2019 and also engineering the Delhi riots. Police have claimed that Hussain was also involved in mobilising funds to buy ammunition and rope in more rioters in the communal conflagration that had claimed over 50 lives. Police have also claimed to have seized petrol bombs and stones from the terrace of his house.Hussain has denied police’s allegations. He has pleaded innocence and has maintained that he has been framed for his links with the ruling AAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-former-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-moves-delhi-high-court-against-3-day-ed-custody/story-Gf7NPEdac63gOK7UGWL7GL.html

09-09-2020||City||New generation of locusts may attack crops in UP after monsoon||Experts have warned that a new generation of locust swarms may attack crops in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Rajasthan after the monsoon retreats even as the toxic insecticides sprayed to kill them might have caused adverse environmental and health consequences.They have cautioned that a new generation of locust swarms might come out of eggs laid by the desert pests and these could attack the crops after the monsoon. In India, locusts have a single breeding season that spans between July and October. While the insect’s life cycle has three distinct stages— egg, hopper and adult.“At present, there is no information about any locust swarms in UP. But it is possible that female locusts, during their stay in UP or Rajasthan, had laid eggs and a new generation of the insects may create a fresh menace,” said CP Srivastava, deputy director, agriculture, Lucknow.Locust swarms had invaded UP in end-April. Initially, the insects had invaded Bundelkhand and kept on hovering from one district to another until the last week of July. Though locusts invade Rajasthan every year from neighbouring Pakistan, UP had to contend with their attack for the first time in the past three decades or so.As per a recent report sent by the state agriculture department to the Centre, the locust swarms attacked 61 of the 75 districts in UP between April and May and later again in July.“The locust swarms did night stay in 42 districts. While the insects only flew from one place to another without night stay in another 19 districts,” the report stated.The UP government had to deploy 127 officers, 325 staff, 217 fire brigade personnel, 224 tractor-mounted sprayers, the Central government’s three mobile vans and as many drones in spraying insecticides to either kill or chase away the invading insects.The report stated that no significant crop damage had occurred in any district because of the locust swarms’ invasion. The report revealed that 5,702 litres of chemicals were sprayed over an area of 7,021 hectares (ha) to kill the locust swarms in 42 districts, where they had stayed at night. The state authorities used three drones to spray pesticides in Agra, Farrukhabad, Pilibhit, Bareilly and Rampur districts.Sources said the Centre had asked the UP government to specify whether the spray of chemicals for locust control had led to any adverse environmental and health impacts.“We told the Centre that no immediate harmful effects were noticed. However, it may take a while for the harmful consequences, if any, to come to the fore,” a source said.The pesticides that were spread to control the spread of locust swarms mainly consisted of chlorpyrifos and lambda-cyhalothrin, the chemicals that are considered as harmful for humans due to their acute toxic content.“The chemicals used to eliminate locust swarms pose a risk to humans and terrestrial non-target fauna aquatic ecosystems,” sources said.KC Khulbe, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research in Lucknow, said insecticide sprays are harmful for both environment and humans.“But much depends on the amount of spray, area covered, nature of chemicals used, exposure duration and safety precautions taken,” he said.“However, we have done no research with regard to locust control,” he added.A state agriculture official said the use of chemical sprays to control locust swarms could have adverse effects. However, he still justified their use.“Spraying the chemical was essential. Else, the locust swarms could have caused a bigger harm,” he added.BoxDesert locust the deadliest pestAccording to the Jodhpur-based Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), desert locust, migratory locust, Bombay locust and tree locust are found in India. The desert locust is the most important pest species in the country and also in the intercontinental context.Historically, the desert locust, according to the LWO, has always been a major threat to humans. The desert locust is mentioned as a curse to mankind in ancient texts such as the Old Testament of the Bible and the Holy Quran. The magnitude of the damage and loss caused by the locusts is beyond imagination. The locusts have caused starvation due to the insects being polyphagous.On average, small locust swarms can eat as much food in one day as about 10 elephants, 25 camels or 2,500 humans. Locusts cause damage by devouring leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, bark and also by breaking down trees because of their weight when they settle down in masses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-generation-of-locusts-may-attack-crops-in-up-after-monsoon/story-ST61pgheuKwpTfxqpHhVIJ.html
09-09-2020||Pune||‘In post-Covid scenario, FTII doing all it can to excel in the digital domain’||At the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), situated as it is, a Pune landmark on Law College road, with a rich and varied history and legacy, the lockdown opened up in July. That is, in terms of evaluating joint entrance test (JET 2020); in terms of structure and method of teaching for the three-year courses; and in terms of fees, India’s premier autonomous organisation, run under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, has been at work preparing for a year under the cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic. The JET results are expected to be announced by September 15, 2020. Other than that, Bhupendra Kainthola, director, FTII, believes the institute is ready to ensure quality education in cinema in the year to come. The entrance exam has already been affected? How will you manage the intake of the next batch of students? JET evaluations began began after a gap of nearly three months. We are continuously assessing the external developments in our plans to build our approach towards resumption of academic activities. What kind of changes are we going to see to the course structure in the coming months for the next academic year? FTII will take all steps to help put the academic calendar back on track as soon as possible and in complete compliance with the norms established by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. It goes without saying that social distancing will be maintained during exercises and projects, and necessary safety and preventive measures will be taken. Although the lockdown prompted us to launch the first online course - the introduction to the film production process in May, which comprised online classes for three hours in the morning for three days- free for 25 students. FTII now offers an online series of short courses in various streams like basic smartphone film making, writing for film and web, digital cinematography, foundation course in video editing, and basic orientation of sound in cinema. These have got quite a good response. Is going online something you are looking at, in terms of courses related to film-making? Not film making, per so, but we have already announced several short courses in online mode. Several courses will run parallel with subjects like film appreciation, documentary film Appreciation, and screenplay writing. The response is huge, from as far as the United States, Canada and Kenya. Let us take, for example, the film appreciation course, as well as the newly introduced mobile journalism course, both taught online. How will you keeping track of students? There is a surge in demand for FTII short courses. The digital space has opened up new possibilities and in the post-Covid scenario we are doing all we can to excel in this domain too. As FTII needs to have physical interaction for students, - shooting, for example - what are the steps taken by you for them to complete assignments? We are awaiting a nod from the ministry about the changes in the curriculum and we will see when we actually open the campus to students (as of now, there is not a single student on campus), about how to begin the classes. There will be no change in the fee structure, it will remain as it is for the next academic change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-post-covid-scenario-ftii-doing-all-it-can-to-excel-in-the-digital-domain/story-2p657NouzSkFhiLVKAUZcL.html

Sumaiyya, who had led the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) (CAA) Act, 2019, in Lucknow earlier this year, had urged the public to beat ‘thalis’ (plates) outside Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s official residence on Tuesday. She had exhorted the public to raise their voices against a host of issues, including the UP government’s mishandling of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“The UP government has failed in containing the contagion in the state. Private hospitals are fleecing the public because the state government is turning a blind eye on them. The Covid-19-related high mortality rate has further worsened the healthcare crisis in UP. Besides, the state government has also failed in curbing unemployment that has started taking a toll on the state’s youths. I had given a call to make our voices heard,” said Sumaiyya, who lives at Qaiserbagh in Lucknow. However, the police didn’t allow the protesters to gather outside the CM’s residence.“The district administration and the police didn’t allow us to assemble outside the CM’s residence on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they put me under house arrest,” Rana said. She said she saw heavy deployment of police personnel outside her residence and later she was told to stay indoors for another couple of days. She said she had also called a press conference to highlight the apathy of the UP government and how it was trying to muzzle the public’s “voices”. Another anti-CAA activist Uzma Parveen was also put under house arrest.Naveen Arora, joint commissioner of police (law and order), Lucknow Police, said, “A two-day restriction has been imposed on Sumaiyya Rana as a precautionary measure in order to maintain law and order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/urdu-poet-munawwar-rana-s-daughter-placed-under-house-arrest-in-lucknow/story-U8Ktw5688GaHGhvSO1PDUP.html
09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Shiv Sena’s existence is over, says Himachal CM after demolition at Kangana’s property||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday condemned the demolition at Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut’s property in Mumbai by the Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), terming it unfortunate. “The Shiv Sena has shunned the principles for which it was formed. Its existence is over ever since it tied up with the Congress to form the government in Maharashtra,” Thakur, who heads the BJP government in the hill state, said on the sidelines of the assembly session in Shimla. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, particularly its MP Sanjay Raut, and the actress have been engaged in a war of words after she likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and said she feared Mumbai Police more than the movie mafia. On Wednesday, while she was travelling from her hometown, Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh to Mumbai, a BMC team reached Kangana’s bungalow in Bandra with a bulldozer and excavators and demolished alterations carried out on the premises till the Mumbai high court stepped in and stayed the demolition. Thakur, however, declined comment on the editorial in Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece, Saamna, that targeted Kangana. “I cannot comment on it. I have not read it,” he said. The Centre provided Y-plus security to Kangana on the recommendation of the Himachal Pradesh Police after she complained of threats to her life following the spat with Raut. The Himachal police provided security to her during her stay at Manali and later at her native village at Bhambla in Mandi district. State education minister Govind Singh Thakur expressed solidarity with Kangana and described the Maharashtra government’s action as unfortunate. Senior state Congress leader Ram Lal Thakur also said that the security provided to Kangana was the responsibility of the Maharashtra government. “She is the daughter of Himachal Pradesh and we are concerned about her security,” he said. Kangana left Mandi for Chandigarh by road early on Wednesday to catch a flight to Mumbai after testing negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-s-existence-is-over-says-himachal-cm-after-demolition-at-kangana-s-property/story-4mo4ZvZLwhlsC5uSBtqWgL.html
09-09-2020||Pune||Students call cut on FTII plans for online teaching||The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) may be emerging from the Covid-19 lockdown carefully, with online courses the new first take; however, even before the academic year has begun, students and management are already on a collision course, par for the annual script at the world-renowned organisation. Bhupendra Kainthola, director, FTII, has proposed mandatory online classes for first year students, which the students have opposed. In July, heads of some departments had enquired, by method of a form, of the availability of resources for online classes. Many students expressed concerns about non-availability of required resources. “Most departments did not even circulate the topics to be covered. There is no assurance from the administration to provide all resources, devices and uninterrupted internet facility, so students are on the same page, learning with equal opportunity,” said Aadhith V Sathvin president, FTII students association, currently in Tamil Nadu, from where he hails. Students also allege there is no official circular from the director, dean or office coordinator. “When we sent a letter to the institute administration about the inabilities of the students to attend online classes, the departments called the students personally and asked them to attend online sessions. We are always interested in online classes or sessions in a suitable situation, provided equal opportunities for everyone. When such an idea is implemented it is very important to brief all students on the overall plan of curriculum and pedagogical methodology. Considering the current circumstances there should have been proper planning and briefing about the online classes,” added Aadith. “The most important aspect of our current syllabus is that, according to the pedagogy of learning, the modules are designed into theoretical and practical classes. It would badly affect the learning curve if we totally ignore the practical learning and only continue with the theoretical classes. The learning objective of every module in the syllabus totally depends on the process of gradual progression from topic to topic with both theoretical and practical inputs,” he added. “We students, together, took this decision to oppose the proposal of online learning as there is no access to resilient digital infrastructure for all students, especially from remote regions. We cherish inclusivity at our campus. Also, the online mode wouldn’t guarantee the cohesive sync between theory and practical thus affecting the overall quality of film education. Students are awaiting a conducive environment to resume classes in the institute,” said FTII student, Ajinkya Ghule, a Pune resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-call-cut-on-ftii-plans-for-online-teaching/story-AkdfOqgtJkLjynqZCorFNN.html

Our investigation showed that cyber fraudsters had replaced the card readers in these hacked ATMs with their own card readers and could have cloned ATM cards,” Upendra Kumar Mandal, Jamshedpur cyber police station officer-in-charge (OC), said.The officer said Axis Bank provided them with the CCTV camera footage of their ATMs on Wednesday while CCTV footage and other details were still awaited from SBI. “We have sent notices to both the bank authorities as most of these ATMs did not have guards, despite clear guidelines. We are going to hold a meeting with the bank authorities soon and ask them to close ATMs without guards and secluded locations by 8pm,” said Mandal. Mandal said in one case, Rs 6 lakh was withdrawn in three ATM transactions and 61 online withdrawals from the SBI account of a district police personnel Upendra Nath Mahato, posted with Sitaramdera police station in the city. Mahato had withdrawn Rs 20,000 from an SBI ATM with guards at Mango Chowk on July 10, after which cyber criminals withdrew Rs 6 lakh from his account in three ATM withdrawals and 61 online transactions.“We are investigating 11 more complaints by city residents involving such ghost withdrawals amounting to another Rs 3 lakh. In most cases, withdrawals were made from ATMs in Dhanbad, Gaya and Patna. There was a lull after we arrested Nawada-based fraudster Ritesh but the cyber gangs in Jamtara, Deogarh and Nawada have become active again,” added Mandal.Rupees 24, 000 were siphoned off from the bank account of another complainant through an Axis Bank ATM on Old Purulia Road on September 2. Rupees 50, 000 were withdrawn from the account of a Sonari resident Suraj Kumar on August 3 and 4 through ATMs in Dhanbad. Rupees 30, 000 were withdrawn in five instalments from the account of UCIL employee Shashi Mugnekar on September 7.In March last year, nine SBI ATMs—three in Mango, two in Sakchi, one each in Sonari, Kadma, Pardih and Hata Chowk—had to be closed after they were hacked, triggering suspicion of hundreds of ATM cards having been cloned by the cyber criminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-atms-shut-after-rs-10-lakh-siphoned-off-in-jamshedpur-by-hackers/story-YeKV2ilL2JIAREaaL03UhP.html

The stay was granted after the city police challenged the May 18 order of a single judge granting the compensation.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan admitted the appeal by the Delhi police, filed through advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government (ASC) (civil), which had challenged the May 18 order of justice Navin Chawla, directing the Delhi Police to give Rs 75 lakh to Dheeraj Kumar, who was 21 years old at the time of the incident in December 2015.The accident took place on an early December morning in West Punjabi Nagar area when Kumar and his father were returning home on a motorcycle and rammed into police barricades, which were chained together to cordon off a road completely. The victim was admitted at Safdarjung Hospital and after undergoing multiple surgeries and treatment, he was discharged in a state of unconsciousness.Challenging this decision, ASC Narayan, on Wednesday, told the court that to curb law and order problems, address security concerns, especially keeping in mind that Delhi is the national capital and the seat of the central government, houses sensitive establishments, is home to embassies and high commissions of several countries across the world and since top functionaries of the central government and the judiciary etc., reside here; the police actively takes several measures, including the placing of barricades from 12 am to 5 am in various parts of Delhi, including residential areas, to restrict and check movement.He said that the barricades are a common enough sight on the roads of the city and the normal and expected reaction of any law abiding member of the public, on coming across a cordoned of stretch of road, ought to be to respect the said measure and turn away and not to attempt to maneuver through, thereby defeating the very purpose of the security measure.Also Read: Complaint against Alt News founder frivolous, says counsel; arrest barred till Dec 8The plea contended that the single judge, however, accepted the case set up by the petitioner, in toto, despite the fact that it is not supported by any evidence with regard to the factors that caused the accident, and vicarious liability has been placed on the police on the basis of presumptions and assumptions.“The fact that the accident could not have occurred without contributory negligence on part of the motorist has been totally lost sight of,” the plea read.Also Read: No need for prescription for asymptomatic patients to undergo Covid-19 test: Delhi HCFollowing this, the court stayed the order of the single judge even though the counsel told the court that the money has already been deposited in the Registry of the Delhi high court.The youth and his father had earlier approached the high court seeking compensation towards the refund of medical expenses, loss of income/dependency, loss of prospects, continuing future needs as also for the pain and suffering suffered due to the accident.The high court, in its verdict of May 18, said the barricades were chained and therefore, did not allow vehicles to pass through and such chains could not have been visible to the motorist from a distance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-stays-rs-78-lakh-compensation-to-man-who-drove-into-chained-police-barricades/story-q7grSqb3bRLPD1kWZ5Il5M.html

They had been admitted to a district hospital and were referred to Bhopal in serious condition on August 12,” Yadav said.While the wife died on August 12, the husband died on August 16.“In the initial autopsy report, the doctors wrote that they were both men. When we asked the family, they said they had no idea about it,” Yadav added. “We waited for the detailed autopsy report. Last week, when we received the detailed report, we found that [the wife] was a male,” Yadav said.Transgender is an identity, and it is independent from a person’s biological sex. An autopsy cannot determine a person’s gender identity.The husband’s older brother, who did not wish to reveal his name, told Hindustan Times that his brother lived separately in Sehore.“He used to support the LGBT [lesbian gay bisexual transgender] movement, saying that one of his friends is gay and wanted to live a fear-free life,” the older brother said. In September 2018, the Supreme Court struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised adult consensual intercourse between two persons of the same sex. There is no legislation that either prevents or criminalises same-sex marriages in India.A case seeking the recognition of same-sex marriage is currently pending before the Kerala high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-same-sex-couple-lived-as-heterosexuals-for-8-years-reveals-autopsy/story-AkFUjLfwNDYERNgdIxUrHK.html

Though the girl’s face was blurred out in the photo, she said she could get identified as her grandfather’s face was recognisable.The NCPCR said it took cognisance of the complaint received under section 13 (1)) and (k) of CPCR Act, 2005, as a minor girl’s picture is seen to be circulated and posted by various Twitter handles with indecent and disgraceful remarks/comments, which seems to be a cognisable offence and requires immediate registration of an FIR.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for Zubair, said that based on a frivolous grievance of the complainant and biased and prejudiced directions of the NCPCR, an FIR was registered against his client at Raipur, Chhattisgarh, under section 509, Information and Technology Act, 2000 and section 12 of the Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He said that Zubair is a dedicated citizen who, through his news outlet, debunks misinformation put out by individuals and by political parties without any bias. Due to the nature of his work, he is often abused, threatened and demeaned by people, who the website exposes or by their blind supporters.Also Read: Supreme Court dismisses plea against rising fuel pricesAdvocate Rahul Mehra, the standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal) told the court that even though he does not have any instructions, it would not be a problem for the department to share the copy of the FIR.

He also said that the city police have written to Twitter India to gather credentials of a third person who had posted an objectionable comment on the tweet.Following this, the court directed Twitter to extend its co-operation to the city police after Mehra sought that direction be issued to Twitter for expediting the information which otherwise takes a long time.The court will now hear the matter on December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/complaint-against-alt-news-founder-frivolous-says-counsel-arrest-barred-till-dec-8/story-S5BB6qUtO4C4vidDN5u48L.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi airport receives over 45k applications from intl flyers for quarantine exemption||Delhi airport’s online portal has received approximately 45,288 applications from international passengers since August 8 to avail exemption from seven-day institutional quarantine, said its operator DIAL on Wednesday.The government had said last month that from August 8, if any arriving international passenger has a negative report from an RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey, he or she need not undergo institutional quarantine in India. Delhi airport had launched an online portal for this purpose.Over 78,700 international passengers submitted their self-declaration form through the portal, the DIAL said in a press release. It added that 77 out of over 78,700 flyers were found to be symptomatic and were escorted to the Airport Health Organisation (APHO) for “necessary assistance and support”. The “Air Suvidha” portal received the highest number of quarantine exemption applications from the United States (15,027), UAE (4,512), UK (4,094), Canada (3,416) and Australia (2,687) till now, the DIAL noted.As per the health ministry rules, incoming international passengers need to undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine in India.Moreover, every passenger has to submit a self-declaration form that they have not tested positive for Covid-19 three weeks prior to the flight, as per the rules.The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had launched the portal on August 8 so that arriving international passengers can fill mandatory self-declaration forms and eligible passengers can apply for exemption from compulsory institutional quarantine. “Based on the applications received for Delhi as first (entry) airport, approx. 45,288 forms for exemption from institutional quarantine have been submitted by international passengers through this portal. A majority of the applications were approved in a timely manner,” the DIAL noted.The Civil Aviation Ministry had last Wednesday said that international passengers, who have to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, will have the option of getting themselves tested for Covid-19 at the entry airports.If the RT-PCR test result is negative, international passenger will be allowed to board his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine, the ministry’s order said.Delhi airport is likely to start this on-arrival testing facility from mid-September.An international passenger who does not have a Covid-negative result certificate from a test done not more than 96 hours prior to the journey, and does not opt for an on-arrival testing facility at the entry airport, will have to compulsorily undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements between India and other countries since July.Domestic flights resumed in India after a gap of two months on May 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-airport-receives-over-45k-applications-from-intl-flyers-for-quarantine-exemption/story-gqmVaZg6ayT9anKV10T8UK.html
09-09-2020||City||Uniform in Rajasthan government schools to change again||The uniform for students of government-run schools in Rajasthan will change again, three years after the former BJP government introduced one that was identical to the RSS uniform. State education minister Govind Singh Dotasara said the decision to change the school uniform was taken on the recommendation of a six-member committee. “The committee considered complaints of parents and school teachers about the uniform introduced during the BJP government in 2017, to recommend a change,” he said. Also read: So far, Rajasthan has recorded normal rainfall during this monsoon, says reportThe committee was yet to recommend a colour but the new uniform will become applicable from next academic session (2021-22), officials said. Since 1997, the uniforms in the state’s government schools had been blue shirt and khaki shorts or trousers for boys and blue kurta and white salwar or skirt for girls. In 2017, this was changed to light brown shirt and brown trousers or shorts for boys, and light brown kurta or shirt with brown salwar or skirt for girls. A senior government functionary said the colour of the trousers and salwar was identical to the RSS uniform introduced in 2016 and the Congress government’s decision to change it was a political agenda. As a matter of fact, the education department had collected samples from Bhilwara, the textile town that supplied cloth for the first lot of new uniforms of the right-wing organisation, to ensure that the shade of brown matched exactly with that of the RSS uniform. Former education minister Vasudev Devnani had said that the decision to redesign the uniform was taken to make children of government schools as “elegant” as their private school counterparts, and added that the objective was to boost their confidence. The Congress government decided to change the RSS-like uniform for a political reason, said an officer of the department who was present in the meeting with the education minister on Tuesday, requesting anonymity. “Some of us suggested to the minister that it was not an appropriate time to effect a change in uniform when there was so much uncertainty about reopening of schools. But the minister persisted, saying the government could give the relaxation of not making the new uniform mandatory for a year,” the officer said. The six-member committee that recommended the change was headed by joint secretary Rajesh Verma; the members were Munni Ram Bagaria, additional state project director of Samgra Shiksha Abhiyaan; Mukesh Sharma, deputy director in Bikaner; Ramchandra Pilania, district education officer of Jaipur; Annu Choudhary, principal of Mahatma Gandhi English-medium School in Mansarovar, Jaipur; and OSD to education minister. The change in uniform will affect about eight million students in 64,000 government schools. Devnani slammed the decision, calling it shameful. “It is shameful to change a uniform which was introduced after discussion with students and teachers and to give students a sense of pride, only to please one’s high command,” he said, adding that the decision will put financial burden on parents some of whom have lost their livelihoods during the Covid-19 pandemic. The education minister was made the president of Pradesh Congress Committee during the political turmoil arising out of rebellion by 18 Congress legislators led by Sachin Pilot. Political observers said in keeping with the one-man-one-post principle, he may be moved out of the cabinet so Dotasara seemed to be in a hurry to make political decisions in the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uniform-in-rajasthan-government-schools-to-change-again/story-wSKnmj1QHnZcAp8JdyX2EP.html

Initially, organising extra-curricular activities on a virtual platform was a challenge. However, we are ready to take the plunge. Celesta, an international event of dance and music, is slated to be organised online from October 16 by City Montessori School (CMS) Aliganj campus-1. Besides teams from India, schools from the United States of America (USA), Russia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia are expected to take part in the event,” said Geeta Gandhi Kingdon, president, CMS, Lucknow. “Our global contacts over the past 50 years have enabled wide international students’ participation for the upcoming events,” she said. “The school has received entries in the form of pre-recorded videos of dance and music from the participating teams, which are being shortlisted. The inaugural event will be streamed live in the evening on October 16. The programme will be held in the evening because of the difference in international time zones,” said Jyoti Kashyap, principal, CMS, Aliganj campus-1. The remaining two days will see the winning entries being played via the Zoom application (app). All participants will be in attendance. “Invites have been sent out. Social networking sites were extensively used to connect with the international participants,” said Kashyap.“We have restructured the event’s format because it will be held on a virtual platform. We have included individual performances such as folk dance, solo singing, instrumental, freestyle hip-hop, jingles, stand-up comedy and also Celesta Got Talent . We will shortlist the participants on the basis of the videos sent by them. Selected videos will be judged on the day of the event,” she added. Similarly, CMS’s RDSO campus will host Spardha, an international sporting event, where students are required to upload their pre-recorded videos up to a duration of two minutes that will showcase a host of physical activities such as rope skipping, push-ups, sit-ups, freestyle football and Zumba. A Google spreadsheet has been created to receive the entries, a teacher said. “Spardha will help enrich our students’ body and mind,” said Jyotsna Atul, principal, CMS’s RDSO campus.Somdeaw Ket, a school team leader from Thailand, said, “Spardha is not just a competition. It’s an opportunity and friendship that inspires all participants to feel empowered.” The competition is open for students from the primary to the senior levels. Entries have been invited for four categories, including the primary section (from classes III to V), the junior section (from classes VI to VIII) and the senior section (from classes IX to XII). Altogether, 34 schools from India and abroad have sent their entries, including the Ban Pak Gsak School in Thailand, to date.

He also knew he could not afford diesel to run the tube well.However, he did have a cooking gas cylinder (LPG) they got under the Ujjwala scheme. That’s when Tiwari reasoned that if LPG could run vehicles, it would run a tube well too. He took the LPG cylinder to the field and after trial and error, he managed to run the tube well on LPG last week.Also read: The rise and fall of two UP strongmen“The tube well ran for 10 hours on four kilos of cooking gas. The same amount of work would have required 11 litres of diesel,” he said, beaming broadly.His success caught the imagination of other farmers, who are lining up for the technical know-how. “I am sharing with them how I simply attached the rubber pipe in the nozzle through which the pump sucks in air,” he said.To start, the tube well requires a litre of diesel and once it is running, it switches to gas. “It cost me merely Rs 17.60 for an hour of operation that is far cheaper than running it on diesel. That cost Rs 75 per hour,” he said.In a week, he used up the cylinder carrying 14.2 kg of gas and cost Rs 690 to irrigate his field. In this duration, the tube well ran for 35 hours in two cycles.“I am both happy and worried as some people have told me that using LPG like this is a crime,” he said, adding that he was compelled by the circumstances.Tiwari has lost his father and the three bighas of land was the only way to help the family – his mother and three younger siblings – survive. “I have taken loans from a few people and I was worried about not being able to repay them,” he said. He tried to find work on the fields and factories in Chaubeypur but did not succeed. “There was no work available anywhere because of Corona and the lockdown,” he said.“That is why I had to use this system; I promise I will not do it again. My field is irrigated and if need be, I will borrow from the sunaar (goldsmith) again. I do not want to go to jail,” he said.Piyush Mishra, a progressive farmer and head of a neighbouring village, said what Sonu did was path-breaking and the most talked about thing in the region. “We will help him if he needs it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/no-money-for-diesel-school-drop-out-in-kanpur-irrigates-field-with-tube-well-running-on-lpg/story-0wq0SqYKnfwSea30XjCixL.html

His illustrations are going to have a new protagonist ft Coronaman, who shall take centre stage as aliens don masks, and spread the message of following safety norms such as social distancing, increased stoppage time at stations, etc.Khan has been kicked about riding the metro post lockdown, but not “so frequently” he says adding this is a temporary plan till things settle down, and hopes that people get the message of how important it is to ensure hygiene, through his illustrations. Talking about one of his illustration depicting a ‘bored Coronaman’ waiting outside a metro station gate and another one featuring a lady travelling wearing a mask and travelling with children looking out of the train in awe of flying dinosaurs , he says, “I’m definitely going to include Coronaman in a few more scenarios. I still have to go out and see it for myself, but try to help out and spread awareness whenever it’s possible through my illustrations. At the same time, I’ve to make the sketches quirky and entertaining. With the metro reopening, it’s an opportunity for me to turn the new scenario, in the pandemic world, into new doodles.”   Meanwhile, Coronaman is bored waiting for us to enter metro. 😈 In these past couple of years, capturing snippets during my regular commute in metro and bringing out hidden stories in them with my doodles has become a part of my life. 5 months into COVID and it all seems like a distant blur.

The literature enthusiasts or reading nerds can rejoice too. The popular group Books on The Delhi Metro is also planning to get back into action, and leave books as free gifts while indulging the bibliophiles in a treasure hint sort of clues to find where they have left the surprises while on the Metro. Shruti Sharma, founder of the group, says she and her volunteers are waiting to resume the secret surprises as soon as things settle down. Sharma adds, “The plan is not to start immediately since metro has resumed running in phases, and surely there will be lesser number of people taking the transport for now. So we don’t want to rush into things right now. But, we have plans to restart our initiative that had become really popular among people of all age groups, travelling in Delhi Metro. Nearly all our book fairies are students, and most of them have also gone back to their home towns, so we will have to figure out how to go about leaving surprises at various locations... We definitely want to come back and resume to normal conditions that we had prior to Covid-19.”   #lockdownreadingwithbodm Condition:New Murugan started his literary career in 1991 when he was just 25.

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana published Wednesday, called the actor, who is scheduled to arrive in Mumbai, a “supari actor”. The Sena mouthpiece added the Maharashtra unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) should have not supported people who refer to the chief minister in a disrespectful manner.Also Read: Maharashtra home minister receives threat call for criticising Kangana Ranaut“Comparing Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir and insulting the khaki uniform by likening the Mumbai police to the mafia are signs of a disturbed mindset... But when the nationalist Modi government’s home ministry stands by such people and provides them security cover, then our 106 martyrs must be shedding tears in heaven,” the editorial said. (106 people had died during the movement that took place to include Mumbai in Maharashtra).It added that though the Shiv Sena had taken a “different route”, it would never allow disrespect towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It said that Modi was just not a person, but an institution in the form of Prime Minister. “If any person arrogantly challenges the chief minister of Maharashtra, then the whole of Maharashtra should be united against it. The Bharatiya Janata Party is directly supporting those who insult Mumbai and the chief minister of the state,” it added.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut tests Covid-19 negative, leaves Himachal home for MumbaiThe editorial further said that insulting Mumbai was equivalent to making derogatory statements against Mumba Devi, the Goddess of Mumbai. “Our goddess was insulted by comparing her with the Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Hindutva and culture, religion and renunciation of 106 martyrs were insulted and despite this, the Central government is giving respect in the form of special protection to the person who insulted Maharashtra,” it said. “The names of those who insult the mother of ‘Mumbai’ will be written with asphalt in the history of Maharashtra,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-slams-centre-for-providing-security-to-kangana-calls-it-insult-to-maharashtra/story-i9BSimIe552id476y1zaNL.html

The then Mayawati government’s decision had caused a financial loss of Rs 572.48 crore to the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and only unduly benefited select property developers in violation of the Delhi Master Plan 2021, the report cited. The report pointed out that the GDA had approved between October 2010 and October 2013 the layout plans of the property developers for a total area of 4,772.19 acres of land, including 3,702.97 acres indicatively earmarked as a hi-tech township in the Delhi Master Plan 2021.The Delhi Master Plan 2021 stipulated that land-use conversion charges of Rs 572.48 crore were to be levied on the property developers for the said project. However, contrary to the norms, agriculture plots were allotted to Uppal Chadha Hi-Tech Developers Pvt Ltd after changing its land use to residential, but no conversion fee was charged. The firm comprises two property developers such as Uppal Chadha Hi-Tech Developers and Sun City Hi-Tech Infra Pvt Ltd. The CAG report noted that the financial irregularity occurred after the then UP government had issued an order on April 23, 2010, according to a statement issued by the Yogi dispensation on Tuesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/up-government-to-act-on-cag-report-revealing-anomalies-during-mayawati-regime/story-6HaFbrbphIUIeTjNPrTM5M.html
09-09-2020||City||Covid-19: Varanasi’s Ramnagar Ramlila may not be staged this year||The lovers of Ramlila – the re-enactment of the life of Lord Rama as depicted in the Hindu epic Ramayana – in the temple town of Varanasi are disappointed because the world-famous annual event Ramnagar Ramlila is unlikely to be held this year owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.However, many are still hoping for the event will be held, albeit symbolically, in a bid to keep an annual date with a tradition that traces its origin over two centuries ago. Ramnagar Ramlila had started in the early 1800s during the reign of the then Kashi Naresh, Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh. Each year, it starts on Anant Chaturdashi and continues for the next 31 days. Ashutosh Pandey, a member of the Vyas family that has been playing a crucial role for several generations in ensuring successful staging of the Ramnagar Ramlila since its inception, said, “The event starts on Anant Chaturdashi. But this year was an exception. Anant Chaturdashi, which fell on September 1, came and went because of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Pandey said: “At the behest of the Ramlila lovers, locals along with Vyas family members are likely to request the present Kashi Naresh, Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh, to organise the event, albeit symbolically. The request will be made after Kunwar Sahab (Singh) returns from Delhi.” He said: “A meeting is likely to take place on September 29 at Ramnagar fort, if Kunwar Sahab returns from Delhi by then.” He added: “If a decision is taken to organise Ramlila symbolically, only five members of our (Vyas) family will recite the Ramcharitmanas in the evening from September 30. This will be followed by ‘aarti’ of the crown on the Ramlila ground near Ramnagar fort.”Despite a last-ditch effort to hold a symbolic event, police authorities are certain that no visual spectacle is expected this tear. Naresh Kumar Singh, an officer at Ramnagar police station, said the organisers had verbally informed him that Ramlila would not take place this year.Another police official said the state administration had appealed to the Ramlila organisers to follow the Central government guidelines in a bid to contain the spread of the contagion. “The organisers had assured us of full cooperation,” he added.Ramnagar Ramlila is a huge annual draw, including foreign tourists, whose likely temporary suspension this year has hurt several local sentiments.“The tradition should never be broken. The event upholds a display of respect for women and elderly parents. It also teaches a lesson to stay away from bad deeds. It’s like a moral science class for all and sundry,” said Professor Vijay Nath Mishra, a Varanasi–based neurologist and an ardent lover of traditional events like many others in the temple town. Ramnagar Ramlila lovers Vijay Narayan Pandey and Pt Prasad Dikshit also echoed Professor Mishra.The annual event has exclusive trappings such young impressive artistes, sound and light technicians, innovative set design, earthy dialogues and a visual grandeur. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has also recognised the event as an intangible world cultural heritage.The Ramlila is staged in the backdrop of the Ramnagar fort under a sheltering autumn sky. Traditional lamps are the only source of light, which lends an ethereal ring to the natural surrounding.Each year, children are selected and training is imparted to hone their histrionic skills to play the protagonist Lord Rama and other central characters such as Goddess Sita, Laxmana, Bharata and Shatrughna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-varanasi-s-ramnagar-ramlila-may-not-be-staged-this-year/story-AALAJi56OvKAxh1HDPh7wK.html

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Pulwama pencils script a made-in-Kashmir story||Lassipora (Pulwama): Every time a child picks up a pencil to write, chances are he or she may be holding a piece of Kashmir. A significant portion of the wood in making the country’s top brands of pencils comes from South Kashmir. Not many know that Oukhoo, the Pencil Village in the militant hotbed of Pulwama, is the hub for making pencil slats, the main raw material. Dozens of units are engaged in preparing slats inside homes from a special poplar tree that grows only in the wetlands of district. “The wood of trees grown here has the right amount of moisture for making pencils,” says Abdul Rahim, who owns a small unit. 60% PRODUCTION DONE IN KASHMIR Officials say at present 60% of pencil production work is done in the units at Lassipora, one of Kashmir’s biggest industrial estates set up over 300 hectares in 1984. Surrounded by apple orchards, hundreds of bags of raw wood neatly stacked and ready for despatch to the country’s prominent pencil-making industries are testimony to the work 250 units are doing at the estate. “We have eight units where slats are prepared and we supply the raw material to Hindustan Pencils, which makes the Natraj and Apsara brands, and is the second biggest pencil manufacturer in the world,” says Feroz Ahmad, who set up his first unit in 2013 and owns another one in neighbouring Kakpora. LOCAL WOMEN LEAD THE CHARGE Ahmad, a graduate from Amar Singh College, Srinagar, says that most of the work in these units is being done by local women. “This industry generates employment for nearly 2,000 people. At Oukhoo, small units have come up in homes,” he says. Slats prepared in Pulwama are sent to units where pencils are made. “Earlier, we used to supply wood to pencil makers but now we have started making slats that has helped generate jobs,” says Shabir Ahmad, a unit owner. The unit owners are keen on making the whole pencil in Kashmir and then selling it. “We do the basic work here as the raw material is easily available. If the government gives us incentive then complete pencils can be made here,” says Showkat Ahmad, a unit holder, adding that initially the government needs to support them as they have to compete with big brands. “If we start manufacturing pencils from this estate, thousands will get jobs. It only needs government support. I’m ready for full-fledged production,” he says, adding it’s owners making slats who pay the maximum tax in Pulwama. CALL FOR LEVEL-PLAYING FIELD The estate unit holders’ president at Lassipora, Nissar Ahmad, says there is an opportunity for growth if the government provides a level-playing field. “The toll post at Lakhanpur (Jammu) has been abolished for unit holders outside the state. How does the government expect the local industry to compete with big units? Yes, our raw material goes outside the state but for finished products, we have to rely on the local market,” he says. If raw material is procured from outside Kashmir, it is stuck on the national highway for days. “We have been waiting for the completion of the highway for decades,” he says, adding frequent and unscheduled power cuts is another problem. “When units don’t have power, they rely on generators that raise production cost,” he says. Work at the industrial estate gained momentum after 2006 when the government started developing it into a hub. Fourteen cold stores, where thousands of metric tonnes of fruit are stored, is also another attraction. “We have big cold stores, TMT, foam, leather, fabrication, milk units here that generate employment for more than 10,000 people,” says Mohammad Rafi Mir, the manager of the Lassipora industrial estate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pulwama-pencils-script-a-made-in-kashmir-story/story-eFW2KXu1SvK70M5YxGW1LN.html

He went to the nearest police station, at Budh Vihar, and sought help that led to the arrest of two men and a woman in the “honey trap” case.

09-09-2020||Kolkata||Maoist posters in Bengal prompt special force reactivation after a decade||Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has directed the West Bengal police’s top brass to reactivate the counter intelligence force (CIF) that was created a decade ago to combat Maoists in the state and further strengthen the special task force (STF) after news of alleged insurgency activities started pouring in over the past few weeks. Banerjee also sought a report from the director general of police on the alleged insurgency activities in some of the districts in the western parts of the state that once used to be the hotbed of Maoists. “The DGP had visited Belpahari. I would ask him to submit a report. I want to know who all are behind this,” said Banerjee. Virendra, DGP of West Bengal, had on September 5 reviewed security arrangements in some of the western districts including Belpahari in Jhargram that used to be a hotbed for subversive activities carried out by the members of the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) until 2011. The state police chief visited Jhargram and West Midnapore districts and held a meeting with Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to review some stray incidents that had come to light of late. Also Read: Police forces in Bengal should keep up good work, not pay heed to adverse remarks: CMOn August 15, around a dozen hand-written posters were recovered from a couple of villages located around the Bhulabheda forest. The posters had urged the public to observe Independence Day as ‘kala divas’, or a black day. On September 4, again some hand written posters were recovered from Belpahari. “Some people had even tried to kill Manoj Verma, the commissioner of Barrackpore.

The CIF was set up to tackle Maoists when they were active. I would ask Ajoy Nanda (a senior IPS officer) to work on the CIF and reactivate it once again,” Banerjee said. She, however, was quick to add that all the alleged Maoist activities and news that the insurgents were regrouping are staged and the “truth would come out soon”. Earlier in August, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had hinted that Maoists could be regrouping in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/maoist-posters-in-bengal-prompt-special-force-reactivation-after-a-decade/story-cazD0f9mYjLzkzEpK4Bn9L.html

Sanchita is a co-accused in a case related to self-styled Godman Asaram Bapu and had approached the Court seeking urgent relief against the publication of the book as the pre-released chapter published on a web portal was defamatory of her and was likely to prejudice her appeal pending before the Rajasthan High Court. Justice Waziri also allowed the plea of Flipkart and Amazon to delete them from the memo of parties followed by their submission that they shall abide by the direction issued by the court.Harper Collins has moved the Delhi High Court against a district court order restraining publication of a book titled “Gunning for the Godman: The True Story Behind Asaram Bapu’s Conviction”.The Patiala House Court of Delhi on September 4 directed the defendants to restrain from publishing the book titled “Gunning for the Godman: The True Story behind the Asaram Bapu Conviction” till the next date of hearing.Additional District Judge RS Meena on Friday granted interim relief to Sanchita Gupta and restrain the publication of a book.Gupta had approached the Court in a civil suit filed by her advocates Naman Joshi and Karan Khanuja and the matter was strongly argued by Advocate Vijay Aggarwal.Arguing for Sanchita, Advocate Aggarwal informed the Court that the book was being published by Harper Collins and scheduled to release on September 5, 2020, both physically and online.The book authored by Ajay Lamba, Additional Commissioner of Police, Jaipur and Sanjiv Mathur claims to be a true story, however, is at variance with the trial record and most importantly interfered with Sanchita’s appeal which was sub-judice and where the Rajasthan High Court had already suspended her sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-hears-harper-collins-plea-against-stay-on-publication-of-book-on-asaram/story-iXWjEB5CduGatrB01F5pjP.html

The tender will be floated to carry out a survey to identify overhead, overground and underground utilities that will be required for the project. The survey will also include identification of power-sourcing options for substations along the Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur high-speed railway corridor. The rail project is slated to save the commuting time by up to 50% from Mumbai to Nagpur. Currently, the shortest railway distance between the two cities is 11-and-a-half hours by Duranto Express. “DPR will be prepared on the basis of the details we get from the survey. It will be crucial as it will determine the area required, pathway of the railway corridor and other technicalities. Once the data is received, we will begin preparing the DPR,” said a senior NHSRCL official. NHSRCL stated that if the trains are operated at a speed of 320km per hour, the travel time will be reduced significantly. “The speed of train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will be 320km per hour. Similarly, the Mumbai-Nagpur corridor will be 753km, [but] the exact speed and time taken will be determined after the DPR is prepared. However, we expect the travel time to come down by up to 50%,’’ the official added. The DPR will also include identification of locations for railway stations, land required for construction of railway lines and station premises. Passenger associations welcomed the move and stated that the reduction in travel time will help boost the economy of Maharashtra. “Maharashtra’s capital is Mumbai, but Nagpur is a very important city in the state. The reduction in the travel time will not just help passengers but will also allow the easy flow of business between both the cities,’’ said Subash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. DPR will also be prepared for Delhi-Varanasi (865km), Delhi-Ahmedabad (886km), Chennai-Mysore (435km), Delhi-Amritsar (459 km), Mumbai-Hyderabad (711 km) and Varanasi-Howrah (760 km) high-speed railway corridors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/national-high-speed-rail-corporation-floats-tender-to-initiate-process-for-detailed-project-report-for-mumbai-nagpur-corridor/story-KNxM2FYQ1Hmf4OUshe9YzL.html

The accused also robbed the DVR of CCTV cameras installed in the shop, leaving no clues behind for police to investigate. Bipin Kumar Singh, Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner, said: “The taxi used by the accused was also stolen. Hence, the investigating team had absolutely no clue about the accused.”A police officer from the Central Unit Crime Branch, requesting anonymity, said, “We tried tracing the taxi used in the crime by using the trail of CCTV footages.

09-09-2020||Mumbai||20-year-old held from Gujarat for stalking, blackmailing 800 minors and promoting child pornography||Mumbai Police’s cyber unit arrested a 20-year-old man from Mahua in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat on Monday for allegedly stalking, blackmailing and promoting child pornography. The cyber police found nude photographs of more than 800 girls, between 10 and 15 years from the mobile phone of the accused, Alfaz Jamani, which he managed to get from the victims after blackmailing them. According to cyber police officers, Jamani is a Class 12 dropout. He used to work at an onion dehydration plant. Dr Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber), said, “On September 4, we received complaints from seven parents whose children are between 10 and 15 years old. The parents alleged that an unidentified person uploaded morphed and nude images of their children on social media. The police filed a first information report (FIR) and began investigations.” Based on technical evidence, one police team went to Gujarat on September 6 and arrested him. According to the police, the accused revealed that he used to first send friend requests to minors and then started chatting with them after they accepted the request. He later would download their photos from their social media account, morph it and upload them on his other social media profile. The accused would then sent the girls the screenshots of their morphed pictures and ask for their username and password. “Once the girl shared the login credentials, he would change the password, the password recovery email id and mobile number, to ensure that the girl cannot recover the password. He would then again blackmail them to send their nude photographs and videos,” said a police officer from the cyber unit. Jamani would also chat with other female friends of the girls through their accounts and share the morphed images of the victims with their friends, said the police. “Jamani would tell the friends of the victims that the latter achieved the body shape because of a medicine, and would then ask them to share their nude photos to “guide” them on the amount of medicine they need to consume to get the desirable shape,” said the police officer. Karandikar said Jamani is booked under section 354D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code as well as sections 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) and 13 (use of child for pornographic purposes) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. “We have recovered four mobile phones from his house which he used for the crime. Some of the phones belong to his parents and elder brother. From one of those phones, we have recovered more than 800 nude images of minor girls and the accused said he had blackmailed the girls to get these pictures. We have found his 17 fake social media profiles which he used it to befriend minors. We are investigating further,” Karandikar said. Last year, Jamani was arrested by Pune Police for the same offences but was released on bail. A metropolitan magistrate court remanded him in police custody for six days.

09-09-2020||City||Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe becomes chairperson of Maharashtra legislative Council||Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe was re-elected as the deputy chairperson of the Maharashtra legislative Council amid din in the House on Tuesday. Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had fielded Gorhe, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had nominated Vijay Girkar. The BJP, however, walked out of the proceedings after chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar refused to defer the election as a petition filed by BJP in the Bombay high court (HC) was to be heard on Thursday. Nimbalkar announced the Gorhe was elected unanimously, as the BJP did not contest the poll carried out through voice votes. Gorhe was the deputy chairperson of the house in June 2019. Leader of Opposition in the Council argued that his party has approached the HC, seeking a stay on the election as some of its MLCs have been infected by Covid-19 and they will be deprived of their fundamental right of voting given by the Constitution. However, the legislative Council chairman refused to defer the poll and said, “The high court has not summoned me on the decision taken. You, the leader of opposition, are informing me about the decision of the High Court. Therefore, I will not accept the objection raised. Here, it is not the matter of one election or the rights of members as contended by you. The high court does not have jurisdiction over the internal proceedings of the House. Therefore, I will stick to my decision.” BJP MLA and state party chief Chandrakant Patil wrote to Nimbalkar and expressed his disappointment and alleged “discrimination” that he acted “under pressure” to favour ally. “In the Chairman election held four years ago, we, who had never backed NCP, voted for you to get you elected as chairman. But you never cooperated with us, even though it was our government. However today you worked under pressure to discriminate against us.” He added, “Deputy chairperson election was held during a pandemic? While three BJP legislators could not attend as they were coronavirus positive, still election was held? Instead of 78 members, the House had 60 members, still, the election was held? The election was held while a petition was pending in the court? It is surprising.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-s-neelam-gorhe-becomes-chairperson-of-maharashtra-legislative-council/story-Us6BQvg07HxC2sSZlV4i0N.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||“We don’t cut trees at night,” Maharashtra CM’s jibe at Devendra Fadnavis after he slams state’s proposal to shift Mumbai Metro-3 car shed from Aarey||In a jibe at leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said that the Maharashtra government will not take “short cuts” for the Mumbai Metro-3 car shed construction and work will be done in “broad daylight’’ instead of night. Thackeray was referring to the cutting down of trees at Aarey Colony in Goregaon in the night last year for the construction of the car shed. His comments were in response to a discussion raised by the Opposition in the Assembly over the relocation of the car shed from Aarey to Pahadi Goregaon.Thackeray also said that his government will ensure that the Metro corridor opens without wastage of public money.Fadnavis had claimed that the state’s purported proposal to shift the car shed to Pahadi Goregaon is technically and financially unfeasible, as it will lead to wastage of thousands of crores of public money. Fadnavis said that the government should not make this an issue of prestige or ego as the new plan will lead to a change in the alignment as well as the merger of metro lines 3 and 6, which is technically not feasible.“Works [for the corridor] such as the tunnel, entry ram, underpass, which costs thousands of crores of rupees, has already been completed. The state will have to buy the plot if it decides to shift the car shed to Pahadi Goregaon, as it is a private property as opposed to the plot in Aarey, which is government land. The move will ultimately cost additional expenses and its burden will come on the passengers. In addition to this, the project will also be delayed,” he said in the Assembly while discussing on the supplementary demands.While Thackeray did not confirm any plans of shifting the car shed, he said, “We are not working to satisfy our ego nor are we taking shortcuts. We will have to chop trees at night if choose to take shortcuts. Whatever the previous government was doing at night, we have started doing it in broad daylight. We will ensure that public money is not wasted and metro services are also started.”The CM’s reply indicates that he is unlikely to change his position on Aarey. Last week, the government reserved 600 acres of land in Aarey near Sanjay Gandhi National Park as forest area.Last year, during Fadnavis’s regime, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) – the nodal agency responsible for completing metro projects – had axed around 200 trees at night, following the Bombay high court’s (HC) decision to uphold the tree authority’s nod to the felling of 2,646 trees at the car shed site in Aarey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/we-don-t-cut-trees-at-night-maharashtra-cm-s-jibe-at-devendra-fadnavis-after-he-slams-state-s-proposal-to-shift-mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-from-aarey/story-YA57b8W7BsElqcSeBdyccO.html

Our pain is that our [GST] compensation worth ₹22,000 crore has not come [to the state] yet. They are not speaking of giving back money, and are instead giving options such as securing loans. This means what is ours will be lost, and the state will further go in debt. This is what the Centre is doing; it is nothing but sin. At least in this matter, can we forget being the ruling party and Opposition, and question the Centre?” the CM asked in the legislative Council. Thackeray referred to an editorial on GST in a Marathi daily and said, “The important question is ‘what next’, because corona will go away eventually. In reality, if the implementation of the [Goods and] Service Tax is incorrect in the first place, then the question is who has the courage to discuss it? You criticise us, which is fine. But do you have the courage to ask the prime minister on GST and that its implementation is not correct.” The chief minister added that he expects cooperation from the Opposition party in the implementation of ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign in the state. In a bard at Parvin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the Council, Thackeray said, “The concerns you raised on the state of coronavirus are good, but tomorrow don’t go out and start ‘ghantanaad’ agitation to open this and that. We expect you to help us in these times of pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-slams-centre-on-non-payment-of-gst-compensation-dares-state-bjp-to-question-implementation-of-tax-regime/story-soKuA6gE19qUNASN8IhGGM.html

Meanwhile, two other members of the organisation, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor, who were arrested on Monday were remanded in NIA custody till September 11 by the special NIA court. Sources claimed that Jagtap was placed under arrest by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Pune on Tuesday morning and was later handed over to NIA. NIA claimed that the three accused Jagtap, Gorkhe and Gaichor, “were propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology”, and were co-conspirators with other arrested accused. “It has also come on record that the arrested accused persons were in contact with absconding accused Milind Teltumbde about the urban network of CPI (Maoist). Also, it is established that during their visits [of Kabir Kala Munch members] in the jungle, they underwent weapon and explosive training, and awareness programme on various topics related to Maoist movement,” the agency said in a press statement.“It is also established that as per the evidence on record, that in June 2018, absconding accused Teltumbde discussed the Elgar Parishad programme which was organised at Pune and the subsequent in-roads made by the CPI (Maoist) in the organisation and execution through the members of Kabir Kala Munch and other frontal organisations,” the NIA statement added.The three accused were named in the original first information report (FIR) registered by Pune Police against the organisers of the event held at Shaniwarwada on December 31, 2017. According to the FIR registered at Vishraumbaug police station, on January 8, members of Kabir Kala Manch had allegedly made provocative speeches, sang songs and performed skits that led to violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018.The initial investigation was conducted by Pune Police, and two charge sheets were filed in the case. The probe was transferred to NIA earlier this year. The agency has so far arrested Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha and Hanybabu Musaliyavirtil Tarayil. An organisation set up for the accused — Bhima Koregaon Shauryadin Prerana Abhiyan — after the arrest of Jagtap, released a statement seeking the release of the three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-arrests-3rd-member-of-kabir-kala-manch/story-ZIUJCFBUPyyMYPTMMc4dXK.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||BMC distributes worksheets to Mumbai students facing internet connectivity issues||In a bid to help students with poor internet connectivity get access to learning, the education department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has recently started distributing worksheets to them.Schools under BMC distributed class-wise worksheets for the syllabus taught in August. Parents had been asked to visit schools in designated slots assigned to them and collect the worksheets. The initiative has been sanctioned up to December.“In order to ensure students do not remain out of touch with respect to their studies, we have started distributing periodic worksheets of all subjects through schools. Students can solve these worksheets and parents can then submit them to the school for teachers to check them. Teachers can contact students and guide them further,” said Mahesh Palkar, education officer, BMC.As per data obtained by the BMC education department in August, around 25% students in civic body schools were unable to join online classes even two months after schools in the state reopened in June. The civic body had thus distributed textbooks to students in the same month.Now, the BMC has also appointed ‘Palak Mitra’ (friends among parents) through its schools. “The concept is to seek help from parents who are reasonably educated and who can help students in their locality in their studies. Through such volunteers, we are sending out educational content, giving students exercises and monitoring their progress. In addition to this, teachers have been asked to visit localities where students can be taught in small groups of three-five,” added Palkar.A principal from a BMC school in the eastern suburbs said that the initiative of appointing Palak Mitra has been helpful in reaching out to more students.“When our teachers tried to contact students, many could not be reached as their contact numbers had changed or they had migrated to their hometowns. With the help of local support from other parents, we were able to track these students and make sure they get to learn like the others,” said the principal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-distributes-worksheets-to-mumbai-students-facing-internet-connectivity-issues/story-ylzOZqicBhDK42nCSw10HJ.html

Fadnavis alleged that jumbo facilities created by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to treat Covid-19 patients were, in reality, a bid to benefit private contractors and there had been massive corruption in the procurement of several health infrastructures from body bags to masks. He also claimed that only 9,000 patients had so far received treatment under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY), a free health insurance scheme run by the state, and fewer tests were conducted to reflect lower number of Covid cases. “With over 27,000 casualties, Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of Covid deaths across the country apart from having the highest number of total cases as well as active cases. Looking at the conditions, it appears that the jumbo hospitals are developed to benefit some contractors. Patients there don’t get facilities and proper treatment. Jumbo hospitals have become death depots,” said Fadnavis. State health minister Rajesh Tope, however, refuted the charges and said that the government is working with complete transparency and honesty. He said that only 18% of the total cases that were admitted to private hospitals had paid treatment charges while the rest got free treatment. He also assured that the state will take strict action if any specific case of corruption is brought to their notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jumbo-covid-19-hospitals-made-to-benefit-private-contractors-alleges-devendra-fadnavis/story-ZMKVLBPS3o0CZ2y15UMq9N.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||In Mumbai and 17 other cities, councillors not involved in Covid-19 management: Report||A study by Mumbai-based Praja Foundation found that despite Covid-19 impacting cities worse than rural areas, local councillors have rarely been involved in the Covid response. Praja Foundation released a report titled Importance of Local Governance in Crisis Management on Tuesday, based on a study carried out in 29 cities between May and June. The report said in 18 of the 29 cities, councillors were not involved in Covid-crises management. Councillors are locally-elected representatives who are a vital point of contact for citizens with a city’s administration. The 18 cities include Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Gurugram, Kolkata and Mangalore. Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee, Praja Foundation, said, “Keeping a city government out in times of crises is a mistake. It is the local councillors who know what is the real situation and what are the relief measures that are needed. They are much more aware than those sitting at the state capital or at the Centre.” The report also states that 24 cities are not taking response actions through ward-level interventions. In 22 cities, the city administration was not involved in the management as decisions were taken by the state government or Centre. Harshil Suresh from Praja said that in many cities, the local government’s role has been limited to sanitation work. In May and June, Praja Foundation carried out random sampling and interviewed local stakeholders, including councillors, administration and civil society organisations. In Mumbai, it found that though councillors might be undertaking relief work at an individual or political level, they were not a part of the crisis-management process. Mumbai is also in the list of cities where area sabhas are not yet functional. The city has 24 administrative and 227 electoral wards. Asif Zakaria, a Congress corporator from Bandra, said, “It is true that councillors are not really involved in the process of decision-making, though they know the pulse of the area. The administration must make the process more inclusive.” Praja Foundation’s report suggests empowering city governments during crises: “The mayor should hold authority to spearhead the disaster or crisis management at the city level. Ward councillors should be authorised for implementation of rapid response actions and effective reach out to the citizens at ward level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-mumbai-and-17-other-cities-councillors-not-involved-in-covid-19-management-report/story-J0ePJBtlrrcULWQC6QtmjJ.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 discharge rate falls below 80% after cases surge||It’s a double whammy for Mumbai as the city’s discharge rate for Covid-19 has dropped below 80% for the first time in three weeks, after a spike in cases since the beginning of September, while the infection growth rate has crossed the 1% mark. Mumbai has reported 13,000 cases in just the first eight days of September as against 30,474 in entire August.The discharge rate was 81% at the end of August after rising from 80% during the middle of the month. However, with the sudden surge in cases this month, the rate slipped to 79% on Tuesday. The city’s case growth rate, meanwhile, stood at 1.07%, up from 0.8% in the previous week. Discharge rate is calculated as the percentage of Covid-19 patients who have recovered and been discharged from the total cases in the city. Growth rate of Covid-19 cases is calculated based on the average rise in infections in the past seven days from any given day. The cases growth rate of Mumbai was more than 1% in the last week of July, after which it had steadily dropped, with August recording an average of 983 daily cases. However, in the week ended September 6, 11 of the 24 administrative wards of Mumbai have a growth rate of more than 1%, with wards in north Mumbai, covering the areas of Borivli, Kandivli, Malad and Mulund, witnessing the highest growth rate. Overall, in Mumbai, the R-Central ward (Borivli West) has the highest growth rate of 1.5%, followed by Bandra West at 1.3% and Malabar Hill with 1.2%. Mumbai on Tuesday recorded 1,346 Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 158,756. On Monday the city had reported 1,788 cases; 1,910 infections were recorded on Sunday, 1,737 on Saturday, 1,929 on Friday, 1,526 on Thursday, 1,622 cases on Wednesday and 1,142 last Tuesday. The city has reported an average of 1,625 cases in the first eight days of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-discharge-rate-falls-below-80-after-cases-surge/story-E6ZeP5gk2JnLJWJTY7mg8M.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Five wards in south Mumbai record 70% of city’s total malaria cases||As the city witnesses a rise in Covid-19 cases, it is also reporting an increase in malaria cases. In the last eight months, a total of 3,099 malaria cases have been reported across the city, with almost 70% of them in five wards of south Mumbai. Data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that the five wards in south Mumbai — G South, E, F South, G North and D — account for 2,157 of the total 3,099 malaria cases. Civic officials have attributed the rise to the creation of breeding grounds at under-construction sites where work stands halted owing to the lockdown, and ongoing Metro railway work in the island city.Doctors said they are being cautious because symptoms of malaria such as fever, breathing difficulties and loss of appetite are indistinguishable from those of Covid-19. To rule out co-infection, all malaria patients have to additionally undergo the test for the novel coronavirus.Last month, BMC recorded two malaria-Covid-19 co-infection deaths, of which one was from south Mumbai. A 27-year-old man from G North ward (Dadar, Mahim, Dharavi) died due to the co-infection on August 3, 24 hours after getting admitted to a hospital. The other patient was a 40-year-old man from M East (Govandi) ward, who died on August 4.“Cases of co-infection are still less in Mumbai. I have seen two such cases where patients with malaria also tested positive for Covid-19. A co-infection can prove fatal for patients above 50 years of age with comorbid health issues,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consulting general physician at Bombay Hospital. In January, only 172 malaria cases were reported, which increased to 1,163 in August — an almost seven-time surge. Of the five wards with the most malaria cases, G-south (Lower Parel, Worli and Elphinstone) has reported the maximum number of cases, with 1,055 patients till August 31. E ward (Mumbai Central, Byculla, Kamathipura) recorded 478 malaria cases while the count in F South (Parel) was 267 cases. G North (Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi), which has recorded the third-highest number of Covid-19 cases (8,748), reported 233 malaria cases. D ward (Grant Road) has 124 cases.Dr Virendra Mohite, medical officer of G-North ward said the ward has witnessed an almost nine-time increase in malaria cases, from 10 cases in January, to 97 in August. “Due to the lockdown, all the migrant workers from the Metro construction sites have gone back. So, no one has cleaned the accumulated stagnant water which has turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes,” he said. Rajan Naringrekar, chief of BMC’s insecticide department explained that during monsoon, water gets inside the houses at BDD chawl in G South. As a large number of people have left the city due to the pandemic, the rainwater lies stagnant, thereby making it a breeding ground for mosquitoes. “We can’t forcefully enter anyone’s house for fumigation. As a result, people living in the surrounding areas are getting malaria,” he said. However, activists have criticised the civic body for delaying the monsoon-related preparations due to Covid-19. Jitendra Tandel from Rugna Kalyan Seva Samajik Sanstha, said, “Every year, a large number of malaria cases are reported from slums like Dharavi and Govandi. Despite this, BMC didn’t fog the areas and clean the mosquito breeding grounds. As most people are staying inside due to the lockdown, many of them living in these congested areas are getting malaria, and the number will rise further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-wards-in-south-mumbai-record-70-of-city-s-total-malaria-cases/story-t0dFksetpsQ1pwS8jJ7R1K.html

For the short-term plan, efforts will be concentrated on improving the existing plant; for the long-term, a new plant could be set up to replace the existing one.“For meeting the city’s immediate needs of waste processing, our effort will be to improve the existing plant,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.The National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research, Chandigarh, in its report had said that “complete replacement of the machinery to process municipal solid waste with new technology is required”.On the other hand, the civil engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, in its ‘Status report of 500 TPD solid waste processing plant, Chandigarh’ had stated that the machinery at the existing plant required immediate repairs and maintenance, and even after that the “plant can be run at 40% of its capacity”.They had advocated setting up “a new modern 500 TPD (tonnes per day) plant for dry and wet waste treatment in the given plot. For the wet waste stream – biological treatment will be required to meet Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016”.Cost assessment needed for long-term plan“Replacing the existing machinery or bringing in new technology for setting up a new plant, both options will have different costs. We have to assess these costs before the long-term solution can be finalised,” said Yadav.“Both the short-term and long-term plans when finalised will be presented before the MC General House for approval,” he added.Plan finalisation after court proceedings completeThe arbitration proceedings between the Jaypee Group, the former contractors of the Dadumajra plant, and the MC are underway. The civic body on June 19 had taken over the plant, citing the firm’s inability to run it. The private firm had then approached the courts.“When the arbitration is over and it is decided that the occupation will remain with the MC itself, only then can we incur expenditure. We are hopeful that by October-mid, the arbitration will be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-to-adopt-two-pronged-strategy-to-run-dadumajra-plant/story-Bs0rnIfJCkkTUwztq6vtEI.html
09-09-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows termination of 23-week pregnancy of Chandigarh woman||The Punjab and Haryana high court has allowed the termination of 23-week pregnancy of a Chandigarh woman.The HC bench of justice Ritu Bahri acted on a plea filed on August 31 that had sought the court’s intervention after which the court had asked Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to examine the woman.The PGIMER opined that the woman had a single live intrauterine foetus with congenital malformation. The findings had suggested Arnold Chiari malformation, a developmental defect in the foetal brain and spine which has poor prognosis, not compatible with normal life. Thus, the institute had recommended termination of pregnancy.Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The law allows termination of pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner, where the duration of the pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks.If the duration is up to 20 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated if doctors say its continuance would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health.In view of the PGIMER report, therefore, the HC has now asked the institute to terminate the pregnancy within three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-termination-of-23-week-pregnancy-of-chandigarh-woman/story-pIk9BMU1TtIxZ71eu0lGBP.html
09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University research scholars seek accommodation in hostels, access to libraries||The scholars of Panjab University (PU) are demanding accommodation in hostels and access to libraries, saying that research work has suffered after class work was suspended in March.The Panjab University Research Scholars Association (PURSA) submitted a representation in this regard to the varsity on Tuesday. After the lockdown was imposed, more than 3,000 research scholars working in the varsity’s teaching departments had no access to laboratories. A total of 491 students were awarded PhD degrees by PU in 2019.The scholars of the science departments said they had a lot of pending work. A research scholar at PU’s chemistry department, who did not wish to be named, said, “We have already lost six months due to the lockdown. My research is in the final stage, but just because of a few pending experiments, my submission is getting delayed.”Many scholars said that their number was lower than students in other disciplines and they should be allowed re-entry on the campus. They assured to follow necessary precautionary measures. The representation focussed on the need for research scholars to access libraries and a good internet connection to access online journals.“When all premier institutions like CSIR, DU, IISC have allowed re-entry of PhD students in a planned manner, PU should also consider it as a priority and reopen,” read the PURSA representation.Meanwhile, the National Students Union of India (NSUI) started an online petition demanding that research scholars be allowed to enter the campus and stay at hostels. Pahul Kaur, district president of NSUI and a research scholar at PU, said, “We also demand that the last date of submission of bills and related documents must be extended.”Dean students welfare (DSW) SK Tomar said, “We have forwarded the representation to the vice-chancellor and an appropriate decision will be taken keeping in view the present situation and the guidelines of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-research-scholars-seek-accommodation-in-hostels-access-to-libraries/story-xIMGVZAl2mhVKDPQ2VEmOI.html

A portion of the house had collapsed two days ago after which its owner asked them to vacate as the house was in a dilapidated condition.Ward officials of Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) in Pendhar village said the incident took place around 7 am. Parents of the four siblings were out looking for an alternate accommodation when the incident took place.Police officials said that Munna Harijan, 30-year-old labourer, was staying in a rented ground-plus-one-load-bearing house near a chawl in Pendhar in the MIDC area with his wife Lali Devi, 25, and four children – Santosh, 12, Hina, 10, Anshika, 4 and Anupama, 3.First, the slab of the house collapsed on Hina, who got crushed under its weight. Shortly, the entire house collapsed with the other three children also getting caught under the rubble. The Taloja MIDC fire brigade reached the spot and pulled out the children. However, Hina could not survive the crash.“Two days before the incident, a wall of the structure had collapsed after which the house owner, Uday Ghana Patil, asked the tenants to vacate. Four-five other families staying there vacated,” said RM Pharande, sub-fire officer at Taloja MIDC fire brigade.Due to financial constraints, Harijan was unable to get a new room quickly. While he was out with his wife to a nearby hospital for a minor health issue, they also decided to search for an alternate accommodation in the area.“We have filed an accidental death report. There is no complaint of negligence against anyone yet. The fire brigade department will submit its report along with the findings of the municipal corporation, based on which further course of action will be decided,” said Kashinath Chavan, senior inspector at Taloja police station.The three other children sustained minor injuries and were taken to Om Sai Hospital in MIDC, Taloja for treatment. They continue to remain admitted, said fire officials.“The structure was built in 1972. We believe the structure had weakened due to incessant rains and deteriorated. The other four families had vacated in the last two days after the owner informed them of the dangerous condition of the structure,” said Dashrath Bhandari, local ward officer, PCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/house-collapses-in-navui-mumbai-s-taloja-area-10-year-old-killed-3-injured/story-8c0JnyurgNHVzXVCPl1qAO.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh case: NCB arrests Rhea Chakraborty, bail plea rejected||Actor Rhea Chakraborty was remanded to 14-day judicial custody after being arrested on Tuesday. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing allegations of drug abuse in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, has charged Chakraborty with procuring drugs for Rajput. On Tuesday afternoon, Chakraborty was arrested on the basis of statements from other arrested accused in the case. So far, NCB has made nine arrests, including Chakraborty’s brother, Showik; Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, and Rajput’s domestic help, Dipesh Sawant. Deputy director general, NCB, Mutha Ashok Jain said, “We have not found any contraband from Rhea and her brother Showik’s residence in Juhu. After three days of interrogation, we have sufficient material to arrest her, but I will not comment on the evidence in this case.” At 7.30pm, NCB produced Chakraborty before a magistrate court via video conferencing. In its remand application, NCB claimed Chakraborty had revealed she procured drugs for Rajput. “It is also clear from the statement that the present respondent [Chakraborty] used to procure drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput for consumption purpose. The present respondent used to manage finance for drug procurement along with Sushant Singh Rajput,” read the application. NCB did not seek Chakraborty’s custody. Advocate Satish Maneshinde, representing Chakraborty, moved for bail and questioned the applicability of section 27A (financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) on Chakraborty. He contended she should at most be charged under section 27 (consumption of narcotic drug or psychotropic substance) of the act. However public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said Chakraborty had been charged under section 27A for arranging drugs for Rajput. “Under section 27 (a), the punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders is 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and could extend up to 20 years, which can also extend to a fine of Rs 2 lakh. Magistrate courts do not have jurisdiction on cases where sections attract punishment over 10 years,” said Atul Sarpande, on the court’s decision to reject Chakraborty’s bail plea. Chakraborty has been remanded to judicial custody till September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-rhea-chakraborty-bail-plea-rejected/story-mFSyCTWmSGParTAk2bXW8N.html

We will clear the building within a fortnight,” said Jyotsna Hasnale, mayor, MBMC. The government resolution (GR) for the formation of the new police commissionerate was passed in September 2019 but there was a bureaucratic delay for over six months which got extended due to the Covid pandemic. The Mira Road location was ideal because of its proximity to Thane and Palghar districts. The state home department has allocated a budget of ₹174 crore for the new MBVV commissionerate.Till now, the Mira-Bhayandar stretch fell under the Thane (Rural) police district and Vasai-Virar under Palghar police district.Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Sadanand Date was appointed commissioner of the newly-formed MBVV commissionerate. Date has been working without a posting after he returned to the state after he was on central deputation in February.During the November 2008 Mumbai terror attack, Date had fired at terrorist Ajmal Kasab and his aide. The officer also was injured in the exchange of gunfire and was later awarded the President’s Police Medal for bravery. He was instrumental in setting up the Maharashtra anti-terrorist squad and had worked as inspector-general (IG) and additional director general (ADG) of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) before becoming the joint secretary in the state law and justice department. He also served as a deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 8 in Mumbai, and later was appointed as the additional commissioner by the Centre.Alongside Date, the state government had sanctioned 4,708 posts for the new MBVV commissionerate. A total of 1,006 posts from Thane (Rural), 1,165 from Palghar and 317 from other areas will be transferred to the new set-up, said a police source. An additional 2,200 posts will be added for the region. Recruitment will be done in two phases and the notifications for the first phase have already been issued.Seven new police stations will also be created alongside the current 13 which are part of Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar. Kashigaon will be bifurcated from Kashimira, while Golden Nest will be separated from Navghar and Mira Road police stations. There will be new police stations at Pelhar, Achole, Mandavi, Bolinj and Naigaon. In July 2019, the state cabinet had approved ₹3.82 crore for the construction of the new police stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-mbvv-commissionerate-finally-gets-office-space/story-pUsSf4N7K8VdwCHS0DgOVI.html

The board will also decide about the allotment of 50% of wards reserved for women.The elections will be held for 50 wards in the last week of November or the first week of December.Kuljeet Singh Bedi, member of the board, said, “The idea is to simplify the ward bandi by adjusting sectors and reshuffling them as per suitability. In 2015, elections were held with the data of 2014, and the votes were made accordingly. After six years now, the population in Mohali has increased and new sectors have become overpopulated. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the area of the Mohali MC and wards must be re-adjusted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-mc-to-complete-delimitation-survey-by-september-20/story-1O2Mg2KsCjoN1bzoo70lXN.html
09-09-2020||City||Waterlogging damages cotton crop on 17,000-hectare land in Abohar||Cotton growers in the semi-arid Abohar belt of Fazilka district are facing losses as waterlogging on nearly 17,000 hectares of land for more than a fortnight has damaged their standing crop. Fields in at least 20 villages were inundated after the catchment area of the Aspal drain in Fazilka, Muktsar and Ferozepur districts had witnessed heavy rainfall on August 21 and 22. Due to heavy inflow of rainwater, the drain breached its banks near the Seeto Gunno area of Abohar and it led to flooding in the adjoining areas. But there has been no improvement in the situation ever since, say the farmers. Officials of the state agriculture department say the chances of survival of most of the crop, which is underwater up to than 4 feet in several villages, are bleak. “The crop was in the final stage of maturity as the first picking of cotton balls was expected after September 20. As fields are still inundated, a sizeable number of cotton plants may not survive,” said Jalour Singh, who holds the additional charge of Fazilka chief agriculture officer. Besides cotton crop having been adversely affected on 17,000 hectare land as per an initial assessment, paddy on nearly 4,000 hectares was also flooded in the area, he added. “Paddy sown on about 1,000-hectare land faces a serious problem even as the rest of the crop may survive,” he said. With 1.22 lakh hectare land under cultivation, Fazilka district ranked second after Bathinda in sowing of the cotton crop this year. Pawan Sihag of Sardarpura village said his crop on 18 acres was completely damaged. “I was expecting a bumper yield as the climatic conditions remained conducive for the crop this time,” said Sihag. Dutarwali sarpanch Surinder Kumar Bishnoi said 2,200-acre farm area in their village is almost submerged for the last over two weeks. “The drain had caused havoc in the area earlier also but the authorities concerned did not come forward with a solution. Villages are getting adequate power supply but septic tanks in household toilets are overflowing. The administration should press more pumps in service to drain out water from the fields,” said Bishnoi. Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Bajidpur Bhoma, expressed concern over non-availability of cattle fodder. “Green and dried fodder also got damaged due to waterlogging. The state authorities should extend support to ease the situation,” said Singh whose crop on 20-acre land is also submerged. State drainage department executive engineer Sukhjit Singh said most part of the affected area is up to eight feet below the drain channel. “It is a major task to drain out a large volume of water from a vast area. Our top priority is to ensure that inhibited areas do not get waterlogged,” he said. Fazilka deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Sandhu said girdawri (crop loss assessment) has been ordered. The drainage department has been provided with logistical support to dewater the farmland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waterlogging-damages-cotton-crop-on-17-000-hectare-land-in-abohar/story-zNy2iIJO7KgCrDql441IKI.html

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board project for govt officials: Design for flats to be finalised in a week||: In a week’s time, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) will finalise the architectural design of the flats to come up under the housing scheme for officials of Punjab and Haryana governments, UT administration and PGIMER officials at the Rajiv Gandhi Information Technology Park.CHB had invited architectural designs for the project in a competition earlier this year. From the entries, 25 designs were shortlisted.“As many as 25 architects participating in the competition will make their presentations before a committee formed to select the best design. The selection process will be completed within a week,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB. The presentations will be made online from September 14.“The committee comprises officials from UT, Punjab, Haryana and experts from the Delhi School of Architecture. The committee will decide the best design in two to three days,” Garg said.In the meeting, the top three designs will be decided. The winning entry will get ₹5 lakh, first runner-up ₹3 lakh and second runners up ₹2 lakh.CHB is to construct eight towers at IT Park. The luxury flats will be made for top officials including IAS and IPS officers and MLAs. Punjab, Haryana UT and PGIMER officials have already expressed their desire to buy these flats. Under the project, CHB will construct three towers each for the Punjab and Haryana governments and two for the UT administration. Haryana is buying two towers for officers and one for MLAs.Meanwhile, design for the general housing scheme in IT Park has been finalised and the presentation has been given to Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore.Significantly, in 2006, CHB allotted 123 acre-land in IT Park to Parsvnath Developers Limited. However, the builder could not start the work on the land which got entangled in prolonged arbitration proceedings. In 2015, CHB took back the land by returning ₹527 crore to the builder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-housing-board-project-for-govt-officials-design-for-flats-to-be-finalised-in-a-week/story-8E6qvSxa8nYFU6RHKzEMtO.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses bail to Finnish woman arrested for helping Sri Lankan national illegally migrate to Europe||The Bombay high court last week refused bail to a 60-year-old Finnish national arrested for helping a Sri Lankan national to illegally migrate to Europe.Justice Sarang Kotwal rejected the bail plea of Miira Mirva Helena Pasma observing that there were strong circumstances against her.Pasma was arrested after Sri Lankan national Kuhapriya Thevarasa was found carrying a forged French passport issued in the name of Pasma on June 28, 2019, at Mumbai airport. Thevarasa was stopped from boarding a flight to Frankfurt after the airline staff suspected immigration stamps on her passport and handed over to the Sahar police.Preliminary investigation revealed that Thevarasa had entered the airport with a ticket for Ahmedabad, whereas Pasma had a French passport and a ticket and boarding pass for the Frankfurt flight. Pasma allegedly passed on the forged passport with purportedly fake immigration stamps to Thevarasa after she cleared immigration check. Thevarasa attempted to board the Frankfurt flight based on the forged documents, whereas Pasma took a domestic flight to Ahmedabad, where she was apprehended on June 30, 2019.Pasma’s interrogation revealed that she had come in contact with an agent who along with others was illegally sending Sri Lankan nationals to European countries from Mumbai, and Thevarasa’s parents had paid the gang Rs. 14 lakh. Pasma, who claimed to be a teacher was promised to be paid 1,500 Euros for helping Thevarasa migrate to Europe.Both of them were then booked by Sahar police for offences punishable under sections 370 (dealing any person as a slave), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) read with section 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.Pasma had moved HC for bail contending that the offences of human trafficking and cheating were not attracted in the case, as no one was being trafficked for exploitation and there was no dishonest inducement for cheating anybody.Justice Kotwal agreed that there was no material to support the charge of human trafficking, but there was material supporting other charges levelled against the 60-year-old.“The offence is serious. The immigration officers of this country were deceived. Indian territory was used by these two accused for their gain,” said the judge.HC refused to take a sympathetic view of the fact that she was behind bars for about 14 months and the trial has not started yet. “Unfortunately, the trial could not start immediately, but, the Court cannot be oblivious to the current situation which has arisen because of COVID-19 pandemic. All the under-trial prisoners are similarly awaiting trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-finnish-woman-arrested-for-helping-sri-lankan-national-illegally-migrate-to-europe/story-gEHzsV848lyzrIYyJJOiOJ.html

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||‘Illegal royalty’ collection: Punjab moves HC seeking recall of CBI probe order||The Punjab government on Tuesday approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking recall of an order asking the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary probe into alleged collection of illegal ‘royalty’ from trucks carrying mining material in Rupnagar district. In an affidavit filed by mines and geology director VN Zade, the government referring to the report that prompted the high court to issue the probe order says “an important and critical distinction” needs to be made that the judicial officer makes “no mention of collection of royalty at such checkpoints”. However, the report by Harsimranjit Singh, chief judicial magistrate-cum-secretary, district legal services authority, Rupnagar, says, “...( those contacted) unanimously confirmed that no truck carrying sand and gravel is being allowed to cross these points without paying royalty” (sic). The report was submitted in March. The judicial officer was tasked by the high court on February 19 to submit the report after hearing a petition on the illegal mining issue amid the government’s claim that there were no illegal check points/barriers near the mining sites in Rupnagar. The government has argued that there was no occasion of exercise of power of instituting/transferring investigation to the CBI. “..(It) arises where the Hon’able court finds it necessary in order to do justice between the parties to instill confidence in the public mind or where investigation by the state lacks credibility” (sic). It further says that criteria under which a CBI probe should be ordered are not met in this case. The affidavit also denies findings of the report that collection of illegal royalty was going on at seven points by private individuals in the district. It says checkpoints have been set up by the government and private individuals are not allowed to be part of the exercise. The government said the affidavit was filed by a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) based on two reports by different functionaries which said no illegal barriers were set up at the locations in question. This affidavit had prompted high court to rope in judicial officer to ascertain facts on the ground.The CBI has already registered a preliminary FIR after the HC directive. In the report, the CJM had listed seven locations where illegal nakas were in place on three dates when he paid the visit to re-verify. The officer had also submitted photos and videos of these nakas and collection being made by private persons from the mining trucks. The government’s plea was taken up by the high court bench of justice Rajan Gupta who directed that it be listed before the bench presided over by justice Jaswant Singh that had ordered probe by the central agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-royalty-collection-punjab-moves-hc-seeking-recall-of-cbi-probe-order/story-HlxYPHXyd8CTaoR5FQ6FHO.html

09-09-2020||City||Haryana farmers demand special girdawari for cotton crop damaged by whitefly, leaf curl||Farmers in Haryana’s Hisar, Bhiwani, Dadri, Fatehabad, Sirsa and Jind districts have demanded a special girdawari for their cotton crop damaged by whitefly attack, parawilt and leaf curl.This season, nearly 7.37 lakh hectares is under cotton cultivation across the state.Dayanand Punia, a farm leader from Bhiwani, said the damage is large-scale and farmers have lost nearly 60 to 100% of their produce. “The farmers were expecting a good yield this time, but the whitefly attack has shattered their hopes,” he added. Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, who visited a couple of villages in Bhiwani and Dadri to inspect the damage, said, “The farmers have suffered huge losses as they sprayed chemicals to kill the insects but those did not help save the crop.”He added, “This time there was less rainfall in August and now the weather has turned hot and humid, which led to the crop damage. Revenue and agricultural officials have failed to guide farmers on saving the crop from pest attack.” FARMERS START INDEFINITE STRIKEQuestioning the procedure adopted by revenue officials while sending an initial estimate of 10% loss in Hisar villages, farmers have started an indefinite protest against the administration at Balsamand village.Kurda Ram, a farm leader, said, “The revenue officials sent a report, stating that there was only 10% crop damage due to whitefly attack. The officials prepared this assessment report while sitting in their offices. The government should order a special girdawari to assess the crop damage and give us a compensation of Rs 50,000 per acre.” He further added, “We demanded that strict action should be taken against the revenue officials, who had sent a fraudulent report about the crop damage.” Additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers’ welfare department, Sanjeev Kaushal, said all cotton growers in the state who have recently suffered losses due to the crop damage caused by whitefly and parawilt, will be given compensation.“All such cotton growers would be compensated irrespective of whether or not they have enrolled under the crop insurance scheme Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-demand-special-girdawari-for-cotton-crop-damaged-by-whitefly-leaf-curl/story-7FC7hnkUhVguYy6JaV5RjO.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s grim realty sector may not get relief this year, say experts||The real estate sector in Mumbai and its surrounding areas is unlikely to recover this year, according to builders, experts and homebuyers, as the industry battles its slowdown and an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. The problems are multi-fold: Construction sites wear a deserted look owing to around 60% of migrant workers still stuck in their home states with minimal ways to return, builders face acute monetary crises and buyers are uncertain when they would get possession of their homes. Industry veteran Paras Gundecha, 67, who heads the Gundecha Group that has constructed more than 100 buildings in Mumbai (most of them in the western suburbs), said he had never seen such a long slowdown. “Things will start moving only after March and till then we have to bear the pain,” said Gundecha. Niranjan Hiranandani, founder , Hiranandani group, which constructed townships in Thane and Powai, said banks should ease monetary crises faced by the sector. “The realty sector was suffering even before Covid-19 and hence, banks need to give us a a one-time rollover to tide over the crises,” said Hiranandani.The shortage of labour is adversely affecting the entire construction sector in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). According to CEDAI-MCHI (Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry), the leading association of builders, of the five lakh workers who had left for their home states in March-May, just two lakh managed to come back. “Construction activity will remain majorly paralysed till we get sufficient labour back to the sites,” said Rajesh Prajapati, chairman, MCHI (media and PR). CREDAI-MCHI has written to both the state and Central governments to start hundreds of trains to bring back migrant labourers. “The labourers want to come back, but are unable due to lack of transport. Till new trains are introduced, the situation will not improve,” he added.The MMR is a prime realty market in India. Liases Foras, the real-estate research firm, said in MMR, work has started in just 4,200 construction sites, of the 10,500 in total. “Even in these 4,200 sites, work is in full swing in just 420, while the other sites have minimal workers and hardly any work taking place,” said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras.The Builders Association of India (BAI) blames lack of liquidity for the problem. “Builders have exhausted all their money and are facing monetary crises. Banks and financial institutions are not supporting us. It is not possible to start work in such a situation,” said Anand Gupta, chairman, BAI (Housing and RERA committee). Potential buyers have deserted the market in the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis. This can be illustrated by the massive drop in sales in both Mumbai as well as MMR during the Covid-19 period. In Mumbai, 1,611 apartments were sold from April to June, compared to 4,460 sold from January to March 2020. Similarly, in MMR, the period between April and June saw 6,396 transactions, compared to January-March where the number of sales clocked 16,794. The state government, to boost sales, announced a cut in stamp duty prices from 5% to 2% till December 31 and to 3% till March 31. However, not many are convinced that this will help. “This is a very depressing market and such small steps will not get anyone to buy a house,” said Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank, a real-estate consultancy firm. Zia puts the onus on the overall state of the economy. “Buyers facing job insecurity and pay cuts will not buy a house. The overall sentiment is negative,” he added. Kapoor and Zia both said it will take at least one year going by the current state for the real estate sector to stabilise. “It depends on the Covid-19 vaccine, which may bring back confidence,” said Zia.Even those who have booked apartments are still uncertain when they will get possession. The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) has extended the possession date by six months. “We were supposed to get possession in December, but it seems uncertain even in 2021,” said Veena Sehgal, who had booked a house at Kandivli. Lalbaug resident Ashwin Gala, who had finalised a house, had to cancel it. “Everything was finalised, but the pandemic struck and the seller bac-ked out. I had no option, but to cancel this deal,” said Gala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-grim-realty-sector-may-not-get-relief-this-year-say-experts/story-MGv0sNubukNu792ZYqE3zN.html

09-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut to be probed over drug-use claim, says Maharashtra home minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday ordered a probe into the claims made by Adhyayan Suman – the purported former boyfriend of actor Kangana Ranaut – in an interview three years ago that she was on drugs and had forced him to consume the narcotic substances as well. The actor, expected to arrive in the city today and who is in the eye of a political storm over her remarks on Mumbai and the Centre’s decision to grant her Y+ security, was also issued a notice by the civic body, asking her to take corrective measures regarding “structural violations” in her Pali Hill office. The civic body will undertake action if she fails to reply in 24 hours. The actor, through her lawyer, has requested for seven days to reply and address concerns in the stop-work notice. Also, breach of privilege motions were moved and accepted against Ranaut and Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami in the legislature for “defamatory” remarks on Mumbai and “derogatory” comments against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray respectively.In response to the probe announced by Anil Deshmukh, Ranaut tweeted, “I am more than happy to oblige @MumbaiPolice @AnilDeshmukhNCP please do my drug tests, investigate my call records if you find any links to drug peddlers ever. I will accept my mistake and leave Mumbai forever, looking forward to meet you. (sic)” Replying to the point raised by Shiv Sena legislators Pratap Sarnaik and Sunil Prabhu, Deshmukh said that the Mumbai Police would be asked to probe into the claims made by Suman, the son of actor Shekhar Suman. Deshmukh said that Mumbai Police would look into Suman’s three-year-old statement. “Sena lawmakers Prabhu and Sarnaik had raised the issue about the revelation against Ranaut that she was on drugs. Suman was in a relationship with her and he had said that she used to force him to do drugs as well. Mumbai Police will look into the allegations,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh also made a statement in relation to the tweets by Ranaut, where she likened Mumbai with the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). He said that such a statement was unfortunate and is an insult to Mumbai and Maharashtra and its proud people. “Mumbai and Maharashtra have given Ranaut everything, but in return she has played with the sentiments of the people. At least, 106 people had laid their lives for a unified Maharashtra. Not only the ruling parties, but even the opposition, BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), must also condemn her statement,” he said. Earlier on Monday, Maharashtra assembly’s deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal directed Deshmukh to make a statement within 24 hours. Deshmukh made the statement in response to a letter written by Sena legislator Sarnaik seeking unanimous resolution must be passed by the assembly against Ranaut for her anti-Maharashtra rants on social media. Deshmukh also announced that Mumbai Police would conduct a probe into the death by suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik three years ago. Naik, in his suicide note, had named a few persons, including a TV news channel’s editor, who allegedly did not pay his dues worth several crores of rupees, according to the deceased’s kin.State food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal and energy minister Nitin Raut have demanded a bid to expedite the probe in the Naik death case. They said that the interior designer and his mother had died by suicide three years ago while holding the editor responsible for non-payment of their dues against the construction of the channel’s studio in Mumbai. “The case has been registered. Mumbai Police will be ordered to conduct a probe into it,” Deshmukh said. A breach of privilege motion was moved in both houses of the state legislature against Republic TV’s managing director and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami on Tuesday. A privilege motion was also moved against Ranaut over her remarks comparing Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) in the Maharashtra legislative Council. Council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar accepted both motions against Goswami and Ranaut, while deputy speaker of Assembly Narhari Zirwal said he will decide (whether to accept it or not) after the scrutiny. Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik moved the motion in Assembly, while his party colleague in the council Manisha Kayande moved it in the upper house against Goswami for derogatory remarks against Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and other politicians. Parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab said that the news anchor holds debates as if he was the judge and holding a trial. His derogatory remarks against the CM and other leaders were highly objectionable. Congress’s Ashok Jagtap moved a privilege motion against Ranaut for “defaming Mumbai” in the Upper house. Congress legislator in Council, Bhai Jagtap referred to 2016 interview of actor Adhyayan Suman and said that Suman had told media that the actor had asked him to consume drugs.Council chairman Nimbalkar said, “I have accepted the breach of privilege of motion. In the absence of a committee for it, I am going to decide on it (on the motion).” Ranaut equated Mumbai to PoK and the Sena took offense and criticised her comment. She also got in to a verbal spat with Sena leader Sanjay Raut. The actor is also been in the news for her controversial comments on the Mumbai Police’s handling of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Later, Sarnaik said outside Vidhan Bhavan that there was no political vendetta in demanding action against Kangana. “Law is same for all citizens. The actors who are given security are idols for society and any allegations against them should be taken seriously. If she is innocent, then action should be taken against the person who has levelled allegations against her. It will come out only after the probe,” he said.Earlier on Tuesday morning, after paying a surprise visit to her office at Pali Hill in Bandra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a stop-work notice to Ranaut, pointing to 14 types of structural violations, carried out in her office and sought her reply in 24 hours, failing which the illegal portions of her office would be demolished. Replying to the notice, Ranaut, through her lawyer, requested for seven days to reply and address the concerns in the stop-work notice issued by the BMC on Tuesday morning. Her lawyer also demanded that the BMC officials, who visited Ranaut’s office premises on Monday, be prosecuted for trespassing in her property and intimidating her security staff. Manikarnika Films Private limited, Ranaut’s office, which is a ground-plus-two storey structure, is located at Bungalow number 5 in Chetak Row Houses of Pali Hill. When the structural details were cross-checked by the BMC, they found out that the structure exists in their records since 1970s. They also found out that the office has several structural violations, which includes illegal extension, which has been pointed out in the notice.Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner of H-west ward (Bandra, Khar), said, “The site inspection was conducted according to the approved plans in BMC’s development plan department. We have listed out several violations in the notice and will await her reply on the same. Depending on that, further action will be taken.” The BMC is yet to comment if it has granted her the seven-day time period as asked by her lawyer.The structural violations in her office include converting toilet into an office cabin, constructing new toilets alongside staircase, unauthorised extension of slab on the first, second floor and merging of the bedroom of adjoining bungalow into this office space, on the second floor by removing partition wall.A report citing all illegalities of the structure is being prepared by the local ward office, H-West ward (Bandra, Khar)Meanwhile, BMC has filed a caveat in a court stating it should be heard first, if Ranaut challenges the stop-work notice. A caveat is a request to a court that no order should be passed without hearing the person or party which files it. Replying to this, Kangana tweeted, “Now BMC has filed a caveat against me, really desperate to break my house, I deeply love what I built with so much passion over so many years but know that even if you break it, my spirit will only get stronger. Go on.”On Monday, Ranaut took to Twitter to share a video clip of the officials visiting her office and accused the BMC of “forcefully taking over” her office and said that the BMC is going to demolish her property on Tuesday. A team of officials from building proposals department inspected her office to check for alterations comparing the approved plans. In her defence, Ranaut had tweeted, “I have all the papers, BMC permissions and nothing has been done illegally in my property. BMC should send a structure plan to show the illegal construction with a notice. Today, they raided my place and without any notice tomorrow they will be demolishing entire structure.”(Inputs by Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-to-be-probed-over-drug-use-claim-says-maharashtra-home-minister/story-uPBwImjdpn8jqgGopLKllI.html
09-09-2020||Mumbai||Six months after Maharashtra’s first Covid case, tally 943,772; toll now 27,407||Six months since the first Covid-19 case was detected on March 9, Maharashtra is inching towards the one million infections mark. The case count reached 943,772 after 20,131 fresh Covid cases were recorded on Tuesday. The surge has led to a rise in active cases at 243,446, accounting for 25.79% of the total cases reported so far.The death toll of the state also jumped to 27,407 after 380 more casualties were reported. Of them, 256 were in the past 48 hours, another 94 were from last week while the rest 30 were from the period before that.Officials are wary that the rise in cases is likely to continue for a few more weeks, before it can hit a plateau. The highest single-day spike of 23,350 infections was on September 6, while the highest toll in a day was 422 on August 18.“The scenario is likely to continue for the next few weeks as new infections are unlikely to come down soon. Even after hitting a plateau, daily cases will remain stable for quite some time, which indicates that cases will not reduce in the next one or maybe two months,” said a senior health official.“With rise in cases, we need more facilities to cope with the daily caseload. We are also working to augment the existing health infrastructure, especially in semi-urban and rural areas of the state, from where a significant number of fresh cases have started coming,” he added.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the coronavirus is unlikely to fade away soon and thus there is a need to make people aware about how to live with it, said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday. In his concluding speech before the two-day monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature was adjourned sine die, Thackeray said, “Covid cases are increasing, but the state government is taking all decisions to bring them under control. We have to admit that the public health issue was neglected in the past, irrespective of the governments. But now we have decided to set up an infectious diseases hospital in all major cities and districts of the state, including Mumbai.”“After slums, fresh cases have started coming from housing societies and buildings. People need to be taught how to live with coronavirus as WHO has made it clear that it is not going soon. For this, awareness has become a necessary step,” said the chief minister.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the doubling rate of Covid-19 is improving and has reached 35 days now. He also said the Centre has withdrawn its support in the fight against Covid-19 by saying that they won’t be able to supply PPE kits, ventilators and masks from September 1.“Now when Covid cases are reaching their peak and require support, the Central government has informed us that they won’t supply ventilators, PPE kits, masks etc. With this decision, the state will have to spend a sum of Rs300 crore a month on procuring all these items to fight Covid-19. We were expecting the ongoing support to continue till this year end. It is unfair to shed responsibility at this point of time,” Tope told the state Assembly on Tuesday.In the past eight days, the state has recorded 150,920 cases. In the first week of September, the state recorded 15,765, 17,433, 18,105, 19,218, 20,489, 23,350 and 16,429 cases respectively. It has also recorded the sharpest single-day spike with 23,350 cases on September 6. The average number of daily new cases has increased to 18,865 .Mumbai recorded 1,346 cases, taking its tally to 158,756. Of these, active cases are 24,560.On June 27, Mumbai reported its highest single day spike with 2,077 cases.City toll stands at 7,942 after 42 deaths reported on Tuesday.Pune city has continued to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,711 cases, taking its tally to 1,16,951, while Nashik city became the second-highest contributor with 1,420 cases, pushing its count to 33,604.Pune district also recorded 1,339 cases and its tally went up to 34,594 cases.Apart from these cities, Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Satara district, Kolhapur district, Raigad district, Jalgaon district, Sangli district and Aurangabad city recorded high number of cases. High number of casualties continues to be a concern for state authorities as it is still the highest in the country.It has reported a total 2,824 deaths in the eight days of this month, which comes to 353 deaths a day on an average. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded 2.9% till Tuesday. A comparison with Gujarat shows the difference between the neighbouring states is left minimal. On Monday, Gujarat’s CFR was 2.96% with 3,120 deaths (105,509 cases), according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Public health expert Sanjay Pattiwar, said delay in hospital admission is a major reason for such a high toll. “We are noticing that people are either not testing even after having symptoms or don’t get admitted on time even if they tested positive and hence waste precious time,” said Pattiwar. He said apart from Mumbai, most areas lack the health infrastructure to cater to such type of serious patients, which has resulted in a high toll in the state.On Tuesday, the state has conducted 83,750 tests and the total number of tests conducted till date are 4,789,682.On the other side, the total number of patients recovered reached 672,556 after 13,234 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.The recovery rate recorded was 71.26%, against the national average of 77.65%.Currently, 38,141 people have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities and 1,557,305 people are home quarantined across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-months-after-maharashtra-s-first-covid-case-tally-943-772-toll-now-27-407/story-6DweZKZsvWXNY7cDUa2szL.html

A DTCP spokesperson on Tuesday said that the department website has been updated for property buyers and owners to submit details after which an NOC will be issued to them.The spokesperson said that in order to bring in greater transparency in issuance of NOCs, required under the Urban Area Act of 1975 for property registration, the department had begun to applications in an online format from September 8. The decision follows the Haryana government decision to make it mandatory for buyers and sellers to obtain NOC from DTCP to prevent illegal registries. “All the details of the seller and buyer will be taken on the online form along with the land details for which the NOC is required. The software application has been launched today and can be accessed from the Department’s portal at https://tcpharyana.gov.in,” said the spokesperson of the town planning department. He further said that the application aims to issue timely NOCs to the applicants. The reform will bring relief to the applicants as the applicants will not be required to submit any hardcopy documents and all approvals will be conveyed online, hence another step towards paperless, faceless governance.He said that eventually, the application will be integrated with the WebHALRIS software used by the revenue department for registrarion and the NOCs issued by the department will reflect in WebHALRIS thus saving the citizens from the hassles of first getting the NOCs issued from the department and then submitting the same in tehsil offices for getting their properties registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-property-owners-can-now-submit-details-online-for-noc/story-zPpHBCBzPcW40k00vfOCyH.html
09-09-2020||Chandigarh||Mohali ISBT: GMADA to claim Rs 89 crore from developer C&C Towers||The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has sought Rs 89 crore from C&C Towers Ltd, developers of the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT Mohali) in Phase-6, Greater Mohali, even as the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) special bench in Chandigarh initiated corporate insolvency resolution process against the firm.A senior GMADA official who did not want to be named, said: “We have sought a claim of Rs 89 crore from the company as the lease/ fine amount,” alleging that “the company has cheated GMADA and allottees of the commercial spaces.” Last year in December, NCLT appointed KPMG International as the resolution professional (RP) to settle the claims of the financial creditors – banks, buyers, public allottees – of C&C Towers Ltd. RPs are appointed as insolvency resolution professionals to manage the resolution and liquidation processes of a corporate debtor. Rs 100 crore investedMore than 472 buyers have invested around Rs 100 crore in commercial properties since 2010 at the Mohali terminal.In 2009 GMADA had signed an agreement with C&C Towers Ltd with the assurance that the project would be completed within 30 months, but deadlines stretched to 11 years and the towers remained unfinished even though the terminus is now partially operational.C&C Constructions is the parent company of C&C Towers Ltd, which was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, in March 2009 as a special purpose vehicle of C&C Constructions for design, engineering, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of the Mohali bus terminal-cum-commercial complex (Mohali Junction) on build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis. This contract was awarded by GMADA.According to Harbhajan Singh Jolly, general secretary of the C&C Mohali Junction Clients Association, “what’s frustrating is that criminal cases have been registered since August 2018 against six persons, including chairman, managing director, other directors and chief general manager, but the police has not taken any action till date. We requested senior police officers for action, but nothing has been done,” he said.The troubled projectThe ambitious busopolis project was launched in 2009 and was to be completed in December 2011. Spread over seven acres, it was to have an inter-state bus terminal, three multi-storey towers with retail and office spaces, multiplex, five-star hotel, banquet hall, hyper markets, and a helipad on top of one tower. But since its inception, the project has been mired in controversies and possession delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-isbt-gmada-to-claim-rs-89-crore-from-developer-c-c-towers/story-XbCLsMp26lQMB0qAEcu37J.html
09-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Three armed men kidnap, rob businessman of cash and gold||Three armed men allegedly kidnapped a businessman from close to his home, took him to a secluded forest area where they robbed him of his cash and gold, and then dropped him back home on Monday night, said the police. When a police team searched the forest area in Behrampur village of sector 71, shortly after the incident was reported, they found at least half the stolen cash, the victim’s wallet and mobile phone there. According to police, the kidnapping happened at around 8pm when the victim, who has a ceramic tile business in Delhi, had returned from work and was about to park his car in a plot adjacent to his house in sector 46. The complainant, in his FIR, said that three masked men alighted from a car, held him at gunpoint and forced him into the car again. “Two of them sat in front of the car, while the third sat on the back passenger seat. “They made me sit on the floor space between the seats. They drove towards Bandhwari village and finally took me deep inside the forest area. They took my two gold rings, a silver chain, gold bangle, my wallet containing driving licence, Aadhaar card, voter card, a mobile phone and ₹10 lakh cash. They had earlier snatched my iPhone and thrown it out. Around 9.30pm, they dropped me at my house in my car and escaped. I immediately called the police and accompanied police teams to the forest area,” the complaint read, adding that during the search, the police recovered his wallet, his mobile phone and ₹5 lakh cash. A passerby, who had found the iPhone on the roadside returned it to him. Surender Singh, station house officer (SHO), sector 50 police station, said, “Prima facie, it appears that it is the handiwork of criminals for loot. The victim has not mentioned any personal enmity with anyone. Several teams rushed to the spot after the incident was reported and we recovered ₹5 lakh cash and the victim’s phone. It is possible that in haste and due to fear of being arrested, the accused men dropped some cash and his phone behind. Teams are working to trace the accused persons. The victim did not suffer injuries during the ordeal” Police said the suspects had arrived in a car and that it was is possible that a fourth suspect had been driving it and waited for the others to finish the job. The suspects are yet to be identified, said police, adding that two crime branch teams were probing the case. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 392 (robbery), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code and section 25/54/59 of The Arms Act at sector 50 police station on Tuesday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-three-armed-men-kidnap-rob-businessman-of-cash-and-gold/story-7BcfyIvSynPqstoTg2279K.html
09-09-2020||Gurugram||Fake call centres in Gurugram under police scanner||In a bid to crackdown against illegal call centres operating in the city in the garb of providing technical support or fake job offers, the station house officers (SHOs) of 40 police stations, across all the zones in the city, have been asked to prepare and submit a list of all the call centres operating within their respective jurisdictions. The SHOs have also been directed to share the details of all the illegal call centres that have been busted in the recent months and the arrests made in those cases. As per the police, the details of the call centres and their work profile would be used to maintain a database and help the police in gathering information regarding the alleged masterminds behind such fake call centres. In the past two years, at least 62 fake call centres have been busted by the police. The move comes after the same set of suspects were found to be involved in multiple cases, said the police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that once the list is prepared, the cyber crime team will check their licences and write to government agencies, such as Department of Telecommunication (DoT), to know how many permissions have been granted for operations across the city. “Once the data has been prepared, the teams will start visiting the establishments and check whether all the necessary documents are in place. Those found violating the rules and regulations will be arrested,” he said. This year, the police have busted seven illegal call centres so far. In the last two years, over 62 such centres have been busted that have allegedly duped over thousands of foreign nationals of English-speaking countries under the garb of providing technical support. The police said, apart from charging the victims exorbitant fees for fixing technical issues, these call centres would also hack into their banking systems and transfer their money into their own accounts. The police said, in most of the cases, the modus operandi is the same: A tele-caller sends emails to unsuspecting victims with fake pop-up messages, stating that a malware has infected their computers and if not rectified immediately, their personal and financial data would be jeopardised. A phone number would be provided, asking users to call on that number. A pop-up would be displayed on a full-screen mode and would lock the user’s screen within a few minutes with messages like “your personal information is not safe” or “your computer has been locked.” Rao said areas such as Udyog Vihar, Cyber City, Sohna Road and DLF phases 2 and 3 house most of these fake call centres. “Udyog Vihar alone has more than 100 operational call centres and 40 were busted from this place itself. The suspects take up a one-room set up on rent and start their operations. More than 100 such establishments have vacated their rented spaces within six months after duping a substantial number of foreign nationals,” he said. Members of industrial associations will be informed to keep the police updated regarding any new set-up so that the police can verify their documents. Also, a list of repeated offenders will be shared with all the police stations, along with pictures of the suspects. “This will help the teams to keep a check on offenders and be aware of their backgrounds. Out of the 62 cases in the past two years, 47 cases were of repeated offenders who were earlier arrested in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad for similar frauds, but were released on bail. We have started this initiative to curb all the scams and frauds taking place in the city,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fake-call-centres-in-gurugram-under-police-scanner/story-tOcKqafYzfeCVPt9T3bIXN.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||No need for prescription for asymptomatic patients to undergo Covid-19 test: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said doctor’s prescriptions will not be required anymore for asymptomatic patients to undergo Covid-19 testing in the national capital, a decision welcomed by the AAP government and diagnostic labs. The only things required would be an Aadhaar card with a Delhi address and an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) form that people who want to be tested need to fill, the court said.Testing without prescriptions will be done on a trial basis initially and 2,000 tests will be allowed for asymptomatic patients every day in the city, the court said. The state government can approach the court for any modification in the directions if it faced any difficulty, the high court said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe AAP government welcomed the order. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement, “We welcome the decision of the Delhi High Court. Earlier today morning, CM Arvind Kejriwal had instructed health minister Satyendar Jain to issue orders to do away with the need for a doctor’s prescription for carrying out a Covid test in Delhi. We encourage more and more people to get tested if they feel they have Corona, so that we can effectively control the spread of the virus in the national capital.”A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad on Tuesday noted there has been a sharp and alarming rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past week. On Tuesday, the Delhi government administered a record 45,797 tests on a day the city registered 3,609 new infections—the highest single-day spike in 76 days, according to the government bulletin.The court also directed the Delhi government to set up testing centres near prominent metro stations for the benefit of commuters. It asked the government to share maps of testing centres with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for display at metro stations for better awareness. The court, hearing a plea filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking ramping up of tests, also told the government to re-strategise its plan to ensure anyone who wanted to get tested was able to do so with any prescription.Welcoming the order, Dr Vandana Lal, executive director of the Lal Pathlabs, said it would ease patients’ problems because nowadays a Covid-19 negative report is necessary even for travelling. She said her lab was well prepared to handle the increased number of tests and would follow all government directives.Dr Deepak Sadwani, head doctor at Prognosis Lab, said people now won’t have to run to a physician to get a prescription for testing.Additional standing counsel Satyakam, appearing for the Delhi government, said the number of RT-PCR tests have been ramped up and mobile testing centres have been set up at inter-state bus terminals and railway stations.A senior government official said testing camps have also been set up at major construction sites, weekly markets and outside major government offices primarily located in the New Delhi Municipal Council area. Appearing for ICMR, central government standing counsel Anurag Alhuwalia told the court that the apex medical body has come out with a fresh advisory and has done away with the need for a prescription for Covid-19 testing.The Delhi government counsel informed the court about an alternative testing method being explored by the government. He said the method has been sent for ICMR for approval even as the medical body (ICMR) said it has not received it yet.The court asked the Delhi government to submit the next sero survey report on the next date of hearing after it was informed by Nutan Mundeja, DGHS, that samples have been collected. The matter will now be heard on September 16.Crowd at trial courtsDuring the proceedings, advocate Alhuwalia raised the issue of setting testing camps at trial courts due to the increased footfall. Advocate Satyakam said all standing counsel of the Delhi government have decided to give a representation, expressing their inability to appear for physical matters in court.Justice Kohli said the courts were opened for physical hearing only because of representations from various bar associations and the legal fraternity.The judge then asked the counsel to give a representation to Chief Justice DN Patel, who during a hearing on Tuesday said his staff members had been affected and the situation was bad.However, the chief justice said that the physical hearings would not stop and would go on .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-need-for-prescription-for-asymptomatic-patients-to-undergo-covid-19-test-delhi-hc/story-1OOcUBXSVX39HaBaaVP4xO.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Soon, enjoy al fresco dining at south Delhi restaurants||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday approved a proposal to allow open-air dining on rooftops and lawns of South Delhi restaurants. The proposal will now be tabled in the House meeting later this month for a final approval.The proposal was drafted after representatives of National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) had approached the civic body in June with a request to allow al fresco dining, citing huge losses due to the pandemic. “We have passed the policy to allow open-air dining at restaurants. The proposal will now be sent to the House meeting of the SDMC to get a final approval before being implemented. There should be adequate checks in place so that traders do not misuse the move,” a member of the SDMC standing committee said.According to the policy, the SDMC will allow open-air dining at restaurants under its jurisdiction with certain riders. The draft policy says that open-air dining will be allowed only at those restaurants where open areas or terrace are privately owned, which means that there should be no encroachments on public land or footpaths. The open space should not have a direct opening to the main road.The open-air dining policy does not allow cooking of food or barbecue in the open space. “Open spaces/terrace abutting licensed eating houses only will be allowed to be used as a service area. The food should be cooked in closed kitchens and only serving of food would be allowed open air. Liquor serving will only be permitted at licensed terraces and the restaurant owners will have to install view cutters and high parapet grilles to ensure that there is no inconvenience to other passersby,” the draft policy said.A senior SDMC official said that open-air dining practices are already in place in major metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and in many foreign countries as well.There are nearly 2,000 restaurants and eateries in south Delhi. But, under the new policy, only those restaurants that already have a health trade licence, structural safety certificate and a no-ojection certificate from the fire department would be allowed to have al fresco seating. The official said to avail of the benefit of the policy, traders will have to pay a licence fee to the civic body. “The fee would be ₹100 per square foot for normal restaurants and ₹200 per square foot for a star-rated (four-star and above) dining restaurants and hotels. This fee will be renewed every year. With this move, we are expecting to earn a revenue of ₹5 crore per annum, post-Covid,” the official said, requesting anonymity.The draft policy also says that light music can be played in the open-air seating area but it should not be beyond the permissible decibel levels. “Live band performance will not be allowed under this arrangement,” the policy states.Manpreet Singh, treasurer, NRAI, said allowing restaurants to serve food in privately owned open areas is very much relevant during Covid-19 scenarios as it would pose a lower risk of the virus spreading, when compared to closed rooms with air-conditioning.He said there are many restaurants with open space available in markets such as Hauz Khas Village, Rajouri Garden, and Safdarjung Enclave, among others. “Internationally as well as in many Indian cities, you see people dining al fresco, but in Delhi, that was not allowed. Approval of open-air dining is a very positive step and it will go long way in helping restauranteurs recoup their business, which is down by over 70% as compared to the same period last year. We are hoping that other corporations such as the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (overseeing Lutyens Delhi) will follow suit,” Singh said.Vijay Israni, vice-president, Green Park Market Association, said approval for open-air dining will come as a breather for the industry, which is facing huge losses owing to the lockdown and the low footfall on account of Covid-19.“It is a welcome move. There are a number of restaurants in Green Park market where open space is available and guests these days insist on sitting in open areas. But we were not able to serve them food in open spaces as that was not allowed. With such a policy in place, we may see a rise in footfall and the move will also be beneficial to guests as well,” Israni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/soon-enjoy-al-fresco-dining-at-south-delhi-restaurants/story-n5ZdeipJVhtNsZ7w3MM7UK.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s Blue, Pink lines open; Red, Green and Violet to function from Thurs||The Delhi Metro will resume services on two more of its lines from Wednesday, improving travel options for commuters across the city. From 7am Wednesday, trains will start running on the 65.35km Blue Line, connecting Dwarka Sector 21 and Vaishali/Noida Electronic City, and on the 57.58km Pink Line, connecting Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar. The Delhi Metro had from Monday resumed services in a graded manner after a gap of 169 days. The first line to be opened was the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli to Huda City Centre) and the Rapid Metro in Gurugram. On Wednesday, too, services will be available to passengers in two shift timings -- from 7am to 11am and from 4pm to 8pm. Entry and exit will be restricted at stations, and commuters can check which gates will remain open on the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation website, www.delhimetrorail.com.“As part of the stage one graded resumption of Metro services, the Delhi Metro will resume operations on Blue and Pink lines. Along with these two lines, the Yellow Line and the Rapid Metro, which had already opened on Monday, will continue operations,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Also read: Delhi Metro ridership picks up on Yellow Line on Day 2The services on the Red Line (Rithala to Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda), Green Line (Kirti Nagar/Inderlok to Bahadurgarh) and the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Ballabhgarh) will resume from Thursday. From Friday, the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden) and Grey Line (Dwarka to Najafgarh) will be thrown open and, finally, on Saturday, the Airport Express Line will be thrown open. By Saturday, the Metro timings will be back to the pre-lockdown schedules of 6am to 11pm. Anticipating the opening of the two lines, final preparations were undertaken on Tuesday at all stations falling on these corridors. DMRC teams were seen disinfecting floors and common touchpoints such as staircase railings, automatic fare collection (AFC) gates and ticket counters. Station staff were also asked to ensure that floor markings are placed so that crowding does not take place on the station premises. The Delhi Metro will be running 66 trains on the Blue Line, which will make 478 trips during the morning and evening hours. Pink Line will have 27 trains making 228 trips from Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar Pocket 1, and 13 trains making 291 trips between Trilokpuri and Shiv Vihar. The opening of the Blue and Pink lines on Wednesday will enable interchange facilities at 28 Metro stations. Commuters will now be able to switch lines from Rajouri Garden (Blue and Pink), INA Delhi Haat (Yellow and Pink), Mayur Vihar phase-1 (Blue and Pink), Rajiv Chowk (Yellow and Blue), Yamuna Bank (Blue, between Vaishali and Noida Electronic Centre sections) and Anand Vihar ISBT (Blue and Pink), among others. That would, however, mean that the DMRC will be staring at a bigger challenge of managing crowds at stations and on trains. Sewa Ram, professor, School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, said from Wednesday, more passengers will queue up to use the Metro and the agency should be prepared to handle the load. “Till Tuesday, only one line was operational. With more lines being opened, the load on the Yellow Line will also go up because interchange facilities will be available now. They can consider having queuing areas outside stations for crowd control. This would give people a safe space to wait as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-blue-and-pink-lines-open-wednesday-red-green-and-violet-from-thursday/story-kkEBf8wmdNtLvgPyBNHCOO.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Bars, restaurants prepare to serve liquor, fix rules for patrons||After a five-month ban as part of the restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, bars, restaurants, hotels, and clubs in Delhi will start serving liquor to dine-in customers from Wednesday. Wary that the permission to serve alcoholic beverages has been granted only on a trial basis till September 30, hotels, bars and restaurants put in place strict Covid-19 protocols, ranging from allowing only 4-5 members in a group to discontinuing live band performances.Restro-bars remained shut in Delhi because serving liquor was not permitted in the city. On September 3, the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal approved the sale of alcoholic beverages to dine-in customers from September 9.Restaurateur Dinesh Arora kept his ‘Unplugged Courtyard’ outlets in Delhi and Gurugram shut despite the Unlock 3 guidelines issued on July 29, allowing dine-in services. “The concepts of my restaurants are totally liquor-based. So, opening just to serve food was not a feasible idea for us. Thankfully, we are opening all our outlets in full swing and with all precautions from Wednesday,” said Arora.Arora, who is also the president of Delhi restaurants and club association, said for the first 10 days all owners will be physically present at their key outlets to ensure that safety protocols are followed. “We do not want to take any risk since it is a trial phase and defaulting on any rule could result in sealing of the entire outlet. So, almost all restaurant and bar owners in Delhi will themselves be present during working hours. We do not want a repeat of a Murthal here in Delhi,” he said.At least 100 persons, including 84 employees of a restaurant in Murthal, Haryana tested Covid-19. Government authorities said the hotel management had flouted social distancing norms. The Delhi government’s excise department said strict action would be taken against the owner and manager of the said facility if they violate rules. “Besides, it will also lead to sealing of the premises and cancellation of the excise licence,” an official said.Starting Wednesday, excise officials will conduct surprise checks at restaurants, bars, hotels and clubs.“Customers are allowed only up to 50% of the seating capacity to ensure adherence to social distancing norms. No standing customer is to be served. Only asymptomatic guests and staff are allowed. For entry, wearing masks, thermal screening and hand sanitisation is mandatory,” said a senior excise official on condition of anonymity.Restaurateur Priyank Sukhija, owner of brands such as Tamasha, Lord of the Drinks, Warehouse Café and Teddy Boy said he is doing away with all seating arrangements along the bar counter for now. “Live performances will also not happen for a while since usually people tend to stand up and dance. The number of guests will also be limited to maximum 4-5 per table with adequate distancing in place. My outlets in Bengaluru and Kolkata have already seen a recovery of almost 60% of the demand during pre-Covid times in over a week’s time. I hope, we will break-even in Delhi in a month or so,” said Sukhija.The Park said they are keeping their bar counters open and have already started taking bookings for parties, including for their pool-side facility. “.. Our poolside facility is available, but using the pool is not allowed. Parties are already getting booked for this month as well as the upcoming months. Our teams are well prepared... Safety and well-being of our guests and associates is of utmost importance to us. All guests are required to wear a face mask and undergo mandatory thermal screening,” said Rohit Arora, area general manager, THE Park New Delhi.The hotel has also installed AV (audio-visual) media and posters at various points in the hotel about the preventive measures to be followed. “Formation of queues is prohibited and strict social distancing measures are taken,” the hotel said in a statement.At clubs like the India International Centre (IIC), the number of tables and chairs has been reduced to half in the bar. Kanwal Wali, secretary of IIC, said Arogya Setu app will be mandatory for all guests besides the usual Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bars-restaurants-prepare-to-serve-liquor-fix-rules-for-patrons/story-uBGasxUi8dNSdHbu3QlvnM.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro ridership picks up on Yellow Line on Day 2||Passenger ridership picked up slightly on the second day of operations of Delhi Metro’s Yellow line and the Rapid Metro line in Gurugram . On Tuesday, the total ridership on the Yellow Line (Huda City Centre-Samaypur Badli) till 8 pm was 17,600. On Monday, the first day after the resumption of operations after a five-month hiatus, the footfall on the line was around 15,500.  Approximately 1,200 smart cards were sold.In the first half of operations, between 7 am and 11 am, ridership on the corridor was nearly 8,300, up from the 7,500 passengers who used the service on Monday. In the second half, around 9,300 passengers used the metro to travel. The figure was around 8,000 the previous day. “There was a slight increase in ridership on the Yellow Line on the second day, but all precautions were in place and everything went on smoothly,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Suresh Singh Rana, 62, who travelled from Central Secretariat to Model Town in the evening hours on Tuesday, said there were long queues at the entrance of stations as passengers were thoroughly sanitised before entry, but the overall process was convenient. “The queue seemed longer because people were maintaining social distancing and leaving ample space while waiting for their turn to get in. I had used the metro yesterday (Monday) as well and there were surely more people there today (Tuesday). But the trains still had space to accommodate the passengers,” Rana said. Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi metro) Jitender Mani said no untoward incident or violations were reported since the resumption of service. “It is because the footfall is low and our men are deployed in good numbers to assist people at every point. Gradually, as more lines become operational, our strength will decrease as it gets distributed among all other stations. We will, however, continue to keep a tight watch to maintain law and order and ensure smooth functioning of the Delhi Metro,” Mani said. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Delhi Metro Rail Police (a Delhi police unit) and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss their preparedness for the reopening of the Pink and Blue lines on Wednesday, taking lessons from the two-day operations on the Yellow Line. From 7am Wednesday, trains will start running on the 65.35km Blue Line, connecting Dwarka Sector 21 and Vaishali/Noida Electronic City, and on the 57.58km Pink Line, connecting Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar. A senior CISF official said there were some learning points, which have been adopted. “The door frame metal detector (DFMD) and frisking points were too close, which led to improper detection by the DFMD. We have moved the frisking point a little forward. Officials using the long bar specially modified for hand-held metal detectors are complaining of too much pressure on their wrist and uneasiness. We are also looking for a modification to that,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-metro-ridership-picks-up-on-yellow-line-on-day-2/story-FmG6LV9Gs0JfHezUGjHjCP.html

No exact reason for the killing has been mentioned in the FIR lodged by Kamlesh, brother of the deceased. But, three including Rajan, Sahul Jadaun and Shivji Gaur have been named in the case,” said Bhanu Pratap Singh, incharge, Kotwali police station, Mainpuri.“Efforts are on to nab the named accused and other unidentified people involved in the incident,” Singh added.As per reports, Sarvesh’s wife along with their two children had gone to her parents in West Bengal during Raksha Bandhan and was there at the time of the incident.However, their 16-year-old daughter stayed with her father. About a week ago, Sarvesh took her daughter to his sister living in Noida. Leaving her there, he returned to Mainpuri. However, some villagers spread the canard that he had ‘sold’ his daughter.“Sarvesh’s daughter has returned to Mainpuri and says she was away for studying. Such rumours about her being sold are baseless,” said the incharge, Kotwali police station, Mainpuri.There are also speculations that Sarvesh had taken money from many people during the lockdown and this could be a reason for the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-beaten-to-death-over-selling-daughter-in-mainpuri/story-8W1R81pfpdD6FJr4xKkIXN.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Veggie vendors, locals oppose curbs imposed by south Delhi RWA, file police complaint||A resident of South Delhi’s Navjivan Vihar and two vegetable vendors have filed a police complaint against the local resident welfare association (RWA) for stopping vendors from running their business inside the residential neighbourhood during lockdown and even after the unlock process started.In the complaint filed on September 3 at the Malviya Nagar police station, the hawkers said the RWA charges them Rs 1,200 annually for vending in the area. The vendors were allowed to do business in the locality in August.The complaint filed by a resident of the locality, along with written statements of the vendors, says the act of the RWA “infringes with the fundamental freedom under the Indian Constitution, under Article 19(1)G—the freedom to practice any trade, profession, or occupation--of the vendors”.In their written statement, Ramesh and Mukesh Kumar, the vendors, said they were not allowed to sell vegetables inside the colony while suppliers to the local vegetable shop and others were not barred from entering it.Speaking to HT on the phone, Mukesh said, “We have been paying Rs 1,200 annually for years to the RWAs as charges to sell vegetables in the area. This year we didn’t pay anything. We filed the complaint after we got support from some residents, also so that it doesn’t happen to us again.”Ramesh said, “I have been selling vegetables here for years. We were not allowed but domestic helps, drivers, etc., were given entry. We were not allowed to enter the colony even after the government’s order.”Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjivan Vihar RWA, said, “Initially, we stationed them at the colony gates. The idea was to minimise movement to control Covid-19. We have an in-house Safal (vegetable) store but we did not want these vendors to suffer. So we didn’t stop people from buying stuff from them. In fact, residents placed orders on the phone to them and our guards used to deliver their (vendors’) goods. After the government’s order in July, we allowed them to get back to work.”Atul Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South), said. “The RWA members are being spoken to and the matter is being verified for appropriate action.”Social scientist Manisha Priyam, a resident of Navijivan Vihar, who helped the vendors, said the RWA’s decision was an attack on the livelihood of poor people. “What part of the unlock order barred any street vendors from sitting on public streets? There could have been reasonable restrictions on them, they could have sat at one place near the colony market, which was operating and fully functional.” “Under the Sodan Singh versus SDMC judgment, street vending is a fundamental right under Article 19.1.G. What power does RWA have to usurp fundamental rights of citizens, specifically weak and vulnerable?” she said.Vinod Arora, former president of the society, and many others opposed the RWA decision. Arora said, “I have been against the idea of charging vendors. But we couldn’t discontinue it as residents wanted it.”Those working for the rights of street vendors and urban poor are also against RWAs charging vendors.Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters, who spoke to the two vendors said, “Who are RWAs to charge vendors for working in their locality? The colony roads are public land and everyone has equal rights over it. This is nothing but harassment of urban poor.” Makhija, who joined the office in 2017, said several other RWAs charge vendors. Makhija said, “The practice of charging Rs 100 a month (Rs 1,200 annually) from vendors has been on for the past 7-8 years. As per the executive committee decision, with this Rs 100, we provide them with cloth bags and discourage them from using plastic…But this year due to the crisis, we didn’t charge them at all as they too are going through a financial crisis.”RWAs in the city are divided over the charge. Some say it is “illegal”, while others say they have been doing a lot of work outside their mandate such as security, maintenance of parks, etc.Rajiv Kakria, member of E Block GK-I RWA said, “We introduced vendor passes 15 years ago and it worked wonders in maintaining discipline, etc. The token amount we collect is for expenses incurred in the verification process etc...RWAs are performing duties way beyond their mandate and have to figure out ways to stay afloat financially.”But Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs in Delhi, said, “We don’t approve of such charges taken by RWAs, as there are no rules which empower them to do so. There is no doubt RWAs do a lot of work but we don’t have powers to charge vendors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/veggie-vendors-locals-oppose-curbs-annual-vending-charge-imposed-by-south-delhi-rwa/story-XrIYTMlE31qrElpUdGuRNO.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||86-year-old raped by plumber in Delhi, man arrested from spot||An 86-year-old woman was raped and assaulted, allegedly by a 37-year-old plumber, after he offered her a ride on his motorcycle and took her to a farm in an isolated area in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla on Monday evening.The man was nabbed from the scene of crime after locals, alerted by the screams of the woman, rushed to help, police said on Tuesday. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said, “The plumber was immediately nabbed and a case was registered at the Chhawla police station.” On Tuesday, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal met the elderly woman and said she had several injuries and bruises on her body. “The woman was found bleeding profusely and in extreme trauma. We will help the family in further legal proceedings in the matter,” said Maliwal. The DCW in its statement said that the elderly woman (who the commission says is 90 years old) told them that on Monday around 5pm, she was waiting for the milkman when the plumber arrived at her house and told her that the regular delivery guy would not be able to make it. The man told her that he could take her to a nearby area from where she could purchase milk. “...he then took the elderly woman to a nearby farm and raped her, ignoring her repeated pleas that she was of his grandmother’s age. The suspect also assaulted her brutally, when she tried to resist and protect herself...Later, local villagers passing by the area heard her scream and ran to help her. The locals caught hold of him and called the police...,” the DCW said in the statement. Police, on the other hand, said that the woman, in her statement, had told them that she was a little distance away from the village, when the plumber saw her and offered her a lift on his motorcycle. “The man then took the woman to a farm in a secluded place, which is nearly 2km away from her home, and forced himself on her. He also assaulted her. Prima facie, it appears that he does not have a criminal record. We are still verifying the allegations. He hails from another village in Chhawla,” said a senior police officer. A DCW member, who did not wish to be named, said that the woman had been admitted to a government hospital where she was medically examined, given treatment, and discharged on Tuesday morning. “A team of counsellors has been with her since Monday. The woman lives with her son and daughter-in-law, who were not present at home at the time of the incident,” the DCW member said. DCW chief Maliwal added, “From a six-month-old girl to a 90-year-old woman, no one is safe in Delhi. The kind of trauma this woman had to face clearly indicates that the perpetrators of these crimes are not humans. I met the woman today. She is extremely courageous and we will ensure that she gets justice. This case needs to be fast-tracked and justice delivered within 6 months.” The elderly woman’s statement was recorded by a magistrate, which is now admissible evidence against the 37-year-old suspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/86-year-old-raped-by-plumber-in-chhawla-man-arrested-from-spot/story-SnKBjwKMRjj74ASsqEPugI.html
09-09-2020||Pune||Pune admin predicts 2.30 lakh Covid cases by Sept 14; shortage of 1,984 oxygen beds, 348 ventilators||With Pune’s Covid-19 curve refusing to flatten, the civic administration has revised its projection for next week with the positive progressive tally predicted to reach 2,30,194 and deaths touching 5,610 in the district by September 14. The projection showcases a rise of at least 27,000 cases in eight days as the Pune district tally stood at 2,03,468 with the death toll at 4,477 as of Tuesday. This may leave the administration staring at a shortage of 1,984 oxygen beds, 145 ICU beds and 348 ventilators, as per the projection by the district authorities. As per officials, Pune district’s doubling rate has reached 32 days and the death percentage of the district has increased to 2.30 per cent. “We have prepared the prediction for the forthcoming days about the Covid situation in Pune district as well as for Pune division and will accordingly start micro-planning. Even though there is a growing gap between the number of rising cases and the number of beds, we are 100 per cent sure of bridging the gap,” said Pune Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao. With the surge in number of cases, the administration has increased its testing. In the last four to five days, the number of tests and along with positive cases has increased in the district, said Rao. Pune city is reporting an average of 2,000 cases every day over the past four days and Pimpri-Chinchwad is recording at least 1,000 cases daily, especially in rural parts the spread of the virus is concentrated in certain villages, said civic officials. “Around 80 per cent of patients are coming from 62% gram panchayats. So, we have a focused approach of creating public awareness in these areas,” said Rao. One of the major contributing factors to the bed shortage is that around 30 per cent of critical patients are coming to Pune from neighbouring districts. “It is a matter of concern for us. So, we are working on increasing the facilities in districts such as Kolhapur, Solapur and Satara. As far as oxygen supply is concerned, officials have been appointed at all the 11 oxygen-producing plants in Pune district to look after the production and distribution,” said Rao. To deal with manpower shortage, the government has now taken a call to absorb medical students who have appeared for the exam. “Today, I have sent a letter to the municipal secretary, medical education, in which I have requested him that all the post graduate students who have appeared for their exams and are right now free from academic pressure, should be allowed to work as trained doctors in the civic body’s Covid-19 programme,” said Rao.These students, according to Rao, will be duly compensated and additionally this service for Covid will be deducted from their bond duration. Secretary medical education has agreed that the state government will actively consider this proposal.“This would be an official channel through which we could get some manpower and in Pune district we have got 600 postgraduate medical students,” Rao added. Projected figures as on Sept 14 by the Pune district administration Total number of progressive positive cases – 2,30,194 Total number of recoveries – 1,72,311 Total number of deaths – 5,610 Total number of active cases – 52,272 Predicted deficit in infra on Sept 14 Isolation beds without O2 : 198 Oxygen supported beds : -1,984 Total number of ICU beds : 145 Number of ventilator beds : -348||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-admin-predicts-2-30-lakh-covid-cases-by-sept-14-shortage-of-1-984-oxygen-beds-348-ventilators/story-SXGT7MYM2NPh2KiyjFaYpK.html
09-09-2020||Pune||Barricading, restrictions in containment zones irk Pune residents||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) announced new containment zones on Sunday to curtail the spread of the Covid-19 infection. However, the action has invited ire of local residents who allege that stepping out to buy essentials and seek medical attention has also become difficult in the sealed areas due to the tin sheet barricades. As of September 8, PMC has 74 micro-containment zones with Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward with the highest number of sealed areas at 11.In Dhankavdi, eight containment zones have been created from the earlier six and in Sahakarnagar, the number has gone up from two to three. Residents of Balajinagar allege that despite being under strict restrictions in the containment zones, the number of Covid-19 cases in the area is only increasing. “What is the use of sealing the area and barricading it, when it has failed to arrest the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. The barricades causing inconvenience to senior citizens, women and other members of the society who want to step out of the area in case of emergencies. More awareness and self discipline must be cultivated rather than resorting to barricading,” Santosh Alhat, a resident said. PMC staff had been distributing essential items at places where there was total lockdown and shops were closed. Now, however, residents are allowed to buy essentials like grocery and vegetables for a limited period. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “The restrictions in containment zones are essential to prevent the spread of the infection and as far as barricading is concerned, we will find out more in details and ensure that the inconvenience faced by citizens is reduced. All necessary essentials will be made available to them.”Meawhile, Hadapsar residents have also aired their complaints about barricading in the area by the PMC. Residents of Bhekrainagar are particularly affected by the tin barricades in Dhamalwadi and Tukaridarshan area. The residents questioned the PMC’s move and said that it was causing inconvenience to them. “We have not understood the logic of barricading the area and how it helps in arresting the spread of the virus. Water supply to our area by tankers is getting affected due to the barricades,” said Maruti Dhamale. Bhekrainagar, Ganganagar, Dhamalwadi, Papadewasti and Tukaidarshan areas are dependent on water tanker supply for water and the connecting road has been currently barricaded. Similarly in Kondhwa –Yeolewadi belt, the number of containment zones have gone up to three from the existing two and restrictions have been put in place to prevent the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/barricading-restrictions-in-containment-zones-irk-residents/story-YwTa0dABr1u40iPXX6SB5J.html
09-09-2020||Delhi||Govt, civic body begins removing concrete around trees in Old Delhi||A tall peepal tree, believed to be more than 100 years old, stands within a house behind Jagat Cinema near Jama Masjid in the Walled City. One of its branches has been cut and a and a portion of its trunk has been concretised to accommodate the construction around it. It is one of the 24 old and full-grown trees in the densely populated Old Delhi, which are being restored by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Delhi government’s forest department on directions of the Delhi High Court. While some of these trees have permanent or semi-permanent structures around their trunks, damaging their roots, others have been heavily pruned over the years. A team of officials from the corporation and the forest department had conducted a joint survey of the area last month and started removing the concrete around them. Sixty-seven-year-old Omwati, the oldest resident of the three-storey house which has come up around the peepal, said the tree has been a saviour for the three generations that have lived there. “We believe that it has protected us from all evil. In 1970, a huge branch that was spreading up to the next building was cut by its owner, as it was coming in between the construction he was doing. Its branches would provide shade to the entire house and had to be pruned several times over the years for sunlight to pass through,” said Omwati. Omwati said she was 13 when she came to the house after her marriage and the tree had been there ever since. “A few days ago some officials had come to inspect the tree and said that they would put a number on it in order to save it from further damage,” she said. According to a senior forest official, who did not wish to be named, said, “In case of this tree, de-concretisation cannot be done, as it is too close to the foundation of the old house and also there is lack of space, which may pose a danger to the building.” Deputy conservator of forests (DCF-North) Aditya Madanpotra said a number of trees that had grown inside the house or a wall, de-concretisation could not be carried out because of limited space and potential danger to the building. “In rest of the trees where religious structures have come up around tree trunks, the matter has been referred to the Delhi government’s religious committee for action as per norms. Besides, around other trees, the cemented boundaries have been broken allowing them space to breathe and water to seep into their roots,” he said. He added that since most of these 24 trees are peepal or neem, which regenerate fast, the root system has been preserved. “We will keep monitoring them and in case any further encroachment is reported, we will put up tree guards around them,” said Madanpotra. As per an affidavit filed by the North Corporation in the Delhi High Court on September 2, at least eight of the 24 trees have religious structures around their trunks in Chandni Chowk municipal ward. Also, the tree branches are wrapped in a web of wires and cables in most places. The corporation submitted the affidavit listing the old trees in Dariba Kalan, Urdu Bazar, Jama Masjid, Jagat Cinema area and Kinari Bazar, among others on the court’s directions which came during a hearing in a plea to restore an approximately 300-year-old banyan tree in Nai Sadak area of Chandni Chowk. On August 6, Nai Sadak resident Nitin Gupta had filed a plea about unauthorised construction that was damaging the tree. At Kinari Bazar’s, Gali Peepal Wali, locals said the street got its name from the old peepal tree there. “The tree has been here for at least the three generations that I have seen. A team of officials had visited the site some days ago and broke down some structures that had come up around the tree,” said Hazari Lal, 73, who owns a decorative items shop nearby. At Cycle Market near Dariba Kalan, another peepal tree, almost five-storey tall, had cement around its trunk, as a temple had come upon it. “I have been seeing this tree since at least 1983 when I started working here. The religious structure had been there since,” said Rajeev Khurana, who owns a shop in the compound. At least five trees on the Netaji Subhash Marg and Urdu Bazar Road fall under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department (PWD) and de-concretisation has been carried out here. The roots of the tree on Urdu Bazar Road lay covered with fresh mud. A senior official from the North Corporation said, “We have removed concrete from tree trunks in most of the cases except for those which had religious structures and a few others, which had grown into walls and houses, that could threaten the building’s foundation. We are waiting for the response of the government’s religious committee to take further action,” the official said, who did not wish to be named. PWD officials said de-concretisation of trees under its jurisdiction has already been done. A Delhi government spokesperson did not offer any specific comment. CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said there are several trees in Old Delhi area have been concretised over the years. “The trees do stand tall because of their roots being deep into the ground, but these trees are not healthy at all. They are just surviving with a thin canopy. All trees have two kinds of roots --- deep in ground and another that are close to the surface. Concretisation damages the roots close to the surface, which play a crucial role in maintaining plant health by absorbing moisture and helping in uptake of nutrients. The root system can regenerate if concrete is removed,” said Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-civic-body-begins-removing-concrete-around-trees-in-old-delhi/story-OBc8EHisyaY9eCV9h9ESeJ.html
09-09-2020||World||Teenagers’ e-cigarette use declined in 2020, US survey shows||Teen e-cigarette use declined this year, according to results from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, marking a positive trend that health officials say still leaves the number of users too high.In 2020, 19.6% of high-school students and 4.7% of middle-school students said they vaped, according to the survey co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Those numbers represent declines from last year’s highs, when more than a quarter of high-school students and about 1 out of 10 middle-school students reported using e-cigarettes.“Although the decline in e-cigarette use among our nation’s youth is a notable public health achievement, our work is far from over,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement. About 3.6 million youths reported using e-cigarettes within the prior 30 days, down from 5.4 million in the 2019 survey.The influential survey has shaped the debate around e-cigarettes in recent years. While billed as a possibly less harmful alternative for the millions of adults who smoke cigarettes, the high rate of teen vaping has cast doubt on whether the products should be available at all.The FDA will soon determine which e-cigarettes can stay on the US market and which must come off. Wednesday is the deadline for applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenagers-e-cigarette-use-declined-in-2020-us-survey-shows/story-rByAqKX5cYghuqXQFXnoxM.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump told Bob Woodward he intentionally downplayed coronavirus risks||President Donald Trump told journalist Bob Woodward that he intentionally downplayed the severity of the coronavirus in public comments to avoid triggering a panic.“I wanted to always play it down, I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,” Trump told Woodward, the author and associate editor for the Washington Post, on March 19 in one of a series of interviews for his book, “Rage,” due for publication this month. CNN published audio recordings of excerpts of the conversations on Wednesday.Trump told Woodward on February 7 that the virus was transmitted through the air -- even as Trump said publicly it was no worse than the seasonal flu and would quickly go away.“It goes through air, Bob, that’s always tougher than the touch,” he said. “The air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”He also told Woodward it was more deadly “than even your strenuous flus.”That same day, Trump had tweeted praise for Chinese president Xi Jinping for his handling of the pandemic.Woodward’s book says Trump was warned by National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien in an Jan. 28 meeting that the virus “will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” according to a Washington Post report on the book.“This is going to be the roughest thing you face,” O’Brien said, according to Woodward, who wrote that Trump’s head popped up at the dire warning. Trump told Woodward in May that he didn’t remember being told that.Trump restricted travel from China shortly after. “The risk of infection for Americans remains low,” his health secretary, Alex Azar, said on Jan. 31.The book is based on 18 interviews that Trump gave Woodward between December and July, the Post reported. It also is based on background conversations with officials and other sources.The book comes as Trump trails Democrat Joe Biden in polls, with surveys showing Americans are displeased with Trump’s handling with the virus. Trump has sought to shift blame over the pandemic, which has killed more than 189,000 Americans, regularly calling it the “China Virus.”On Wednesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump never lied or mislead the public. “We want to keep the country calm, that’s what leaders do,” McEnany told reporters at the White House. “The president never downplayed the virus.”Woodward reports that top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said the White House has “rudderless” leadership, and criticized Trump.“His attention span is like a minus number,” Fauci said, according to the Post’s account of Woodward’s book. “His sole purpose is to get re-elected.”On Wednesday, McEnany quoted Fauci praising Trump over the virus. “There’s a litany of praise,” McEnany said.The book said Trump’s former Defense Secretary James Mattis referred to the president as having “no moral compass” and that he is “unfit” for office.According to the Post account of the book, former intelligence director Dan Coats told Mattis that, to Trump, “a lie is not a lie. It’s just what he thinks.”Trump also criticized top military leaders, according to the Post account of the book.“Not to mention my f-----g generals are a bunch of p-----s. They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals,” Trump told one adviser, according to the Post account.Trump has been under fire for a week after a report by the The Atlantic that he made disparaging comments about American Marines killed in World War I and questioned the value of military service. The White House has disputed parts of that report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-told-bob-woodward-he-intentionally-downplayed-coronavirus-risks/story-TpG7JyjhsAxuvPXd6zxPxM.html
09-09-2020||World||In pictures: Explosive wildfires across California stoked by fierce winds||Wildfires raged unchecked across parts of the western U.S. on Wednesday amid gusty and dry conditions, but forecasters said some weather relief was in sight that could help firefighters overwhelmed by the blazes.In California, winds stoked unprecedented numbers of fires that have forced rescues and evacuations. In Washington, more acres burned in a single day than firefighters usually see all year. Fires also forced people to flee in Oregon and Idaho.A temperature plunge of as much as 60 degrees (15 Celsius), caused by a dramatic intrusion of polar air, helped slow wildfires that spread in Colorado and Montana.“The significantly colder airmass is helping reduce critical fire conditions across the West, however most of West coastline and adjacent counties have Red Flag warnings in effect for part of today,” the National Weather Service said. A warning is issued when conditions combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger.Diminishing winds were possible by Thursday, “bringing some relief to the ongoing fires and fire weather threat,” forecasters said.A massive cloud of smoke covered much of California on Wednesday, dimming the sun to an eerie orange glow over San Francisco.About 125 miles (200 kilometers) to the northeast, winds fanned a huge fire in the Sierra Nevada foothills and forced authorities to order early morning evacuations and warn other residents to be ready to leave.The area is not far from the town of Paradise, where 85 people were killed by a fire two years ago, and Oroville Dam, where failing spillways forced a massive evacuation in 2017.On Tuesday, flames overtook 14 firefighters who had to delploy last-resort emergency shelters and destroyed a fire station in Los Padres National Forest on California’s central coast. They suffered burns and smoke inhalation, and three were flown to a hospital in Fresno, where one was in critical condition, the U.S. Forest Service said.Helicopters have been used in recent days to rescue hundreds of people stranded in the burning Sierra National Forest, where a fire has destroyed 365 buildings, including at least 45 homes. About 5,000 buildings were threatened, fire officials said.Flames threatened the foothill community of Auberry between Shaver Lake and Fresno.In Southern California, fires burned in the mountains of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties, with the potential for the region’s notorious Santa Ana winds to push flames out of wilderness and into communities.People in a half-dozen foothill communities east of Los Angeles were being told to stay alert because of a fire in the Angeles National Forest.“The combination of gusty winds, very dry air, and dry vegetation will create critical fire danger,” the National Weather Service warned.The U.S. Forest Service on Monday closed all eight national forests in the southern half of the state and shutter campgrounds statewide.More than 14,000 firefighters are battling fires in California Two of the three largest blazes in state history are burning in the San Francisco Bay Area, though they are largely contained after burning for three weeks.The state has set a record with nearly 2.3 million acres (930,800 hectares) burned this year and the worst part of the wildfire season is only beginning.“It’s extraordinary, the challenge that we’ve faced so far this season,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said.The threat of winds tearing down power lines or hurling debris into them and sparking a wildfire prompted Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest utility, to shut off power to 172,000 customers in Northern California. More outages were expected Wednesday, with power not expected to be completely restored until Wednesday night.The Southern California Edison utility warned that about 55,000 customer accounts may lose power while San Diego Gas & Electric said 16,700 customers were at risk of a preemptive outage.In the Sierra National Forest east of Fresno, dozens of campers and hikers were stranded at the Vermilion Valley Resort after the only road in — a narrow route snaking along a steep cliff — was closed Sunday because of the so-called Creek Fire.“This is emblematic of how fast that fire was moving, plus the physical geography of that environment with one road in and one road out,” said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College, said of the helicopter rescues. “Unless you wanted an absolute human disaster, you had to move fast.”Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires to global warming. “The frequency of extreme wild fire weather has doubled in California over the past four decades, with the main driver being the effect of rising temperature on dry fuels, meaning that the fuel loads are now frequently at record or near-record levels when ignition occurs and when strong winds blow,” Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pictures-explosive-wildfires-across-california-stoked-by-fierce-winds/story-kY4TcWslm7N0OPlwEejGbI.html

09-09-2020||World||Missing Pak official who ‘helped’ in report on PM’s aide reappears||A Pakistani government official, who is suspected to have helped journalists in writing a story about the rise to riches of a top general and key aide to Prime Minister Imran Khan, has returned home after unknown abductors freed him on the outskirts of Islamabad, officials and the man said.Sajid Gondal, a joint director at Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, returned home on Tuesday evening, five days after he went missing.According to his colleagues, Gondal, a former reporter with Dawn newspaper, was investigating Lt Gen (retd) Saleem Bajwa, the chairman of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority and information aide to Prime Minister Khan.Bajwa resigned last week as special assistant to the prime minister on information and broadcasting, but Khan rejected the resignation. Bajwa’s move came after a report alleged that he had used his offices to help his family set up several offshore businesses. Bajwa, who also served as Commander of the Southern Command, rejected the allegations, and said he would continue to head CPEC Authority. It was unclear who held Gondal for five days, though his family and friends speculated he was in the custody of one of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, which work largely outside the control of the government.“I am back and safe, and I am thankful to all friends who were worried for me,” tweeted Gondal, who had gone missing while visiting a family-owned farm. His car was found abandoned on a road on the outskirts of Islamabad.Gondal was freed after his relatives rallied in Islamabad amid growing pressure on social media for his release.On Saturday, the Islamabad High Court had ordered authorities to trace Gondal by Monday, while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by his mother Asmat Bibi.The court also forwarded a copy of the order to the cabinet division secretary. “The abduction of a citizen from the federal capital is extremely alarming,” Chief Justice Athar Minallah remarked.Federal information and broadcasting minister Shibli Faraz said Prime Minister Imran Khan was concerned about Gondal’s abduction in Islamabad.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-pak-official-who-helped-in-report-on-pm-s-aide-reappears/story-SLEqiTeEmUUKYdWlesQ1xH.html
09-09-2020||World||Chinese state media admits military deployment along India border||China has deployed bombers, armoured vehicles and heavy artillery besides special forces as well as infantry units along the border with India, state media reports said on Wednesday, in a rare acknowledgment of what seems like a massive mobilisation of troops and equipment along the disputed boundary.Usually, official media highlights exercises in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) to demonstrate its military might along the border with India like it did last August, and repeatedly during the Doklam (Donglang) standoff in 2017.The more blatant show of military power – including sorties by Chinese fighter jets close to the border – is reserved for Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing considers to be a renegade region which it wants to unify with the mainland, by force if necessary.The words ‘deployment’ or ‘mobilisation’ are seldom used in the context of the border with India.State-run nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a report on Wednesday that “bombers, air defence troops, artillery, armoured vehicles, paratroopers, special forces and infantry units” have been mobilised from across the country at the border. “H-6 bombers and Y-20 large transport aircraft attached to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Central Theatre Command Air Force have been deployed to the Tibetan plateau region for training missions, the command revealed on Tuesday, the Global Times report said.A report in national broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said HJ-10 anti-tank missile systems attached to the PLA 71st Group Army were recently transported from east China’s Jiangsu province to northwest China’s Gobi desert, which is more than 1,600 km away.For the PLA, it would be easier to dispatch troops and equipment to the northwest from the Gobi desert region. “An air defence brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army also mobilised to the Northwest region in autumn and held live-fire confrontational drills with anti-aircraft guns and missiles,” CCTV reported on Friday.A separate CCTV report said paratroopers and heavy equipment on board the PLA Air Force’s transport aircraft recently conducted a multidimensional area capture and control exercise, also in the deserts of northwest China.The news reports did not specify since when the troops were being mobilised from different parts of China to the border. But they attributed the movement of troops and equipment to the ongoing boundary tension in eastern Ladakh. The reports added that soldiers, guns and aircraft were moved near the border areas not only from different parts of China but also different theatre commands.The Sino-India border area falls under the Western Theatre Command (WAC) of the PLA – the largest among its five theatres of command that covers the mainland’s geography.Several troop divisions deployed in northwest China’s desert areas in Xinjiang and southwest China’s TAR have been ordered to carry out live-fire drills and complex military maneuvres.Chinese military experts whom HT reached out to did not comment on the deployment.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-state-media-admits-military-deployment-along-india-border/story-3Vtg5Er2dLtZx7TUEDMbVL.html

The country also recorded 6 new coronavirus-linked deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the toll to 312, said Dr Jageshwar Gautam, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Population. Gautam said 1,081 new cases of Covid-19 were detected while carrying out 11,167 tests at various labs across the country. He said a total of 918 persons, who earlier tested positive for the virus, were discharged after they fully recovered from the disease. Kathmandu Valley has recorded 464 new cases of Covid-19, taking its tally to 9,440 as of Wednesday, the official said. “With this, the number of Covid-19 infected people discharged after full recovery has reached 33,882,” he said. There are currently 15,025 active cases of coronavirus at various isolation centres. With six new Covid-19 deaths reported on Wednesday, the country’s coronavirus death toll has reached 312, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-coronavirus-cases-near-50-000/story-wa2J5bWeIkNuBvsKrTbhcP.html
09-09-2020||World||Scientists, drugmakers and traders react to AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trial pause||AstraZeneca has paused global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after an unexplained illness in a participant, denting the British drugmaker’s shares as the move was seen as dimming prospects for an early roll out.“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials,” AstraZeneca said in an emailed statement.Below are reactions from scientists, drugmakers and stock market traders and analysts to the news:SCIENTISTS: Ian Jones, Professor of Virology at the University of Reading:“An inevitable consequence of testing a vaccine on large numbers of people is that some will naturally fall ill of other causes during the trial.We must wait and see what the investigation in this case shows but at the moment, I think unfortunate more than sinister would be the best description of the halt.”Charlie Weller, Head of Vaccines Programme at Wellcome:“Safety is the most important consideration when developing any vaccine, and it is right for the trial to be paused while an investigation takes place. This is often a normal part of the process in vaccine trials, which involve tens of thousands of people. It’s critical to quickly understand whether the illness has any relationship to the vaccine or the placebo and to share data openly, as Oxford University and AstraZeneca have done. “Vaccines are among the most rigorously tested and monitored products we have in society, and the COVID-19 vaccines should be no different.”James Gill, Honorary Clinical Lecturer, Warwick Medical School, and Locum GP, said:“During the development of any drug, people will develop side effects – hence we know ibuprofen can cause heart burn. People will also fall ill during the natural course of their lives whilst they have taken the vaccine. We know that the flu vaccine doesn’t cause flu, but some people can be unlucky and catch a bug around the time they are inoculated.Personally, I would be suspicious of a vaccine for a novel virus which was developed without any hiccoughs or pauses.Science on TV is great, and usually gets completed in the course of an episode. In a real lab, chemistry, patients and biology don’t often follow a nice simple course, which is why from the start scientists have said that this COVID vaccine development will take considerable time to get right and safe.”Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine:“We do not know what event has occurred, but given that in the UK those aged over 70 have been included in the trials, coincidental events are to be expected.Very occasionally, what might be expected in an older person, such as a stroke (and this is certainly not a suggestion that it is such an event that has happened here), can occur in a young person.“This very incident shows that the Oxford trial, and any other trials conducted in the UK, are monitored very carefully and precautions are taken to protect both the trial participants and those who might get the vaccine in the future.It is premature to speculate on whether the vaccine caused the adverse event, and even if it eventually is concluded that it is possible the vaccine was the cause, there may be other factors involved and it would not necessarily mean the vaccine could not be used at all.”COMPANIES:Germany’s Leukocare is working with Italy’s ReiThera and Belgium’s Univercells on a monkey adenovirus-based vaccine that is in early testing on humans.CEO Michael Scholl said a clinical trial halt was not unusual:“When you are inoculating 20,000 people, it is a foregone conclusion that at some point you will have severe adverse events. As soon as a link to the vaccine can clearly be ruled out, the trial continues.”He added that something as common as a heart attack could halt a vaccine trial, though he cautioned that any immune-related condition such as an inflammation would be subject to particular scrutiny.Moderna said it was “not aware of any impact” to its ongoing Covid-19 vaccine study at this time.Serum Institute of India (SII):“We can’t comment much on the UK trials, but they have been paused for further review and they hope to restart soon. As far as Indian trials are concerned, it is continuing and we have faced no issues at all.”TRADERS AND ANALYSTS:AstraZeneca’s shares in London fell more than 3% at the open on the news. The FTSE-100 listed stock was down 1.5% at 0943 GMT.Mirabaud trader Mark Taylor:“These headlines will be set back, but it is not an unusual step in the process. The only unusual bit is the amount of attention being drawn to it.“This dents the vaccine hope trade, which had become elevated and has been a major driver in some of the factor style rotation seen lately.”Neil Wilson at Markets.com:“Such are the problems with pinning hopes on a vaccine for a return to normal to be possible. The worry is that while we have all kind of assumed that one company will come up with a vaccine later this year, it’s not going to be plain sailing.”Citi analysts:“The risk of material potentially vaccine-related serious adverse event in one of the multiple large Covid-19 trials was always a high probability event.”“(The) development may negatively impact timelines for other Covid-19 vaccine sponsors. While AstraZeneca’s current share price is discounting little economic value from Covid-19, we expect an initial negative stock and broader market reaction today in response to the news.” UBS:“Even if the vaccine was to work, tolerability may be its Achilles heel and bigger picture, longer term safety of all vaccine candidates will remain an open question even if we get efficacy data later this year/early next.For those that think the Oxford/AZN collaboration is a stepping stone into becoming a vaccine player, we remind investors AZN has repeatedly said that its involvement in the development of a SARS-Cov2 vaccine is not a commercial venture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-drugmakers-and-traders-react-to-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-pause/story-JOpEIzJdJyCXgFjNnuuHOP.html
09-09-2020||World||China’s biggest airshow cancelled for first time over pandemic||China has called off its biennial airshow due to the coronavirus, a further blow to a global aviation industry heavily disrupted by the pandemic.The show, scheduled to take place in the southern coastal city of Zhuhai from November 10, was set to feature major companies such as Boeing.But China remains closed off to most international travellers due to tight restrictions to stop a resurgence of the coronavirus, which first surfaced in the central city of Wuhan before spreading across the globe.The event takes place every two years and is China’s main aerospace industry exhibition, with products, trade talks and a flying display.It has been a platform for Beijing to show off military equipment and technology such as stealth drones, as well as to unveil a replica of China’s first permanently crewed space station.While Asia’s biggest air show in Singapore went ahead in February -- with measures in place to guard against the deadly pathogen -- over 70 exhibitors including industry giant Lockheed Martin chose to skip the show.This year global air travel has been decimated as countries close borders and tourists stay home.Qatar Airways said in June it will not take any new aircraft in 2020 or 2021, deferring orders with Boeing and Airbus as demand diminishes amid the coronavirus crisis.The virus has also led to the cancellation or postponement of major events including the Olympic Games in Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-biggest-airshow-cancelled-for-first-time-over-pandemic/story-Ue7RmTibKX8zfs8AVIMOZM.html

Officials in the U.S.-led coalition say Iraqi forces are now mostly able to handle the remnants of Islamic State on their own.“We are continuing to expand on our partner capacity programs that enable Iraqi forces and allow us to reduce our footprint in Iraq,” Marine General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Iraq.A senior administration official had said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump would be announcing a reduction of U.S. troops from Iraq.The United States and Iraq in June affirmed their commitment to the reduction of U.S. troops in the country in coming months, with no plans by Washington to maintain permanent bases or a permanent military presence.In 2016 Trump campaigned on ending America’s “endless wars,” but U.S. troops remain in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, albeit in smaller numbers.Last month during a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, Trump redoubled his promise to withdraw the U.S. troops still in Iraq.Trump’s meeting with the Iraqi leader came amid a new spike in tensions between Washington and Tehran after Washington said it would seek to reinstate all previously suspended U.S. sanctions on Iran at the United Nations.Iraq’s parliament had voted earlier this year for the departure of foreign troops from Iraq, and United States and other coalition troops have been leaving as part of a drawdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-announce-us-troop-withdrawals-from-iraq-afghanistan/story-MYyDbosxEb2EKEVqQYk37H.html
09-09-2020||World||Pope uses mask, sanitiser as he appeals for public health||Pope Francis wore a face mask and used hand sanitiser Wednesday as he appealed for the faithful to look out for the health of others as well as themselves during the coronavirus pandemic.Francis took off the mask as his car pulled into the San Damaso courtyard inside the Apostolic Palace, where last week he resumed his weekly public audiences after a nearly six-month Covid-19 shutdown.While chairs were spaced out in the courtyard, the limited crowd massed along the barriers as Francis passed by and some lowered their masks to call out to him. The 83-year-old pope, who lost part of one lung to illness when he was young, loves plunging into crowds but tried to keep his distance and urged the crowd to stick to their seats to avoid contagion.An aide squirted some hand sanitizer in Francis’ hands after he greeted the well-wishers and before he approached his cleric translators on the podium. It was the first time the pope has been seen in public wearing a mask and using hand sanitiser.During his remarks, Francis lamented that “partisan interests” were emerging in which some nations and groups are seeking to keep vaccines for themselves, or to further their own political or economic interests.“The coronavirus is showing us that each person’s true good is a common good and, vice versa, the common good is a true good for the person,” he said. “Health, in addition to being an individual good, is also a public good. A healthy society is one that takes care of everyone’s health.” Francis is expected to elaborate on the need for the world to seek out the common good after the pandemic in an upcoming encyclical that he will sign next month during a private visit to Assisi, birthplace of his namesake, St. Francis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-uses-mask-sanitiser-as-he-appeals-for-public-health/story-tGc27YNnNp15fBltbIKE7J.html
09-09-2020||World||Build-up of greenhouse gases hits new record despite lockdowns: UN report||Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere hit a record high this year, a United Nations report showed on Wednesday, as an economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic had little long-term effect. The sharp, but short, dip in emissions earlier this year represented only a blip in the build-up of climate-warming carbon dioxide. “Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise,” said Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, a UN agency based in Geneva.While daily emissions fell in April to just 17% relative to the previous year, those levels were still on a par with 2006 emissions – underlining how much global emissions have grown over the last 15 years.And by early June, as factories and offices reopened, emissions were back up to within 5% of 2019 levels, according to the report by several UN agencies.Even if 2020 emissions are lower than last year’s output by up to 7%, as expected, what is released will still contribute to the long-term concentration built up since the beginning of the industrial era.Presenting the latest data on emissions, global temperatures and climate impacts on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, the report showed that atmospheric concentration of CO2 hit 414.38 parts per million in July, compared with 411.74 ppm a year earlier. Scientists say they consider 350 ppm, breached in 1988, a safe limit.As CO2 levels have increased, global temperatures have also risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Scientists say a temperature rise beyond 1.5 or 2 degrees will lead to far worse impacts from climate change across the world, including droughts, stronger storms and extreme sea level rise.“We are really only adapted and able to deal with a very small range of possible weather,” Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, told Reuters. “Even if this is just perturbed a little bit, we come very quickly to the edges of what we as societies can deal with.”The report detailed how climate change is expected to put hundreds of millions more people at risk of flooding. Access to fresh water is also projected to worsen.The number of people living in water-scarce areas by mid-century is now estimated to reach up to 3.2 billion, up from the previous estimate of about 1.9 billion.“It is those who are the most vulnerable in society who are hit fit first,” Otto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/build-up-of-greenhouse-gases-hits-new-record-despite-lockdowns-un-report/story-9cH6ax65g0soXwvk8XQmyN.html
09-09-2020||World||Amid border clashes, Jaishankar to meet foreign ministers of China, Russia||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will have a luncheon meeting with his Chinese and Russian counterparts on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) council of foreign ministers’ summit in Moscow, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday.The ministry said Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi will also have bilateral meetings with counterparts from other SCO member states, but did not say anything specific about a one-on-one with Jaishankar.The Russia-India-China (RIC) meeting between Jaishankar, Wang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov is likely to be held on Thursday. The meeting is significant as it comes in the wake of escalating tensions at multiples points along the disputed boundary between India and China in eastern Ladakh.Jaishankar is already in Moscow for the two-day meeting of foreign ministers, which began on Wednesday.“During this (SCO) meeting, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi will discuss with foreign ministers of other member states of the SCO, cooperation amid Covid-19 and exchange views on major international and regional issues,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular briefing.Wang “will also hold bilateral meetings with relevant member states and attend a luncheon for Chinese, Russian and Indian foreign ministers,” Zhao added.When specifically asked about a bilateral meeting between Jaishankar and Wang, Zhao said: “Like I said, I talked about state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit, and regarding the bilateral meeting you mentioned, if there is information, we will release it in due course”.India’s external affairs ministry said on Tuesday that Jaishankar’s Moscow visit will “include the participation in the Council of SCO Foreign Ministers and other bilateral meetings.”The RIC foreign ministers had last met by video conferencing on June 23 in the backdrop of the spreading Covid-19 pandemic.A meeting between the three ministers in Moscow indicates that Russia, an ally of both India and China, is keen to mediate between the two countries to defuse the tension at the border.A one-on-one meeting – and in-depth exchange - between Jaishankar and Wang is also widely expected as a possible way forward from the months-long standoff between the border troops in eastern Ladakh.Wang Dehua, South Asia expert at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the RIC meeting may also pave the way for a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping.“After Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe and Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh’s meeting in Moscow on September 4, the meeting of foreign ministers is of great significance as it’ is conducive to ease the tension along the border while helping to reset relations of our two countries. Perhaps, it will prompt early meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping,” Wang said.“I think it is also beneficial to the RIC mechanism. The border dispute can only be solved through talk or dialogues. Military confrontation is not an option,” he added.Incidentally, Jaishankar is the longest serving Indian ambassador to China, with his Beijing tenure lasting four-and-half years between 2009 and 2013.Speaking at the launch of his book, The India Way: Strategies For An Uncertain World last week, Jaishankar had said he knew Wang for a long time. “As to what I will be talking to my Chinese colleague when I meet him, we have known each other a long time so you can have a reasonable guess,” he had said.The two had last spoken over phone on June 17, two days after the Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Jaishankar had conveyed to Wang that the need of the hour was for the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps. “The two sides should scrupulously and sincerely implement the understanding that was reached by the senior commanders on 6th June. Troops of both sides should also abide by the bilateral agreements and protocols. They should strictly respect and observe the Line of Actual Control and should not take any unilateral action to alter it,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-border-clashes-jaishankar-to-meet-foreign-ministers-of-china-russia/story-utqYkaXC0tHUfvUrWYMvCL.html

The nomination was submitted by a four-term member of the Norwegian Parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, who is also the chairman of the Norwegian delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Fox News reported.The news comes just weeks after Trump helped broker peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Also Watch | Donald Trump nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for helping broker Israel-UAE deal “I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees,” Christian Tybring-Gjedde was quoted as saying by Fox News.“As it is expected other Middle Eastern countries will follow in the footsteps of the UAE, this agreement could be a game changer that will turn the Middle East into a region of cooperation and prosperity,” Tybring-Gjedde wrote in his nomination letter to the Nobel Committee.On August 13, Trump had announced the United Arab Emirates and Israel’s agreement to establish full diplomatic ties as part of a deal to halt the annexation of occupied land sought by the Palestinians for their future state.The announcement makes the UAE first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.Among Arab nations, Egypt and Jordan have active diplomatic ties with Israel. In 1979, Egypt made a peace deal with Israel, followed by Jordan in 1994.Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize nomination comes just weeks before the crucial US presidential elections, where the Republican’s presidential candidate is running a politically charged campaign against his rival Joe Biden. On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and vote to elect a new government for the next four years or re-elect the Trump for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-nominated-for-2021-nobel-peace-prize-report/story-AcJu6VRUlqzzHWKbE2wkYK.html
09-09-2020||World||Pope warns against seeking political, economic gain from coronavirus||Pope Francis said on Wednesday no one should seek economic or political gain from the coronavirus pandemic and vaccine developers should not see it merely as a profit-making endeavour.Francis told visitors at his weekly general audience - the second with public participation after six months of virtual audiences - that the pandemic should spur everyone to work for the common good.“Unfortunately, we are witnessing the emergence of partisan interests. For example, there are those who want to appropriate possible solutions for themselves, such as (developing) vaccines and then selling them to others,” he said. “Some are taking advantage of the situation to foment divisions, to create economic or political advantages, to start or intensify conflict,” he said, without specifying.The pandemic and the quest for a vaccine have become hot-button issues in the US presidential campaign between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.Trump wants to fast-track a vaccine, which he has said is coming “very, very soon”.

The deal would include an option for another 100 million doses.The EU didn’t disclose financial terms. Pfizer and BioNTech previously agreed to supply 120 million doses to Japan. The US in July reached a deal to pay $2 billion for an initial 100 million doses, with an option for 500 million more.The companies have said they’re on track for regulatory review as soon as October. They’ve enrolled more than 25,000 of the 30,000 participants needed for a massive clinical trial to show the vaccine works and secured sign-off this week from regulators to expand the study to Germany.Including study sites in Europe, “and now especially in Germany, is aimed at supporting an approval in Europe,” BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said in a previous statement.The companies’ vaccine relies on a new technology that prompts the body’s own cells to produce the virus proteins needed to trigger the immune system.The EU previously announced preliminary plans for vaccine supply arrangements with developers including Moderna Inc., Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford, Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as CureVac NV..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-lock-biggest-eu-vaccine-deal-of-200-million-doses/story-jPBbKUXmi8uKcTMJhxWxvK.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump and Joe Biden run vastly different pandemic campaigns||North Carolina caps outdoor gatherings at 50 people to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but don’t tell that to President Donald Trump. He basked in a largely maskless crowd of several thousand supporters during a rally in this critical battleground state.“As far as the eye can see,” Trump said, reveling at the sight of people flouting public health guidelines at Tuesday’s rally. “I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago.”A day earlier in Pennsylvania, Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, held a socially distanced meeting in a backyard. His team has been so attentive to local regulations that some staffers have left the room if they risked breaking the rules on crowd limits.“I really miss being able to, you know, grab hands and shake hands,” Biden recently told supporters. “You can’t do that now.”With less than eight weeks until Election Day, Trump and Biden are taking diametrically opposite approaches to campaigning during a pandemic — and the differences amount to more than political theater. The candidates are effectively staking out different visions for the country with Biden emphasizing guidelines supported by local health officials while Trump rails against restrictions that he argues — without evidence — are politically motivated.“By the way, your state should be open,” Trump said in North Carolina — a state where he has feuded with Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, over his abandoned plans to hold the Republican National Convention in Charlotte. “It’s you, it’s Michigan, it’s a couple others,” Trump added, as he sees a potent line of attack in battleground states run by Democrats.Trump aides and allies suggest the president sees his rallies as a manifestation of the reopening he’s preaching — and that he believes is vital to the nation’s economic recovery and what voters want. In a dig at those who warn against reopening too quickly, Trump suggested that these states would suddenly reopen the day after the election — when opponents advocating caution can no longer hurt his reelection.Outdoor events used to be few and far between for Trump, who prefers the deafening echo and air conditioning of indoor arenas. But in the wake of a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the president addressed a half-empty arena and a promised five-figure overflow crowd never materialized, his campaign decided to move to lower-stakes airport hangars and tarmacs.The one thing that has stayed the same: crowing about his crowd sizes in comparison with Biden’s.“If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot,” Trump said Tuesday of his opponent. “Have you ever seen the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people.”Biden’s crowds, in fact, have been far smaller. The former vice president has appeared in public only sparingly since the pandemic hit — and with the strictest adherence to state guidelines: 25 people in Pennsylvania, 50 in Michigan and mandatory face-coverings all around. Biden’s approach reflects the reluctance of many of his supporters to attend large gatherings.For someone who has never been a natural in an arena, the smaller events allow Biden to have more personal interactions with representatives from key voting blocs, like labor and community leaders.But they also allow him to largely avoid any controversy created by a critical questioner or a protester, both of whom he was forced to grapple with multiple times on the campaign trail before the pandemic struck.Even when Biden is confronted with organic crowds of supporters, he’s rarely given the opportunity for an unscripted interaction with them.As Biden gave a speech last week focused on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus at a university building in Pittsburgh, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and continued to arrive even as his event wrapped up.They chanted “We want Joe!” and waved Biden signs, some of them homemade. But, after his speech, Biden remained inside the building to attend a virtual fundraiser, then abruptly left to pass out pizzas at a nearby firehouse without approaching the supporters.Three days later, after Biden visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, he and his wife, Jill, stopped at the home of a supporter in Wauwatosa, a leafy Milwaukee suburb.With so many people confined to their homes, the presence of Biden’s motorcade on a small street drew more than 200 people out onto their porches or the street. The Bidens spent more than half an hour meeting in a quiet back patio with two teachers and a parent concerned about how to resume in-person learning during the pandemic.The crowd cheered and chanted “Go Joe!,” but the private meeting ran so long that Biden only interacted with them for less than a minute. As he was leaving, he walked to the middle of the street and then, surrounded by Secret Service agents, bellowed, “Don’t forget to vote!”Earlier this week, however, Biden took a moment after an event focused on labor leaders at a supporter’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to greet a crowd of about two dozen supporters that had assembled across the street. Flanked by Secret Service agents, Biden said a few words to the crowd about his belief that Americans can do anything when they’re unified and about the need to vote, then spoke briefly to reporters and departed.Later that day, Biden waved at a crowd of about 100 from the window of the AFL-CIO Pennsylvania headquarters, but declined to come any nearer after leaving the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-with-two-months-to-go-pitches-amped-up-for-us-presidential-election-2020/story-nfwl1Afbu2aETqc8Xk9WaP.html
09-09-2020||World||Brexit endgame spurs investors to buckle up for a wild ride||In a year that’s featured a global pandemic and a tidal wave of liquidity from central banks, investors are bracing themselves for a risk they’ve ignored for most of 2020: Brexit.The prospect of the UK and European Union reaching a trade agreement by an October deadline is looking less likely, with Britain saying this week it’s willing to walk away and break international law in the process. That risks the pound falling to a 35-year low, stocks that lag international peers, and bond yields turning negative for the first time amid bets on Bank of England interest-rate cuts, fund managers say.“If we have a big selloff in risk assets, and a bad Brexit outcome, then there’s no reason the pound couldn’t fall back through the March lows,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. That would mean a 12% slump to around $1.14, the lowest since 1985.The stalemate in discussions has already seen the pound suffer its longest losing streak since March when Covid-19 started to rip through the country, and has sent the yield on haven short-term bonds to record lows. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now facing a backlash over a government minister’s admission that the UK plans to break international law by re-writing parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Until recently, the risks associated with failed trade talks had been in the background, overshadowed by the economic fallout of the coronavirus. The pound, which has acted as a market barometer to Brexit since the 2016 referendum, had been rallying along with other currencies in Group-of-10 nations against the US dollar.Complacency around Brexit prompted Riddell to add to a short pound position in recent months and use sterling as a risk-off hedge, mainly against the US dollar and the yen.By contrast analysts in a Bloomberg survey expect only a mild drop to $1.30 by end-2020 and then gains next year. Economists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley all still anticipate a deal on commerce will be in place for the end of December.But with formal talks between the UK and EU resuming this week, those risks are back on investors’ radar. Johnson signaled he would let the talks collapse if a deal isn’t made before mid-October rather than compromise. Officials have also drafted a law that risks undermining the negotiations, a move that Northern Ireland Minister Brandon Lewis conceded would break international law.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is “worried and disappointed.”The flare-up in trade tensions has sent the pound tumbling by more than 2% this week, to below $1.30. It’s increased the cost of hedging swings in sterling over three months to the highest level since May, while Johnson’s comments spurred the biggest jump for six months in options betting on a fall in the currency by December.Value TrapBrexit continues to be a drag on the nation’s equities, with the FTSE 100 falling to a record low against the MSCI World Index. While a slide in the pound may provide a boost for exporters, investors are more underweight on the UK than on any other country examined in a Bank of America fund survey for August.“We see the UK as a value trap,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “Valuations might be attractive but fundamentals are not.”In addition to Brexit, the UK is suffering one of the biggest hits to growth in Europe from the pandemic, and must decide next month whether to keep supporting millions of furloughed workers or face a surge in unemployment.That could mean more pain for UK Plc, which combined with concern over a painful transition from the EU, may further fuel demand for the safety of gilts. Benchmark yields have fallen near a record set during the pandemic shock in March, and the rate on two-year bonds dropped to an all-time low of minus 0.156%.John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management, expects government bonds to rally if fears that trade talks will collapse drive up the possibility of UK interest rates going negative.Money markets have brought forward pricing on a BOE cut below zero to May, compared to September earlier this week. The potential for turmoil also raises the chances for more central bank bond buying.“It’s worth remembering that the Bank of England’s forecasts are based on the UK reaching a full trade agreement with the EU,” said Daniela Russell, head of UK rates strategy for HSBC Holdings Plc, who sees 10-year yields falling to zero by the end of the year.There’s a 40% chance yields could go below that to turn negative in the next year, said Jan von Gerich, a chief strategist at Nordea Bank Abp.Bare BonesA ‘bare-bones’ free trade deal would be enough to avoid such a scenario and lead Aberdeen Standard Investments to be underweight gilts, said Aaron Rock, an investment director.And Citigroup Inc. foreign-exchange strategist Adam Pickett said the market hasn’t priced in the likelihood of the UK and the EU moving toward a last-minute agreement, and is targeting a climb back to $1.35.Brexit fatigue could be one reason why markets are so far mostly positioned for a deal. Either way, fund managers will be glad to see the back of an issue that has forced them to work nights after late votes that flipped markets, defeated two prime ministers and divided the country.“It has dragged on long enough,” said Rock at Aberdeen Standard. “It will be better for all concerned if we can move on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-endgame-spurs-investors-to-buckle-up-for-a-wild-ride/story-3BpDp4fRUxUuKCOZdwXxxI.html

The 45th edition of North America’s largest movie event will still span 10 days from Thursday.“We began this year planning for a festival much like our previous editions, but along the way we had to rethink just about everything. This year’s line-up reflects that tumult,” said Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s artistic director and co-head.TIFF has usually featured close to 400 films. But 2020 will witness a pared-down slate, with 61 features, 36 shorts and another 30 films that will be restricted to the industry to keep its marketplace buzzing.Among the novelties for regular festival-goers will be the “outdoor experience”, with screenings at two drive-in venues and an open-air cinema in Toronto. Physical screenings will be limited to a maximum of 50 persons in the theatre.The online platform will also debut this year and feature all the films available to the public, though they will be geographically limited to Canada.Also Read: While media attention was focused on the insider-outsider debate, Chaitanya Tamhane made historyUnlike previous years, stars will be unable to visit Toronto in person due to mandatory quarantine requirements. But they will make online appearances to interact with audiences. Given the backdrop, TIFF is also partnering with a healthcare company for the festival.The festival will open with African-American director Spike Lee’s filmed version of David Byrne’s American Utopia, a Broadway musical from the founder and frontman of the classic band Talking Heads.India will be represented at TIFF this year by The Disciple, a film from Mumbai-based director Chaitanya Tamhane. In addition, the closing night presentation will feature episodes of Indian-American director Mira Nair’s TV adaptation of Vikram Seth’s novel Suitable Boy.“We could never have anticipated the global seismic changes we would be facing in 2020,” TIFF’s executive director and Co-Head Joana Vicente said. And while TIFF 2020 will miss the adulatory crowds swarming around stars for selfies, organisers hope it will be a memorable experience in a year of duress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toronto-film-fest-is-going-hybrid-as-show-must-go-on-during-pandemic/story-92SzfJOdpA8jEP458O29WO.html

09-09-2020||World||India honours armed forces superveterans settled in Canada||India has launched an initiative to honour armed forces veterans in their 90s and 100s now settled in Canada.The programme called Varisth Yoddha was launched in the Canadian province of Ontario , with a visit by Consul General Apoorva Srivastava to the homes of veterans.Seven veterans were presented with mementos in recognition of their service to India.The oldest of them was Captain Mohinder Singh, born on October 2, 1917, who fought in the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars against China and Pakistan. While the majority of the selected veterans in the first batch defended India in each major war fought since Independence, others had also been part of the British Army and fought in World War II. Among them was Commander Joginder Gei, 98, who joined the Royal Indian Navy and served aboard ships in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Another 98-year-old veteran was Bakshish Singh Randhawa who fought in WWII and also against Pakistan in 1965. Others on the first list included Major Darshan Singh Sanghera, 91, Subedar Major Pritam Singh Dhaliwal, 92, Subedar Gajjan Singh Mavi, 90 and Naib Subedar Gurdial Singh Grewal, 97.Also Read: Pro-Khalistan group alleges India disrupted secessionist referendum, Canada rejects theoryThe initiative was to have started on August 15, India’s Independence Day, but due to Covid-19 restrictions, the consul general visited the veterans at their residences with small ceremonies held for each of them. These centenarians and nonagenarians live in the Greater Toronto Area and have roots in Punjab.The ceremonies were held with the cooperation of the Veterans Association of Ontario. Brigadier Nawab Heer of the association said, “It was quite an emotional occasion for us and pleasant for them.”“If the government is remembering superveterans, it’s a positive step,” Heer said.“We wanted to hold an event on August 15 but because of the circumstances we couldn’t, so I decided to go to their homes in appreciation of their service,” Srivastava said.Srivastava said the plan is to institutionalise appreciation of these ex-servicemen with official ceremonies at the Consulate on Republic Day and Independence Day. For those unable to travel from their homes to the consulate, she said she would continue to visit them at their homes. After more veterans in their 90s are honoured, those in other age brackets will also be remembered, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-honours-armed-forces-superveterans-settled-in-canada/story-3Nhialw2QiS38Lbf892yiO.html
09-09-2020||World||Britain sets out details for post-EU life amid new Brexit row||Britain will set out new details of its blueprint for life outside the European Union on Wednesday, publishing legislation a government minister acknowledged would break international law in a “limited way” and which could sour trade talks.After leaving the EU in January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pushed on with plans for the end of a status quo period in December, and hoped a bill on Britain’s internal market would set in stone the transfer of powers from Brussels.But with talks with the EU all but stalled over fisheries and state aid, a statement from his Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis that the new bill would “break international law in a very specific and limited way” may only worsen matters.The EU has warned Britain that if it reneges on the divorce deal there would be no agreement. London has repeatedly said it will respect the withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol, saying its bill contained only “clarifications”.Also read: EU, UK blame each other over deadlocked post-Brexit talksBritain and the EU say they have until October to agree on a free trade deal, which would ease the worries of some companies who fear disruption at the borders and of supply chains at a time when many are struggling with the coronavirus crisis.In a statement, the government hailed its Internal Market Bill as a way of empowering Britain and ending the reign of “unelected EU bodies”.“This bill will also give the UK government new spending powers to drive our economic recovery from COVID-19 and support businesses and communities right across the UK,” said Michael Gove, a cabinet minister.“No longer will unelected EU bodies be spending our money on our behalf. These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK parliament and people of the UK.”The bill is intended to allow all companies to be able to trade unhindered in Britain’s four nations, to transfer powers to Britain allowing it to replace some of the EU’s spending programmes, and set up a new body to monitor internal trade.On Northern Ireland, Lewis said in a separate statement that the provisions would ensure businesses based in the British region would have “unfettered access” to the rest of Britain, without paperwork. It would also ensure there would be no legal confusion about the fact that while Northern Ireland would remain subject to the EU’s state aid regime, Britain would not.“As a responsible government it is also necessary for us to ensure there is a safety net in place which provides legal certainty that we can deliver on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland,” he said.Northern Ireland, which borders EU member Ireland, has always been a stumbling block in talks, and almost killed off the Brexit deal until Johnson found agreement with then Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar last year.Even after that, the government says there are ambiguities in the Northern Ireland protocol which need to be clarified in accordance with the election promises Johnson made last year.But Scotland and Wales said the planned bill would undermine the United Kingdom by stealing devolved powers from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Let me be clear – the UK government plans to sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations,” Jeremy Miles, Wales’ counsel general, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-sets-out-details-for-post-eu-life-amid-new-brexit-row/story-k2HHoB3Vug8tzPqB6kLJcK.html

Protests also broke out involving migrants, riot police, and firefighters.“It has been a very difficult night,” government spokesman Stelios Petsas said, adding that a state on emergency would be declared later Wednesday on the island.Some 12,500 people were living at the Moria camp and the surrounding area, where additional restrictions have been imposed over the past week after a Somali resident tested positive for the coronavirus.There were no reports of injuries.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe fires broke out overnight, police and fire officials on the island told The Associated Press, adding the cause of the blazes, as well as the full extent of the damage, remained unclear. They did not confirm local reports that the fires had been set deliberately in protest at the lockdown measures but said firefighters had “met resistance” from some camp residents.Government spokesman Petsas said that arson was being considered as a possible cause of the fire. Before dawn, riot police set up cordons along a highway near the camp to restrict the movements of migrants.Health authorities on Tuesday said 35 people at the camp had been confirmed infected with the virus so far after a major testing drive was ordered at the overcrowded facility. Those with confirmed infections were being kept in isolation at a separate site that was not affected by the fire, officials said.Lesbos was Europe’s busiest crossing point in 2015-16 for illegal migration during a massive westward movement of refugees, many fleeing war in Syria and Iraq and travelling through Turkey. After that wave of migration, Greece set up camps on Lesbos and four other islands, helped with European Union funding, and more recently also set up a network of camps on the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-sweeps-through-largest-refugee-camp-in-greece-which-is-under-lockdown/story-uxapz9YeUkxEjRWF2uQ03N.html
09-09-2020||World||Fresh fires on oil tanker off Sri Lanka under control||Fresh fires that erupted on a large oil tanker drifting off Sri Lanka are under control again, the country’s navy said Wednesday.A new blaze broke out Monday on the MT New Diamond, which was carrying nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil, and reached the magnitude of last week’s fire, only a day after it was extinguished. Officials have warned of massive environmental damage to Sri Lanka’s coast if the ship leaks or explodes.“The fire has now been brought under control and the ship is being towed by a tugboat to out to sea,” said navy spokesperson Indika de Silva.“There are no flames or smoke to be noticed as of now,” he said, adding that the navy’s specially trained firefighting and disaster management team will join with firefighting experts from India’s coast guard and specialists sent by the ship’s owner on Wednesday to assess the situation.Ten British and Dutch professionals, including rescue operation specialists, disaster evaluators and legal consultants, reached the scene on Monday and are waiting to board the tanker to begin the mission of salvaging it. The experts were sent by New Shipping Ltd., the commercial owner of the New Diamond in Athens, Greece.The tanker is about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) off the coast and the plan is to position it is at 40 nautical miles to facilitate salvaging work, de Silva said.The tanker was transporting crude oil from the port of Mina Al Ahmadi in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip, where the state-owned Indian Oil Corp. has a refinery.High winds, extreme temperatures on the ship and sparks reignited the fresh fires, the navy said, adding that so far there is no risk of an oil leak or of the fire spreading into the oil storage area.The navy said the initial fire began in an engine room boiler but did not spread to where the oil is kept.The navy said Tuesday that “a diesel patch” had been spotted in the ocean about 1 kilometer (half a mile) from the ship. The patch is likely to be diesel fuel from the ship, it said. The ship has about 1,700 tons of fuel to power its engines.An Indian coast guard aircraft sprayed a chemical on the patch to minimize damage.The initial fire killed one Filipino crew member and injured another, while 21 other crew members escaped uninjured.Twenty of them were taken to the southern port city of Galle on Tuesday, while the captain remained on a ship near the tanker to help with firefighting efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-fires-on-oil-tanker-off-sri-lanka-under-control/story-AeWabO4wG6JAUnbY0uI1hN.html
09-09-2020||World||Covid-19: As cases in Indonesia rise, medical workers bear the burden||While Indonesia has recorded more deaths from the coronavirus than any other Southeast Asian country, it also has seen by far the most fatalities among medical workers in the region, leading to concerns about the long-term impact on the nation’s fragile healthcare system.The tribulations endured by Indonesian healthcare workers are similar to others globally: long working hours, hospitals filled to capacity and a lack of resources like personal protective equipment.Indonesia’s government has been able to provide PPE to healthcare workers after an initial shortage that saw doctors wearing plastic raincoats while working. But other issues remain in the country, where more than 200 medical workers, mostly doctors and nurses, have died from the virus.According to Dr. Halik Malik, spokesperson for the Indonesian Medical Association, coronavirus and non-coronavirus patients are often treated in the same healthcare facilities, increasing workers’ potential exposure to the virus. Only workers who are treating known Covid-19 patients are provided virus testing for themselves, he said, noting that results are often delayed.“We are worried that if positive cases in the community continue to increase, there will be many cases that cannot be handled properly,” Malik said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndonesia on Tuesday surpassed 200,000 cases of the coronavirus, the second-highest tally in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, which has reported more than 241,000 infections. In all of Asia, Indonesia’s death toll of 8,230 is second only to India, which has had over 73,000 fatalities.At least 213 healthcare workers have died from Covid-19 in Indonesia, including 107 doctors and 74 nurses, according to the Indonesian Medical Association.The Philippines, which has reported more than 3,900 deaths overall, has seen 33 of its medical workers die from the virus, second-most in the region. The only other Southeast Asian country with more than 100 overall deaths is Malaysia, with 128.Indonesia also has one of the lowest numbers of doctors per capita in Southeast Asia, at just 4.27 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.The deaths of so many of its doctors from Covid-19 will impact the country’s healthcare workforce for years to come, said Nurul Nadia, a public health expert from the Center for Indonesia’s Strategic Development Initiatives, an organization that focuses on health.“Our health system is weak, the number of doctors is not ideal, the number of specialist doctors is very few and many have become victims of Covid-19 now,” Nadia said.And the spread of the virus is only getting worse across the vast archipelago nation of more than 270 million people.According to the WHO, 66,420 cases were recorded in Indonesia in August alone, a 28% rise from July’s total. While a majority of the cases were in East Java province and Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, several other places have emerged as new hot spots. The true number of cases is suspected to be significantly higher, as Indonesia continues to have one of the lowest testing rates in the world.Yet businesses across the country continue to reopen. Bali, one of the country’s largest tourism hubs, began welcoming domestic visitors on July 9. According to Bali Tourism Agency chief Putu Astawa, the island welcomed at least 78,000 domestic tourists in August. In Jakarta, many offices have reopened, contributing to a spike in cases in the sprawling city.As a result of the spike in cases, hospitals are continuing to fill, leading to some becoming overcrowded. Isolation beds are now at 70% capacity in the country, “raising concern about the healthcare system’s capacity to cope with the increasing number of new cases every week,” the WHO said.Medical workers face other burdens for which there are no available statistics. They often work long hours, with no offer of psychological counseling, said Dr. Irman Pahlepi, who has worked in a Covid-19 intake center since March. The fear of exposure to the virus has also kept many healthcare workers away from their families, as they choose instead to stay in government-provided hotels.Pahlepi, who spent most of the past five months living away from his newlywed wife for fear of infecting her, recently found out his wife is pregnant and decided to move back home to help care for her. But the decision doesn’t come without risks, he said.“I’m getting more scared now, and getting sadder too,” Pahlepi said. “I remember my family at home more than before. What if we get infected?”Healthcare workers across Indonesia are facing other hardships as well. The secretary of the Legal Aid Agency of the Indonesian Nurses Association said that as of May 25, “330 nurses in government-owned or private-owned hospitals experienced pay cuts and did not receive any holiday bonus,” according to a report by Amnesty International.Indonesia’s government announced a plan last week to lessen the burden on healthcare workers by moving patients from hospitals to create more space, adjusting clinical work arrangements to reduce exposure to patients, and providing nutritional supplements to medical workers.“We are deeply sorry to our hero health workers, the front-liners, the fighters who have passed away while handling Covid-19 treatment,” National Covid-19 Task Force spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito said at a news conference. “Both the task force and the minister of health are very concerned (about) this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-as-cases-in-indonesia-rise-medical-workers-bear-the-burden/story-aL4rNRPeWf6CiOr3f9WwzH.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden run vastly different campaigns amid Covid-19 crisis||North Carolina caps outdoor gatherings at 50 people to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but don’t tell that to President Donald Trump. He basked in a largely maskless crowd of several thousand supporters during a Tuesday rally in this critical battleground state.“As far as the eye can see,” Trump said, revelling at the sight of people flouting public health guidelines. “I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago.” A day earlier in Pennsylvania, Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, held a socially distanced meeting in a backyard. His team has been so attentive to local regulations that some staffers have left the room if they risked breaking the rules on crowd limits.“I really miss being able to, you know, grab hands and shake hands,” Biden recently told supporters. “You can’t do that now.” With less than eight weeks until Election Day, Trump and Biden are taking diametrically opposite approaches to campaigning during a pandemic — and the differences amount to more than political theatre. The candidates are effectively staking out different visions for the country with Biden emphasizing guidelines supported by local health officials while Trump rails against restrictions that he argues — without evidence — are politically motivated.“By the way, your state should be open,” Trump said in North Carolina — a state where he has feuded with Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, over his abandoned plans to hold the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.“It’s you, it’s Michigan, it’s a couple others,” Trump added, as he sees a potent line of attack in battleground states run by Democrats.Trump aides and allies suggest the president sees his rallies as a manifestation of the reopening he’s preaching — and that he believes is vital to the nation’s economic recovery and what voters want. In a dig at those who warn against reopening too quickly, Trump suggested that these states would suddenly reopen the day after the election — when opponents advocating caution can no longer hurt his reelection.Outdoor events used to be few and far between for Trump, who prefers the deafening echo and air conditioning of indoor arenas. But in the wake of a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the president addressed a half-empty arena and a promised five-figure overflow crowd never materialized, his campaign decided to move to lower-stakes airport hangars and tarmacs.The one thing that has stayed the same: crowing about his crowd sizes in comparison to Biden’s.“If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot,” Trump said Tuesday of his opponent. “Have you ever seen the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people.” Biden’s crowds, in fact, have been far smaller. The former vice president has appeared in public only sparingly since the pandemic hit — and with the strictest adherence to state guidelines: 25 people in Pennsylvania, 50 in Michigan and mandatory face-coverings all around. Biden’s approach reflects the reluctance of many of his supporters to attend large gatherings.For someone who has never been a natural in an arena, the smaller events allow Biden to have more personal interactions with representatives from key voting blocs, like labor and community leaders.But they also allow him to largely avoid any controversy created by a critical questioner or a protester, both of whom he was forced to grapple with multiple times on the campaign trail before the pandemic struck.Even when Biden is confronted with organic crowds of supporters, he’s rarely given the opportunity for an unscripted interaction with them.As Biden gave a speech last week focused on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus at a university building in Pittsburgh, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and continued to arrive even as his event wrapped up.They chanted “We want Joe!” and waved Biden signs, some of them homemade. But, after his speech, Biden remained inside the building to attend a virtual fundraiser, then abruptly left to pass out pizzas at a nearby firehouse without approaching the supporters.Three days later, after Biden visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, he and his wife, Jill, stopped at the home of a supporter in Wauwatosa, a leafy Milwaukee suburb.With so many people confined to their homes, the presence of Biden’s motorcade on a small street drew more than 200 people out onto their porches or the street. The Bidens spent more than half an hour meeting in a quiet back patio with two teachers and a parent concerned about how to resume in-person learning during the pandemic.The crowd cheered and chanted “Go Joe!,” but the private meeting ran so long that Biden only interacted with them for less than a minute. As he was leaving, he walked to the middle of the street and then, surrounded by Secret Service agents, bellowed, “Don’t forget to vote!” Earlier this week, however, Biden took a moment after an event focused on labor leaders at a supporter’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to greet a crowd of about two dozen supporters that had assembled across the street. Flanked by Secret Service agents, Biden said a few words to the crowd about his belief that Americans can do anything when they’re unified and about the need to vote, then spoke briefly to reporters and departed.Later that day, Biden waved at a crowd of about 100 from the window of the AFL-CIO Pennsylvania headquarters, but declined to come any nearer after leaving the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-run-vastly-different-campaigns-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-qjozv7CcC54ct8k0lFcoJK.html
09-09-2020||World||Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh targeted in Kabul, Haqqani network is prime suspect||Two days after Afghanistan First Vice President Amrullah Saleh raised the issue of Durand Line and talked about Peshawar as summer capital of Islamic Republic, the former intelligence chief was target of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack in Kabul that left three of his bodyguards injured, many bystanders killed or maimed in the explosion.The device was placed under a culvert over which Saleh’s cavalcade was passing en-route to the Vice President’s office. The IED was so powerful that gas cylinders in nearby shops exploded due to concussion. There are unconfirmed reports that 15 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the attack. Saleh, intelligence reports confirm, is safe.In a video message released after the attack, Saleh said that the attack took place at 7.30 am, when he was on his way to work. The place where the suicide attack took place was narrow, he said, thanking the swift action of the securitymen present there.Saleh, a former intelligence chief, has survived several assassination attempts, including one on his office last year that killed 20 people.The attack on Saleh comes at a time when the ultra-conservative Sunni Pashtun outfit Taliban is planning to hold intra-Afghan negotiations in Qatar with the support of US. “No Afghan politician of national stature can overlook the issue of Durand Line. It will condemn him or her in life & after life. It is an issue which needs discussions & resolution. Expecting us to gift it for free is un-realistic. Peshawar used to be the winter capital of Afg,” he said in a tweet on September 7.According to diplomats base in Kabul and New Delhi, the needle of suspicion for the attack on Saleh is towards the Haqqani network as the Zadran tribe, which is affliated to the global terrorist group, has a hold on Kabul city with the perpetrators of attack this morning based in Pakistan. Sirajjudin Haqqani, head of the Haqqani network, is deputy leader and sword arm of Taliban.While the decision of the US to withdraw after nearly two decades of active involvement in Afghanistan is well respected all around, its decision to foist the Taliban on the political and constitutional system by unilateral moves which are required to be honoured and accommodated by Kabul is causing much concern all around the region.Incidents such as these once again bring to fore that contrary to their public protestations, neither the outfit nor its sponsors-in-uniform in Pakistan are in the mood for any accommodation.The Taliban have not sent their delegation to Qatar for talks, they are seeking the release of Haji Bashir Noorzai, an Afghan drug lord who was arrested in 2005. Keen to make the Taliban sit with the Afghanistan’s government, the US is looking to entertain this request to release Noorzai and other Taliban detainees in Guantanamo Bay.“I think the TBN will not start talks in Doha till the release of Haji B Noorzai. According to the attached article, Dr Khalilzad guaranteed his release. Considering the timing, perhaps Haji Bashar might be released this week. Now the TBN have no incentive to reduce violence,” Afghan politician Rahmatullah Nabil said on Twitter. I think the TBN will not start talks in Doha till the release of Haji B. Noorzai.

09-09-2020||World||AstraZeneca pauses Covid-19 vaccine trial after unexplained illness||AstraZeneca Plc stopped giving shots of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after a person participating in one of the company’s studies got sick, a potential adverse reaction that could delay or derail efforts to speed an immunization against Covid-19 for the world.The pause stemmed from a standard review of the company’s vaccine trials after one person developed an unexplained illness, AstraZeneca said in a statement. The move was intended to give researchers time to examine safety data while maintaining the integrity of the trials, the company said.The vaccine, which AstraZeneca is developing with researchers from the University of Oxford, has been viewed as one of the leading candidates to reach the market. The decision to tap the brakes jolted investors, sending AstraZeneca’s U.S.-traded shares down sharply, while boosting the stocks of some rivals developing different potential Covid-19 shots.“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,” AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell said in a statement. She said that it’s too early to determine the sick participant’s specific diagnosis.Scientific sprintThe development has the potential to disrupt one of the most closely watched scientific sprints in history. Companies have been working to find a vaccine in hopes of blunting a pandemic that has sickened more than 27 million people and killed over 894,000 worldwide. Health officials in the U.S. and President Donald Trump have repeatedly said that it’s possible to have an immunization before the end of the year, and potentially as early as next month.The top U.S. official in charge of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s program to support the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, said experts monitoring the trials in the U.K. paused the late-stage trial in coordination with their U.S. counterparts.Moncef Slaoui, the head of the Warp Speed initiative, said in a statement that Data Safety Monitoring Boards in the U.S. and U.K. are “conducting an in-depth review of the company’s vaccine candidate which is standard procedure when an adverse event occurs.”A Data Safety Monitoring Board is a panel of outside experts that watches for potential harm from experimental drugs and vaccines during clinical trials. The bar to pause a vaccine trial is generally low since participants are healthy and may never need the immunization they have volunteered to receive.The members of the monitoring board have unparalleled insight into clinical studies. Unlike doctors and researchers, they are told whether those participating received the vaccine or a placebo, and they are given regular updates on how each group is faring.Oxford University’s Jenner Institute didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.‘Safety precaution’Some scientists downplayed the significance of the halt. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and clinical-trials expert at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, said such pauses in large studies are “not uncommon at all.” There is a high likelihood the adverse event will turn out not to be related to the vaccine, he said in an email.“It’s a safety precaution,” he said.Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the AstraZeneca shot involves giving large doses of a monkey adenovirus engineered so it can’t replicate. It is therefore important for researchers to investigate whether the adverse event wasn’t somehow being triggered by a reaction to that large viral dose, he said.“When you have that kind of viral load, you can have side effects,” said Offit. The question is whether the adverse event could somehow be related to the large number of viral particles being given, or whether it is just a coincidence. If after investigating, the monitoring board is comfortable there are reasons unrelated to the vaccine to explain the adverse event, the trial will be able to continue, he said.The U.S. and other governments have invested billions of dollars to develop a shot at an accelerated pace, and more than two dozen vaccines are now being tested in volunteers less than a year after the virus was first discovered. Eleven candidates are in late-stage trials.Raised questionsThe setback comes as a group of international scientists raised questions over a fast-moving vaccine from Russia, saying some results of a study appeared improbable. The two incidents highlight the difficulty in getting an effective vaccine to the public quickly as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads unabated.Politics have also complicated the pursuit of a vaccine. Amid concerns about the Trump administration politicizing the rollout of a vaccine before the elections, frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine pledged to avoid shortcuts on science as they face pressure to rush a shot to market.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that it’s “unlikely” a Covid-19 vaccine will be available to the public by Nov. 3.In late trading in New York, AstraZeneca shares fell as much as 8.3%, while Moderna Inc. and BioNTech SE saw their shares rise. All three companies are participating in Operation Warp Speed. News of AstraZeneca’s trial setback was first reported by STAT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-pauses-covid-19-vaccine-trial-after-unexplained-illness/story-YaCN7db9JBJLbjncnx1VxL.html

The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP’s parliamentary majority.Suga, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida will appear in a televised debate on Wednesday, making the case for who should lead the country after nearly eight years under Abe.Abe had early success with his “Abenomics” economic initiatives but the coronavirus pandemic has eradicated those gains.Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, sank deeper into its worst postwar recession in the second quarter of this year with a record 28% annualised contraction, government data showed the previous day.Suga said on Tuesday the biggest job for the new prime minister would be to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy.Ishiba has been a popular figure among the public while Kishida has the diplomatic experience that Suga lacks, but they have only a fraction of the LDP support that Suga enjoys, the Asahi tally shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-yoshihide-suga-in-pole-position-for-pm-as-debate-kicks-off/story-4M3r7KLtLElCi8ZGmbcyXL.html
09-09-2020||World||US Prez Donald Trump planning to withdraw additional troops from Iraq||The Trump administration will announce Wednesday that it is withdrawing additional troops from Iraq, as President Donald Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to disentangle the country from “endless wars.”A senior administration official discussed the draw-down with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday night, on condition of anonymity. The official said the administration is also looking to announce the withdrawal of additional troops from Afghanistan in the coming days.The planned announcements come as the president has been trying to make the case that he has fulfilled the promises he made four years ago as he tries to secure a second term.There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. In July, the top US general for the Middle East said he believed the US will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said he believes the Iraqis welcome the US and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.Trump told reporters two weeks ago that “we look forward to the day when we don’t have to be there.” The comments came during an Oval Office meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized at that same meeting that a full withdrawal of US troops would only occur once “we can complete the mission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-donald-trump-planning-to-withdraw-additional-troops-from-iraq/story-SNhJQJaTgQhIjUv6KTcxhI.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump expands ban on new offshore drilling sites in Atlantic||President Donald Trump expanded a ban on new offshore drilling Tuesday, an election year reversal likely to appeal to voters in Florida and other coastal states. Two years ago, Trump had taken steps to vastly expand offshore drilling from coast to coast.“This protects your beautiful gulf and your beautiful ocean, and it will for a long time to come,” Trump said as he announced the expanded drilling ban during an appearance at the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse.The president signed a memorandum instructing the interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina for a period of 10 years — from July 1, 2022, to June 20, 2032.The existing moratorium covers the Gulf of Mexico, and Trump said the new one would also cover the Atlantic coast — a significant political concern in coastal states like Florida.Trump used the event to portray himself as an environmental steward and contrast his record against that of Democrat Joe Biden. But the Trump administration has overturned or weakened numerous regulations meant to protect air and water quality and lands essential for imperiled species.The trip comes as Trump steps up his travel to battleground states eight week before the election. From Florida, he headed for a campaign rally in North Carolina, another must-win for his re-election, before returning to the White House late Tuesday.Trump used the North Carolina stop to campaign against the state’s restrictive coronavirus guidelines, as he openly flouted the 50-person cap on outdoor events with a rally of thousands of supporters standing shoulder-to-shoulder on an airport tarmac.Also read: Trump slams Harris for doubting vaccine, says she’ll never be president“Your state should be open,” Trump said, baselessly claiming that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and others were trying to hamstring their economies with restrictions to hurt his reelection. “It’s a shame what’s going on, and I’ll tell you what, on November 4, every one of those states will be open. They’re doing it for political reasons.”Back in Florida, Trump used the taxpayer-funded event to lambaste his opponent with claims that Biden would “destroy America’s middle class” and give a “free pass to the world’s worst foreign polluters.”Biden has called for eliminating carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and modernizing the electric grid. Both moves would curtail fossil fuel demand. His plan also includes significant direct public spending and tax subsidies for other energy sources, which Biden’s campaign says would spur new jobs even as traditional energy jobs wane.Biden calls out China as the world’s biggest coal polluter and says he’d hinge all future trade deals with Beijing on carbon reductions. He supports an international alliance to help other nations afford low-carbon development and pitches a global moratorium on Arctic offshore drilling.The announcement could open Trump to charges of an election year flip-flop given that in January 2018 he acted to vastly expand offshore drilling from the Atlantic to the Arctic oceans and he has supported efforts to boost American energy production to lessen reliance on foreign sources.Biden accused Trump of “conveniently” changing his mind.“Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida,” Biden tweeted. “Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable. You don’t have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling.”Trump offered himself as the greatest environmental president since Theodore Roosevelt.“Who would have thought? Trump is the great environmentalist,” the president said. “You hear that? That’s good, and I am. I am. I believe strongly in it.”But Trump has rolled back numerous regulations designed to protect the environment, from power plant emissions to auto fuel standards to clean water. He withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Accord, a global agreement to address the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.The environment has also been the primary target of Trump’s push to eliminate regulations, eliminating or weakening dozens of rules that protect the air and water, along with lands essential for imperiled species while reversing Obama-era initiatives to fight climate change.Trump replaced Obama’s Clean Power Plan aimed at slashing greenhouse gas pollution from electric plants and eased automobile fuel economy standards. Under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency stripped federal protection from millions of acres of streams and wetlands. He lifted restrictions on oil and gas exploration in sensitive areas and shortened environmental reviews of construction projects such as highways and pipelines.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a longtime Trump ally who has opposed the administration’s drilling exploration expansion plans, applauded Tuesday’s announcement as “good news” but warned “we must remain vigilant in the conservation and preservation of our coastline.”Trump said he had also been discussing the moratorium with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who greeted Trump at the airport in West Palm Beach and attended the Jupiter event. About 200 people attended. Few wore face coverings or practiced social distancing.Jaclyn Lopez, Florida director for the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, said Floridians will remember it was Trump who previously proposed opening the state to drilling in the first place.“Voters shouldn’t be duped by this cheap, last-minute maneuver,” Lopez said in an emailed statement. “It can’t even begin to make up for the aggressive efforts to expand dirty offshore drilling since Trump’s been in office.”Energy industry groups said the decision was the “wrong approach” for the times.“Offshore access is critical for growing US energy leadership and providing affordable energy for American families,” said Lem Smith, vice president of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, in an emailed statement. The ban “puts at risk hundreds of thousands of new jobs, US energy security advancements and billions of dollars in critical revenue for states,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-expands-ban-on-new-offshore-drilling-sites-in-atlantic/story-MOxo26fZ3DKUWZQwLJ4snN.html
09-09-2020||World||Chinese journalists based in Australia raided, says state media||China’s state media is reporting that intelligence officials raided the residences of Chinese journalists based in Australia in late June, amid heightened tensions between the trading partners.The Global Times reported the journalists were questioned and their computers and phones seized, citing a source close to the matter that it didn’t identify. Xinhua News Agency had a similar article, while the China News Service said the homes of four journalists from three Chinese media outlets were raided by Australian police on June 26, who eventually found they did nothing wrong.A request for comment on the reports to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wasn’t immediately answered.The reports come after China confirmed that Cheng Lei, an Australian television anchor, was being held over suspected state security violations hours after the last two correspondents from the country’s media outlets fled the country. Australia was informed mid-August that she had been detained.While those issues highlight the mounting political pressures on foreign press corps operating in China, they also underscore fraying ties between Beijing and Canberra after Prime Minister Scott Morrison in April called for independent investigators be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Australia has been locked in a tussle over a series of diplomatic moves that China has interpreted as supporting the U.S. in the expanding trade and security dispute between Beijing and Washington. The media are only the latest sector to get swept up in the fight, after China curbed or launched trade actions against imports of Australian beef, wine and barley.A Sydney-based lawmaker had his home and office raided by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on June 26, the same day as the raids on Chinese media are alleged to have occurred. New South Wales state lawmaker Shaoquett Moselmane later said the probe was linked to people allegedly advancing the goals of the Chinese government, and denied being a suspect.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-journalists-nased-in-australia-raided-says-state-media/story-yVx8JEOQ67zS1rLy1E4kHO.html

Rising average temperatures, combined with recent heat waves, parched ground vegetation, creating optimal fire conditions.Pilots are flying at night using night vision goggles to see through dense smoke that during the daytime can make missions impossible.“Those night vision goggles allowed us to keep on going one ridge further,” Goding said.(Reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-than-combat-helicopters-rescue-hundreds-from-california-wildfire/story-kgYNonzhOEeGqHQEHVSVgK.html

Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him; Russia has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.Germany briefed the G7, which the United States is chairing this year, on its determination that Navalny “is the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve-agent of the ‘Novichok’ group, a substance developed by Russia,” the G7 statement said.“Any use of chemical weapons, anywhere, anytime, by anybody, under any circumstances whatsoever, is unacceptable and contravenes the international norms prohibiting the use of such weapons,” the statement added, calling on Russia establish who was responsible “for this abhorrent poisoning attack.”“We will continue to monitor closely how Russia responds to international calls for an explanation of the hideous poisoning of Mr. Navalny,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-foreign-ministers-condemn-navalny-s-confirmed-poisoning/story-c4CbSuUjOZvoVrQoFYqCRJ.html

I mean, it’s clear, we have all the evidence showing what is going on in Xinjiang,” he told AFP.Coronavirus victimBaduicao accused Disney of “double standards”, embracing western social justice movements such as MeToo and Black Lives Matter, while turning a blind eye to China’s rights abuses. The live-action remake of Disney’s 1998 animation classic, “Mulan” has had a troubled release. It was meant to hit global theatres in March but became an early victim of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, Disney rocked the industry -- and its own cast -- by announcing the film would in streamed into living rooms in many markets, including the United States, which it started Friday.Hollywood has been increasingly accused of hypocrisy over its relationship with authoritarian China.In August the anti-censorship group Pen America published a report which said screenwriters, producers and directors often change scripts, delete scenes and alter content to avoid offending Chinese censors.The actions include everything from deleting the Taiwanese flag from Tom Cruise’s bomber jacket in the upcoming “Top Gun: Maverick,” to removing China as the source of a zombie virus in 2013’s “World War Z.”But it also means completely avoiding sensitive issues including Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong politics, Xinjiang and the portrayal of LGBTQ characters, the report said.AFP contacted Disney for comment but has yet to hear back on the Labor Day holiday.Xinjiang is a resource-rich region home to mostly Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs and boasts spectacular desert and mountain backdrops.After sectarian unrest and attacks by Uighur militants, Beijing blanketed the region in a draconian security crackdown, building dozens of huge internment camps.Initially China denied the camps existed before switching to describing them as voluntary re-education centres.Even before the latest Xinjiang controversy the hashtag #BoycottMulan has been trending in recent weeks Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan.Activists in all three places have launched multiple online campaigns critical of China’s authoritarianism.Dubbed the “Milk Tea Alliance” -- named after a shared love of the drink -- they seized on social media comments made last year by actress Liu supporting Hong Kong’s police.They have also noted the resemblance of actor Tzi Ma, who plays Mulan’s heroic father, to China’s leader Xi Jinping.After her arrest last month under Beijing’s new security law, young Hong Kong dissident Agnes Chow was dubbed “the real Mulan” by supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mulan-movie-boycott-calls-grow-over-scenes-filmed-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-cCRXz4Qw8T2I4wnfIQpzVM.html

The suspected cases were self-isolating for a 14-day period, he said, adding the virus had sickened people working in different UN agencies across the country.Syria has recorded 3,229 cases of Covid-19, with 137 deaths registered in zones controlled by the Damascus government.The CEOs of nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 on Tuesday pledged to “uphold the integrity of the scientific process”. “We want to make clear our ongoing commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for Covid-19 in accordance with high ethical standards,” said the CEOs. The statement was signed by AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GSK, J&J, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi.China has passed “an extraordinary and historic test” with its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday at an awards ceremony for medical professionals.“We have passed an extraordinary and historic test,” Xi said. “We quickly achieved initial success in the people’s war against the virus.

09-09-2020||World||‘Brag about your feats, run for office’: Nikki Haley to Indian Americans||The time has come for Indian Americans to get more involved in politics, Nikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the UN, said Tuesday, exhorting the minority community to embrace their accomplishments, “brag” about them and not hide behind their traditional humility and shyness.“Whether it’s Republican or Democrat,” said Hailey, a lifelong Republican herself and a rising star in the party, adding, “get involved, don’t just get involved by vote. Get involved by running, get involved within government offices, in public sectors.”“I think Indians are so good at everything they touch, it’s a natural progression to have them get involved in politics as well,” she added further.Haley chose an unusual platform for her muscular message for the community — the annual summit of US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a trade body. She was in conversation, virtually, with Ajay Banga, the MasterCard CEO, another successful Indian American like herself. Haley is by far the tallest political leader in the community. No Indian had ever held a federal cabinet-rank position before she was named by President Donald Trump as ambassador to the UN in 2017. She is also a two-time state governor, an honour she shares with Bobby Jindal, a fellow Indian-descent Republican.Haley might have to concede that community crown to another Indian-American, Kamala Harris - if she wins. Harris is running for vice-president with Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president.In growing recognition of her standing in the party, Haley, despite being out of office, landed a major speaking spot at the just concluded party convention to re-nominate President Donald Trump. She is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nominee in 2024There are an estimated 4 million Americans of Indian descent. At just about 1% of the population, they are not big in numbers. But they are the most affluent and educated community, and the most philanthropic, something that Haley said makes her feel the proudest about being Indian American.“Those are things that we should brag about because those that have come before us have worked so hard to reach these points and we have to make sure that we take to the next level,” Haley said, urging the community to speak more about its accomplishments, and flaunt them.“I think that we have to not be so shy and not be super humble, but also go out there and try and share what we know we can be good at, and I think that there’s a lot of different aspects from business to education to health care, everything in between that we can share that will add to this country and make people more proud of the Indian community that is here,” Haley added.There are no counts of the number of Indian Americans running for office at any time — because the range includes everything from the White House to the county education board and lower — but the number of those elected to the most high-profile positions has been growing over the years.From just the one, Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, the number of Indian Americans in US congress has risen to five — Harris in the Senate and Ami Bera, Pramila Jayapal, Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna in the House of Representatives.Haley is calling for more, up and down the range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brag-about-your-feats-run-for-office-nikki-haley-to-indian-americans/story-pZGOxUHBwKsGkPGFv55s6O.html
09-09-2020||World||‘Those walks in India created a commitment in me’: Harris recalls her grandfather||The Vice Presidential nominee of Democratic Party, Kamala Harris on Wednesday (local time) recalled that her grandfather, P V Gopalan would often take her on his morning walks in India, where he would discuss the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights.“As a young girl, my grandfather would often take me on his morning walks in India, where he’d discuss the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights.

09-09-2020||World||Proud daughter of Indian immigrants: Haley||Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the UN, on Monday night said she is the proud daughter of Indian immigrants while seeking to address the issue of racism as she spoke at the Republican convention to nominate President Donald Trump for a second term.“They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world,” said Haley, one of the most anticipated speakers of the opening night of the convention. She added they faced discrimination and hardship. “But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor.”Also read: Donald Trump woos Indian-American voters, with clips from Howdy ModiHaley, who was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa, has been the first and only Indian American woman governor of a US state yet of any party. She also went to hold the highest federal government office by an Indian-American as Trump’s US ambassador to the UN, a federal cabinet-rank position.Haley is widely expected to run for president someday. Many thought she was looking at a 2020 run when she left her UN job in 2019.There has been speculation though that Trump could name her his vice-presidential nominee, replacing Mike Pence, the incumbent.Haley is not on the ticket yet. But for most Indian-American Republicans, she may be as their answer to Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Harris is the daughter of a mother from India and a father from Jamaica. Harris’s nomination as vice-president made headlines around the world. She is the first Indian-American and Black woman on a presidential ticket yet.Haley and Harris are crucial to their respective party’s evolving strategies for the elections on November 3. With 1.2 million voters, Indian-Americans have emerged as a key constituency for both parties, especially in battleground states, also called swing states, that could settle the race with wafer-thin margins.“Nikki Haley is a very powerful voice with a great appeal,” said Al Mason, who leads the Trump campaign’s outreach to the Indian-American community. “As she is of Indian Heritage; Indian Americans love her. She could be a big influence on the Indian-Americans, eDspecially in the battle the ground states.”“Nikki Haley told the story of America, and it is her personal story too and similar to the most immigrant who come to this great nation,” said Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican exploring a run for Lt Governor of Virginia, a swing state with growing Asian-American population.“A proud successful governor of South Carolina, she highlighted the successes of President Trump and policies of the Republican Party.”Haley remains close to the Trump family, especially Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. And she was given a speaking slot just ahead of Don Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, who spoke on the first night of the convention, which was a mix of in-person and virtually delivered speeches by leading lawmakers and supposedly ordinary Americans with undeclared political agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-daughter-of-indian-immigrants-haley/story-wMgihsQdMGSIrUU5OvZ6cP.html

Its vaccine candidate has been undergoing late-stage trials around the world, with the India leg expected to start soon.The company said in a statement the pause in the global trials was a “routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials”.“In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully,” it added.The announcement came just hours after AstraZeneca joined eight other pharmaceutical giants to release a joint pledge to not apply for regulatory approval or authorisation of their candidate vaccines till their safety and efficacy had been established, a move that they said was “historic”.Signed by the chief executive officers of AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Sanofi, BioNTech and Pfizer, it said the companies would seek regulatory approval or authorisation for vaccines only if their safety and efficacy had been established in Phase 3 clinical trials.“The safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals (is) our top priority,” the companies said in the pledge on Tuesday, titled ‘Biopharma Leaders Unite to Stand with Science.’The companies have between themselves developed 70 novel vaccines in the past.“We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,” they added.AstraZeneca began Phase 3 clinical trials in the US on August 31 on 30,000 volunteers. Called D8110C00001, it is funded by the US department of health and human services and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is led by Dr Anthony Fauci, the foremost US epidemiologist.According to an agreement AstraZeneca had signed with the US government, it was expected to make available at least 300 million doses of the vaccine to the country, with the first lots delivered as early as October 2020, subject to approval by the Food and Drug Administration, the US drug regulator, or its European counterpart.The US has invested billions of dollars in other vaccine projects as well, under a multi-agency programme called ‘Operation Warp Speed’.The safety pledge by the vaccine companies came amid growing perception that despite him claims to the contrary, President Donald Trump is rushing the search for a vaccine breakthrough before November 3, the election day, to help his re-election chances.Also Read: Russian vaccine trials show strong immune response, The Lancet reportsMany Americans are sceptical of the vaccine search and will not be queueing up for a shot when one becomes available, according to polls. A CBS/YouGov poll released on Sunday found that 65% respondents would think the vaccine is “rushed through”, if they were told it had been found. The rest said they would call it a “scientific achievement”.Only 21% of them will try to get a shot “as soon as possible”, down from 32% in July; and 58% will “wait to see what happens”, up from 51% in July. It’s a trend that has been reflected in many recent polls, showing growing scepticism about a coronavirus vaccine.Lately, the president has clashed with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris for their scepticism about his claims. He has demanded an apology from Harris for saying she “would not trust” the president on a vaccine.The Biden-Harris campaign doubled down on their criticism of the president on Tuesday, asking for the criteria that would be used to determine the vaccine is safe and works, who will make that determination and if the vaccine will be distributed “free, safely, equitably, and without politics”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-pauses-covid-19-vaccine-trial-just-after-9-drug-makers-take-safety-pledge/story-RynVLw8YEYgriGUpaX0dcP.html
09-09-2020||India||Numbers prove money given was ‘niggardly’, ‘insufficient’: Chidambaram on govt assistance||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday attacked the government over its assistance to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, alleging that money given was “niggardly and totally insufficient”. The Finance Ministry on Tuesday said more than 42 crore people have received Rs 68,820-crore financial assistance under the government’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to protect the poor and vulnerable from the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. As part of the Rs 1.70 lakh crore PMGKP, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26, the government announced free foodgrains and cash payment to women, poor senior citizens and farmers. Attacking the government, Chidambaram asked, “How much did each beneficiary get under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana? Was it ‘relief’ in any real sense or tokenism?” Under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), 2.81 crore people got Rs 2,814 crore or Rs 1,000 per person, the former finance minister said and asked, “Could that sum have kept body and soul together”. “Jan Dhan account holding women (20.6 crore) got Rs 30,925 crore or Rs 1,500 each over three months. Could a homemaker have run a family on Rs 500 a month?” he said in a series of tweets. “Migrants (2.66 crore) got 2.67 lakh MT of food grains over 2 months. That is 5 kg per month. Could it have sustained a migrant and his family? The numbers prove that the money given was niggardly and totally insufficient,” Chidambaram said. “And certainly, the money could not have acted as a ‘stimulus’ to boost demand and revive the economy,” he added. Under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, the government announced supply of free food grains and chana to migrants for two months, and the estimate of number of migrants provided by the states was about 2.8 crore. “During the distribution period up to August, total 2.67 LMT of food grains was distributed to 5.32 crore migrants. This works out to an average of about 2.66 crore beneficiaries per month, which is nearly 95 per cent of the estimated number of migrants,” the ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/numbers-prove-money-given-was-niggardly-insufficient-chidambaram-on-govt-assistance/story-d2qL1ivddkSvdpy83fRdHP.html

Reviewing the Unlock-4 situation at a high level meeting at his Lok Bhavan office, the CM also said contract tracing work should be done in a well organised manner. “Contact tracing has an important role in controlling the spread of Covid-19 infection. This work should be conducted in a systematic and effective manner. In Lucknow, Prayagraj and Kanpur, contact tracing should be increased,” a statement quoted the chief minister as saying. Underscoring that they are working on a strategy, the CM said the government was committed to protecting the people from Covid-19 and providing better facilities for their medical treatment.The chief minister said people should be made aware of measures for protection from Covid-19. He directed officials to consistently increase the number of beds in L-2 (level 2) and L-3 (level 3) Covid hospitals. The work to increase manpower in Covid hospitals should be expedited by imparting training to doctors and paramedical staff, he said. He also said arrangements for providing PPE (personal protective equipment) kits, gloves, masks and sanitisers should be made to ensure protection of medical staff from Covid-19. Yogi said the chief minister’s helpline should be used to get information about the condition of health of the patients under home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intensify-contact-tracing-in-lucknow-kanpur-prayagraj-yogi-adityanath/story-apxNnih9sJKB0KWDoLX6YK.html

The 28-year0old actor said was forced into making “self-incriminatory” confessions by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and that she was withdrawing them.After questioning her for three consecutive days, NCB arrested Chakraborty on Tuesday in connection with its probe of a drug angle in the death of her boyfriend and actor, Sushant Singh Rajput. A magistrate’s court remanded Chakraborty to 14-day judicial custody.NCB said in its remand application that Chakraborty had revealed her involvement in procuring drugs for Rajput, 32, who was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14.Among other offences, she has been charged under Section 27A of the NDPS Act, which pertains to punishment for financing illicit traffic. The section carries minimum rigorous imprisonment of 10 years, which may be extended to 20 years.Chakraborty’s lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, approached the special court on Wednesday with her plea saying the allegations against her “would at the most make out a case of purchasing small quantity of drug — which is in essence a bailable offence”.“There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender and hence the ingredients of Section 27 A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances,” it said.The court is expected to take up the case on Thursday.Apart from Chakraborty and Showik, NCB has arrested Rajput’s house manager, Samuel Miranda, and a member of his personal staff, Dipesh Sawant. The agency has also arrested Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar for alleged drug peddling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/falsely-implicated-by-ncb-says-rhea-in-bail-plea-to-special-court/story-Ik3zTrgnSTacBgd3vkWuhK.html
09-09-2020||India||China deployed combat vehicles in Tibet plateau, reports state media||Beijing Combat aircraft, artillery, armoured vehicles and special forces from across China were deployed to the Tibetan plateau amid fresh tensions with India, state media reported on Wednesday in a rare acknowledgment of the massive mobilisation along the disputed border. China’s official media usually highlights exercises in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) to reflect the country’s military might along the border with India, as it did in August, and repeatedly during the 2017 Doklam standoff. The more blatant show of military power – including sorties by fighter jets close to the border – is reserved for Taiwan, which Beijing describes as a renegade region to be unified by force if necessary. The words deployment and mobilisation are seldom used in state media reports in the context of the border with India. The news reports didn’t specify since when the troops and equipment were mobilised from different parts of China to the plateau. They attributed the movement of units to “renewed border tensions between China and India” over the past two weeks. The reports said troops, artillery and aircraft were moved to the plateau not only from different parts of China but from different theatre commands. The border with India is under the Western Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the largest of five commands covering the mainland. Several troop formations in northwestern desert areas in Xinjiang and southwestern TAR were engaged in live-fire drills and complex manoeuvres. The nationalistic Global Times tabloid reported “bombers, air defence troops, artillery, armoured vehicles, paratroopers, special forces and infantry units” from across the country were mobilised to the border areas. H-6 bombers and Y-20 large transport aircraft from the PLA Central Theater Command Air Force were deployed to the plateau for training missions, the reports cited the command as saying on Tuesday, a day after the latest face-off on the south bank of Pangong Lake. National broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported HJ-10 anti-tank missile systems attached to the PLA 71st Group Army were recently moved from eastern Jiangsu province to the northwestern Gobi desert, more than 1,600 km away. For PLA, it would be easier to dispatch troops and equipment to the northwest from the Gobi desert region. An air defence brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army also mobilised to the northwest region in autumn and held live-fire confrontational drills with anti-aircraft guns and missiles, CCTV reported on Friday. CCTV also reported paratroopers and heavy equipment on board PLA Air Force’s transport aircraft recently conducted a “multidimensional area capture and control exercise” in the deserts of northwest China. The state media reports also said troops had been engaged in “long-distance manoeuvres, deployment exercises and live-fire drills” in desert areas and TAR over the past few weeks. Chinese military experts HT reached out to didn’t comment on the matter. India has consistently rejected China’s claims that Indian troops crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, and asserted that it has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-deployed-combat-vehicles-in-tibet-plateau-reports-state-media/story-HrQI0PuhJxNiYgx7Ow3eUP.html
09-09-2020||India||PLA increases troops in Finger Four region||New Delhi: At a time when the Chinese foreign ministry is expressing hope of troops going back to their camping areas from the present confrontation points in Ladakh, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is showing no such signs on the ground and has undertaken force accretion on the contested Finger Four relief feature of Pangong Tso.The doubling of PLA troop strength on Finger Four on the north bank of Pangong Tso has sowed distrust in the Indian Army’s mind about the sincerity of Beijing’s offer even as it holds dominant positions south of the saltwater lake. The only other explanation is that the Chinese foreign ministry is not on the same page as the Western Theatre Commander of the PLA.External affairs minister S Jaishankar is meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the border situation and remind Beijing about the bilateral commitment to peace and tranquillity accords signed since 1993 which pertain to minimum troop deployment along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The fundamental problem facing the Indian Army in proposed disengagement and de-escalation is lack of any Chinese guarantee that the PLA will not occupy those positions vacated by the Indian troops south of Pangong Tso. Just as the PLA has taken dominant positions up to Finger 4 on the north bank, the Indian Army is now holding the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline right upto its perception of the LAC. The PLA troops are virtually contesting these Indian positions through large-scale deployments south of the lake.Although the Chinese spokesperson on Tuesday talked about harsh weather conditions in the area, fact is that the Indian Army has been used to such conditions since Operation Meghdoot in Siachen in 1984. “ The Indian soldier is prepared for mountain and snow from the very beginning with virtually all of them serving either on the Line of Control with Pakistan, Siachen Glacier or the LAC,” said a military commander, who didn’t want to be named. The PLA, on the other hand, last bled in Vietnam in 1979.The basic problem facing disengagement is that the Chinese have road infrastructure right upto the LAC in Ladakh while Indian Army troops have to traverse mountain passes, nullahs and ridges to reach their current posts and positions. “If China is serious about disengagement and de-escalation, then both sides have to bilaterally commit that the other side will not occupy the heights once vacated by the present occupant. Only then will the disengagement be successful,” said a second military commander. In the past 27 years, the PLA has nibbled into the LAC while Indian Army troops, with their defensive mindset, sticking only to the patrolling points (defined by the China Study Group), which fall well short of the Indian perception line. The Indian Army’s posture has changed since the initial PLA transgressions in May. And this time, the troops are not even willing to yield an inch within their side of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-increases-troops-in-finger-four-region/story-Jilzxs27r1PjqIPlJfOmaK.html

Forty-three year-old Ramananda Sarkar would know. In the past five months, he’s helped with the last rites of nearly 400 Covid-19 deaths in Guwahati, the biggest city of Assam. “I’ve been conducting last rites of Covid-19 patients since April and till Tuesday have done nearly 400 cremations till date. Earlier, it used to be 1-2 cases in a day, but since the past one month we have 10-12 cremations daily,” said Sarkar, who works at the Ulubari crematorium in Guwahati. In past few weeks, Assam has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases as well as deaths. The state had recorded 130,823 positive cases till Tuesday and 378 deaths. Kamrup Metropolitan district, which includes Guwahati, is the worst affected with 500-600 new cases daily. According to district officials, over 400 cremations have been conducted till date at the Ulubari crematorium, which is handling the bulk of the load while a few cases are shifted to Bhootnath crematorium, the other designated place for cremating bodies of Covid-19 patients. Seventy two more patients have been buried at the Athgaon and Islampur cemeteries in the city. “These days I and my two assistants start conducting last rites daily at 3 pm and by the time we finish it’s nearly 2 am or 3 am. I am getting tired and it seems the flow of bodies won’t stop and there’s no rest for us. Earlier, I used to be afraid to handle bodies of Covid-19 patients, not anymore,” said Sarkar. A resident of Jagiroad in Morigaon district of central Assam, Sarkar had come to Guwahati two years ago and was working at the Bhootnath crematorium before his services were hired by the district administration and he was shifted to Ulubari. These days he stays at a hotel at government expense. He has been tested several times for Covid-19, but not detected positive yet. According to health officials, though the official death count due to Covid-19 is 378, the number of patients who tested positive for the disease but died due to other co-morbidities is over 500 as the death audit board (DAB) doesn’t count them or those who test positive posthumously as Covid-19 deaths. In the past few days, there have been rumours that due to increase in fatalities, bodies of Covid-19 patients have been lying in morgues for days due to lack of enough manpower to dispose them. “The Kamrup Metro administration is also facing a tough time cremating the Covid-19 deaths. Resources are stretched to a limit and the team is working overtime,” Dr Navanil Barua, head of neurosurgery at Guwahati’s GNRC Hospital wrote on Facebook on September 6. “When my brother in law died of Covid-19, he was in serial number 17 waiting for cremation. As deaths mount, waiting time shall also mount as Covid-19 deaths are not handed over to relatives. Also, Guwahati might run out of morgue space too,” he added. The district administration, however, stated that the problem was due to laxity on the part of private hospitals intimating the DAB about Covid-19 deaths. “We are not having any issues in disposing bodies of patients who die at Guwahati Medical College Hospital, the state’s biggest government hospital,” said Chinmoy Nath, additional deputy commissioner, Kamrup Metropolitan. “But there’s delay in performing last rites of those who expire at private hospitals as they inform the DAB about the deaths sometimes after 2-3 days. We can easily perform last rites of 10-15 patients daily at the designated places and there’s enough manpower also available now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-m-tired-says-43-year-old-assam-man-who-has-cremated-400-covid-19-victims/story-JU4ey92qRJGSEBez5aAWRL.html

09-09-2020||India||New roles finalised for restructured rly board||New Delhi: Centre has finalised the work allocation of its restructured Railway Board, with the Chairman and CEO in charge of key divisions including safety, human resources, security and infrastructure portfolios.According to a railway board order reviewed by Hindustan Times, the government has also finalised Cadre Controlling Authorities (CCAs) for existing railway services before its unified cadre, the Indian Railway Management Service, becomes functional. In December 2019, the Union cabinet approved plans to trim the strength of the board to half, unify eight railway services (traffic, accounts, personnel, engineering, stores, electrical engineering, signal engineering and mechanical engineering) in a central service called the Indian Railway Management Service as part of a major reform of the 150-year-old transporter . As the first chief operating officer of the national carrier, the railway board chairman will be the cadre controlling officer responsible for human resources (HR), with assistance from a director general (HR). The other portfolios, which have an overarching effect on the running of railways and its immediate modernisation plans, have been entrusted to the CEO; the portfolios include safety, security, health, planning, infrastructure, vigilance, efficiency, research, public relations, heritage, the transformation cell and “corporate coordination.” The appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) earlier this month formally approved the restructuring of the Railway Board and approved the appointment of VK Yadav, the chairman of the railway board, as its first CEO.With the new rearrangement, three apex level posts -- member (staff), member (engineering) and member (materials management) in Railway Board have been surrendered and the post of member (rolling stock) has been utilised for creation of the post of director general (HR).The railway board is the apex body of Indian Railways which reports to Parliament via the ministry of railways. It will now consist of the chairperson and four members, in charge of infrastructure, operations and business development, rolling stock and finance, respectively .According to the railway board order issued on Tuesday: other members of the board including member (infrastructure) have been allotted work related to civil engineering, bridges, signals and telecom, land and amenities, station development and railway electrification.Member (traction and rolling stock) will be in charge of production units, mechanical workshops, coaches and trainsets, among other things. Member (operations and business development), will be responsible for traffic transportation, tourism and catering, non-fare revenue and marketing. Member (finance) will oversee all accounts and revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-roles-finalised-for-restructured-rly-board/story-vfu74snXc8JFOqTupbfo5L.html
09-09-2020||India||Air passengers entitled to refunds due to lockdown, Centre tells SC||The Centre assured the Supreme Court on Wednesday that all air passengers will be entitled to claim refunds for flights cancelled during the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19, regardless of when they booked the ticket.“We intend refund of all cancelled flights during the lockdown. There is no catch on when the tickets were booked.” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said,.The statement came during proceedings on a bunch of public interest litigations filed by air passengers under the banner Pravasi Legal Cell, seeking refunds for flights booked prior to the lockdown that was enforced on March 25. Individual passengers, too, filed similar petitions that were heard together by the Court.The bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, asked Mehta to file an affidavit explaining the Centre’s position within a week.The bench said: “In your affidavit you (Centre) have said (in the case of) tickets booked during the first lockdown period (March 25- April 14) for travel during the lockdown period till May 3, full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. The petitioners want to know will those who booked tickets before that date also be entitled?.” The Court gave the Centre a week’s time to clarify its position and posted the matter for hearing on September 23.Last week, an affidavit filed by the Centre outlined a scheme for passengers who demanded refund of fares for flights that were cancelled during the lockdown. By a notification of April 16, 2020, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered full refund of tickets booked during the lockdown, but those who booked prior to this date were not considered for similar relief. Passengers claimed that airlines were wrong in denying them a refund and wanted credit for future travel with the carriers. The flight operators, on the other hand, claimed helplessness in repaying the money after being hit badly by the lockdown.On the top court’s prodding, government officials, along with the DGCA and flight operators, met in July and formulated a scheme to protect in interests of both passengers and airlines. The scheme promised immediate refunds for tickets booked between March 25 and April 14, the period coinciding with first lockdown. “For all other cases, the airlines shall make all endeavors to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days,” the scheme added.The solicitor general clarified on Wednesday that this sentence will cover even those tickets booked prior to lockdown.Mehta said, “This scheme is subject to the final approval of the Court. Tickets have to be refunded. If not in cash, the airlines must create a credit shell in the name of the passenger that can be availed on any route for travel on or before March 31, 2021. The Centre has taken care of the interests of both passengers and airlines with this scheme.”Senior advocate CA Sundaram, who appeared for the Air Passengers Association, said, “We are largely agreeable to the proposed scheme.” He proposed higher interest on the money deposited with the credit shell. The rate fixed by the Centre was 0.5% per month from the date of cancellation till June 30 and thereafter, 0.75% every month till March 31, 2021..IndiGo, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, said it was “by and large happy” but sought a little tweaking of some formulations. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for SpiceJet. endorsed the scheme while senior counsel Arvind Datar, appearing for GoAir, claimed that the carrier was not in a position to pay as it had so many other financial commitments. Vistara and Air Asia also supported the stand taken by Datar. The court gave a week’s time to all airlines to respond on the government’s affidavit containing the scheme.The court also allowed tour operators’ associations to give their response as they were not happy with the proposal to open a credit shell in the name of a passenger. Since they book tickets in bulk, the tour operators demanded that for tickets booked by them, the credit shell should be in their name and they would transfer the refund to the passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-passengers-entitled-to-refunds-due-to-lockdown-centre-tells-sc/story-tikDRzFwoA2CpM9dp8czAK.html

Maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region got the top billing at Wednesday’s meeting held over video conference.The officials spoke about “enhancing maritime security cooperation” including maritime domain awareness, mutual logistics support and capacity building of other friendly countries in the Indo-Pacific region, people familiar with the matter said.There was broad agreement among the three partners that they should look at a multi-polar world where countries join hands for mutual benefit and support rather than a unipolar or multipolar world.China did figure in the discussions but the meeting wasn’t focussed on one country. It took an overarching view, one Indian official later told Hindustan Times. The virtual meeting was co-chaired by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, secretary-general in French ministry for Europe and foreign affairs François Delattre and secretary in Australian department of foreign affairs Frances Adamson.ON THE TRILATERAL TABLEMARITIME SECURITY COOPERATIONExplore trilateral cooperation in mutual logistics supportConsider greater operational coordination towards maritime security Collaborate to set up a pan Indian Ocean Region- Search and Rescue mechanismJoin hands in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster ReliefPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCHCollaborate on therapeutics and vaccine for COVID-19BLUE ECONOMYBlue Economy initiatives such as hydrography, meteorology and oceanography, and marine medicine Environmental Challenges- marine pollution, etc.Collaborate on identifying, monitoring and reducing pollution sourcesINTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCEPromote solar-energy based solutions in countries of the regionFrench President Macron was among the first to call for building a strategic alliance between the three countries that could respond to challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and the growing assertiveness of China. On a visit to Australia before he flew down to India back in May 2018, President Macron had spoken about the need for the partners to ‘organise’ themselves. “We’re not naive: if we want to be seen and respected by China as an equal partner, we must organize ourselves,” President Macron said in a speech at an Australian naval base. “This new Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis is absolutely key for the region and our joint objectives in the Indian-Pacific region,” he said, according to a 2018 Reuters report.On the India leg of his trip, President Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a blueprint to step up cooperation in the Indian Ocean to counter China’s growing influence in the region.“The Indian Ocean, like the Pacific Ocean, cannot become a place of hegemony,” President Macron said as the two countries signed pacts that gave Indian warships access to French naval bases in the Indian Ocean.At Wednesday’s meeting, Indian foreign secretary Shringla underscored PM Modi’s vision for the Indo-Pacific that he had articulated at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2018 to promote the concept of Security and Growth for All in the Region or SAGAR.The three countries also discussed cooperation on marine global commons – blue economy, marine biodiversity and environmental challenges such as marine pollution.

A majority of the people were obeying the guidelines and it was because of a few violators the infection was spreading. The spread of the virus due to the callous attitude of a few people will not be tolerated,” said Patnaik, amid reports of people not wearing masks properly and flouting social distancing rules in public places.The chief minister’s warning came in the background of rising local transmission in Bhubaneswar where more than 400-450 news cases are being reported daily.Last month, Odisha had announced amendment in Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to increase imprisonment to two years with a fine of Rs 1 lakh for people not wearing masks.Two days ago, special relief commissioner Pradip Jena had said people in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, the two hotspots, have become callous and there is no seriousness towards the Covid-19 pandemic. Jena said 10 senior IAS and IPS officers had conducted surprise visits in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar and later drone cameras were used to watch public behaviour.“The videos showed that people are crowding markets, not maintaining social distancing and also not wearing masks. With such behaviour, we are inviting the virus home and will never be able to win this fight against Covid-19. Such unnecessary trips outside the house should be avoided,” said the CM.Patnaik also directed authorities to increase the number of ambulance services and make more ICU facilities available for critical patients. Officials in the meeting said that the recovery rate in Odisha has climbed to 77.8%, higher than the national recovery rate while the fatality ratio in the state was 0.43%, lowest in the country.Odisha has emerged second among states in the country by conducting 1,265 tests per million per day, compared to the national average of 580. Only Goa is doing more tests than Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/absue-of-covid-rules-by-callous-few-won-t-be-tolerated-naveen-patnaik/story-IeajK0woVRYYl0hveGi65K.html
09-09-2020||India||SC seeks response from Centre, states on reopening of places of worship amid Covid-19||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider a PIL which questioned the closure of religious places during the Covid-19 pandemic even as states are giving markets, manufacturing units and liquor stores priority to remain open.“The pandemic due to unemployment, financial stress, etc. has affected the mental health of many followers and worshippers which can be majorly resolved by allowing religious places to reopen and helping them attain spiritual peace and happiness,” said a petition filed by a Gujarat-based public trust Gitarth Ganga Trust. The petitioner demanded opening of all places of worship belonging to all religions.“Even when the Ministry of Home Affairs has allowed opening of religious places under its May 30 “Unlock 1.0” guidelines, no order has been passed by states for nearly three months to allow opening of places of worship of all religions abiding with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) issued for containing the spread of Covid-19 released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on June 8, 2020,” said advocate Surjendu Sankar Das, who filed the petition for the trust.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice on the petition to the Centre and all states and union territories. Interestingly, the CJI-headed bench on August 21 had allowed opening of three Jain temples in Mumbai for the last two days of the Paryushan festival. While allowing five devotees at a time to offer worship at the Jain temples in Dadar, Byculla and Chembur, the bench had remarked, “We find it strange that you (Maharashtra government) are allowing every activity involving economic interests and money. But if it involves religion, you say you cannot do it because of Covid-19.” The present petition has adopted a similar line of argument by stating, “In permitting businesses and commercial activities and prohibiting religious practices, the states have weighed the risk of a Covid-19 outbreak with the “reward” of the value of the business.” The petition goes on to state that it is concerned for the “well-being and spiritual happiness of each and every resident of India” and wants all religious places to open with all necessary precautions as not doing so violates fundamental rights of citizens to practice and profess any religion protected under Articles 25 and 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-response-from-centre-states-on-reopening-of-places-of-worship-amid-covid-19/story-3BT8TqSzx3R9uj82tAZSBM.html

09-09-2020||India||At Rajasthan Congress feedback meet, slogans against minister, posters torn||At a Rajasthan Congress feedback meeting helmed by Ajay Maken, the Ajmer police had to disperse party workers who allegedly tore posters and raised slogans against health minister Raghu Sharma on Wednesday. A section claimed that some members were detained. Rakesh Pareek, Congress MLA from Masudha, reached the police station and asked to free the workers. Then, along with his supporters, he sat outside the police station. However, superintendent of police, Ajmer, Kunwar Rashtradeep said they were some who were tearing posters and as a precautionary step they were dispersed. The officer denied that members have been arrested. The incident happened outside a hotel in Ajmer, where Congress AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, along with co-incharge Vivek Bansal, state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra, minister Raghu Sharma and Pramod Jain were holding a feedback meeting to strengthen party organisation. Addressing the media, Pareek said, “When we came out from the meeting, we learnt that supporters of leaders were raising slogans. The police misbehaved with some of the workers from Masudha assembly constituency. They were also asked to remove clothes – what crime have they done?” He said, “Raising Sachin Pilot Jindabad slogans cannot be a crime. No leader is involved but some prejudiced officers. There is no BJP, all were Congress workers here – they (officials) did it to get a good posting. We will speak to the CM, Pilot, state party chief and apprise Ajay Maken. This is an intolerable act and action should be taken against those responsible.”A leader on condition of anonymity said that some people first tried to enter inside the meeting and when denied shouted slogans against Raghu Sharma and tore posters. Maken had met workers and leaders of Ajmer division today and will next be meeting those from the Jaipur division tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-rajasthan-congress-feedback-meet-slogans-against-minister-posters-torn/story-L9ISrgz2vB317wZZJs5MTO.html
09-09-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty retracts confession in drugs case, says she was forced by NCB||Actor Rhea Chakroborty and her brother Showik have approached the special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for bail as their pleas were rejected by the Magistrate court on Wednesday. Showik Chakraborty, Sushant’s house manager Samuel Miranda and Sushant’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant, and Bandra residents Zaid Vilatra, Abdel Basit Parihar who were arrested for allegedly peddling drugs were produced before a magistrate court which sent them to judicial custody till September 23, said NCB officials.They have all applied for bail but the matter has been adjourned till tomorrow.In her plea, Rhea has stated that she is innocent and falsely implicated in the case. Further, it is claimed that Rhea “was coerced into making self-incriminatory confessions and by her application on September 8 the applicant has formally retracted all such incriminatory confessions”. The actor’s bail plea too was not accepted by the court after the prosecution raised objections regarding jurisdiction of the magistrate court to hear her plea. Questioned for three days by all levels of officers of the NCB from September 6 to 8, Rhea was formally arrested on Tuesday. “There was not a single lady officer who interrogated the present applicant as mandated by law. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Sheela Barse VS State Maharashtra, has held that the interrogation of females should be carried out only in the presence of a female police officer/constable,” reads the bail application, highlighting that the agency failed to comply with the guidelines of the apex court. The sister-brother duo has been booked under Section 27 A of the NDPS Act which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders. As per the provisions, if found guilty the two can face imprisonment not less than 10 years and can also be fined Rs 2 lakh. They have been arrested for allegedly arranging a narcotic substance for actor Sushant Singh Rajput. After the bail pleas were turned down by the magistrate court, the 28-year-old’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde approached the special court. The pleas are scheduled for hearing on Thursday where the investigating agency would be required to file their reply before the special court. The defense has raised the issue of applicability of charges of Section 27 A of NDPS Act against the two. In Rhea’s plea, the defense has stated, “The allegations against the present accused would at the most make out a case of purchasing a small quantity of drug which is in essence a bailable offence. There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offender and hence the ingredients of Section 27 A of the NDPS Act are not made out in present facts and circumstances.” “The respondent (NCB) is silent as to the amount of financing, quantum of drugs and the type of drugs allegedly procured and financed by the present applicant. The case of the respondent in the layman term is that the applicant would co-ordinate the delivery of the drug for her then boyfriend and occasionally pay for them herself. In essence, her alleged role, if any, is purchase of a small quantity of drugs for her then boyfriend which would squarely fall within the ambit of Section 20 (b) (ii) (A) (produces, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports, imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses cannabis,) which is punishable with a maximum imprisonment of upto a year or with fine or both,” reads the bail plea filed by Rhea’s lawyer. The defense alleged that even though the role attributed to Rhea and her brother Showik is identical to that of another accused in the case – Kaizan Ebrahim, NCB selectively invoked charges of Section 27 A only against Rhea and Showik.“The co-accused Kaizan was in fact released on provisional cash bail on the very first day of his remand by the magistrate court,” defense claimed in Rhea’s bail plea, adding that the agency did not even ask for his custody. The defense have cited several rulings of the Supreme Court to support their contention and contented that in a case when the person is found to have been booked under bailable offence he or she is entitled for bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forced-confessions-quizzed-by-male-officers-rhea-chakraborty-seeks-bail/story-njgg7EohHz4T6sT0Og50kJ.html

Two composite teams of SOG and DVF had participated in this operation.Following heavy firing from the ultras near Sirki village in Belghar area of Kandhamal district at around 11 am today, the teams resorted to retaliatory firing, said an official statement issued by the Odisha police.“The exchange of fire lasted for around 30 minutes, during which four Maoists were neutralised and a SOG Jawan suffered injuries. More teams of SOG, DVF and CRPF have been sent to the area for combing and search operations,” said Thakur. Five armed weapons have been recovered from the spot. However, the rank of the deceased Maoists is yet to be verified.On July 23, two more Maoists were killed in an exchange of fire with the anti-Maoist cops in Kandhamal.Earlier on July 5, five Maoists, including two women, were killed by the security forces in Sirla Reserve forest area under Tumudibandha police station of Kandhamal district.One of the dead Maoists was Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of the Odisha State Committee of the CPI(Maoist) with a bounty of Rs 20 lakh on his head. Maoist activities declined considerably in Odisha in 2019 with just 14 incidents of Maoist-linked killings reported in which 19 deaths were reported. Of the 19 deaths, 10 were civilians who were killed by the Maoists over allegations of being a police informer.In 2019, 13 Maoists had surrendered. But despite the declining Maoist presence, the Kandhamal-Kalahandi-Boudh-Nayagarh (KKBN) division of the CPI-Maoist that operates in the hilly and forested patches of the state has been a matter of concern for police.Odisha director general of police Abhay recently said with Maoist situation improving in the state and more rebels surrendering due to an aggressive police action, the state has now recommended to the Centre to drop the districts of Angul, Boudh, Sambalpur, Deogarh and Nayagarh from the list of Maoist-affected districts.Once the MHA excludes these districts, Odisha would have 10 districts under SRE, a scheme that supplements the efforts of the Maoist-affected states by reimbursing the expenditure incurred by them on anti-Maoist activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-suspected-maoists-killed-in-encounter-with-odisha-police-combing-ops-on/story-teivXZkuM4rEf1dsXpU1SI.html

09-09-2020||India||Telangana to set up task force to monitor treatment for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday announced the setting up of a task force headed by a senior IAS officer, to monitor treatment of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals in the state at an affordable cost. Intervening during the short-discussion in the state assembly on the Coronavirus pandemic, the chief minister said there had been innumerable complaints from all quarters over the exorbitant charges being collected by private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. KCR, as the chief minister is called, agreed with the suggestions made by several members that there should be more control over corporate hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. “Right from the beginning, I had been saying that treatment for Covid-19 should be given only in government hospitals, as the corporate hospitals would fleece patients. However, we had no option but to allow corporate hospitals to admit Covid-19 patients after the high court’s intervention,” he said. He said it was unfortunate that these hospitals were extorting money from patients in the name of treating the coronavirus disease at this troubled time. “Is this the time for corporate hospitals to fleece patients for money, taking advantage of their misery?” he asked. Stating that the government would now initiate stern action against the corporate hospitals collecting exorbitant fees from Covid-19 patients, the chief minister said the task force which would be formed on Wednesday and would release weekly reports on the status of treatment in these hospitals. “These reports will also be sent to the leaders of all the opposition parties in the state to create wide social awareness about the “cruel” ways of the hospitals in extorting money from the victims of the pandemic,” KCR said. Reacting to suggestions by Congress floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, the chief minister said the government would examine the possibility of including Covid-19 under Arogyasri, the state government’s health scheme for the poor and government employees. “The government will also consider reimbursement of bills paid by white ration card holders who underwent treatment for Covid-19 in private hospitals,” he said. The chief minister lashed out at the Centre for releasing paltry funds to the states at a time when it should come to their rescue to fight the pandemic. It had released only Rs 256 crore under the National Health Mission, apart from 647 ventilators to the state, he said. He demanded that the Centre increase the budgetary allocations on improving the medical and health infrastructure in the state. “Our government is also planning to increase the budget for medical and health to tackle any emergency like Covid-19 in future,” he said. Earlier, making a statement in the House, state health minister Eatala Rajender said the state had so far registered 1,45,163 cases as on September 7, of which 1,12,587 patients had recovered. Of the remaining, 24,579 patients were in home quarantine and 7,091 people were getting treatment at various hospitals, while 906 people had died. The recovery rate of Telangana is 77.6% which is at par with India’s recovery rate. However, the death rate at the national level is 1.7% whereas in Telangana it is 0.62%. The number of deaths in the entire country is 72,830. Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of deaths i.e. 27,027 while Telangana is at 12th position with 906 deaths. He said tests for Covid-19 were being conducted in 38 private laboratories as well apart from government hospitals. At present, around 60 thousand tests are being conducted daily in the state, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-set-up-task-force-to-monitor-treatment-for-covid-19-patients-in-private-hospitals/story-XtRG630I8eshpN0T8uREgO.html

He will also interact with the beneficiaries on the occasion.Among other launches by Modi is the comprehensive fish production technology centre at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University in Pusa in Bihar.  The centre, with facilities for seed production technology and demonstration unit technology for fish, referral laboratory and diagnostic testing, will facilitate in boosting fish production and assist in capacity building of fish farmers, the PMO said.The PMMSY aims at enhancing fish production by an additional 70 lakh tonne by 2024-25, increasing fisheries export earnings to Rs 1,00,000 crore by 2024-25, doubling of incomes of fishers and fish farmers, reducing post-harvest losses from 20-25 per cent to about 10 per cent and generation of additional 55 lakhs direct and indirect gainful employment opportunities in fisheries sector and allied activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-flagship-fisheries-scheme-app-for-farmers-on-thursday/story-L12vvxfgwrgZ4Qn8uKUboN.html

09-09-2020||India||With a recovery rate of 88.98%, Bihar ahead of other states on Covid-19 parameters||Bihar has a reason to be hopeful over its management of the Covid-19 health crisis. At six deaths per million, it ranks the best in this category. Kerala and Assam, with 10 deaths per million each, are next, according to government data released on Tuesday.Bihar’s test positivity rate was also the lowest at 0.9%, followed by Gujarat (1.8%) and Uttar Pradesh (4.3%) on September 8. The growth rate for Covid-19 cases in Bihar is the lowest at 1.3% at par with Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, against a national average of 2.14% in the week ending September 8. Some other states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have a few things to ponder over. At 10,343 cases per million, Delhi ranked the highest, followed by Andhra Pradesh (9,363) and Maharashtra (7,500). Delhi also ranked highest in terms of Covid-19 deaths per million (246), followed by Maharashtra (219) and Tamil Nadu (102). Bihar has been able to shed the ignominy of being the state with lowest tests per million — a position it had occupied till early August — with the ramping up of testing facilities after July 27, when Pratyaya Amrit was posted as the principal secretary of Bihar’s health department. On Monday, Bihar tested 1,53,156 lakh samples, the highest in a day so far, with the average daily testing hovering over 1 lakh tests since August 13. The increased testing had led to a decline in its tests’ positivity rate. Most tests being done were rapid antigen-based, which had up to 40% probability of giving false negative results. The Centre has already advised states to mandatorily do RT-PCR tests of Covid-19 symptomatic people, testing negative on rapid antigen kit. However, many states were not following this practice, leaving out missing cases, said a senior officer of the health ministry. Bihar, for instance, had done reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of only 6.55% (9,901) samples out of the total 1,51,033 tested on September 5. Rapid antigen tests accounted for 1,36,870, while another 4,262 tests were done on TrueNat machines. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had on May 19 revised its testing guidelines to allow the use of the TrueNat system for screening and confirmation of Covid-19. The test uses a person’s nose or throat swab samples. The nucleic acid extracted from the sample has to be followed by an RT-PCR. Unlike traditional RT-PCR tests, the sample preparation in TrueNAT tests is automated, and the results are available within half an hour. Only 3.11% (1,364) institutional beds were utilised out of the total 43,748 Covid-19 isolation beds available at different levels, while 14,401 patients were under home isolation as per government data of September 5. Bihar’s case recovery rate was 88.98% as against the national average of 77.65% on Tuesday. Health officials were not willing to come on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-a-recovery-rate-of-88-98-bihar-ahead-of-other-states-on-covid-19-parameters/story-VWoDesOq4AFbJw5YN5Uf6H.html

Her family blamed a man from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district with whom she had become friends over TikTok, for her death. They alleged he had been harassing her for months and extorted money from her.But police said there was an argument in the family before she was found dead.“Preliminary investigations revealed that there was an argument between the actor and family members before she went to her room and allegedly hanged herself. We are on the lookout for the man who allegedly harassed her,” inspector Narasimha Reddy of the S.R. Nagar police station said. “We rushed to the spot and shifted the body to Osmania General Hospital for post mortem. We have registered a case and are investigating,” he said. The actor’s mother claimed that the police had called the man once to the police station following a complaint by her daughter but let him off. “She was forced to pay him money in different instalments. But when he did not stop harassment, she lodged a complaint with the police in June. The police called him but let him off after he apologised and assured not to repeat the offence,” her mother said. “But he continued to torture my daughter forcing her to take to extreme step,” she added. She claimed her daughter returned home from shooting late in the night and straightaway went into her bedroom. Her family members thought she had locked inside to change clothes. “When she did not come out even after a long time, we broke open the door only to find her hanging from the ceiling fan,” she told reporters.

In his address via webcast to street vendors of Madhya Pradesh, Modi said work was going on at a rapid pace on the platform.PM Modi, who interacted with three vendors from the state’s Sanver (Indore), Gwalior and Sanchi, said the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the poor and the society’s deprived sections most. He added the government has made efforts to help them through various scheme. “The government will ensure that those registered under Pradhan Mantri SVANidhi Yojna are taken care of and provided all basic amenities.” The SVANidhi Yojna has been formulated for street vendors to provide them access to affordable loans for resuming their livelihoods hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Also read: Not just our products, India’s voice has also become global, says PM Modi“Under the scheme, the government will see if the street vendors are getting the benefits of Ujjawala [for distribution of LPG connections], Ayushman Bharat [health insurance scheme], housing and other government schemes. If they do not... the government will work on it on a priority basis.”Modi said the SVANidhi Yojna has given a new identity and opportunity to a large number of street vendors to resume and promote their businesses. He said Rs 10,000 loans can be initially taken under the scheme. Modi added street vendors could improve their borrowing capacity gradually by improving their business and repaying loans on time.He called on vendors to come up with innovative ideas to take their businesses to new levels and work on digital payments. “In the last four years, digital transactions have gone up. During Covid-19 period, we saw it was necessary also. Now customers avoid making a cash payment.”Modi said many people talked about the poor repeatedly but the work done for them in the last six years in a planned manner was never done before. “Several steps were taken...to help the poor become self-reliant and fight against poverty on their own and come out it.” He said the Centre’s schemes have supported Dalits, tribals and other have-nots.Modi said the poor once would not go to the banks out of fear of papers but now 400 million people have their bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. “It is because of Jan Dhan Yojna that the poor are linked with the banks, getting easy loans and could get out of tentacles of moneylenders. It is because of these bank accounts that the poor are getting houses without paying bribes. Farmers are getting assistance directly in their bank accounts.”He said during the pandemic over 200 million women got Rs 31,000 crore in their accounts thanks to the Jan Dhan Yojna. “Similarly, under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, more than Rs 94,000 crore were transferred directly to the bank accounts of more than 100 million farmers.”He said soon every village would be linked with online markets and thus the world would be linked to villages. “We resolved on August 15 this year to provide optical fibre to every village in 1,000 days. Thus every village will have internet facility and thus the villages too will benefit from the digital revolution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/svanidhi-yojna-gives-new-identity-opportunity-pm-modi-to-madhya-pradesh-street-vendors/story-caf9IIBQeY2i2Q0tkz4PzJ.html
09-09-2020||India||What Sharad Pawar said on demolition job at Kangana Ranaut’s office||The Mumbai civic body’s demolition drive at Kangana Ranaut’s Mumbai office in the wake of recent controversial remarks by the actor gives people reasons to doubt, said Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, whose party is part of the Maharashtra government.To the actor’s comment comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to counter Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut who had slammed her for saying she was scared of the Mumbai police, the veteran leader said people don’t take such statements seriously.The Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) team reached the actor’s bungalow at Pali Hill in Bandra with bulldozer and excavators and demolished alterations made sans the civic body’s approval.“I am never wrong and my enemies prove again and again this is why my Mumbai is POK now,” Kangana tweeted, soon after the demolition work began. She also posted photos of BMC staff engaged in the demolition work.Pawar said that the BMC officials may have found it appropriate to take action, however, their action also gives an opportunity to some to raise doubts considering the prevailing situation.“We are giving too much importance to the people making such statements. One must understand the impact of such statements on the people at large,” said Pawar, who was speaking to reporters at YB Chavan Centre at Nariman Point in the city after a book launch ceremony.Supporting the Mumbai police force, the former chief minister said people of Maharashtra and Mumbai have an experience of years of the police and know how dutiful their force is.“In my view, people don’t take such statements seriously. They have an experience of years of police force and are aware how dutiful they are. We don’t need to take it seriously even if someone is saying that very often,” Pawar said.Responding to the BMC’s action, Pawar said he has no information if there was anything illegal or not but the action has given an opportunity to the people to raise doubt, indicating that it could have been avoided.“I don’t know if there was anything illegal and read about it only in the newspapers. It won’t be appropriate to comment on this without having proper information. Illegal work is not a new thing in Mumbai. However, BMCs action in the backdrop of the ongoing situation allows people to raise doubt over it. BMC officials have their own rules and may have found it appropriate to take the action,” said the veteran leader.Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court stayed the demolition process initiated by the BMC for illegal construction and sought to know how the civic body entered the property when the owner was not present.Before the demolition work on Wednesday, the BMC posted a second notice outside the actor’s bungalow, informing her of the action being taken by the civic body, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-sharad-pawar-said-on-demolition-work-at-kangana-ranaut-s-mumbai-office/story-Rce6fBMrZSenNDppkfbd6N.html
09-09-2020||India||As some states oppose borrowing money, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy says it is the only way to overcome GST shortfall||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy has called borrowing the only way to overcome the crisis states face amid the Centre’s inability to reimburse them for the shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in their share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue this financial year.“The only way to overcome the crisis is borrowing. The Centre has also asked the states to go for additional borrowings. As we cannot tax people more, we are working on possible additional revenue-generating options,” said Reddy in an interview to HT.Reddy’s comments came even as some states have opposed the option of borrowing the Centre has given to states because of delays in GST compensation. Also Read: Jagan govt withdraws subsidy to Discoms, to directly transfer power bill amount to farmersWest Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Monday said state governments were not in a position to borrow any money from the market and criticised the Centre for imposing the idea on them with no proper consultation.At a GST Council meeting on August 27, the Centre gave the states’ option of either borrowing the compensation amount arising from implementing GST (Rs 97,000 crore) or the entire shortfall (Rs 2.35 lakh crore). If they exercise the first option, the interest and principal amount will come from the cess levied on products like liquor, cigarettes, aerated water and automobiles. In the case of the second option, the states will have to bear the interest burden.Reddy said the Centre is taking its time and paying a little late, but it is not that there has been any drastic cut-down. “They have been passing on [the money] with some delays. This is understandable, keeping in view the Covid-19 situation and its impact on the country’s economy,” he said.Also Read: Building a revenue-earning city to compensate for the loss of Hyderabad ‘perverted thinking’: Jaganmohan ReddyThe Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent 68-day hard lockdown have taken a toll on the economy, causing a 23.9% contraction in the quarter that ended on June 30.HT on Tuesday reported the Centre remains committed to reimbursing states the entire shortfall and that only immediate compensation may not be forthcoming.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on September 2 wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that she was “deeply anguished” by the GST imbroglio which was violating the very premise of federalism. She said the Centre is duty-bound to give compensation to states.Some states have demanded that the Centre borrow the money. Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac tweeted, “FMs [finance ministers] of Punjab, Delhi, W[est] Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation. Our option: Central Govt to borrow entire compensation due regardless of acts of gods, humans or nature, to be paid back by extending the period of Cess.”Isaac was referring to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s comment on the compensation crisis being caused by “an Act of God”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-some-states-oppose-borrowing-money-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister-jaganmohan-reddy-says-it-is-the-only-way-to-overcome-gst-shortfall/story-aHg0fNl9joHVt59quUd5pO.html
09-09-2020||India||Climate change may cause 26% habitat loss for snow trout in Himalayan rivers: Study||Snow trout, the iconic cold water fish species found in Himalayan rivers, would lose their habitat by 16 per cent in the next 30 years and by over 26 per cent by 2070, a new climate change study by the government’s Wildlife Institute of India has found. The study -- ‘Is There Always Space at The Top’-- was published in the ‘Ecological Indicators’, a journal of high international repute based at the Netherlands, on September 6. The study indicates that most of the lower altitude streams across the Himalayas would be rendered unsuitable for the existence of snow trout with the rise in temperatures.An ensemble of 72 statistical models across the Himalayas, the study -- authored by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists Aashna Sharma, Vineet Kumar Dubey, Jeyaraj Antony Johnson, Yogesh Kumar Rawal and Kuppusamy Sivakumar – reveals the vulnerable snow trout would be squeezed into the high-altitude rivers in the Himalayas. “Our empirical findings strongly suggest that snow trout, a prime cold water fish of Himalayan rivers, would suffer a habitat loss in the future and the high-altitude areas would act as only saviours, provided suitable habitat connectivity is offered,” senior scientist Kuppusamy Sivakumar told PTI. The study says mountain systems across the globe are conspicuously sensitive to on-going climate alterations and the condition is much more detrimental in the Himalaya, where the rate of warming, and thus the glacier meltdown, is much higher than elsewhere. “The Himalayan coldwater species are concerningly most vulnerable to these changes because of their limited thermal range,” it says.Funded by the Department of Science & Technology (DST), the study is a part of the government’s National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE), which was launched to research the impact of climate change on the Himalayan ecosystem.The study iterates that if the countries across the globe continue their greenhouse emissions as usual (mentioning it as the ‘business-as-usual scenario’), “the species (snow trout) would lose a net habitat of 16.29% till the year 2050 which would further increase to 26.56% in the year 2070.” “As it stands, the snow trout faces serious threats due to river valley modifications, destructive fishing practices and exotic salmonid introductions,” it says. “Due to ongoing threats, its population size has been reduced drastically in Himalayan waters, hence listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List,” it adds.The fish species has great commercial and recreational value and its sole presence in the high-altitude cold waters makes it a flagship species to conserve the Himalayan rivers, the study underlines.“Already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors, the fate of snow trout population and many co-occurring genera can be considered explicitly at a higher risk in the Himalaya,” it adds.The also flagged the “rampant” damming of the rivers across the Himalayas, saying the presence of dams would definitely obstruct the fish mode of movements to safer havens, ultimately risking their very survival.“Our results highlight that snow trout would expand their range upwards into the high-altitude streams with a concurrent predominant range contraction in most of their lagging edges, ultimately creating a high-altitude squeeze,” the study says. The study recommends some solutions such as persuasive “conservation efforts beyond political boundaries by combined decisions of the policymakers of Himalayan countries”. It also include reducing “unsustainable harnessing of rivers for hydropower development projects and energy efficiency by improving green energy potential”.They also underscore a need to focus more on climate change science in India, more so in the Himalayas, which, the team says is “predicted to be warming at a rate much higher than the global average rate of about 0.4 °C”.The team detailed that never has such an extensive and rigorous ensemble methodology been used to understand the climate change impacts on any freshwater species in India. They said there was a dire need for inter-governmental policy measures -- involving India, Nepal and Bhutan -- to sustain the biodiversity of these rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-change-may-cause-26-habitat-loss-for-snow-trout-in-himalayan-rivers-study/story-wUvfDe8nuP4Y1Ds79JzAWI.html
09-09-2020||India||France describes India as foremost Asian strategic partner||France on Wednesday described India as its “foremost” Asian strategic partner and said the upcoming visit of its Defence Minister Florence Parly to the country is aimed at further strengthening the “forward-looking” defence cooperation with New Delhi.Parly will visit India on Thursday to attend a ceremony in Ambala to induct the first batch of five Rafale jets into the Indian Air Force (IAF).The French Defence Minister will hold talks with her Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.In a statement, the French embassy here said the focus of the talks will be on maritime security ties in the Indo-Pacific, counter-terror cooperation and strengthening overall bilateral defence partnership.“Their broad-ranging talks will cover, among others, industrial and technological partnership in line with the Make in India programme, operational defence cooperation, particularly maritime security in the Indo-Pacific, modalities of continuing the armed forces’ joint exercises in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, counter-terrorism cooperation as well as major regional and international strategic issues,” the embassy said.It said the talks will take forward the decision of French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deepen and expand the Indo-French partnership with strategic autonomy, and the defence of a multipolar order as its cornerstones.It will be Parly’s third visit to India since 2017 and one of her very first official trips since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic, the embassy said.The French defence minister will be accompanied by top executives from Dassault Aviation, Thales Group, Safran, and MBDA, representing the French defence majors that have been partnering with many Indian companies as part of the Rafale deal.The Rafale jets, produced by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, will be formally inducted into the IAF at the ceremony in Ambala air base on Thursday in presence of Singh, Parly and several top military officials.During her visit to the national capital, Parly will also pay floral tributes to India’s valiant soldiers at the National War Memorial.The ties between India and France are on an upswing in the last few years with cooperation witnessing a major expansion in key areas.The areas of defence and security, civil nuclear cooperation and trade and investment constitute the principal pillars of the Indo-French strategic partnership.In addition, India and France are increasingly engaged in new areas of cooperation such as in the Indian Ocean region, climate change and sustainable growth and development.The two countries share a close degree of convergence on a range of regional and global issues as well including ways to deal with terrorism and extremism.Both India and France have important bilateral investment and trade cooperation. France has emerged as a major source of FDI in India with more than 1,000 French establishments operating in the country with a total turnover of around USD 20 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-describes-india-as-foremost-asian-strategic-partner/story-rJmsUIWze24pfh3Ekip7yL.html

A grinding stone suspected to have been used in the assault was lying on his face. Police said Shobhnath’s son Ravishankar told them that he saw two persons talking to his father at around 11 in the night and assumed that they may be neighbours. Early this morning, he saw a grinding stone on his father’s face and removed it only to discover that he was dead. Superintendent of police (Crime) Ashutosh Mishra reached the spot and questioned the family and villagers in connection with the murder. “Shobhnath’s family had enmity with one of their neighbours in which a person was killed. Shobhnath’s son was arrested for the murder in 2014 and is out on bail. There are no indications of any loot attempt and it is possible that the murder took place over old enmity. However, further action will be taken after receiving a complaint from the family” Mishra said. In another crime in Prayagraj district, unidentified miscreants barged into a house and looted cash and valuables after taking the family hostage at gunpoint at Updaura village in the trans-Ganga area.Police reached the spot and launched a hunt for the looters but to no avail. The house where the robbers struck belongs to a lawyer who lives in the city. His wife Gauri Mishra and three children live in the village. Gauri told the police that at around 2 am, she opened the main door of the house to go to the toilet in the outer part of the residence when some robbers held her at gunpoint and took her and the children hostage. The miscreants then looted Rs 3,000 in cash and gold and silver ornaments worth several lakhs of rupees. Gauri and the children raised an alarm after the robbers left. Villagers rushed to the spot but the looters had fled by then. SP (trans-Ganga) NK Singh said miscreants were being traced on the basis of details provided by the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aged-man-bludgeoned-to-death-with-grinding-stone-in-prayagraj-district/story-2de8KDnr0lnwCQvdCIQv2I.html

09-09-2020||India||Efforts on for online delivery platform for street vendors: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said efforts are being made to provide an online delivery platform to street food vendors on the lines of big restaurants.After a virtual interaction with beneficiaries of the PM Street Vendors’ Aatmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme from Madhya Pradesh, Modi praised the state government for ensuring the scheme’s benefits to over lakh people and providing identity cards to over 4.5 lakh people (scheme beneficiaries) in just two months.The Union government had launched the PM SVANidhi scheme on June 1 to help poor street vendors impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic resume livelihood activities.“I congratulate those who are moving ahead with the SVANidhi Yojna. It is a big thing to provide benefits of the scheme to over one lakh street vendors and providing identity cards to over 4.5 lakh such people. Other states must take inspiration from Madhya Pradesh,” Modi said.After his interaction with the street vendors, Modi in a televised address said, “A scheme has been prepared to provide an online platform to street food vendors by using technology. This means, the street food vendors will be able to make online delivery like big restaurants. Efforts are being made to provide this kind of facility.” He told the street vendors that if they come forward, the government will take this effort further.The prime minister also urged the street vendors to adopt the digital payment system on a large scale.“The use of digital payment has increased during the past three-four years. Its importance was realised during the corona (Covid-19 outbreak) period. Now customers avoid making payment in cash and pay directly through mobile phone,” he said.Appealing street vendors to come forward to adopt the digital system, Modi said, “A new beginning has been made by the banks and digital payment system providers.” Modi told the street vendors that representatives of banks and such organisations will reach out to them, provide the QR code and inform them about its use.“I appeal to them (street vendors) to use digital payment more and present an example before the world,”he said.He said the government will make efforts to ensure that street vendors in all big cities of the state get benefit of the PM SVANidhi scheme.“Whenever there is a pandemic, it hits the poor brothers and sisters hard. They always suffer whether it is excessive heat, rainfall or cold and these create problems for their employment and food, Modi said.“They (the poor) faced it the most during the pandemic and were even were forced to return to their native places.The government has realised this and tried to help them as much as possible by providing them ration and creating employment opportunities,” he said.The government launched the PM SVANidhi scheme with easy rules so that they can get rid of paying interest on loans which they used to take from private lenders.“You are getting a rebate of seven per cent in interest in these loans (under the scheme). If you repay to the bank on time, you will get more facilities. If you make digital transaction, you will get rewarded for it and you get more loan next time, he said.Referring to attempts made earlier to remove poverty, Modi said, “In our country, a lot has been talked about the poor. But in the last six years, everything has been done in a planned manner. Steps have been taken, which were not taken earlier, like the Jan Dhan Yojna under which 40 crore bank accounts of poor people were opened.” These people are getting loans and are liberated from the clutches of money lenders. Farmers are getting assistance directly, he mentioned.He also said that soon villages will also be associated with online marketing platforms.“On August 15, we took a vow to connect all villages with the optical fibre network in next 1,000 days. People will also get digital health identity cards for getting health facilities in rural areas also,” he said.Earlier, he interacted with some beneficiaries of the PM SVANidhi scheme, including street vendor Chaganlal and his wife from Sanver in Indore district, Gwalior’s Archana Sharma and vegetable vendor Dalchand in Raisen district.Modi advised Chaganlal how to enhance his business by asking customers to return the pipe used in making broomsticks to reduce the cost of making a broomstick.Chaganlal also told Modi that he wanted to enhance his business. After spotting a plastic water bottle kept behind Chaganlal’s chair, Modi advised him to use an earthen pitcher instead of a single-use plastic bottle for drinking water to save the environment.Modi also asked him about the Ujjwala Yojna and how it benefited his family.Interacting with Archana Sharma from Gwalior, Modi asked whether she would serve him ‘tikki’ (patties) that she sells at her joint. He also asked her about the SVANidhi scheme and how it benefitted her.He also asked her if she was aware of the Ayushman Bharat health care scheme, to which she said her husband was getting treatment through this scheme only. Modi also interacted with her husband Rajendra Sharma.Talking to vegetable vendor Dalchand from Sanchi in Raisen district, Modi praised him for using the QR code digital platform for receiving payments. He also suggested him ways to improve his vegetable business.After the interaction, Modi also informed street vendors about the ‘one nation one ration card’ scheme to make things easier for people.The prime minister also cautioned people about the threat of Covid-19 until its vaccine is developed, and advised them to follow guidelines like wearing masks and maintaining two-yard distance. He also asked people to avoid single-use plastic products, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efforts-on-for-online-delivery-platform-for-street-vendors-pm-modi/story-tsph2swN8zwTZWPbPpKCxN.html

Of the total 89,706 new cases, which have been reported in the last 24 hours, Maharashtra has alone contributed more than 20,000 and Andhra Pradesh has contributed more than 10,000”, the Health Ministry said today.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, in that order, are the five worst-affected states in the country. India’s current Covid-19 tally stands at 43,70,128. This includes 33,98,844 recovered cases, 8,97,394 active cases and 73,890 deaths, of which 1,115 are from the last 24 hours.Of the 89,706 cases in the last 24 hours, 20,131 were from Maharashtra, the second time the state has reported over 20,000 cases in a single-day. It has been the worst-hit state since the early days of the outbreak of the pandemic in the country.Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, reported 10,601 cases on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-43-lakh-mark-centre-says-60-cases-from-five-states-alone/story-LpQBOsRaiUTKEI19ucFBlJ.html

The new Covid-19 cases were reported from all 30 districts of the state. With this, the active cases have mounted to 32,312 while 102,185 people recovered from Covid-19 so far, an official said. Out of the new cases, 2,210 were found from quarantine centres and the rest 1,538 people were found to be infected during contact tracing, he added. Khurda district, which also includes the state’s capital Bhubaneswar, added the maximum number of cases (615), and followed by Cuttack (392) and Puri (387).Also read: AstraZeneca pauses Covid-19 vaccine trial after unexplained illnessBhubaneswar, which turned into a Covid-19 hotspot is facing a severe shortage of ICU beds.

Odisha is also short on trained doctors and paramedical staff that can deal with critical patients. The doctor patient ratio is 1: 2597 whereas it is 1: 1457 nationally. This shortage indicates the state’s difficulty in combating the pandemic.

Major cities grow over the decades and centuries. Investing Rs 1,00,000 crore to build a mega metro is not viable. Forget about additional revenue, you cannot even repay the debt [incurred by spending] …on infrastructure,” Reddy said in an interview to HT.He was responding to a question on his predecessor Chandrababu Naidu’s idea to build a revenue-earning city comparable to Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad and why not much has been heard of that since Reddy took over.Reddy cited the example of Omaha city in the Midwestern US state of Nebraska with a population of just 400,000. He added 23 of the largest US corporations are headquartered there. “That is where [business tycoon] Warren Buffett stays. [Business magnate and Microsoft co-founder] Bill Gates operates from Seattle [in the northwestern US state of Washington with a population of 608,660],” he said. Also Read: Jagan govt withdraws subsidy to Discoms, to directly transfer power bill amount to farmersReddy underlined mega-cities are unwanted, and only drain resources and become a burden on the people. He said none of the top 10 developed countries have a metro and a mega city. “Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Finland…all these developed countries have no mega-cities. Development is not industrialisation or urbanisation. Development means many things like per capita income and happiness index.”Reddy said Kerala, too, has no major cities and yet is ahead of other states in terms of several parameters. “Development has to be distributed across the state. Visakhapatnam, Anantapuram, Kurnool and Tirupati, and a few other cities can become clusters of development. Ports are being developed. Central Andhra, which is an agriculture hub, can have some agro-logistic parks and all can prosper.”Reddy argued revenue gets generated through manufacturing and a proper service sector. “Why should the industry be located in urban areas? For instance, Visakhapatnam is not our capital. When it was a small town, a steel plant and a few other industries were set up there a few decades ago. Now, it is emerging as a major city.” He added in a similar way, they can have growth centres where industries can be promoted. “The Covid-19 experience tells us that most of the cities ultimately become sick. There is a gradual shift from the so-called major cities or metros to medium and small towns.”Reddy argued against pouring money into building a congested and “a not required urban place”. He added money should instead be spent on connecting places and ensuring faster mobility and cost-effectiveness. “It is a wrong perception that cities generate more money. Barring a couple of exceptions, greenfield capital cities did not succeed anywhere in the world.”He questioned whether the state has resources to build Amravati as per Naidu’s plan. “[US management consulting firm] Boston Consulting Group analysed it from an economic perspective and said its investments are not viable.”Also Read: Only way to overcome GST crisis is to borrow money: Jaganmohan ReddyHe defended his plans to have separate capitals for executive, judicial, and the legislative arms of the state in Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, and Amravati, saying they should not put all their eggs in one basket. “The capital’s functions can be distributed among different places. Why all these functions should be delivered from a particular place? The residuary state of Andhra Pradesh suffered twice in the past on account of [loss of] Chennai and Hyderabad. That is what history tells us. If you put all your eggs in one basket, you are going to suffer. Then why you want to continue with the same approach without taking into account past experiences? It is not logical and rationale thinking,” he said. “The document prepared by the previous [Naidu] regime says that you need Rs 1,00,000 crore [for building the new capital in Amravati]. Instead of planning to build a so-called city at a place which is not suitable for construction of any mega structures on 33,000 acres land acquired or pooled from farmers, he could have planned something on 500 acres elsewhere.”Reddy said a special investigating team is probing land deals of his predecessor and “his cronies”. “People with vested interests purchased lands from poor farmers. Then came the announcement of the capital and subsequent scam. Those who purchased land at throwaway prices benefited to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. It was just a real estate business by the previous regime to benefit a certain section of people. Once the development is diversified and spread across the state, they become centres of growth...”Reddy rejected as absurd the suggestion that he wanted to downgrade Amravati to slight Naidu. “Why should we bother about Amravati? We believe in the overall development of the state. We did not leave Amravati. The legislature will continue to work from Amravati.” He added had there been a referendum option available, they would have gone for it over Amravati. “We are confident the people would have given a thumbs up for our decentralised development.”A group of farmers have in the high court challenged the move to have three capitals, saying Amravati was made the capital as per a presidential order. The state cannot have three capitals in violation of the order, the farmers have argued.As many as 55 petitions have been filed in the high court challenging the law for the creation of three capitals and abolition of the Capital Region Development Authority for the development of Amravati as the state capital.The Supreme Court last month refused to stay a high court order for the status quo on continuing Amravati as the state capital. It said it cannot interfere in the matter as it was pending before the high court. The Supreme Court also rejected the state government’s plea to direct the high court to expedite the hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/building-a-revenue-earning-city-to-compensate-for-the-loss-of-hyderabad-perverted-thinking-jaganmohan-reddy/story-k42KEUrSvjRRPCiQLHcHrK.html

In a tweet, Omar said that he is vacating the house as the rules of entitlement have changed in the Union Territory (UT) of J&K. Last August, the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two UT’s – Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh and the special status enjoyed by the region was revoked by the parliament.Omar said he has started house-hunting and will voluntarily vacate the house by the end of October. “My letter to the J&K administration. I will be vacating my government accommodation in Srinagar before the end of October. The point to note is that contrary to stories planted in the media last year, I received no notice to vacate and have chosen to do so of my own accord,’’ Omar Abdullah tweeted the letter addressed to the administrative secretary of the estates department of the J&K government. “I was allotted a house G -1 in 2002 in my capacity as a member of Parliament (MP) representing Srinagar constituency. Subsequent to my election as chief minister in 2008, the adjoining house was renovated and the complex of G1 and G- 5 was used as the official CM residence from October 2010 onwards. I continued to remain in occupation of this accommodation subsequent to my demitting the office of CM in January 2015, as the rules allowed me to retain an accommodation in Srinagar,’’ he said in the letter. Also Read: Pulwama pencils script a made-in-Kashmir story“Consequent upon the change in entitlements for former CMs of J&K some months ago, I now find myself in an unauthorized occupation of this accommodation as no attempt has been made to regularise the allotment to me on security or any other grounds. This is a situation that is unacceptable to me. I have never held on to any government property I was not entitled to and have no intention to start now.’’ Also Read: Ramesh Pokhriyal inaugurates three newly completed projects at Central University of JammuFormer J&K chief minister further states that he is searching for a suitable accommodation. “The process is taking longer because of constraints caused by Covid -19. I intend to complete the process in 8-10 weeks and should be in a position to handover Gupkar road accommodation accordingly.’’ Omar’s official residence was close to the houses of his father Farooq Abdullah and his aunt and sister.

09-09-2020||India||Farm loan waiver worked, says Congress as farmers’ suicides drop 53% in MP||The Congress in Madhya Pradesh has claimed that the initiatives of former chief minister Kamal Nath to waive of farm loans contributed to the decrease in farmers’ suicides in the state.The Congress claim came on the back of the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) annual report that showed a drop of 53% in farmer suicides in Madhya Pradesh in 2019.The NCRB released its accidental deaths and suicides in India (ADSI) report for the year 2019 last week. The Congress said that although the farmers suicide rate increased by 3% in rest of the country, it came down by 53% in Madhya Pradesh. The central Indian state reported 303 farmer suicide cases in 2018 when the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power and it came down to 142 cases in 2019 when Congress ruled the state.The Congress had ended the BJP’s 15-year rule in the state in December 2018 by winning the polls with a slender margin. The Congress formed the government with the help of smaller parties and independents and Nath became the chief minister.Although there is a significant improvement in the suicide cases of farmers, the suicide by farm labourers increased from 352 to 399 in MP during this period, the report says.However, the farmer suicide trend in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where Congress came to power in 2018 simultaneously with MP and introduced the farm loan waiver scheme, is different. In Rajasthan, only two farmers had committed suicide in 2018 and the number is reported as same in 2019 too while in Chhattisgarh, the number of cases increased by 21% from 182 in 2018 to 233 cases in 2019, according to the ADSI report. Rajasthan government officials said farmer suicides are reported separately only if the investigation shows the reason for committing the acct was farm related.The Congress in Madhya Pradesh had promised Rs 2 lakh per head loan waiver to farmers in the run-up to 2018 assembly elections. Once in power, the Congress government claimed to have waived loans of more than two million farmers who had loans up to Rs 50,000. The second phase of the loan of farmers having loans of Rs 50,001 to Rs one lakh was announced in December 2019. However, the Congress government was dislodged by BJP in March 2020 before the second phase of loan waiver scheme could be implemented. A Congress leader said, “We are not concerned about what happened in other Congress ruled states but in MP we have decided to make the significant fall in the number of farmer suicides a major poll issue in the bypolls in 27 assembly constituencies.” Farmer welfare and agriculture development minister in Kamal Nath government, Sachin Yadav, said, “Former chief minister Nath’s agrarian policies and schemes had given a ray of hope to farmers. The farm loan waiver scheme proved a boon and many farmers got the benefits from the scheme. But other reforms like action against the land mafia, mandi mafia and money lenders,helped bring down the production cost of crops and farmers were getting a fair price for their crops. All these factors brought happiness to farmers in MP.” Farmers and farmers associations have mixed opinions about the Congress’s claim. Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangh president Shivkumar ‘kakkaji’ said, “Apart from the major schemes meant for farmers, Congress-led state government had started addressing small issues too related to farmers. In just one year, more than 2 lakh agriculture land dispute cases, which were in pendency for the past several decades, were resolved by the revenue department. Similarly, farmers were being trained for horticulture too so that their sole dependence on traditional crops could be reduced to some extent.” Bharaitya Kisan Union general secretary Anil Yadav said, “It’s true that the then Congress-led state government’s loan waiver promise reduced the stress on farmers but there was unequal distribution of benefits and poor implementation of the scheme. In fact, both BJP and Congress use farmers to win election and after election they forget them.” A farmer Bhagwan Meena of Sehore district said, “Congress promise of loan waiver raised the hope of farmers. Loan of a section of farmers was waived to a certain amount but a good number of farmers who expected waiver of Rs 2 lakh loan became defaulters in the records of banks as they were not given the benefit of the scheme.” The ruling BJP rubbished the Congress’ claim of improving the condition of farmers.Minister for farmer welfare and agriculture development in the BJP-led government, Kamal Patel said, “The farmers trusted lies of the Congress but in just one year, the then Congress government stood exposed for its falsehood. Now, farmers are facing a tough time due to the Congress’ poor policies. We are helping the farmers overcome their problems. We are also giving compensation to farmers by conducting a swift survey of damaged crops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-loan-waiver-worked-says-congress-as-farmers-suicides-drop-53-in-mp/story-ipRkgP4c8L5rP6SJWSjtmM.html

It was particularly aggrieved by the clauses in the tender that allowed the contractor to commercialise the open space by setting up their own sports complex, swimming pool, restaurant etc.Also Read: Maharashtra home minister receives threat call for criticising Kangana RanautHC accepted the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner body that the development already carried out at the park was unauthorised, and the civic body could not be allowed to further proceed with the tender.

A civic squad has already reached her office.The structure in question is Ranaut’s Manikarnika Films Private Limited office, which is a ground plus two-storey building.Also read: Shiv Sena slams Centre for providing security to Kangana Ranaut, calls it insult to MaharashtraVinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC, H-West Ward under whose jurisdiction Bandra falls, said: “We will carry out the demolition work on Wednesday over the structural violations carried out at Ranaut’s office at Pali Hill. Further action will be taken after the demolition process.” As per the civic rules, any structure has to be built in line with the plan submitted to the local authorities. Any illegal changes in the plan or alterations in the structure attract legal action. On Tuesday, BMC had issued a notice to Ranaut over several structural violations carried out in her office while asking her to respond within 24 hours and take corrective measures, failing which “the illegal portions” would be demolished.Later, Ranaut’s lawyer had written to the BMC authorities asking seven days to respond to the notice, instead of 24 hours. The lawyer had cited that the notice is legally untenable. Ranaut is incensed at the turn of events. “As I am all set for a Mumbai darshan on my way to the airport, Maharashtra government and their goons are at my property. They are all set to illegally break it down. Go on! I promised to give blood for Maharashtra’s pride. This is nothing. Take everything, but my spirit will only soar higher,” she tweeted on Wednesday morning.Ranaut has been involved in a bitter war of words with Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena, which also controls the BMC, over her remarks likening Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, which also comprises the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has accused Ranaut of siding with its rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On Tuesday, a breach of privilege motion was moved against Ranaut in the Maharashtra legislative assembly for her remarks against Mumbai and its police. The Maharashtra government had also said that it would probe into allegations made by actor Adhyayan Suman, her purported ex-boyfriend, in an interview three years ago that Ranaut did drugs and also compelled him to consume narcotic substances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-to-demolish-illegal-parts-of-kangana-ranaut-s-bandra-office-for-structural-violations/story-kanQDWX48iB9OGKbsGajAO.html

The owners, who resumed with one service between Mumbai and Mandwa, will now be increasing it to three services a day from September 20 owing to increasing demand. According to data shared by the M2M Ferries Pvt Ltd, more than 5,000 passengers, 1,200 cars, 270 two-wheelers and cyclists have taken a trip on the ferry since August 20. Aashim Mongia from M2M Ferries said that most people are taking a leisure trip to Alibag. “Most people are tired of being stuck in their homes. Plus compared to travelling via roads, it is much easier to take the ferry,” Mongia said. The state’s first ro-ro service between Mumbai’s Ferry Wharf and Mandwa in Alibag was launched in March. However, it was shut owing to the lockdown. The operations were limited to one service to and from Mandwa initially, which was then increased to two services a day. “To mark the first month of the resumption of the service, we will be initiating three services to and from Mandwa,” Mongia said.As a precautionary measure, however, ferries are being operated with reduced capacity. A spokesperson said the operator will not be taking bookings for more than 300 passengers and 60 cars for each trip whereas its capacity is close to 500 passengers and 145 cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-s-ro-ro-ferry-service-gets-massive-response-frequency-to-increase/story-U29izSZZwjYofHJ3tei8xJ.html

09-09-2020||India||PLA’s actions aimed to test India’s mettle||China’s aggressive moves in Ladakh and the South China Sea are based on a historical construct. If a Green Line crafted in 1960 by then paramount leader Mao Zedong is the objective of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh, it is the 9, 10 or 11 dash line (depending on political convenience; the concept has a dubious historical basis in the Sino-French war) that is the target of the Red Army in the South China Sea.The PLA’s main enemy in the South China Sea is a competing superpower, the US, which is backing Taiwan, even as members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations look the other way. Its adversary in Ladakh, adjoining sensitive and restive Tibet and Xinjiang, is a rising power, India, whose neighbours have all become increasingly cosy with Beijing in recent years .Also read: PLA force accretion on Finger 4 belies Beijing Ladakh disengagement offerAlthough the ambitious western theatre commander of PLA, Zhao Zongqi, portrayed the Indian Army as an aggressor or a war monger after Monday’s clash at the Rezang La- Rechin La ridgeline, the fact is that Indian troops are only preventing the Chinese from reach their outrageous Green Line claim in the south of Pangong Tso. The Indian Army did the same on August 29-30, and at the same spot. It is quite evident that there is a short-term and a long-term context to the latest clash, both of which are familiar to commanders on the ground. .Clearly, the latest PLA aggression is aimed at teaching the Indian Army a lesson for using the Special Frontier Force (SFF), largely comprising Tibetans-in-exile, on the front line in the August clash. What has upset Beijing the most is that the sacrifice of a Tibetan SFF junior commissioned officer, Nyima Tenzin, in the battle on August 29-30, something that has become a rallying point for Tibetans all over the world and revived resistance against the Chinese occupation of the region. To make matters worse, the SFF proved its worth in high mountainous terrain.However, the long-term objective of China is to destabilize India by putting continuous pressure along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), fully knowing its impact on Indian polity and on the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On August 12, 2013, Shyam Saran, a China expert and then chairman of the National Security Advisory Board, submitted a report to the then Prime Minister’s Office that advocated increased patrolling of the LAC by the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police. Saran said that while the patrolling points (65 in Ladakh) within the Indian LAC were identified by the apex China Study group, there was a need for the Indian Army and the ITBP to patrol till the actual LAC as there were significant gaps between the points and the perceived line. While admitting that patrolling the mountainous terrain was difficult, the former foreign secretary pointed to increased PLA activity in these areas due to an upgrade of border infrastructure by China.Also read: Face-off at Rechin La leads to scuffle with aggressive PLA. Situation tense but ground commanders talkingEssentially,what Saran, in the context of the April-May 2013 PLA intrusion in Depsang Bulge, meant was that PLA had the option of nibbling at the LAC due to lack of Indian patrolling till the perceived LAC. The 2013 intrusion has ensured that Indian forces virtually cannot patrol points 10 to 13 with the PLA sitting on the mouth of the Bulge at Raki Nullah. The PLA aggression in the past four months in eastern Ladakh has left the Narendra Modi government no option but to militarily contest the PLA nibbling of the LAC or lose political equity by ceding territory to Communist China.India is facing a triple whammy. First, its economy has shrunk 23% in first quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. Second, the economic cost of putting the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force on war-like alert with emergency purchases is significant and mounting each day. It is quite evident that the Chinese economy can afford this deployment, and Beijing would like to tire out the Indian Army and economically bleed India till such time status quo ante is restored in Ladakh. The PLA is an expert in tiring out the enemy since the Korean war. Third, the country it is using is its all-weather ally, Pakistan, to provoke India on the Line of Control (LOC) through cross-border firing and terrorist infiltration. Had it not been for the umbilical ties between India and the Nepalese army, Beijing may have well been successful in activating a fourth dimension to bleed India.While the PLA’s attention is today diverted on two fronts with the US activating the Indo-China front, with Australia and Japan, India will feel more military pressure in Ladakh should the US position change after the country’s presidential election in November. Europe is still to understand the rise of China, which has close economic ties with the European Union powerhouse Germany. The big picture for India appears to be grim at the moment in the context of China, but the country will be in pole position if it can ride over this round of Chinese checkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-s-actions-aimed-to-test-india-s-mettle/story-gknGfBJaXcfYYCTQZJFEXN.html

Sambhar lake, the largest inland salt lake in India, hit the headlines late last year after almost 22,000 migratory birds died there and sparked alarm among environmentalists and ornithologists. The birds died due to animal botulism, a neuromuscular illness. The NGT is hearing the original application filed on the basis of a news item published in Hindustan Times, titled ‘Sambhar’s ecology among worst: Report’, on November 20, 2019, and petitions filed by Jaipur-based Wild Creatures Organisation and Delhi-based the Ecology, Rural Development and Sustainability Foundation (ERDS Foundation), both non-profit organisations. During a hearing on March 17, the NGT ordered the state government, among other things, to prepare a comprehensive management plan. The State Wetland Authority (SWA) told the NGT on June 23 that a comprehensive environment management plan had been prepared by the environment department but was yet to be approved by the authority. “Due to Covid emergency, the meeting of wetland authority could not be held which will be held shortly and the plan will be submitted thereafter. Delineation of core and buffer area has been included in the comprehensive management plan and compliance will be submitted along with the management plan,” the SWA report said. Meanwhile, chief secretary Rajeeva Swarup will interact with collectors on September 11 through video conference and the SWA meeting has been scheduled on September 15, officials said. The chief secretary earlier reviewed progress with departments on August 4 and a meeting of the Standing Committee on Management of Sambhar Lake was held on August 6. The NGT noted in the August 27 order that the problem of management of waste and sewage, removal of encroachment and disposal of sodium sulphate waste/ sludge generated from salt refining units still remain to be fully tackled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-raps-rajasthan-on-the-knuckles-for-inadequate-measures-in-sambhar-lake/story-KFrY5gaPcFZKtGvdwPzVeK.html

The hearing of the plea is scheduled for Wednesday morning. According to MGP, senior citizens should not be asked to use credit shells, and airlines should not ask passengers to pay the fare difference and instead be allowed to fly on the original ticket price till March 2021. A credit shell is an open ticket, issued when an airline holds on to the booking amount in the form of credit. Also Read: Centre proposes full refund in 15 days on air tickets booked before lockdown“On the whole, the proposal of the civil aviation ministry is welcome as it tries to harmonise and balance the interest of both passengers and the airlines. There is, however, a need for further relief. The ministry must direct that senior citizens need not use this credit shell. In the present situation, senior citizens are advised not to travel and hence it will be in consonance with government policy to direct airlines to refund the ticket amounts to senior citizens forthwith. There’s also a need to protect these passengers against the possible fare hike and they should be allowed to travel till March 31 on the same fare,” said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman, MGP. “Further, the government must make it clear that in no circumstances, can the credit shell period can be extended beyond March 31, 2021.” This comes after DGCA, in its affidavit to the SC, stated that tickets booked for domestic and international carriers between March 25 and May 3 will be fully refunded within 15 days. DGCA’s affidavit also stated that “If on account of financial distress, if the airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected. This credit shell shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket.”Also Read: Airlines get ready for in-flight meal servicesThe affidavit also stated that passengers will be able to use the credit shell up to March 31, 2021 and change the flight sector. This means that a passenger booked on a Mumbai- Indore flight can change his/ her sector and fly to any other destination till March 2021.This is after an order was issued by SC on June 13 asking private airlines and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) to find a way to refund the airfare of passengers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown. It was then the meetings were held with all the stakeholders in July and it was decided that tickets booked directly by passengers during lockdown 1 and 2 will be fully refunded. A former DGCA official said, “Which airline is doing financially well with this pandemic? Why will an airline provide a refund when they can state that they are currently financially unstable and hence cannot provide a refund?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-consumer-rights-body-to-seek-clarifications-on-dgca-affidavit-over-air-ticket-refunds-in-supreme-court/story-Ess65xhjB50OtQXfTvDEVK.html

The number has now increased to 14,273 daily active cases.At this rate, India will see a million active cases by next week.There is concern because of more relaxations being allowed by the government. The metro services have been resuming phase wise, and with footfalls expected to increase in the days to come, authorities fear the number of cases could see a rise further.The health ministry had said on Tuesday that the above three states, along with Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, account for nearly 70 per cent of deaths due to Covid-19 in the country.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that apart from these five states, other states and union territories account for 31.37 per cent of the deaths due to the disease.He also highlighted that despite the high number of cases, the number of Covid-19 cases per million population in the country stands at 3,102 - among the lowest in the world.Bhushan said that the global average for number of cases per million population stands at 3,527.He also said that Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is continuously declining. “It was 2.15 per cent in the first week of August.

Durmi-Gauna lake also known as Birahi taal, 18 km from Nijmula valley in Chamoli was a prominent lake of Garhwal region on the lines of Nainital in Kumaon during the early part of the last century. Britishers liked this hill spot owing to its scenic beauty against the background of the Trishul Himalayas and water of four rivulets forming the core water supply of this lake. The vast alpine pastures and panoramic Himalayan view from this lake and adjacent villages provide a breathtaking view to the visitors. According to district magistrate Chamoli Swati S Bhadauriya, the Durmi-Gauna lake has vast potential to be re-developed into a prominent tourist destination for which survey and project report is being prepared. “Durmi–Gauna lake is situated in the midst of two villages Durmi and Gauna because of which this lake is known as Durmi-Gauna lake. It was a major lake during the pre and post-Independence era. Boats used to operate on this lake with a large number of tourists and visitors from neighbouring districts of Garhwal-Kumaon division used to arrive. But due to a natural disaster on July 20, 1970 when a cloudburst and heavy rainfall and landslide resulted in burying much of the lake with debris and boulders from the mountain. Now, this lake will be revived and redeveloped with multi development projects to restore its lost status,” Bhadauriya said. On the anvil are re-carpeting of the track route leading to the Durmi Gauna lake, viewpoint, camping sites, cycling track, a mini-museum and basic tourist amenities. A geological survey of the surrounding area of this lake is also being done, officials said. Mohan Singh Negi, headman of the nearby Irani village, who along with12 other village heads, has been pursuing the revival of Durmi-Gauna lake, pointed out that prior to the 1970 catastrophe, there were around a dozen odd British-era boats in the lake. “The remains of a British-era boat was recovered on August 17 this year after carrying out digging work near Durmital. A single line phone facility also existed at Durmi lake then which itself speaks of the significance of this lake. Local people used to get employment as boat operators and the local economy was tourist based but after the lake was covered, there was a mass exodus of youths who moved out in search of employment,” said Negi. “A British-era bungalow near Durmi village is testimony of the Britishers’ love for this place” , said Narayan Singh, who was 30 years old when the natural disaster covered the lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/damaged-british-era-durmi-gauna-lake-in-uttarakhand-to-be-revived-after-5-decades/story-MkOcIt5vfynozhe7VIGqRO.html

An inconclusive Covid-19 report on Tuesday threatened to disrupt her travel plans to Mumbai amid her ongoing war of words with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut over her remarks that she doesn’t feel safe in Mumbai after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Last week, Kangana had taken to Twitter to claim: “Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena leader, has given me an open threat and asked me not to come back to Mumbai. After Aazadi graffitis in Mumbai streets and now open threats, why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir?” The actor was provided Y-plus Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) security on the recommendation of the Himachal Pradesh Police chief Sanjay Kundu after she complained of threat to her life.

The doubling of PLA troop strength on Finger four on north bank of the lake has sowed distrust in the Indian Army’s mind about the sincerity of Beijing offer even as it holds dominant positions south of the saltwater lake. The only other explanation is that the Chinese Foreign Ministry is not on the same page as the Western Theatre Commander of the PLA.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the border situation and remind Beijing about the bilateral commitment to peace and tranquility accords signed since 1993 which pertain to minimum troop deployment along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also Watch | Explained: Behind China’s LAC dares, a nefarious plot to destabilize IndiaThe fundamental problem facing the Indian Army in proposed disengagement and de-escalation is lack of any Chinese guarantee that the PLA will not occupy those positions vacated by the Indian troops south of Pangong Tso. Just as PLA has taken dominant positions upto Finger 4 on the north bank, the Indian Army is now holding the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline right upto its perception of the LAC. The PLA troops are virtually contesting these Indian positions through large scale deployments south of the lake.Although the Chinese spokesperson on Tuesday talked about harsh weather conditions in the area, fact is that Indian Army has been used to such conditions since Operation Meghdoot in Siachen in 1984. “ The Indian soldier is prepared for mountain and snow from the very beginning with virtually all of them serving either on the Line of Control with Pakistan, Siachen Glacier or the LAC,” said a military commander. The PLA on the other hand last bled in Vietnam in 1979.The basic problem facing disengagement is that Chinese have road infrastructure right upto the LAC in Ladakh, while the Indian Army troops have to traverse mountain passes, nullahs and ridges to reach their current posts and positions. “If China is serious about disengagement and de-escalation, then both sides have to bilaterally commit that the other side will not occupy the heights once vacated by the present occupant. Only then will the disengagement be successful,” said a military commander.In the past 27 years, the PLA have nibbled into the LAC with the Indian Army troops with their defensive mindset sticking only to the patrolling points (defined by the China Study Group), which fall well short of Indian perception line. However, the Indian Army’s posture has changed since the initial PLA transgressions in May. And this time, the Indian troops are not even willing to given an inch within their side of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-force-accretion-on-finger-4-belies-beijing-ladakh-disengagement-offer/story-YKGtaAU3FAkyZ6VSmRExOP.html

The neighbouring Himalayan state of Sikkim is expected to follow suit from October. Every year more than 10 lakh tourists visit the region. This year, however, because of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, the hill stations were totally shut since March. Sikkim was among the first states to ban the entry of tourists from March 16. On September 5, the West Bengal government had permitted hotels in Darjeeling and Kalimpong to resume their services following social distancing norms and maintaining hygiene. Those within containment zones, however, would have to remain shut. “Now that the hotels have opened up we are optimistic that tourists would start arriving and the tourism industry would roll back to normal in a phased manner. We are expecting tourists soon,” Sangey Tshering Bhutia, president of Darjeeling Hotel Owners’ Association. Tourism is one of the important economic activities in the hills with almost 15% of the population dependent on it for their livelihoods. Both Kalimpong and Darjeeling have low cases of Covid-19. On September 8, Kalimpong which has the second lowest number of Covid-9 cases among the districts of West Bengal after Jhargram, had only 64 active cases compared to 4,067 in Kolkata. Hoteliers said that they have drawn up plans on how to sanitise hotels and maintain hygiene when tourists start flocking in. “Once a guest checks out of the room it would be sanitized and would be kept vacant for at least three days before allotting to another guest. There would be no buffet system, body temperature of guests would be checked when they check in and all hotel staff would be wearing masks and gloves. The entire hotel would be sanitized regularly,” said Diamond Oberoi, managing director of a prominent hotel. Public transport connecting New Jalpaiguri and Siliguri with the hills stations of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and other places have already started. “As many tourists prefer to take shared jeeps and buses to the hills from Siliguri bus stand and NJP railway station the drivers would maintain social distance among the tourists while ferrying them to their destination. They would be taking only half the passengers they used to take during pre-Covid times,” S N Pradhan, president of Himalayan Transport Coordination Committee So far around seven long distance trains are running via New Jalpaiguri railway station including Agartala-Delhi Rajdhani Express, Brahmaputra Mail and Padatik Express. Subhanan Chanda, chief public relations officer of North East Frontier Railway said that more trains are expected to ply from September 12. In Sikkim, the state tourism department has come up with a draft proposal to open the state for tourists from October. The proposal says domestic tourists with pre-booked or package tours would be allowed initially and they need to produce valid Covid-19 negative certificates at the border check posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darjeeling-kalimpong-open-for-tourists-sikkim-to-follow-suit-in-october/story-hcGm0Atz1DUEVq5DhKFsUO.html

09-09-2020||India||Stick to rule: SC on Char Dham road||The Supreme Court has ruled that the width of the Char Dham highway, an ambitious 900-kilometre project that promises to offer all-weather connectivity to four Hindu pilgrimage centres in Uttarakhand, and the ancillary benefit of facilitating rapid movement of Indian military forces to areas adjoining its border with China, shall not exceed the 5.5 metres specified in 2018 by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) for roads under construction in mountainous terrain. The matter came up for hearing before a bench headed by justice R F Nariman which told solicitor general Tushar Mehta on Tuesday that the ministry’s guidelines should apply to the two-lane highway, which will connect Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.“All you have to do is to go by your 2018 guidelines. How can you not go by your own guidelines?” the bench asked Mehta after hearing Ravi Chopra, chairman of the high-powered committee (HPC) formed by the apex court last year to review the environmental impact of the project. The court accepted the final report submitted by the committee, some members of which have differed with the central government on the width of the highway. The Centre has been in favour of a two-lane highway with a width of seven metres; some HPC members , including Chopra, contended that such a broad road would be dangerous for the fragile Himalayan ecology that is highly susceptible to landslides.In its order published on Wednesday, the apex court rejected Mehta’s suggestion that the 2018 circular on road width was prospective in nature and not meant for projects under construction. “Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General, persisted with his arguments that the 2018 circular is only prospective in nature. We are well aware of the distinction between something which is retrospective in the sense that it applies for the first time to projects which are already completed as opposed to ongoing projects, where it is necessary to take stock of the current situation and then move forward,” the court said. “Having taken stock of the current situation and of the fragility generally of the ecosystem in mountain terrain, we are of the view that this argument has no legs to stand on,” the order read. It also says that plantations should be taken up in stretches affected by landslides and construction activity.Solicitor general Mehta submitted to the court an affidavit by MoRTH hich said a width of seven metres was required for strategic roads connecting to international borders such as the one between India and China on which military vehicles ply. Mehta said the argument that the intermediate carriageway’s width should no exceed 5.5 metres was a “minority view” in the committee.The advocate who represented the petitioner Citizens of Green Doon and Ors, a Dehradun-based environmental group, said the contentious issue of the highway’s width had been addressed by the apex court.“The SC has clearly said that in the Char Dham project’s intermediate lane configuration with road width of 5.5 metres has to be followed, as per the MoRTH’s circular of 2018 meant for hilly and mountainous regions. The Centre’s plan of building a seven-metre wide highway will not be considered. I have highlighted that a lot of damage has been done to the fragile ecology of the Himalayas. Now, the damages have to be mitigated,” said the advocate, Sanjay Parikh.Several landslides were triggered by construction work on the Char Dham highway this year, according to the committee that reviewed its environmental impact..The affidavit, seen by HT, said that the Geological Survey of India (GSI) was engaged by the ministry to carry out landslide susceptibility mapping of vulnerable areas in Uttarakhand. The exercise revealed that around half of Uttarakhand is highly or moderately susceptible to landslides, establishing that the work on the Char Dham highway is not the only factor responsible for the phenomenon.MoRTH cited a report by the Disaster Management Centre of Uttarakhand, which showed that between January 1 and August 28, 66 people were killed, 40 injured and 419 buildings destroyed by natural disasters in the state. Landslides claimed 22 lives; 38 died because of flash floods.Chopra, the chairman of the committee, submitted a detailed report to the ministry of environment on August 13 citing environmental lapses and violations that took place during the construction of the Char Dham highway.The report said the developer carried out extensive work such as felling of thousands of trees without the clearance of the ministry.“Works such as hill cutting, digging and dumping of muck is in gross violation of the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980, which has resulted in massive damage to the ecology of these valleys,” the report added.In August last year, the apex court cleared the decks for the Char Dham highway project by modifying a National Green Tribunal order to constitute a high-powered committee to look into environmental concerns. It said the committee shall consider the cumulative and independent impact of the Char Dham project on the entire Himalayan valley.

However, it said the high-speed facility which was restored on a trial basis in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal and Jammu region’s Udhampur on August 16 would continue till this month-end as there has been no report of its misuse in the two districts.Also read: 4G internet services to be restored in two J-K districts after more than a year In an order issued this evening, Principal Secretary in the Home Department Shaleen Kabra said that after a fresh review of the situation, it has been decided that internet speed will remain restricted to 2G in the rest of the 18 districts. The order said that the law enforcement agencies have furnished credible inputs on terror modules making sustained efforts to provoke sentiments of gullible youths and lure them into terrorist organisations and “indicated potential misuse of high-speed data services in disturbing public order”. The agencies have also expressed apprehensions that the high-speed data services can be misused for assisting infiltration attempts by terrorists. The 4G mobile internet services in Ganderbal and Udhampur would continue till September 30, unless modified earlier, the order said, adding no report of misuse has been received from the two districts. In the rest of 18 other districts, the internet speed would continue to be restricted to 2G only, it said. The internet services were snapped in Jammu and Kashmir before the Centre’s announcement on August 5 last year to scrap J-K’s special status and split it into two Union Territories.Also read: Mobile phone services, 2G internet , shut for R-Day, restored in Kashmir However, the 2G internet facility on mobile phones was restored on January 25 this year. The resumption of 4G internet services in Ganderbal and Udhampur after a gap of one year on August 16 came days after the Centre had informed the Supreme Court that a special committee looking into the matter was considering allowing the facility on a trial basis in two districts of the Union Territory. The order said: “Whereas the law enforcement agencies have furnished credible inputs that the terror modules operating in various parts of the UT of J&K, with active support from across the border as well as separatists/anti-national elements from within, are making sustained efforts to provoke sentiments of the gullible youth and lure them into terrorist organizations to fill the vacuum created by the killing of many terrorists.” “Also, the agencies have reported infiltration attempts by terrorists, along the LoC (Line of Control) and the IB (International Border), and apprehension of facilitation of these attempts if high-speed mobile data services are restored. They have also indicated potential misuse of high-speed data services in disturbing public order,” Kabra said in his order. However, he said the review committee, while taking note of the assessment made by the law enforcement agencies, observed that no reports of misuse of high-speed internet services in the districts of Ganderbal and Udhampur had been reported but said the situation needed to be monitored closely. After considering the reports of law enforcement agencies, inter-alia, bringing out the necessity of speed-related restrictions on mobile data services, and upon assessment of the available alternatives, Kabra said the 4G mobile internet services in Ganderbal and Udhampur would continue till September 30, unless modified earlier. “In the rest of 18 districts, the internet speed would continue to be restricted to 2G only,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-high-speed-internet-for-j-k-only-ganderbal-udhampur-districts-to-continue-getting-4g-till-sept-end/story-4ElOg6LZtpCkPLSHAAlUxK.html

Nazia’s father, brother and two maternal uncles absconded after the incident, police said.Rakesh Bhatt, additional superintendent of police said, “The two had died on the spot. In the initial probe, it has been found that the two had eloped and then married. Nazia’s family members, especially her father Muzammil and brother Mohsin were against the marriage.” “After the marriage, the two returned to the town and were living in Rashid’s house. But Nazia’s father and brother were not talking to her because they disapproved of her marriage. On Monday night, when the two passed in front of their house, they shot the two dead,” said Bhatt. He said that the two are on the run along with Nazia’s two maternal uncles Afsar Ali and Jouhar Ali who are also accused of being involved in the case.“During the investigation it was also found that Muzammil was particularly angry with the fact that Nazia had married a Muslim man from another clan. While she belonged to the Pathan community, Rashid belonged to the Chipi community of the Muslims which Muzammil considered to be an interior one to his,” said Bhatt. Satish Kapri, senior sub-inspector, Kashipur police station said, “Five rounds were fired at the couple in which Rashid sustained injuries in his face while Nazia was shot in the chest.” “Following the incident, the family members of Rashid lodged a complaint. Muzammil, Mohsin, Afsar and Jouhar were booked for murder. All are absconding and police are trying to nab them,” said Kapri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newlywed-couple-shot-dead-by-woman-s-family-in-uttarakhand/story-LXvJGRS0RLzS1uz9Dh4UGP.html

IICF is the trust set up by the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) for the construction of the mosque at Ayodhya on the land allotted by the UP government in compliance with the Supreme Court order. The hospital will be part of Indo-Islamic Centre Complex in Ayodhya village that will also include a community kitchen and an Indo-Islamic Research Centre. The research centre will have a museum and a library too. IICF spokesman Athar Hussain said the maximum area of land would be allocated to the hospital, which will also be the largest public utility establishment at the Indo-Islamic complex. The name of the hospital, whose construction is expected to start in next couple of months, is yet to be finalised. “We plan to develop a multi-specialty hospital that would be equipped with the state of the art facilities. The entire hospital would be established in two phases. In the first phase, the arrangement for 100 beds would be made at the hospital while in the second phase 100 more beds would be added to it,” Hussain said.IICF office bearers said the hospital would offer best treatment in cancer care, transplants, spine, heart, robotics, orthopaedics, emergency and others. Officials said that hospital would help in serving the society and play a major role in bridging gap between the communities. On September 1, the trust had appointed a Lucknow- based architect-cum-town planner and a founder of dean faculty of Architecture Jamia Milia University, Delhi to design the mosque that would come up in Dhannipur village, Ayodhya in place of the Babri Masjid. The trust has also appointed noted Indian academician and food critic Pushpesh Pant as consultant curator for the food archive a - section of the museum that would be a part of the Indo Islamic Centre Complex||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alongside-dhannipur-mosque-in-ayodhya-a-200-bed-multi-specialty-hospital/story-9ghYXb0Ew9DlBT23My2B5I.html
09-09-2020||India||PLA territorial violations since July not limited to eastern Ladakh: Intel||The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) violated the Line of Actual Control several times in the past two months, and in several places across the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand, according to intelligence reports, and security and intelligence officials who asked not to be identified.The Chinese transgression was not restricted to Eastern Ladakh alone, the officials and reports reveal — with, in one case, the PLA transgressing up to 40km inside Indian territory before withdrawing. Accounts by the officers also belie Chinese claims of India transgressing the LAC between the two countries. They also point to the larger Chinese strategy: the officials contend that the increased activity along the unsettled, approximately 3,500-km-long border is aimed at keeping the Indian Army on its toes at multiple places and injecting an element of surprise in the ongoing tension, even though Eastern Ladakh remains the main standoff theatre.India and China have been involved in a prolonged, four-month-long standoff since April in which both sides have suffered casualties. At least 20 Indian Army soldiers, including a commanding officer, were killed, and 80 injured, in Galwan in Eastern Ladakh on June 15. Also read: The breakdown with China | HT EditorialAccording to one intelligence official, who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media, the PLA entered Arunachal Pradesh twice in July. According to him, Chinese soldiers transgressed at least 26km inside Indian territory in district Anjaw and “camped for three to four days”, in the first half of that month, before exiting.In the second instance, also in Anjaw, the PLA transgressed through Arunachal’s Hadigra Pass and came in 40km, and retreated only after leaving telltale marks. In early August, there was a face-off in eastern Sikkim’s Jelep La area in which the PLA occupied higher ground and rolled stones onto Indian Army troops. The tension eased after senior officers intervened, but in a joint meeting between the two sides, both stayed adamant on their claim over the Jelep La area. A security official said: “The development was worrying because this was the first such instance in an area which has largely remained undisputed.” Again, in mid-August, the PLA’s presence was noted in Uttarakhand’s Tanjun La Pass “for the first time this year”. A senior army official who asked not to be named said: “The PLA is trying to dominate important heights to gain tactical and strategic advantage. It is also trying to use the disengagement process to upgrade its infrastructure.” The Indian Army did not officially comment on the multiple transgressions. The army is engaged in ground-level talks at the Brigade and Division level. At the political level, defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks with his Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe in Moscow last week. China reached out for a meeting with Singh on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings after India gained an advantage by occupying heights in the Pangong Tso area in eastern Ladakh. In the meeting last Friday, Wei blamed India and said China was not willing to lose a single inch of its territory. Singh told his Chinese counterpart that Beijing was in violation of border agreements while New Delhi was being responsible, and that there should be no doubt about India’s determination to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.The foreign ministers of the two countries are scheduled to meet later this week. A statement issued by India after Singh and Wei’s meeting held China responsible for the prolonged conflict along the LAC. The statement said: “The actions of the Chinese troops, including amassing a large number of troops, their aggressive behaviour and attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo were in violation of the bilateral agreements, and not in keeping with the understandings reached between the Special Representatives of two sides.” On Monday, the Indian Army said in a statement that PLA troops attempted to “close in with one of our forward positions along the LAC and when dissuaded by our own troops, fired a few rounds in the air” to intimidate “our troops”. The statement added that the Indian troops exercised “great restraint”.HT learns that the latest incident happened at the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline. Tensions between the two neighbours are far from over. India has now sought information of five missing civilians from Arunachal who might be in Chinese custody. According to an army official, “We continue to be on heightened alert.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-territorial-violations-since-july-not-limited-to-eastern-ladakh-intel/story-WFOMnyoYDzN24s4FuramFM.html
09-09-2020||India||After a 4-day adventure inside Delhi airport, cat returns home||Pet parent Astha Shah’s anxiety, and her cat Nala’s grand adventure,came to an end last Friday. Airport security traced the eight-month-old feline, which — after being loaded in an Air India flight from Bengaluru on September 1 — managed to slip out of her crate in the aircraft’s cargo belly, steal into the terminal building, and roam the airport for four days, before she was rescued and reunited with her family.An official from the Delhi-based NGO Wildlife SOS, which helped track Nala, said that Shah was travelling with her two cats to Delhi on the Air India flight.“Both cats were being transported in certified pet carriers. When the plane landed in Delhi, the passenger was informed that one of the cats went missing from her carrier during transit at the Indira Gandhi Internation airport. “Our enquiries revealed that the pet carrier in which Nala was put had come undone in the aircraft’s cargo compartment.The cat had slipped out and gotten lost on the vast Delhi airport premises,” a spokesperson for the Wildlife SOS said. When Shah was told that Nala had gone missing, she cancelled her onward journey to Ahmedabad and stayed back in Delhi to help find the cat. “The airport authorities immediately launched a search for the missing feline. Wildlife SOS also assisted with the search operation by placing food baits at several locations inside the airport to lure Nala out. After four days of tracking the cat, she was finally located in the airport’s cargo hold area,” the spokesperson said.Even after she was traced, it took the Wildlife SOS team hours to ease out the terrified and hungry Nala from the cargo facility before being reunited with Shah, the spokesperson added.Shah, who lives in Bengaluru, said the cats are her family and the incident had left her in tears. “House cats struggle to survive on their own for long. The past few days have been extremely stressful, but I received a lot of support from the animal community, the Air India staff, airport authorities and the airport operator. This incident showed me that compassion is not dead and people will still go the extra mile to help a stranger desperately searching for her beloved pet,” Shah told Wildlife SOS.Air India also said the airline was delighted that Nala is now safe with her pet parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-4-day-adventure-inside-delhi-airport-cat-returns-home/story-gushNUknvN4j4Mf2ess4PI.html
09-09-2020||India||Russia in touch with India over vaccine trials, manufacturing||India is considering Russia’s proposal for conducting third phase of clinical trials and manufacturing of its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine Sputnik V by firms in the country, Niti Aayog member Vinod Paul said on Tuesday, adding that specific outcomes of the deal are expected very soon.“Indian scientists have looked at data and we are paving the way for phase 3 trials or bridging studies as per science and the requirements of regulatory system of India. We are working in partnership with this vaccine candidate for manufacture, trials and regulatory facilitation,” Paul said at a briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSputnik V received regulatory clearance from Russia on August 11, making it the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine to be approved by a government. Russian scientists published the results of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of trials in The Lancet last week that demonstrated Sputnik V was safe and induced a satisfactory antibody response in all participants within 21 days. Phase 3 trials of the vaccine began last week.“The government of Russia approached the government of India and sought help on two counts. One, to consider manufacturing through our network of companies for manufacturing high quality vaccines, as the size, volumes and capacity is perhaps the best in the world… And whether, if need be, phase 3 or bridging studies can be conducted in India, which means support in regulatory processes and finding suitable partners for trials,” said Paul. On both counts, there has been significant movement, he said. “The outreach has been extended to several companies in India and three to four have already come forward, and the others are in discussion with their Russian counterparts and the government is facilitating the process of how the connect can be made. There may be specific outcomes very soon,” he added.Dr K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser to the government, said: “The Department of Biotechnology and its agencies have put in place collaborative processes... They will then decide if the next steps, which are clinical trials at the appropriate phase, are to be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-in-touch-with-india-over-vaccine-trials-manufacturing/story-g8da7IveSrAJxYRagzr5gL.html
09-09-2020||India||70% of banking sector debt affected by Covid-19 impact||The Indian economy wasn’t in great shape even before the Covid-19 outbreak, which has only made matters worse. The report by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) expert committee on a resolution framework, headed by former ICICI Bank chief K V Kamath, brings this out clearly. The report notes that the pandemic “has affected the best of companies” and businesses that were otherwise viable before the outbreak. Experts believe that banks may be more risk-averse to restructuring loans this time around, having already suffered big losses in previous restructuring efforts. ₹15.5 lakh crore: Covid-19’s exclusive addition to stressed debt Nineteen sectors, which were not under stress before the pandemic but have been hit it, account for Rs 15.5 lakh crore of debt. Retail and wholesale trade are the worst affected with outstanding debt of Rs 5.4 lakh crore. The pandemic has also affected 11 sectors which were already under stress. These sectors have a debt of Rs 22.2 lakh crore. Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have the highest , Rs 7.98 lakh crore, among these sectors. Agriculture and allied products make up the biggest silver lining in India’s debt landscape. This sector has debt of Rs 9.8 lakh crore. It was stress-free before the pandemic and continues to be so.  Up to half of stressed companies do not meet restructuring criteria The Kamath committee has specified sector-specific ratios on five major parameters – total outstanding liability to adjusted net worth, total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities), debt service coverage ratio and average debt service coverage ratio to decide whether or not companies will be eligible for loan restructuring. A Nomura analysis of 5,179 companies across 25 sectors shows that 30-50% of them do not meet the necessary criteria on backward looking data.  Huge write-offs in previous restructuring might make banks more risk-averse The Nomura report expects risk-aversion among banks to rise given their bad experience in previous restructuring cycles. “We think banks will be a lot more prudent towards restructuring in this cycle vs past restructuring cycles where ultimate slippages/write offs were as high as 70-75% in the corporate segment”, the report said. That’s bad news for industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-of-banking-sector-debt-affected-by-covid-19-s-impact/story-MAYiYZWz5NE6Pijm7XQNSJ.html
09-09-2020||India||Only way to overcome GST crisis is to borrow money: Jaganmohan Reddy||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy is upfront in his criticism of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)’s Chandrababu Naidu but cautious while talking about the Congress or explaining his supportive, issue-based approach to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In an interview to Vinod Sharma, Reddy spoke about this, Covid-19 pandemic, his vision of three capital cities for Andhra, etc. Edited excerpts: How prepared are you to contain the spread of Covid-19? The infection has gravely spiked in recent weeks amid reports of the health infrastructure seemingly crumbling under pressure. The decision of your deputy chief minister Amjad Ali and other legislators to seek treatment in private facilities is an expression of no confidence in the state’s health infrastructure.We are fully prepared to contain the spread. From being a state with not even a single lab to test for the virus, Andhra Pradesh has, since March (when the sample of the first case was sent to Bengaluru), acquired the capacity to test more than 60,000 samples a day. We are pursuing a trace, test, isolate and treat policy. All district health teams supported by line departments are fully involved in cluster containment under the direct supervision and monitoring of district collectors. A look at the spread of infection in Andhra indicates that the cases started spreading after unlocking started.The recent spike in cases is expected as lakhs of migrant workers have returned to the state. Our health infrastructure is fully prepared to handle any surge with 4,214 ICU [intensive care unit] beds with oxygen, 17,232 non-ICU beds with oxygen, 17,161 general beds and 1,620 ventilators. In terms of human resources also, we are fully geared up. In addition to the existing health care workers in the system, 2,926 general duty medical officers, 15,98 specialists, 1,461 anaesthesiologists and other technicians, 4,487 staff nurses, 11,200 trainee nurses, 4,109 nursing orderlies, 4,394 sanitation workers and 712 data entry operators have been recruited by district collectors. Above that, 9,712 health professionals are being recruited on regular basis at the state level. That includes 2,000 medical officers, 4,600 staff nurses and other paramedics. The health infrastructure with this kind of manpower and a fully committed administration will be handling any surge without any pressure on the system.You have said the people have to learn to live with the virus. By official counts Covid-19 cases are rising in thousands every day. What is your strategy to contain the pandemic?It is now an accepted fact that the people have to live with the virus in the manner we are living with other diseases. To contain its spread, we have to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. We are aggressively tracing and testing (60,000 samples daily) people in containment clusters. We are leveraging on the availability of two lakh volunteers [200,000] under the newly established 13,000 village and ward secretariats. Each volunteer is allotted 50 households approximately with the mandate to closely monitor their health. In the last five months, these volunteers, supported by 43,000 ASHAs [Accredited Social Health Activists] and 23,000 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) have visited 1.4 crore [14 million] households five times during the fever survey and identified persons with Covid-like symptoms and started testing them. Testing is happening in cluster/containment zones. All primary and secondary contacts of positive persons are being tested. Our strategy of aggressive testing has taken a cue from international learning and WHO guidelines. We have put in place a RCCE [Risk Communication and Community Engagement] strategy with the support of UNICEF for training and awareness on Covid-appropriate behaviour to 1.06 crore [10.6 million] households. A month-long mask campaign has also been initiated for 95% mask utilisation in urban and rural areas. With such a robust system in place, we are very confident of controlling and containing Covid-19. The curve will hopefully be flattened very soon. Going by your government’s statements, the YSR Cheyutha scheme is said to be a game-changer for rural Andhra by benefitting women belonging to the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Backward Classes and minority communities. But there is criticism that it is not reaching the targeted beneficiaries across caste and religion.The idea is to help women take up self-employment ventures. Nearly 80% of women between 45- 60 are being covered. To make the effort successful, the government is trying for backward and forward linkages to these units with companies like Amul and ITC. The scheme will cover all religions. The scheme is not meant for any particular religion.Your bid to help the poor through direct benefit transfers (DBT) is laudable. The flip side is the outreach will consolidate your vote bank, not the state’s economy that is in the red.All states and the central government have been implementing several schemes. A few are through DBT... The reform that we brought is to ensure that the DBT system is foolproof, that there are no leakages and benefits reaches the genuine beneficiary directly, completely, in time and without corruption. New schemes such as Amma Vodi and Rythu Bandhu are investments in social sector. What the state’s responsibility? Maintaining law and order besides focusing on education, health and agriculture. Any investment in these sectors cannot be simple welfare measures. These, in fact, are social capital building investments. If we can provide free education to all depending on their requirement without compromising on quality, that is the best any state can do towards its people. It is a misconception that only private institutions provide quality education. The IITs [Indian Institutes of Technology], IIMs [Indian Institutes of Management], IISC [Indian Institute of Science] and several other top educational institutions are in the public sector. My government’s focus is to bring back primacy to education in government sector and schemes like Amma Vodi [for financial assistance to mothers to educate their children] are a step in that direction. Providing school books, improving the quality of mid-day meals, strengthening staff and physical infrastructure are aimed at providing quality education. Investments in such schemes cannot be looked at as a burden on the exchequer. Same is the case with the health sector. Andhra’s per capita expenditure in the health sector is more than any other state because of schemes like Arogyasri, which has been revamped in terms of coverage and reach. Improving support systems like ambulances and providing some financial relief to the poor after they are discharged from hospitals is something which any government should do. Expenditure on health cannot be considered as a drain on the state’s finances. To provide good quality and free health services is the fundamental responsibility of the state. Most of our welfare schemes revolve around education, health and agriculture. The services we extend to farmers are limited because we will never be able to do as much as they need. That is one sector which had always been neglected. A portion of the money is spent on irrigation and the rest on investment subsidy to the farmer. Direct or indirect investments in the primary sectors ultimately come back to the state’s economy in one form or the other.My father late YS Rajasekhara Reddy [YSR] studied the ground realities when he came to power in the undivided Andhra in 2004. In 1997, more than 7,000 farmers committed suicide in the state. Instead of going to the root cause of the problem, the then TDP dispensation brushed the issue under the carpet by passing the buck... YSR understood the problem and realised that most of the farmers committed suicide because of debt. They incurred debt for three reasons: children’s education, health issues and for digging bore wells in the absence of surface water. That is what brought about the fee reimbursement scheme, Arogyasri, irrigation projects and free power supply to the agriculture sector. These schemes addressed the problem and yielded the desired results. I am carrying forward these schemes with some improvisation besides expanding the base. While continuing fee reimbursement, we are focusing on schools, where the infrastructure is being revamped and the curriculum redesigned to meet high standards of education. In the irrigation sector, we are extending input subsidy to save the farmer from debt trap. We are doing that while not ignoring infrastructure creation. Irrigation projects like Polavaram are going on. Three sea ports are coming up. Huge investments are being made in the power sector. Some roads and buildings projects are being lined up with the aid of the World Bank.It is not the large number of welfare schemes which are causing the so-called financial stress. I inherited pending bills of Rs 40,000 crore in the power sector alone from the previous government. No one was aware of it. This is equal to the money my government spent in a year on all welfare schemes. The state had a debt burden of Rs1,17,000 crore when Andhra Pradesh was divided in 2014 and by 2019 it went up to Rs3,00,000 lakh crore. Repayment stress is there. Pending bills were huge. Then to our misfortune, the economy started doing badly and then came the Covid pandemic.What was the need for separate village secretariats and village volunteer system? Is the administration unable to reach the people properly at the grassroots level?The village secretariat and village volunteer system is to provide a delivery mechanism at grassroots level, or in panchayat raj parlance [designating] functionaries in the villages to ensure that schemes are delivered without pilferage. After the introduction of the village secretariat system, pilferage has come to a nought in DBT schemes and welfare measures. There were some functionaries earlier in the panchayat raj system, but the people did not know who they were and where they sat? Now, they are in the midst of the beneficiaries.For want of employment, many governments have been trying to give unemployment doles. Instead of a dole, why not use youths in a purposeful and service-oriented manner—and pay them Rs5,000 as honorarium instead of Rs2,000 dole. That makes them better and more responsible human beings. In Andhra, they are playing a crucial role in the implementation of welfare schemes. They have played a crucial role during natural calamities and against the Covid-19 pandemic. People have positively received the experiment and appreciated the village volunteers for their efforts.When 60% of the population lives in villages, common sense tells us that 60% of the government employees should be available in villages. In reality, till this government came to power, not even six per cent of the government employees were in villages. Most of them were in urban centres. That is what we have reversed.The Centre has lagged behind in paying GST compensation to states. If the stalemate lingers, would you be open to borrowing from the market? What will be its impact on Andhra’s exchequer?It is okay. They are taking time and so far paying a little late. It is not that they have drastically cut down. They have been passing on [the money] with some delays. This is understandable keeping in view the Covid-19 situation and its impact on the country’s economy. The only way to overcome the crisis is borrowing. The Centre has also asked the states to go for additional borrowings. As we cannot tax people more, we are working on possible additional revenue generating options.In the context of the New Education Policy, how do you move forward with your promise of English medium in schools? The problem is till Class 5. The policy says post Class 5, there is no compulsion to have mother tongue as the medium of instruction. In other words, we can implement English medium in schools from Class 6 the way we have designed and planned. Up to Class 5, primacy has to be given to the mother tongue. While conforming to the national policy, we can start giving more and more inputs on English up to Class 5 so that the students are equipped to switch over to English medium from Class 6.We feel the Centre has done an excellent job in bringing equity in the policy. We decided to introduce English medium not because we love English and want to neglect our mother tongue. It is because we wanted to bring in equity. Those who can afford to are sending their kids to English medium schools while the children of the poor are being forced to study in regional languages as they cannot afford English medium schools. Students with private school background are taking away major chunk of the jobs in public and private sectors, leaving behind those who are educated in mother tongues in government schools. The idea of English medium education is to create an equal platform. If private schools across the country introduce mother tongue as the medium of instruction till Class 5 in conformation with the new policy, then there is no issue at all.After Telangana’s creation, your predecessor Chandrababu Naidu unsuccessfully sought a special category status from the Centre for Andhra. He wanted to build in the state a revenue-earning city comparable to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. Not much has been heard of that since you became the CM.We cannot give up the demand for special category status. An agro-based state like Andhra can take off industrially only if some quality industrial incentives are given. That would be the biggest incentive as revenue deficit is being taken care of anyhow. Both the previous finance commission and present finance commission have addressed the revenue deficit issue. The so-called financial package is not going to help address the fundamental issue of industrial incentives which the hill states are extended. We continue to harp on the status as we cannot afford to give it up....on revenue earning city, I call it perverted thinking. Nowhere in the world has it been proved. Major cities grow over decades and centuries. Investing Rs1,00,000 crore to build a mega metro is not viable. Forget about additional revenue, you cannot even repay the debt which you have spent on infrastructure. What is the contribution of major cities of the US to its economy? Take for example a place called Omaha. With 400,000 population, it headquarters 23 of the fortune 500 companies of the world. That is where Warren Buffet stays. Bill Gates operates from Seattle. Revenue gets generated through manufacturing and a proper service sector. Why should industry be located in urban areas? For instance, Visakhapatnam is not our capital. When it was a small town, a steel plant and a few other industries were set up there a few decades ago. Now, it is emerging as a major city. In a similar way, we can have growth centres where industries can be promoted. The Covid experience tells us that most of the cities ultimately become sick. There is a gradual shift from the so-called major cities or metros to medium and small towns. Look at the top 10 developed countries. None of them have a metro and mega city. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Finland…all these developed countries have no mega cities. Development is not industrialisation or urbanisation. Development means many a things like per capita income and happiness index.Instead of pouring in entire money in building a congested and a not required urban place, spend that money in connecting various places and ensuring faster mobility and cost-effectiveness. It is a wrong perception that cities generate more money. Barring a couple of exceptions, green field capital cities did not succeed anywhere in the world. The success of one such city was built on oil money, which was abundantly available in that nation. Infrastructure was created as financial resources were available in plenty. They did not look at it from the economic angle. Do we have that many resources to build the so-called Amaravathi? The Boston Consulting Group analysed it from economic perspective and said its investments are not viableThat brings one to your plans to have separate capitals for the three arms of the state: the executive, the judiciary and the legislature. The matter is sub-judice. But you certainly can share the administrative vision behind the move.The three capitals is a layman perception. [In effect] a capital city’s functions are being distributed: executive functions from Visakhapatnam, legislative from Amaravathi and judicial from Kurnool. These are the exact words used by Sivaramakrishnan Committee. The capital’s functions can be distributed among different places. Why all these functions should be delivered from a particular place? The residuary state of Andhra Pradesh suffered twice in the past on account of Chennai and Hyderabad. That is what history tells us. If you put all your eggs in one basket you are going to suffer. Then why you want to continue with the same approach without taking into account the past experiences? It is not logical and rationale thinking. The insider trading approach in Madhapur of Hyderabad in late 90s is tried again by the previous regime in Amaravathi. If the secretariat and assembly or High Court do not mean development, then why bother… do not talk about them. The document prepared by the previous regime says that you need Rs 1,00,000 crore. Instead of planning to build a so-called city at a place which is not suitable for construction of any mega structures in 33,000 acres land acquired or pooled from farmers, he could have planned something in 500 acres elsewhere.Why does he need 33,000 acres when a mere 500 acre land is sufficient as per the Siva Rama Krishnan report? The special investigating team is probing land deals unearthing benamis of my predecessor and his cronies. People with vested interests purchased lands from poor farmers. Then came the announcement of the capital and subsequent scam. Those who purchased lands at throwaway prices benefited to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. It was just a real estate business by the previous regime to benefit a certain section of people. Once the development is diversified and spread across the state, they become centres of growth in near future.How many major cities Kerala has? None! And yet, Kerala is ahead of other states in several parameters. Development has to be distributed across the state. Visakhapatnam, Anantapuram, Kurnool and Tirupati and a few other cities can become clusters of development. Ports are being developed. Central Andhra, which is an agriculture hub, can have some agro-logistic parks and all can prosper.What will you say to the criticism that you want to downgrade Amaravathi to slight Naidu? The charge sticks also because the TDP leader has not been too kind to your administration whom he accuses of spying on the Opposition.This is absurd. Why should we bother about Amaravathi? We believe in the overall development of the state. We did not leave Amaravathi. The legislature will continue to work from Amaravathi. When experts say it is a wrong approach, why do not you respect their opinion?In India, the concept of referendum is not in use. The other option available for taking a decision is the experts’ opinion. Had there been a referendum option available, we would have definitely gone for it. We are confident the people would have given a thumps up for our decentralised development. Except those 29 villages and 10,000 farmers opposing decentralisation for obvious reasons, the entire state would have stood behind us if a referendum were to be conducted. Since, there is no scope for this, we respected the committee appointed by the central government [and] we appointed our own expert committee. They too have given their opinion. We took the opinion of BCG. Based on the feedback from such quarters, the state’s political executive took a conscious decision that a decentralised model is far better than a centralised model.Mega cities are unwanted, they only drain resources and become a burden on the people. The government’s role is to provide services at optimum cost. We are for decentralised development. We are going for multi-speciality hospitals and medical colleges in all districts (new districts are going to be carved from the existing 13 districts).The spying allegation is absurd. The DGP [director general of police] asked the opposition to produce evidence which they could not. In fact, when we were in the opposition, phones of our senior leaders were tapped and we had provided official proofs to that effect.Your father was also a political opponent of Naidu. But he would often say that they started in politics at the same time, in the same party and were friends. Is not there a need for rival parties and leaders to work together when the pandemic is posing serious challenges to public health and the economy?They are stuck up with the single idea that they should protect their investments in Amaravathi. They have no other agenda. In the last 15 months, he is only talking about Amaravathi and nothing else. Amaravathi is not worth discussing. We have said time and again that we are for decentralised development. There is no way we can consider one single place for development just because you and your colleagues purchased land there. What cooperation you are referring to? After March, he [Naidu] has not set foot in Andhra while the state is battling the pandemic.How are you viewing the recent demands for an overhaul of the Congress, your erstwhile party? Can it stay intact without a Gandhi family member at the helm?Ours is a regional party and is very strong in Andhra. We do not have the numbers to influence national politics despite being the fourth-largest party in the Lok Sabha. Our role is confined to the development of the state which was pushed into a disadvantageous position after the bifurcation. We are in the process of rebuilding the state. National aspirations are not of a priority to us.How would you describe your equation with the BJP whom your party has often supported in the Parliament? Are you a proximate ally or an issue-based supporter?We place the interests of our state ahead of other [matters] and navigate in that direction in dealing with every issue. We believe that the special category status for Andhra will be a reality, if not now then in the near future. We are optimistic on that count. Our support will be issue-based and will dovetail the betterment of our state in every aspect. We are in the process of rebuilding the state after its reorganisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-way-to-overcome-gst-crisis-is-to-borrow-money-says-andhra-cm-jaganmohan-reddy/story-79cYAtlfPS4rraXdcVp2zL.html
09-09-2020||India||Deepak Kochhar arrest: Transactions worth ₹15 cr under ED lens||A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday remanded former ICICI Bank managing director Chanda Kochhar’s husband, Deepak Kochhar, until September 10 to the custody of the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Deepak Kochhar’s remand, a day after his arrest, came as the ED investigates over two dozen transactions worth over Rs 15 crore in three bank accounts of Deepak Kochhar in Mumbai between 2008 and 2019, people familiar with the development said.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, along with Sunil Gonsalves, seeking Kochhar’s custody, argued that his interrogation was required to determine crucial aspects of funds received by his company and unravel the money trail.The people familiar with the development said two transactions, one worth Rs 2.20 crore by Chanda Kochhar in her husband’s account on November 23, 2010 and another worth Rs 1.39 crore by her sister Karna Varuna Jaiprakash on January 14, 2016, are of particular interest to ED investigators. The central agency sought details from Deepak Kochhar about these two transactions in his HDFC Bank account but said he had not provided them until Monday. In fact, he was questioned about these transactions before his arrest Monday night in Mumbai, said an officer who didn’t want to be named. ED is also looking into the transactions carried out by Deepak Kochhar with two companies , Pacific Capital Services Pvt Ltd (PCSPL) and Opel Properties Pvt Ltd (OPPL), suspected to be linked to him, according to documents reviewed by HT.  Kochhar received Rs 40 lakh in his DBS Bank account in Mumbai from OPPL on June 26, 2009 out of which Rs 39 lakh was transferred to his company NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL) the very next day. Subsequently, he received Rs 75,000 from OPPL on January 27, 2010. In all, there were nine transactions in DBS, the documents show. On May 2, 2008, he received Rs 20 lakh in his ICICI Bank account in Mumbai from OPPL, which was transferred to NRL on May 4. An amount of Rs 65,000 was received by him in the same account from PCSPL on July 30, 2008. ED documents also reveal that the agency sought details of at least 15 transactions in Deepak Kochhar’s HDFC Bank account on different occasions; it wants to know the details of the senders and purposes of transfers. The 15 payments, totaling around Rs 9 crore, were made within a period of three months, from June 29, 2010 to September 18, 2010. These payments ranged from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 2 crore. “All these transactions point to layering and money laundering. But we want to be sure so we asked Deepak Kochhar. However, he was being evasive. We hope he will reveal all details during custodial interrogation,” the officer cited above said.  ED took up the probe into money laundering after the Central Bureau of Investigation registered a case of corruption against the Kochhar couple. CBI initiated its inquiry in 2017 against the couple on the basis of a whistle blower complaint about quid pro quos for loans sanctioned by ICICI Bank. In a first information report registered in January last year, CBI alleged that six high-value loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were given by ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group of companies between 2009 and 2011. It said that a 2009 credit facility to Videocon was extended in contravention of rules and policy of the sanction committee, of which Chanda Kochhar was a member.It alleged that a loan of Rs 300 crore was disbursed to Videocon International Electronics Limited on September 7, 2009, out of which an amount of Rs 64 crore was transferred to Deepak Kochhar’s NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd by Videocon the following day..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deepak-kochhar-arrest-transactions-worth-15-cr-under-ed-lens/story-kOXKWhohfVMhQNlnr2rtaL.html
09-09-2020||India||Delhiwale: No time for spicy golgappas||No crowd on the street. No hope of getting a customer. Golgappa vendor Sooraj Pal’s face is hidden behind a blue mask. “I will wait,” he says.This evening, he was walking by a south Delhi lane when he decided to stop by this spot. Mr Pal’s street stall moves with him—it consists of a tripod stand called tirona (it is sold in Old Delhi’s Khari Baoli for ₹150), a large glass-shielded basket at the top of the tirona filled with golgappas and papris, a brass platter to support the large basket, a small plastic basket tucked at the bottom of the tirona for customers to dispose of their used bowls, and vessels containing tamarind water and spiced chickpeas.Gazing upon the crispy shells, Mr Pal hopes “more people will start coming to my stall, like in the old days.” He means the pre-corona era.Unlike many of the fellow vendors he knew, Mr Pal stayed in the city instead of returning to his family in Badayun, UP. “There was nothing to do in the village.”He resumed work following the challenging months of the lockdown “but the earnings are barely enough for my daily survival.” Absolutely no possibility to send savings home, he notes matter-of-factly.Mr Pal leaves his rented room in Kotla village at 10 in the morning and returns twelve hours later. “So often I stay idle with nobody approaching me for golgappas.”Showing his clipped finger nails, he says that “I wash my pants and shirt everyday, so that people have confidence in the cleanliness of my food.”Now a man approaches the stall. He is an auto driver wearing a colourful mask. The driver stares at the golgappas, stays motionless for a few moments, and turns back, retracing the route to his auto.Mr Pal blankly watches the speeding cars on the road. After some time he lifts the golgappa basket and keeps it on his head. He places the tirona under his arm and walks away.Some minutes later, some turnings away, he is spotted sitting on a pavement, his masked face hidden behind his stall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-no-time-for-spicy-golgappas/story-Sf6OviCNmisnqr4SZIhQCK.html
09-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In the beginning (I’ve always wanted to start a column thus), everyone thought the battle against the coronavirus disease would be a sprint. One 49-day long lockdown, or multiple weeks-long lockdowns interspersed with breaks for a few months, would flatten the curve, experts said. A post titled The Hammer and the Dance, detailing one such lockdown-and-fight approach, went viral. The HT newsroom wrote up (and talked up) several research studies and papers that spoke of this. How wrong we all were.The pandemic is now in its seventh month in India. A 68-day long lockdown (albeit, with some relaxations after three weeks) was imposed when the country had a few hundred cases. It now has over four million. And among large countries hit hard by the viral disease, it is the only one yet to see its peak (or even its first peak).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the beginning, everyone was careful. People respected rules, wore masks, socially distanced themselves, didn’t venture out unless they had to (and when they did, the sensible ones wore gloves even if they made them look funny), asked the help not to come (the generous ones still paid them), stocked up, and stayed safe.Even those who couldn’t afford to stay home did so — fear and the rules kept them there.In the beginning — after a few missteps, most notably in the case of migrant workers left stranded in large cities without jobs, and in some cases, without homes — the central government was proactive. There were daily briefings by the health ministry, expert groups addressing various aspects of the pandemic, sincere efforts to acquire ventilators and PPE, regular interactions between the Prime Minister and chief ministers, addresses to the nation by the PM, and there was a general sense that we would overcome.Things are opening up now, from a feeling that the infection fatality rate (see Dispatch 152 for more on this) is only around 0.1% in large cities; from the knowledge that masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing can prevent infections; but also from a sense of resignation, fatigue, desperation, and lack of any other options.The opening can’t be driven by the confidence that the worst is behind us, simply because it isn’t. India is seeing the most cases in a day, and the most deaths, and no amount of spin about how many recoveries there are (there are bound to be, it’s simple math) or how low the fatality rate is (it is, but if we accept this cheerfully, we somehow seem to be suggesting that a thousand deaths a day is a price worth paying) can hide the fact that we are in the midst of a huge crisis.It is a crisis that has wreaked havoc on lives and livelihoods — and transformed life, work, study, and play. Indeed, it has become so bad that many of us no longer even talk about the crisis — unfortunately, this includes those who should only be talking about it.The battle against Covid-19 is a marathon, and it is suddenly becoming clear that many may not have the mental stamina for it. Managing Covid-19 requires respect for science and data (don’t get me started on this); attention to detail; an understanding of cause, effect, and consequences; and a willingness to read, listen, assimilate and synthesise.Policymakers and political leaders need this (the latter have, in the past, displayed tremendous physical and mental stamina for political work), and many have been found wanting. It still isn’t clear who is leading the fight against the disease in the country — when India crossed a million cases, Dispatch 108 recommended that the government appoint a Covid Commissioner to spearhead the country’s response, and also a data chief.Health administrators need this stamina too — and many of them have also been found wanting. In hindsight, India’s testing strategy was wrong (it took till the end of last week for the Indian Council of Medical Research to even recommend when which test should be used); it didn’t trace aggressively enough; and even if the system of isolating the infected worked (it didn’t always), people let themselves down with their behaviour.So, what should we do now?Like a flagging marathoner, all of us need to refocus, and run on. To quote from the best book of running ever written (I may have referred to it before in this column): “You don’t become a runner by winning a morning workout. The only true way is to marshal the ferocity of your ambition over the course of many days, weeks, months, and (if you could finally come to accept it) years. The Trial of Miles; Miles of Trials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-E2BmjvUDC0uDcg0X48AnWJ.html
09-09-2020||India||Bengal’s Sunderbans billed ‘endangered ecosystem’, mangroves show signs of climate-resilience||The Sunderbans in West Bengal – a UNESCO world heritage site and home to the only tiger that lives in mangroves – has been categorized as an ‘endangered ecosystem’ by a team of scientists from four countries. But there is a silver lining too. The researchers have found that the world’s largest mangrove system, which has been degraded because of unbridled human activities in the past, is showing signs of stabilization and is gradually becoming resilient to climate change. “The Sunderbans, which has seen much degradation in the past, has been categorized as an endangered ecosystem according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s The Red List of Ecosystems. Felling of trees for human settlement over the past few centuries which has degraded the mangrove to a large extent and the declining fish population were the two primary reasons to tag the delta as an endangered one. Ongoing threats, including climate change and reduced freshwater supply may further impact the delta,” said Punyasloke Bhadury, who heads the Centre for Climate and Environmental Studies at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research. The IUCN’s Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is a global standard for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse. The Giant Kelp Forest in Alaska, the tidal flats of Yellow Sea in east Asia and Lake Burullus in Egypt also fall in the endangered category. The Gnarled Mossy Cloud Forest in Australia and Gonakier forest in Senegal are two critically endangered ecosystems. The Aral Sea which has dried up has been tagged as a collapsed ecosystem. “However, mangrove extent has since stabilised, tiger numbers are slowly recovering and analysis of mangrove condition highlights that only a small proportion of the forest is classified as degraded. We are cautiously optimistic about the future of the Indian Sundarbans,” said Michael Sievers, a scientist with School of Environment and Science at Griffith University in Australia and the corresponding author of the research paper.The study was done by researchers from various institutes including the Oxford University and Griffith University in four countries – India, UK, Australia and Singapore. The findings have been published in the latest issue of Biological Conservation-- a journal of the Elsevier group. The Sunderbans sprawls over 10,200 sq km. While 4200 sq km lies in West Bengal in India, the remaining 6000 sq km is in Bangladesh. Around 200 tigers have adapted to this mangrove and hence have acquired global importance. The scientists have analysed data of past five decades till March 2020, which means even though they have included the effects of Cyclone Aila in 2009 and Cyclone Bulbul in November 2019, they missed out the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan in May 2020. Cyclone Amphan had devastated almost one third of mangrove forest, top forest officials had said. The scientists have warned that despite the positive signs, several threats remain. Impacts from hydrological modifications and salinity alterations, from climate change and sea level rise, and from coastal erosion and reduced sediment supply all need to be properly monitored and managed where possible. The findings have been shared with authorities of the state pollution control board and the forest department. “We are planting around 50 million saplings of mangrove species in the Sunderbans to cope with the loss which the delta has suffered during Cyclone Amphan. The tiger population has increased from 88 to 96 in the past one year. A series of measures such as generating jobs though MGNREGA are being taken for the villagers,” said VK Yadav, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-sunderbans-billed-endangered-ecosystem-mangroves-show-signs-of-climate-resilience/story-sixh1ndTydSFSbP3WLhSxM.html

The facility was discontinued after alleged harassment of health workers by people and difficulty in reaching every house, said Mohammad Suleman, additional chief secretary, health department. Suleman said, “Fatality rate of Covid 19 patients has come down in Madhya Pradesh to 1.4 % from 2.4%. The recovery rate in Madhya Pradesh has been recorded at 76%. At present, there are about 17,000 active cases in Madhya Pradesh. About 40% patients in Madhya Pradesh are availing treatment under home quarantine.” “At present, about 55% ICU beds are occupied in cities like Bhopal and Indore. Along with this, the authorised hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 will also give bills for the amount spent on the admitted patient. It will completely be up to the patient’s will to pay 100 percent or some part of it,” said Suleman. Chief minister Shivraj Singh, who chaired the meeting, said control command centres will be introduced in every district, doctors will also be made available in these centres for counselling of common people. He further said that Urban Administration and Panchayat & Rural Development Department will organise awareness programme. The CM also showed concern on the increasing number of cases in Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur in the meeting, said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-door-to-door-collection-of-samples-of-covid-suspects-in-mp/story-AyMrOwecGIY74alidmWNSL.html

These workers have highlighted their plight due to unavailability of livelihood options and difficulty in travelling back to their workplace for rejoining work,” Pradhan wrote.“I am informed that even though some employers are willing to offer bus transport service from Odisha, due to the prevailing monsoon conditions, a long and arduous journey via road is neither feasible nor safe for such long distances. Keeping in mind the need to reignite our economy and the plight of migrant workers in Odisha, who are in urgent need of livelihood. I request your personal intervention for restarting of Shramik Special Trains from Odisha to states like Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra at the earliest,” he added.The Centre had begun operation of Shramik Special trains’ from May 1 for transportation of stranded migrant labourers during the lockdown period. Railways has said more than 63 lakh migrants were ferried in over 4,600 Shramik Special trains and the last Shramik train ran on July 9.According to officials aware of the development, the ministry may soon announce additional special trains from Odisha to meet the state government’s demand.“No other state has requested to run Shramik Trains as yet. But in addition to the 40 pairs of trains announced recently more regular trains are expected to be run from Odisha to meet the demand,” the official said requesting anonymity.The Indian Railways will deploy 80 special trains from September 12, in addition to the 230 special trains currently operating, the railway ministry announced on Saturday. The reservation for the special trains will begin from September 10.Chairman and CEO of the railway board VK Yadav had last week said that a key factor in starting the 80 new trains were migrant workers returning to their places of work. Yadav said the occupancy of the trains has gone up to 80-85% now and about a dozen trains are low occupancy.“Many of these trains are running in reverse direction of the Shramik Special trains. So, they are leaving their homes and going towards their workplaces. The occupancy of 12 trains is very less among the 230 trains, so we are running them, but will reduce the number of coaches. We are monitoring the occupancy of trains and will run more trains as per demand,” Yadav had said.To be clear, the ministry had clarified that all regular trains will continue to remain suspended but additional special trains will be operated based on the requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharmendra-pradhan-writes-to-railway-minister-seeks-shramik-trains-to-ferry-migrant-workers-from-odisha/story-KtBWXLEKVvCVtcARgukbxM.html

Moving forward, PUBG Corporation will take on all publishing responsibilities within the country,” PUBG said in a statement. Hindustan Times on September 2 reported that the Indian government has banned PUBG, along with 118 other mobile applications with links to China, citing reports that these apps were ‘stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner.” The government said these apps promoted activities “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”. “This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace,” the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) said. Tencent confirmed that PUBG Corp would take on the responsibilities of publishing the mobile game in India, news agency Reuters reported. “Our existing cooperation with PUBG Corporation in global markets other than India is not affected,” Tencent said in a statement, according to Reuters.The move was seen as being aimed at Chinese technology giants such as Tencent Holdings, the country’s search engine leader Baidu Inc., Xiaomi’s ShareSave and online payments giant Ant Group Co.’s platform Alipay. PUBG was banned in the third round of blocks ordered by the government in the wake of the increased military tensions between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had called the move a :”digital strike on China.” “This is a business call,” an IT ministry official (CHECK) said, asking not to be named. The official added that there is no question of revoking the ban until the government is satisfied that all its concerns have been addressed. “The reasons and grounds on which the ban has been imposed go way beyond ownership,” said this person. “Unless those concerns are addressed, {there is no} no reason to revoke the ban. The larger issues remain that of data privacy, data security and the information that the apps are collecting from users. We have sent 70-odd questions to the blocked apps, we will review them and respond.” The government is also going through the answers provided by the 59 apps banned in the first round, including TikTok, and the 47 mirror apps banned in the second. All the app operators will also be given a chance to make their case in front of a panel which is yet to begin hearing their representations. PUBG’s statement said that the ‘corporation fully understands and respects the measures taken by the government as the privacy and security of player data is a top priority for the company.”“It hopes to work hand-in-hand with the Indian government to find a solution that will allow gamers to once again drop into the battlegrounds while being fully compliant with Indian laws and regulations,” said the statement. “As the company explores ways to provide its own PUBG experience for India in the near future, it is committed to doing so by sustaining a localized and healthy gameplay environment for its fans.” India accounts for over a quarter of PUBG Mobile’s lifetime installs though revenues from the country are still minuscule, a Bloomberg report said, citing data from research firm Sensor Tower. PUBG had seen its user numbers rocket in India as the coronavirus disease-related lockdown boosted gaming. The banned versions of PUBG include PUBG Mobile Lite, a leaner version of the app suited to inexpensive smartphones, as well as PUBG Mobile Nordic Map: Livik, a newer game played in Nordic terrain.According to Raman Jit Singh Chima, lawyer and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group, the government is citing law and order and data protection as grounds for an economic decision. “Normally, countries criminally charge a firm for violating data privacy and not block the services,” said Chima. “PUBG’s actions seem to indicate that they are hopeful that the government may reinstate the application now. If we look at the US, they are clear on the fact that their move against Tencent is an economic one and aims to restrict its activities; they have not banned PUBG,” he added. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pubg-pulls-india-rights-from-china-based-tencent-games-after-ban/story-Ia2b2tRATCfKaLkoOCMYxI.html

According to cyber police officials, Jamani dropped out of school after class 12 and started working at an onion dehydration plant. Dr Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber), said, “On September 4, we received complaints from seven parents whose children are in the age group of 10 to 15 years. The parents complained that someone had uploaded morphed nude images on Instagram, a photo sharing app, of their children, following which an FIR was registered.” “We have recovered four mobile phones from his [Jamani] house which he used for this crime. These phones belong to his mother, father, elder brother and himself. From one of those phones we have recovered more than 800 nude images of minor girls and the accused said he had blackmailed them to get these pictures. We have found his 17 fake Instagram profiles which he used to become friends with minors. We are further investigating to know why he was collecting these pictures,” Karandikar said.Last year, he was arrested by the Pune police for the same crime and upon release on bail he again started this. On Monday, the accused was produced before metropolitan magistrate court and was sent to police custody for six days.Karandikar said the FIR has been under section 354D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code section 12 (Punishment for sexual harassment) and 13 (Use of child for pornographic purposes) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 43, 66, 66C, 66D, 66E of Information Technology Act. On September 6, a team was dispatched to Gujarat to arrest him. According to the police, the accused revealed during questioning that he used to first send friendship requests to minor girls and then would start chatting with them. He later would download the girl’s picture, said police, from the Instagram account, morph it with nude picture and then upload it on his other account’s wall.The accused would then send his victim screenshots of the nude picture and would ask the victim to share their username and password so that he could stop it, the police added. “Once the victim shared the details, he would change the password and the password recovery email id and mobile number, to ensure that the victim would not be able to recover their password, and would then blackmail them over nude photographs and videos,” said a police officer from the cyber unit. Jamani, at the same time, also would chat with other female friends of the victim through the victim’s Instagram account and would share morphed images of the victim with them, added officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-year-old-put-morphed-nude-images-of-minors-on-instagram-arrested/story-c4OMpKsbaVASZQJ7PQ9hEP.html
09-09-2020||India||Shots fired at LAC after 45 years||The Indian Army on Tuesday said Chinese troops fired into the air on September 7 to intimidate its soldiers holding dominating heights near a strategic mountain pass in eastern Ladakh, in a failed attempt to close in on a forward position controlled by India as bullets flew at the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) for the first time in 45 years.Soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tried to advance on the Mukhpari peak near Rezang La on Monday evening but stopped in their tracks after a stern warning from the Indian Army, which occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, officials familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.The last recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when the PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead. The situation remains tense in the area with around 40 to 50 Chinese soldiers armed with automatic weapons, spears and machetes still holding positions below the Mukhpari peak, said one of the officials cited above. “They are the same soldiers who fired the shots. Our positions are around 200 metres away. They have been in the area for the last two to three days. The PLA is intent on occupying high ground,” said a second official. Indian soldiers put up a “wire obstacle” near their positions in a warning to the PLA to not cross over, the officials said.Reacting to a claim made by PLA’s Western Theatre Command on Monday night that accused India of crossing the disputed border and firing shots, the Indian Army said it neither violated the LAC nor fired bullets, and that the PLA was trying to mislead domestic audiences and the international community with its baseless allegations. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Indian Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said Indian troops exercised “great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner” despite grave provocation by the PLA. “It is the PLA that has been blatantly violating agreements and carrying out aggressive manoeuvres, while engagement at military, diplomatic and political level is in progress,” the statement said. Experts said the escalation was worrying.“Shots being fired for the first time along the LAC in 45 years is a clear sign of military tensions escalating. Protocols and agreements for border peace appear to have collapsed. The new developments indicate that military friction will only grow in the future,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said. The latest tensions in eastern Ladakh come days after defence minister Rajnath Singh — in a face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wei Fengshe on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow — asked China to strictly respect the LAC, not make attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, and work with India for complete disengagement from all friction areas in the sensitive sector. The incident also comes just days before foreign minister S Jaishankar is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at the SCO meet in Russia this week.“On September 7, it was the PLA troops who were attempting to close-in on one of our forward positions along the LAC and when dissuaded by Indian troops, the PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate our troops,” the army statement said. It did not specify how Indian soldiers “dissuaded” the PLA. The army said while India was committed to disengagement and de-escalating the conflict, China was undertaking provocative actions to escalate the situation.“At no stage has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to the use of any aggressive means, including firing,” the statement said. “The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity. However, it is also determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs. The statement by the Western Theatre Command is an attempt to mislead their domestic and international audience,” it added. The Western Theatre Command on Monday accused Indian soldiers of illegally crossing the LAC and firing “warning shots”, forcing the PLA to take countermeasures. During his meeting with Fenghe on Friday, Rajnath Singh made it clear that India was fully determined to defend its frontiers. He also told the Chinese defence minister that the PLA’s aggressive actions in the Ladakh sector to unilaterally change the status quo on the ground violated bilateral agreements and the understanding between the Special Representatives of the two sides. Singh said while Indian troops showed a responsible approach towards border management, there should be no doubt about India’s determination to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Tensions flared up in the Ladakh sector after the Indian Army occupied strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake following aggressive moves by the PLA on August 29. China made another provocative move on August 31, targeting these positions, but the Indian Army’s defensive action thwarted the Chinese attempt. Both sides have concentrated a significant number of soldiers, tanks and artillery pieces, and are within each other’s rifle range in the area. The situation on the lake’s southern bank remains tense with both armies sending in reinforcements to the area where the Indian Army controls ridge line positions that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity — India holds a series of positions near Black Top (a hill feature) and on Rezang La and Reqin pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-fired-at-lac-after-45-years/story-o2GjyJqk9qXvLamP55BbwN.html
09-09-2020||India||GST row: Most states likely to opt for borrowing Rs 97k crore||With the Centre clarifying that the only option available to states to receive the GST compensation is for them to borrow, most states, including some ruled by non-BJP parties, are likely to opt for the first of the two options offered at the recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting. Their acceptance, which is likely to be confirmed to the Union finance ministry soon, will put an end to the controversy surrounding the compensation payments.The Centre, at the GST council meeting on August 27, gave two option to the states even as it admitted to a total shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. One, to borrow the projected GST shortfall of Rs 97,000 crore from a special window of the Reserve Bank of India, with both the principal and the interest coming from the compensation cess fund — along with Fiscal Regulatory and Budget Management (FRBM) relaxation of 0.5 percentage point. Or to borrow the entire projected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore – both on account of losses arising from implementation of GST and that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. States have to bear the interest cost in this case. To be sure, the finance ministry has said it is committed to paying the total compensation — only, states will have to wait for the bit arising from Covid-19 till the compensation cess fund is extended. Also read: GST compensation to states a legal obligation, Ashok Gehlot tells PM ModiThe compensation cess is derived from taxes on sin and luxury goods such as tobacco, cars and aerated drinks. Under The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, states are guaranteed compensation for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST for a transition period of five years (2017-22). The compensation is calculated based on the difference between the states’ current GST revenue and the protected revenue after estimating an annualised 14% growth rate from the base year of 2015-16. The council is also working on extending the 2022 deadline for another five years. At the GST council meeting, at least five states — Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, Puducherry and Delhi — voiced their concerns over the proposals. They wanted the Centre to borrow and pay the GST shortfall to the states, a suggestion that was rejected by the Centre. “We have to take what is on the table,” said a Kerala finance department official. “While noting our dissent to the options, we may opt for the first option as it has lesser burden on the state finances. Everything is under discussion.” Also read: ‘GST means economic apocalypse’: Rahul Gandhi’s latest jibe at govt over economy in new videoKerala finance minister, Thomas Issac, who tested Covid positive on Sunday, was one of the first ones to oppose the options, and accused the Centre of going back on its commitment. An official from Maharashtra, another state which opposed the Centre’s options, said it may also go for the first option. “What other option we have?” the official asked, adding that without GST revenue, the state would not be able to pay salaries to its employees and fund various anti-Covid programmes. Manoj Saunik, Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary, finance, said: “We are weighing the options. It will be finalised and conveyed to the Centre in a day or two.” Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing the two options saying they were in violation of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 and said applying 10% (nominal) growth to project a higher revenue loss due to Covid is “statistically untenable” and “factually unsound”, a year after the actual growth was just 4.2%. Nominal growth in 219-20 was 7.2%.“It is the obligation of the Central Government to ensure that the states receive, without liability, the full amount of compensation, notwithstanding the shortfall in the collection of cess and that the compensation can neither be increased nor decreased without amending this Act,” he wrote. He also said that late Arun Jaitley , finance minister at the time GST was launched, had stated that the GST Council could consider raising additional resources including through borrowing but it was never the understanding that the states would borrow this additional amount. “The Council does not have the power to alter the compensation mechanism without getting the Act amended,” he wrote. The Haryana government has decided to go for option 1 as the borrowing will be over and above any other borrowing ceilings eligible notified by the department of expenditure. The special window will not be treated as debt of the state for any norms prescribed by the Finance Commission, a Haryana official said. “The first charge on the GST compensation cess each year will be the interest payable. The second charge will be the principal repayment. The remaining arrears of compensation accrued during the transition period will be paid after the interest and principal are paid,’’ added this official, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Madhya Pradesh finance department official said the state would go for option 1 . Bihar has already communicated to the Union finance ministry that it has chosen option 1. “We have given in writing to the union finance ministry that Bihar will go with option one,” said deputy chief minister cum finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi. Sowjanya (who goes by just one name), secretary, Uttarakhand finance department, said that the state government has not taken a final decision on the matter and will respond to Central government soon.

09-09-2020||India||Maharashtra orders probe into Kangana’s ‘drug use’||Maharashtra ordered a probe on Tuesday into allegations by actor Adhyayan Suman that actor Kangana Ranaut consumed drugs even as an inconclusive Covid test delayed the latter’s departure from Himachal Pradesh to Mumbai, where a political row is brewing over her comments in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. State home minister Anil Deshmukh said that Mumbai Police would be asked to probe into claims made by Suman made three years ago. “Sena lawmakers Prabhu and Sarnaik had raised the issue about the revelation against Ranaut that she was on drugs. Suman was in a relationship with her and he had said that she used to force him to do drugs as well. Mumbai Police will look into the allegations,” Deshmukh said.In the assembly, breach of privilege motions were moved and accepted against Ranaut and Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami in the legislature for “defamatory” remarks on Mumbai and “derogatory” comments against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, respectively. Deshmukh also said Ranaut’s statement likening Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was an insult to Mumbai and Maharashtra. “Mumbai and Maharashtra have given Ranaut everything, but in return she has played with the sentiments of the people. At least, 106 people had laid their lives for a unified Maharashtra. Not only the ruling parties, but even the opposition, BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), must also condemn her statement,” he said.His statement came on a day the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation served a notice to Ranaut, saying her Pali Hill office violated civic rules, and that action will be taken if she failed to reply in 24 hours. The actor, through her lawyer, requested seven days to reply. Ranaut was given Y+ category security by the central government on Monday in the midst of a raging controversy triggered by her remarks likening Mumbai to PoK and subsequent protests by Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena. Ranaut didn’t respond to Deshmukh’s statement but said BMC was intimidating her. “I have all the papers, BMC permissions and nothing has been done illegally in my property. BMC should send a structure plan to show the illegal construction with a notice. Today, they raided my place and without any notice tomorrow they will be demolishing entire structure.”Ranaut, who was in Himachal Pradesh, wanted to return to Mumbai on Wednesday but swab samples taken of her and younger sister Rangoli Chandel for Covid-19 came back inconclusive in Manali, local officials said. A team from Lal Bahadur Shastri Medical College in Mandi visited Ranaut to take fresh samples on Tuesday.Her test report is expected to come late Tuesday night and if cleared, Ranaut is likely to leave for Mumbai on Wednesday morning . She will travel to Chandigarh via road and board a flight for Mumbai. Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said he spoke to Ranaut over the phone. “I have spoken to Kangana ji on phone. She told me she would leave for Mumbai on 9th,” said Thakur....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-orders-probe-into-kangana-s-drug-use/story-oc18jKoXiAzIWhylyrsQPO.html
09-09-2020||India||Not made Delhi HC judge due to sexual orientation: Lawyer||Delhi-based lawyer Saurabh Kirpal, who was one of the lawyers who successfully challenged Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in the Supreme Court in 2018, has alleged that he was blocked from becoming a judge of the Delhi high court because he is gay.Kirpal, 48, said he was first asked if he was open to become a HC judge in April 2017 and filled a form as part of his formal consent.The proposal was cleared by the high court collegium which comprised justices Geeta Mittal, Sanjeev Khanna and Ravindra Bhatt, but got stuck when it was sent to the Intelligence Bureau and Supreme Court for further clearances.Between September 2018 and April 2019, Kirpal’s elevation came up thrice in the top court’s collegiums, according to Him, but the decision was deferred each time.“My professional competence was known to the high court and the Supreme Court collegium and my case for elevation was presumably not deferred for that reason. Media reports seemed to indicate the issue might have been the nationality of my partner who is Swiss. Had I been a straight man with a foreign spouse, this would not have been an issue; former Supreme Court judges have had foreign spouses. But it became an issue only because I am not,” Kirpal told HT. The top court’s website that lists the names of candidates considered by the SC collegium continues to cite Kirpal’s case, indicating it was considered. The last time the SC collegium met was on August 20 under Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.HT spoke to a judicial officer who was aware of the case and confirmed that the Intelligence Bureau asked for more time to “look into the allegation’’ of his relationship. The SC collegium, he said, could have ignored IB’s report but they decided to wait for their clearance.When contacted, an IB official said, “ The SC has decriminalised section 377, so why should it be a factor?’’But Kirpal said he believed his sexuality was the only stumbling block. “The aim was to have diversity on the bench. I really believe it could change the lives of so many LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] people in India.’’In 2018, Kirpal was part of the legal team that argued against section 377, which criminalized intercourse “against the order of nature”. On September 6, 2018 the top court read down the colonial law and decriminalised homosexuality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-made-hc-judge-due-to-sexual-orientation-lawyer/story-wOGl9qxCjf0ddLyEIHYPFK.html

After three days of interrogation, we have sufficient material to arrest her, but I will not comment on the evidence in this case. We will produce that before the court,” said Jain.Rajput, 34, was found dead at his Bandra residence in Mumbai on June 14 in what the city police said initially was a case of suicide.

The court remanded Chakraborty to 14-day judicial custody, rejecting her bail plea.NCB said in its remand application that Chakraborty had revealed her involvement in procuring drugs. “It is also clear from the statement that the present respondent (Chakraborty) used to procure drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput for consumption purpose.

09-09-2020||India||Delhi scales new testing high with more than 45k Covid-19 samples||New Delhi The Delhi government conducted a record 45,797 tests for Covid-19 on Tuesday — days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the ramping up of testing to 40,000 daily samples to tackle a resurgence of cases. This was the first time that the number of daily tests crossed the CM’s target of 40,000 announced on August 26 though a gradual increase in testing in Delhi had started from August 31, with the city setting new records for daily tests in five out of the last seven days.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe milestone in Covid-19 testing comes on the same day that the Delhi high court removed the requirement of a doctor’s prescription to get a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, tests in the city. As testing increased, 3,609 new cases were reported in Delhi — the highest single-day case count since June 24, 76 days ago, when 3,788 new cases were reported. Over the past week, Delhi has recorded 2,868 new cases every day on average. Cases in Delhi rose rapidly through May and June, and started dropping by end of June after hitting an initial peak. After a steady drop in cases for around three weeks (seven-day average of daily cases dropped to 983 by August 4), cases again started rising alarmingly from mid-August. As of Tuesday, there are 197,135 cases in the city.Also read | Covid-19: With 3,609 cases, Delhi records highest ever infections in over 78 daysDelhi health minister Satyendar Jain said people should not panic over the rising number of daily cases. “The main reason why Covid-19 cases are more now is because we have more than doubled our testing. It is part of our ‘test, track, treat and isolate’ strategy, which essentially is the Delhi model,” he said.He added the current daily numbers cannot be compared to the cases reported in June, when 18,000-20,000 tests were being conducted daily and the fresh cases ranged between 2,000-3,000. Also on Tuesday, the Delhi high court said that a doctor’s prescription is not required anymore for asymptomatic patients to get an RT-PCR test. Until now, if someone who did not have any Covid-19 symptoms wanted to get an RT-PCR test (which is considered the gold standard for tests) in Delhi, they had to produce a doctor’s prescription. Delhi residents, however, could get antigen tests without any prescription.Now, only Aadhaar cards (with Delhi address) and an Indian Council of Medical Research form would be required for people who want to get RT-PCR test. On a trial basis, RT-PCR tests for asymptomatic patients would be capped at 2,000 a day, the court said.With 9,944 RT-PCR tests, Delhi also set a record for the highest number of single-day RT-PCR tests, according to Tuesday’s health bulletin. Previously, this record was set on June 29, when Delhi conducted 9,619 such tests.Also read | Delhi: For some patients, wait for ICU bed is long and agonisingDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet on Tuesday: “The Delhi government has increased testing multifold. I have directed the health minister this morning that doctor’s prescription should not be asked for testing. Anyone can get himself tested.”With the increase in tests, the average positivity rate has also started declining. Around 7.9% of tests came back positive on Tuesday. The number, which had dropped from a peak of 31.4% in mid-June to 5.7% at the end of July, was 8.4% in the past week. Overall, 10.7% of all tests done in Delhi have come back positive.Experts welcomed the increase testing in Delhi and said rising cases are not an immediate concern.“The government has taken a very good step of ramping up testing massively. What we need to see is that the number of positive cases that we are reporting every day is not that bad considering the number of tests. We were reporting the same number of cases with maybe 15,000-odd tests in June. The government has also asked hospitals to test all the patients coming into the OPD and their family members too, if needed. This has resulted in us detecting several asymptomatic cases that might have otherwise transmitted the infection on to others,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Disease where the city’s first plasma bank is located.(With inputs from Richa Banka)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-scales-new-testing-high-with-more-than-45k-covid-19-samples/story-K3wkkSDqO2nE2Dkc0yT2jI.html

09-09-2020||India||Top private hospitals fast running out of ICU beds for Covid care in Delhi||There are no intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators available for Covid-19 patients in eight of the Capital’s 11 top private hospitals, data from the Delhi government’s real-time occupancy tracking app, Delhi Corona, showed on Tuesday, raising concerns that the city may face a shortage of critical care resources if the current spike in new infections worsens. The national capital recorded 3,609 new Covid-19 infections as on Monday, taking the number of active cases to 22,377 – the highest since July 8, the government’s daily health bulletin showed on Tuesday. The number of people in hospital has risen in tandem: from 3,590 beds occupied August 24 to 5,218 on September 7.While this still leaves 8,788 of the 14,202 beds vacant, the concern particularly relates to ICU beds – of the 14,202, only 2,117 are in the intensive care category. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“With the increase in the number of cases, we will have to start optimising our resources and may have to follow a strict cut-off like what was being followed in June -- only those with oxygen saturation below 94% were being admitted to hospitals. However, by then sometimes the condition already starts deteriorating,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital.The beds data from the Delhi Corona application reflect a drastic imbalance in people’s preference, with large private hospitals being the most sought after. The high occupancy also extends to ICU beds without ventilators in the top eight private hospitals, where 85% of these were occupied. In three of these, Max Patparganj, Fortis Shalimar Bagh and Apollo, there were zero vacancies even though 35% of such beds were reported vacant across the city.  The Delhi government and top health officials acknowledged that beds in private hospitals were seeing high demand, but added that there is adequate resources for now. “There are enough ICU beds available, there is no need to worry,” a Delhi government spokesperson said.“It is the big private hospitals that have started getting full. And, this is mainly because many prefer to go to these possibly the big multi-speciality ones that have doctors from all disciplines available,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and chair of the first expert committee that had been set up by the Delhi government to manage Covid-19 in the city. Accounting for all private hospitals in the city, 78.6% of ICU beds with ventilators and 66.3% of regular ICU beds were occupied. These numbers were correspondingly higher than government hospitals, where 37.6% of ICU beds with ventilators and 50% regular ICU beds were already full. Also read | Delhi: For some patients, wait for ICU bed is long and agonisingSarin said fatality trends indicate the infrastructure was able to handle the load and the situation was unlikely to become like when it was in June, a time when the capital’s hospitals were stressed. “Even with the increase in the number of hospitalisations, the proportion of deaths is not that high. And, this is because of the standardised treatment protocol that is now in place. Doctors have understood the importance of high flow nasal oxygen, started proning patients to improve their oxygen saturation, started administering antiviral medications and steroids, and of course administering plasma therapy,” he added. Since the June spike, Delhi has beefed up its Covid-19 hospital resources. The city has ordered all private hospitals to reserve 20% of their beds for Covid-19 patients, the army set up a new a field hospital, the operations of two of Delhi governments newly constructed hospitals were expedited and makeshift hospitals were created adjacent to existing ones and in banquet halls.Among the people hospitalised in Delhi are also many who are not from the city. Over 30% of all hospital admissions due to Covid-19 in Delhi were patients from neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan, according to the Delhi government. Among them was a 53-year-old patient from Saharanpur who was brought to the Sir Ganga Ram hospital after doctors in his UP hometown detected pneumonia patches in his lungs. “We booked a car immediately and landed up in Gangaram hospital because I have faith in the doctors here. However, the doctors told us that there were no ICU beds available and we would have to wait. Our family suggested we take him to other hospitals nearby but we did not want to. So, we waited for a bed to become available in the emergency department. He was admitted there for two days,” said the patient’s son, who asked not to be named or for his father to be identified. Dr DK Sharma, the medical superintendent of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) agreed this was one of the factors. “The number of hospitalisations are on the rise in Delhi mainly because of two reasons -- one, the migrant population is returning to the city as the economic activities are picking up and are then getting the disease; two, large number of people from the neighbouring and sometimes even far away states are travelling to Delhi for treatment. For example, in AIIMS 35-40% of the Covid-19 admissions are in people from other states,” he said. “There might not be bed available in the hospital of your choice, however, there will definitely be a bed available for you,” said Sharma. Doctors say it is important to remind people to not become complacent. “We have seen a rise in numbers in the past few weeks for mainly the below mentioned points: 1) the number of tests have gone up, thereby pushing up the diagnosis of the disease; 2) Delhi has eased its earlier lockdown norms. This is visible with increasing traffic and in markets and offices re-opening. People have to be careful in observing social distancing, wearing masks and following hygiene steps because the transmission of virus has picked up pace,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-private-hospitals-fast-running-out-of-icu-beds-for-covid-care-in-delhi/story-X5NPDK56wIkx2wUuqQLXmI.html
09-09-2020||India||Congress plans joint opposition candidate for Rajya Sabha post||The Congress decided on Tuesday to work to field a joint opposition candidate for the post of the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson in a bid to present a united front against the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on September 14, people familiar with the development said on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a meeting of the parliament strategy group of the Congress on Tuesday, a party leader said on condition of anonymity.The meeting was otherwise dominated by the India-China military standoff on the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh. The Congress decided to corner the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government on the issue in parliament, but in a “nuanced” way, given that Indian forces are eyeball-to-eyeball with Chinese troops along the LAC, the leader cited above said.The meeting was attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, his deputy Anand Sharma, party leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury,, his deputy Gaurav Gogoi, and senior leaders AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jairam Ramesh, KC Venugopal, Manish Tewari, K Suresh, Manickam Tagore and Ravneet Singh Bittu. The Congress leader cited above said Tewari pitched for a nuanced approach on the military standoff with China following the June 15 skirmish in the Galwan valley in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese were killed. Tewari also noted nationalistic fervour on the issue and said the Congress needs to be careful how it articulates its position. At the same time, while keeping popular perception in mind, he said it was important to expose the government because there was absolutely no doubt that it had bungled on the China issue. Tewari said that his concern was not what the people will say but what a soldier standing on the borders and guarding the country 24x7 putting his life at stake, will feel at a time when the country is facing the biggest challenge from China since the 1962 war.“Are we going to dampen the morale of the soldiers at a time when they are standing eyeball-to-eyeball with Chinese troops,” he asked. At this point, Rahul Gandhi intervened and agreed with Tewari, said another leader present in the meeting, requesting anonymity. “We need to calibrate our stand,” the leader quoted Rahul Gandhi as saying at the meeting. Venugopal also said the Congress should be vocal in its criticism of China, which he described as the invader and the aggressor. Sharma too echoed Tewari’s views. He said the party should be careful not to demoralise the armed forces given that extensive mobilisation is taking place along the borders and the country faces a situation that is unprecedented since 1962. But some leaders such as Tagore and Bittu said patriotism needs transparency and telling the truth and the Congress should keep up its attack on the government on the issue. Chowdhury said the Congress should demand a white paper from the government on the Ladakh situation. At the outset, Azad listed the issues to be raised in the monsoon session. He said the election to the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson’s post was coming up and all opposition parties should collectively contest it. His views were endorsed by Patel. The Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson’s post is vacant after Janata Dal (United) MP Harivansh retired in April this year. He was re-elected to the Upper House from Bihar soon after and is expected to be the NDA candidate yet again. In August 2018, after the retirement of PJ Kurien of the Congress, Harivansh was elected as the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson. As the NDA candidate, he defeated BK Hariprasad of the Congress. Harivansh secured 125 votes to 105 for Hariprasad. The election to the post is scheduled to be held on the first day of the monsoon session on September 14. The last date for filing nominations is September 11. The Congress is likely to approach the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the post, and has authorised Azad to speak to other parties on the issue and finalise a candidate. The post of deputy speaker of the Lower House is also vacant since the 17th Lok Sabha was constituted in May last year. The party will also flag the Covid-19 situation across the country, the impact of lockdowns, the current state of the economy, decline in gross domestic product growth, Good and Services Tax (GST) compensation to states, job losses, agrarian distress, restoration of the Question Hour and Facebook’s alleged nexus with the ruling BJP. It will also seek a discussion on the PM CARES Fund set up in March to provide relief to those affected by Covid-19. Rahul Gandhi said the party should aggressively raise the Covid-19 issue, given that the situation is grim . He said accountability for the deteriorating situation should be fixed. Ramesh briefed the meeting about the 11 ordinances the government is expected to bring in the session and said the Congress will oppose four of them, including the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 and the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020. Tewari said the party should not oppose the ordinance on the Insolvency and Banking Code (IBC), given that the economy is in a bad shape. “It is a good ordinance and suspends the rigour of the Act,” the second leader quoted him as saying at the meeting. Tewari said the Congress should move adjournment motions to find out “who stands where” on these issues. The meeting also decided to firm up a joint strategy with other like-minded opposition parties. Some key opposition leaders like Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader and Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren have already stated that they will work closely with each other to take on the government in Parliament. The leaders expressed their views at a recent meeting of non-NDA chief ministers called by Sonia Gandhi. A meeting of opposition parties is expected to be held later this week. This was also the first time that three – Azad, Sharma and Tewari -- of the 23 signatories to a letter to the party president seeking a complete overhaul of the organisation came face-to-face with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi after the stormy Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on August 24. Four out of the 23 signatories who are CWC members – Azad, Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada – had come under intense fire from other colleagues at the meeting for writing the letter. After Tuesday’s meeting, Sonia Gandhi is likely to leave for an overseas trip for a routine health check-up and will not be able to attend the full monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-plans-joint-oppn-candidate-for-rs-post/story-m777lQY1DWB6xfmdFSV4qO.html

Before resuming the activities, all work areas have to be sanitised using 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Schools that had been used as quarantine centres will have to be deep cleaned before resuming, the guidelines say.The schools will be allowed to call only half of their teaching and non-teaching staff for online teaching. All employees at higher risk – the elderly, pregnant women, or those employees with co-morbid conditions should preferably not be exposed to work requiring direct contact with the students.Seating plans should be made in a manner that social distancing can be ensured and outdoor spaces should be utilised for teacher-student interactions, weather permitting, according to the guidelines. The schools have also been asked to ensure hand-washing facilities along with soap. Alternative to biometric attendance has to be used in schools as they resume work. Assemblies and sports events that can lead to overcrowding have been strictly prohibited, the guidelines say.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the action aided committee of private unaided recognised schools -- and umbrella body of over 400 private schools in Delhi-- said that their association has already released its own SoPs for the partial re-opening of schools from September 21. “Our SoPs cover almost all the points mentioned in the one issued by the ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday. Schools are preparing for the partial reopening on voluntary basis as permitted by the government. We will take all possible measures to ensure safety and security of the students at the school premises,” he said. For practical activities such as laboratories, maximum capacity per session has to be planned with floor areas of 4 m sq available to each student, all equipment has to be disinfected, everyone must sanitise hands before and after using the equipment with sanitisers available on the work stations, the guidelines say.Anyone who develops symptoms in the school has to be isolated from other and their guardians informed. The patient will remain in a mask or face cover and the nearest medical facility will be informed, the contacts will be traced, and the premises disinfected.The schools have been asked to maintain back-up stocks of personal protective equipment such as face covers, masks, visors, and hand sanitizers. Teachers and management should have supply of alcohol wipes, 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, disposable paper towels, and pulse oximeters. The schools must ensure availability of covered dustbins.Apart from the precautions, the schools have been advised to ensure regular counselling for students and teachers reporting mental health issues such as anxiety and depression||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-releases-guidelines-as-schools-prepare-to-counsel-senior-students/story-EUupfa99ov8Wtakb5jf49I.html

When Pravesh’s father, Dharamvir, had tested positive for the infection on Monday, the doctor at the government testing centre had advised that he be admitted to a hospital at earliest because of his existing heart condition. “We went to nearby Saroj hospital, where we were told that in case his condition deteriorates, they will not be able to manage him. Their ICUs were full and they asked me to shift him to a bigger hospital,” said Pravesh. However, when he checked the ‘Delhi Corona’ app,the ICU beds at all big hospitals near his house were occupied. “As he was already on oxygen support, I decided not to take any chances and rushed him to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital in an ambulance. The only reason I travelled so far with him is because there were no beds available at hospitals near my house,” he said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Maliks were one of several hundred residents who have in the past few weeks sought hospitalisation, as the number of Covid-19 cases in the city sees a major upsurge.As of Tuesday, at least 5,400 people suffering from Covid had been admitted to various Delhi hospitals — the highest since the third week of June when the city had 6,200 hospitalised Covid patients. Even though more than 8,600 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 remained vacant in the city (on Tuesday), the ICUs in the large multi speciality private hospitals have started running full. Ashwini Sharma, a businessman from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh brought his 52-year-old uncle, who had tested positive for Covid-19 back home and was running a high temperature, to Delhi’s Max hospital in Saket on Tuesday afternoon. After almost 40 minutes of waiting, they were told that beds were not available at the hospital. “The oxygen levels of my uncle had been dropping since last night. A private hospital in Gwalior suggested that we go to Delhi for treatment. Once here, we were told that there is a waiting of 3-4 days. Now we will try Max hospital in Vaishali. However, the ambulance staff has told me that they are running out of oxygen and it would take at least an hour to reach Vaishali in Ghaziabad. I just hope we make it in time,” said a worried looking Sharma, as his uncle lay in the ambulance. A medical support staff at Max, Saket, who did not wish to be named, said over the past few days, the number of admissions had gone up. “The bed occupancy at our dedicated Covid-19 facilities is running full,” said Max hospital in a statement. Also read: Top private hospitals fast running out of ICU beds for Covid care in DelhiChetan Gupta, 32, from Haryana’s Rewari, who too had come to Max, Saket, said his father used to come for dialysis at the hospital thrice a week and last Saturday tested positive for the virus. “He is a critical care patient. We had to wait for almost 12 hours to get a bed in the hospital. We had reached the hospital at 10am on Saturday and it was only by 9pm that he finally managed to get a bed, after we made several calls. We couldn’t have taken him anywhere else, as his dialysis was being done here ,” said Gupta. At AIIMS too, the Covid screening facility had a queue of ambulances with patients being tested before admission. A medical staff at the facility said that the number of Covid patients coming in for ICU and ventilator support beds had witnessed a sharp rise in the last few weeks. “The workload has increased again with more critical care patients are pouring in. Since morning at least four cases had come that required ICU beds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-for-some-patients-wait-for-icu-bed-is-long-and-agonising/story-YsDfwOlwsSxvENi3mbTYIP.html
09-09-2020||India||5 missing Arunachal men found by PLA, says Indian Army||The Indian Army said on Tuesday that the five young men from Arunachal Pradesh who went missing from near the Indo-China border last week have been found by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The five men of the Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for the Indian Army, went missing on September 2 reportedly from Sera-7 on the Indian side of the McMohan Line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and the Tibet autonomous region (TAR) of China.  “China’s PLA has responded to the hotline message sent by Indian Army. They have confirmed that the missing young men from Arunachal Pradesh have been found. Further modalities to hand over the persons to us is being worked out,” Kiren Rijiju, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Arunachal West, tweeted on Tuesday evening. Following their disappearance, a brother of one of the men posted on social media that they were “abducted” by the PLA. The same accusation was made by Tapir Gao, the BJP MP from Arunachal East, and Ninong Ering, the Congress MLA from Pasighat . “We came to know about the suspected apprehension of the five young men on September 3. Two days later we sent a hotline message to PLA regarding the whereabouts of these men. Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, PLA sent a message, informing {that} they have been found,” said Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, an army spokesperson based in Tezpur, Assam. “The young men, who were hunting in the area,inadvertently crossed over to the other side. The PLA has informed us that they all are okay. Formalities for their early transfer are being coordinated with the Chinese side,” he added. Lt Col Pande said the PLA has not mentioned the date when the five men were found; standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed for people straying across the border would be followed before they return to the Indian side. On Monday, China’s state-affiliated Global Times tweeted quoting Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian: “China has never recognized so-called Arunachal Pradesh, which is China’s south Tibet region, and we have no details to release yet about question on Indian Army sending message to PLA about five missing Indians in the region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-missing-arunachal-men-found-by-pla-says-army/story-KZ5VwqzXL2i3l8jlvcDXGL.html
09-09-2020||India||Echoes of heroism in Rezang La||The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday fired shots in a failed attempt to intimidate and dislodge Indian soldiers holding dominating heights near a towering mountain pass in eastern Ladakh, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops put up a fierce fight against Chinese soldiers on a chilly Sunday morning during the 1962 war.The historic Battle of Rezang La, fought at heights of more than 18,000 feet, saw 124 Indian soldiers repel attack after attack by a numerically superior and better-equipped enemy in November 1962.The soldiers from the Charlie Company of the 13th battalion of the Kumaon Regiment were pitched against more than 5,000 Chinese troops, with the advancing enemy infantry being supported by heavy artillery fire. Led by the legendary Major Shaitan Singh, whose outstanding leadership and courage is the stuff of legend, the unbelievably fearless men from the C Company fought to the last bullet and inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese army.Also read: Face-off at Rechin La leads to scuffle with aggressive PLA. Situation tense but ground commanders talkingThree months after the battle, the frozen bodies of Indian soldiers were found in their trenches – the dead men still holding their weapons. The first attack launched by the enemy at the crack of dawn on November 18 was blunted with the Major ordering his men to open fire at the Chinese the moment they came within their rifle range, according to a book published by the Ranikhet-based Kumaon Regimental Centre.“Many of the enemies fell, others continued to advance. But with every weapon of C Company firing, the gullies in front of the 8 Platoon were soon full of dead and wounded Chinese,” says the book The Images of Valour and Triumph, published in 2005.After their first attack failed due to stiff Indian resistance, the Chinese resorted to heavy artillery bombardment of the positions held by Major Singh and his men. The Indian soldiers had the odds stacked against them, but the fierce assault failed to crush their fighting spirit and determination to defend their positions till their last breath.The heavy shelling helped the Chinese troops launch multiple assaults and the C Company soon found itself surrounded by the enemy. The book says Major Singh reorganised the positions held by his soldiers and re-sited the automatic weapons to take on the Chinese troops, a move that resulted in the enemy suffering more casualties.The heroic officer was killed in action in this phase of the battle that resulted in 114 Indian deaths in a few hours of fighting.A chapter on the Battle of Rezang La in the book says, “The dead men were found in their trenches, frozen stiff, still holding their weapons. Broken light machine gun bipods, and some men holding only the butts of their rifles while the remaining weapon had blown off, bore witness to the enemy fire.” Their mortal remains were found three months later.Different estimates peg the number of Chinese killed in the battle at between 500 and 1,300.Major Singh was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra – the country’s highest wartime gallantry award – for the exceptional courage and leadership demonstrated by him in the battle.General VP Malik, former chief of army staff who was inducted in the Ladakh sector in October 1962 as Captain with 3 Sikh Li, said: “We were directly in the Chushul battlefront, but were preparing defences in the rear on Dungti-Chuma Tang axis. The tactical significance of Rezang La lies in the dominating heights, Gurung Hill and Magar Hill, which have now been occupied by us. During the war, we did hear about Major Shaitan Singh’s heroic action, but it was much later that I visited the place where he had fallen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/echoes-of-heroism-in-rezang-la/story-AGmbeQP72RBpvHP7miRb8H.html
09-09-2020||India||Chanda Kochhar and husband Deepak worked in tandem, says ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged that former ICICI Bank managing director Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar, who was arrested on Monday night in connection with a money laundering probe, worked in tandem in a conspiracy to extend a loan to Videocon Group and then used an “elaborate structure/web of entities” for layering a bribe of Rs 64 crore. Deepak Kochhar, according to the ED, not only actively engaged in laundering proceeds of crime and projecting it as “untainted,” but continued to have access to the laundered money. Interestingly, after Deepak Kochhar was arrested around 8.06 pm in ED’s Mumbai office, the agency informed Chanda Kochhar on telephone that her husband had been arrested. In its remand document submitted in a Mumbai Prevention of Money Laundering Act Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday while seeking 14 days’ custody, the ED said that Deepak Kochhar’s arrest was “qualitatively more elicitation oriented” and absolutely necessary since he has been totally non-cooperative and needs to be taken to Delhi to be confronted with voluminous evidence so that the agency can decipher the complete money trail.The ED added that various persons examined by it in the case are linked to various “sham transactions” and several documents have been recovered showing details of other companies controlled by Deepak Kochhar. Also read: ED probes over 24 transactions in Deepak Kochhar’s accounts. It includes one by his wifeDeepak Kochhar.was sent to ED’s custody until September 19. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, argued that the arrest was illegal.  “This arrest and remand will not stand scrutiny in higher courts,”Aggarwal told HT, adding that his client joined the investigation and submitted 10,000 pages of documents in two years, and was arrested in a case punishable with seven years’ imprisonment “which is illegal” . According to the amended Criminal Procedure Code, an accused may not be arrested for offences in which the maximum punishment is seven years. At the heart of the case are allegations of loans for favours and conflict of interest. According to the ED investigation, details of which were accessed by HT, ICICI Bank extended a loan of Rs.300 crore to (Rs 283.45 crore was the actual disbursed amount) to Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) on September 7, 2009, following which Rs 64 crore was transferred to Deepak Kochhar’s company NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL) through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd, the very next day. NRL was started by Videocon’s Venugopal Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar together; Dhoot later transferred control of it to Kochhar. ED has prepared a detailed flowchart on how money moved from Videocon’s various companies and bank accounts to finally reach NRL, a company controlled, owned and managed by Deepak Kochhar from 2012. “Chanda Kochhar was part of decision making process and chairperson/member of the recommending/sanctioning committees for other loans sanctioned to Videocon Group by ICICI Bank,” it added. SEPL, ED said, was acquired by Pinnacle Energy (a family trust of Deepak Kochhar). “…an elaborate structure/web of entities was created to ostensibly hold this amount of Rs 64 crore. Loan funds travelled from VIL to NRL through SEPL, but two intermediaries were brought in for purpose of layering,” it added. The money was used by Deepak Kochhar for purchase of properties (wind farm projects of 33.15 MW capacity), the agency added. The agency has claimed that Deepak Kochhar was given multiple opportunities to rebut the allegations against himself but his stand has been contrary to the records of the case. “He also wilfully withheld information which was in his exclusive knowledge.” ED has also identified an overseas transaction in Deepak Kochhar’s company. Officials hinted that Venugopal Dhoot and Chanda Kochhar may also soon be called for questioning on the basis of Deepak Kochhar’s custodial interrogation.Calls made to Chanda Kochhar’s mobile number failed to connect and WhatsApp messages did not elicit a response. In January 2019, Chanda Kochhar was sacked as chief executive of ICICI Bank, a post to which she was appointed in 2009, with retrospective effect after a panel indicted her on several counts. The ICICI Bank board terminated her services following a meeting where it discussed the report that found the former banker to have breached the bank’s code of conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chanda-kochhar-and-husband-worked-in-tandem-says-ed/story-6jqDntpWUf3qijMMotzgZI.html
09-09-2020||India||We are in the process of rebuilding Andhra: CM Jaganmohan Reddy||Andhra Pradesh chief minister (CM) YS Jaganmohan Reddy is upfront in his criticism of the Telugu Desam Party’s (TDP) N. Chandrababu Naidu but is cautious while talking about the Congress or explaining his supportive, issue-based approach to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In an interview to Vinod Sharma, he explained that his vision of three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh was informed by the residuary state’s past two bifurcations (in which it lost Chennai and Hyderabad) and predicated on decentralisation of development. How prepared are you in Andhra to contain the spread of Covid-19? The infection has gravely spiked in recent weeks amid reports of the health infrastructure seeming to crumble under pressure. The decision of your deputy CM Amjad Ali and other legislators to seek treatment in private facilities is an expression of no confidence in the state’s health infrastructure. We are fully prepared to contain the spread of Covid-19. From being a state with not even a single lab to test for the virus, Andhra Pradesh has, since March 2020 (when the sample of the first case was sent to Bengaluru) has acquired the capacity to test more than 60,000 samples a day. We are pursuing a trace-test-isolate and treat policy. All district health teams supported by line departments are fully involved in cluster containment under the direct supervision and monitoring of district collectors. A look at the spread of infection in Andhra indicates that the cases started spreading after unlocking started. The recent spike in cases is expected as lakhs of migrant workers have returned to the state. Our health infrastructure is fully prepared to handle any surge with 4,214 ICU [intensive care unit] beds with oxygen, 17,232 non-ICU Beds with oxygen, 17,161 general beds and 1,620 ventilators. In terms of human resources also, we are fully geared up. In addition to the existing health care workers in the system, 2,926-general duty medical officers, 1,598-specialists, 1,461 anesthesiologists and other technicians, 4,487 staff nurses, 11,200 trainee nurses, 4,109-nursing orderlies, 4,394- sanitation workers and 712 data entry operators have been recruited by the district collectors. Above that, 9,712 health professionals are being recruited on regular basis at the state level. That includes 2,000 medical officers, 4,600 staff nurses and other paramedics. The health infrastructure with this kind of manpower and a fully committed administration will be handling any surge without any pressure on the system. You’ve said the people have to learn to live with Covid-19. By official counts, Covid cases are rising in thousands every day. What’s your strategy to contain the pandemic?  It is now an accepted fact that the people have to live along with the virus in the manner we are living with other diseases. To contain its spread, we have to follow Covid-appropriate behavior. We are aggressively tracing and testing (60,000 samples a day) people in containment clusters. We are leveraging on the availability of two lakh volunteers under the newly established 13,000 village and ward secretariats. Each volunteer is allotted 50 households approximately with the mandate to closely monitor their health status. In the last five months, these volunteers, supported by 43,000 ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and 23,000 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) have visited 1.4 crore households five times during the fever survey and identified persons with Covid-like symptoms and started testing them. Testing is happening in cluster/containment zones. All primary and secondary contacts of positive person are being tested. Our strategy of aggressive testing has taken cue from international learning and WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines. We have put in place a RCCE (Risk Communication and Community Engagement) strategy with the support of UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund), to reach training and awareness on Covid-appropriate behaviour to 1.06 crore households. A month-long mask campaign has also been initiated for 95% mask utilization in urban and rural areas. With such a robust system in place, we are very confident of controlling and containing Covid-19. The curve will hopefully be flattened very soon. Going by your government’s statements, the YSR Cheyutha scheme is said to be a game-changer for rural Andhra, aim as it does to benefit women belonging to the SC (scheduled caste), ST (scheduled tribe), BC (backward class) and minority communities. But there is criticism that it’s not reaching the targeted beneficiaries across caste and religion. The idea behind YSR Cheyutha is to help women take up self-employment ventures. Nearly 80% of women between 45- 60 age group are being covered. To make the effort successful, the government is trying for backward and forward linkages to these units with corporate companies like Amul and ITC. The scheme will cover all religions. The scheme is not meant for any particular religion. Your bid to help the poor through direct benefit transfers is laudable. The flip side is that the outreach will consolidate your vote bank, not the state’s economy that’s in the red.  All states, including the central government, have been implementing several schemes, few are through DBT (direct benefit transfer) and others vide traditional methods. The reform that we brought is to ensure that the DBT system is foolproof, that there are no leakages and benefits reaches the genuine beneficiary directly, completely, in time and without corruption. New schemes such as Amma Vodi and Rythu Bandhu are investments in social sector. What the state’s responsibility? Maintaining law and order besides focusing on education, health and agriculture. Any investment in these sectors cannot be simple welfare measures. These, in fact, are social capital building investments. If we can provide free education to all depending on their requirement without compromising on quality--- that is the best any state can do towards its people. It is a misconception that only private institutions provide quality education. The IITs {Indian Institujtes of Technology}, IIMs {Indian Institutes of Management}, IISc {Indian Institute of Science} and several other top educational institutions are in public sector. My government’s focus is to bring back primacy to education in government sector and schemes like Amma Vodi (for financial assistance to mothers to educate their children) are a step in that direction. Providing school books, improving the quality of mid-day meal, strengthening staff and physical infrastructure are aimed at providing quality education. Investments in such schemes cannot be looked at as a burden on the exchequer. Same is the case with the health sector. Andhra’s per capita expenditure in the health sector is more than any other state because of schemes like Arogyasri, which has been revamped in terms of coverage and reach. Improving support systems like ambulances and providing some financial relief to the poor after they are discharged from hospitals is something which any government should do. Expenditure on health cannot be considered as a drain on the state’s finances. To provide good quality and free health services is the fundamental responsibility of the state. Most of our welfare schemes revolve around education, health and agriculture. The services we extend to farmers are limited because we will never be able to do as much as they need. That’s one sector which had always been neglected. A portion of the money is spent on irrigation and the rest on investment subsidy to the farmer. Direct or indirect investments in the primary sectors ultimately come back to the state’s economy in one form or the other. My father, late YS Rajasekhara Reddy, studied the ground realities when he came to power in the undivided Andhra in 2004. In 1997, more than 7,000 farmers had committed suicide in the state. Instead of going to the root cause of the problem, the then TDP dispensation brushed the issue under the carpet by passing the buck on to spurious seeds, pesticides and other trivial issues. YSR understood the problem and realized that most of the farmers committed suicide because of debt. They incurred debt for three reasons: children’s education, health issues and for sinking bore wells in the absence of surface water. That’s what brought about the fee reimbursement scheme, Arogyasri; irrigation projects and free power supply to the agriculture sector. These schemes addressed the problem and yielded the desired results. I am carrying forward these schemes with some improvisation besides expanding the base. While continuing fee reimbursement, we are focusing on schools, where the infrastructure is being revamped and the curriculum redesigned to meet high standards of education. In the irrigation sector, we are extending input subsidy to save the farmer from a debt trap. We are doing that while not ignoring infrastructure creation: irrigation projects like Polavaram are going on; three sea ports are coming up; huge investments are being made in the power sector. Some roads and buildings projects are being lined up with the aid of the World Bank. It is not the large number of welfare schemes which are causing the so-called financial stress. As CM, I inherited pending bills of Rs 40,000 crore in the power sector alone from the previous government. No one was aware of it. This is equal to the money my government spent in a year on all welfare schemes. The state had a debt burden of Rs 1.17 lakh crore when Andhra Pradesh was divided in 2014 and by 2019 it went up to Rs 3 lakh crore. Repayment stress is there. Pending bills were huge. Then to our misfortune, the economy started doing badly and then came the Covid pandemic. Where was the need for separate village secretariats and village volunteer system? Is the administration unable to reach the people properly at the grass-root level? The village secretariat and village volunteer system is to provide a delivery mechanism at gross root level; or in panchayat raj parlance (designating) “functionaries” in the villages itself to ensure that schemes are delivered without pilferage. After the introduction of the village secretariat system, pilferage has come to a nought in DBT schemes and welfare measures. There were some functionaries earlier in the panchayat raj system, the people didn’t know who they were and where they sat. Now, they are in the midst of the beneficiaries. For want of employment, many governments have been trying to give unemployment dole. Instead of a dole, why not we use the youth in a purposeful and service oriented manner--- and pay them Rs 5,000 as an honorarium instead of Rs 2,000 dole. That makes them better and more responsible human beings. In Andhra, they are playing a crucial role in the implementation of welfare schemes. They’ve played a crucial role during natural calamities and against the Covid pandemic. People have positively received the experiment and appreciated the village volunteers for their efforts. When 60% of the population lives in villages, common sense tells us that 60% of the government employees should be available in villages. In reality, till this government came to power, not even 6% of the government employees were in villages. Most of them were in urban centres. That’s what we have reversed. The Centre has lagged behind in paying GST compensation to states. If the stalemate lingers, would you be open to borrowing from the market? What’ll be its impact on Andhra’s exchequer?  It is OK. They are taking time and so far paying a little late. It is not that they have drastically cut down. They have been passing on (the money) with some delays. This is understandable keeping in view the Covid situation and its impact on the country’s economy. The only way to overcome the crisis is borrowing. The Centre has also asked the states to go for additional borrowings. As we cannot tax people more, we are working on possible additional revenue generating options. In the context of the New Education Policy, how do you move forward with your promise of English medium in schools?  The problem is till Class V. The new education policy says post Class V there is no compulsion to have mother tongue as the medium of instruction. In other words, we can implement English medium in schools from Class VI the way we have designed and planned. Up to Class V, primacy has to be given to the mother tongue. While conforming to the national policy, we can start giving more and more inputs on English up to Class V so that the students are equipped to switch over to English medium from Class VI. We feel the Centre has done an excellent job in bringing equity in the new education policy. We decided to introduce English medium not because we love English and want to neglect our mother tongue. It is because we wanted to bring in equity. Those who can afford are sending their kids to English medium schools while the children of poor people are being forced to study in regional languages as they cannot afford English medium schools. Students with private school background are taking away major chunk of the jobs in public and private sectors, leaving behind those who are educated in mother tongue in government schools. The idea of English medium education is to create an equal platform. If private schools across the country introduce mother tongue as the medium of instruction till Class V in conformation with the new education policy, then there is no issue at all. After the creation of Telangana, your predecessor Chandrababu Naidu unsuccessfully sought a special category status from the Centre for Andhra. He wanted to build in the state a revenue-earning city comparable to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. Not much has been heard of that since you became the CM. We cannot give up the demand for special category status( SCS). An agro-based state like Andhra can take off industrially only if some quality industrial incentives are given. That would be the biggest incentive as revenue deficit is being taken care of anyhow. Both the previous finance commission and present finance commission have addressed the revenue deficit issue. The so-called financial package is not going to help address the fundamental issue of industrial incentives which the hill states are extended with. We continue to harp on SCS as we cannot afford to give it up. Coming to the second part of your question on revenue-earning city, I call it a perverted thinking. Nowhere in the world has it been proved. Major cities grow over decades and centuries. Investing Rs 1 lakh crore to build a mega metro is not viable. Forget about additional revenue, you cannot even repay the debt which you have spent on infrastructure. What is the contribution of major cities of the US to its economy? Take for example a place called Omaha. With 4 lakh population, it headquarters 23 of the fortune 500 companies of the world. That is where Warren Buffet stays. Bill Gates operates from Seattle. Revenue gets generated through manufacturing and a proper service sector. Why should industry be located in urban areas? For instance, Visakhapatnam is not our capital. When it was a small town, a steel plant and a few other industries were set up there a few decades ago. Now, it is emerging as a major city. In a similar way, we can have growth centres where industries can be promoted. The Covid experience tells us that most of the cities ultimately become sick. There is a gradual shift from the so-called major cities or metros to medium and small towns. Look at the top 10 developed countries. None of them have a metro and mega city. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Finland…all these developed countries have no mega cities. Development is not industrialisation or urbanisation. Development means many things like per capita income and happiness index. Instead of pouring in the entire money in building a congested and not-required urban place, spend that money in connecting various places and ensuring faster mobility and cost-effectiveness. It is a wrong perception that cities generate more money. Barring a couple of exceptions, greenfield capital cities did not succeed anywhere in the world. The success of one such city was built on oil money, which was abundantly available in that nation. Infrastructure was created as financial resources were available in plenty. They did not look at it from the economic angle. Do we have that many resources to build the so-called Amaravati? The Boston Consultancy Group analysed it from economic perspective and said its investments are not viable That brings one to your plans to have separate capitals for the three arms of the state: the executive, the judiciary and the legislature. The matter is sub-judice. But you certainly can share the administrative vision behind the move. The three capitals is a layman’s perception. (In effect) the capital city’s functions are being distributed: executive functions from Visakhapatnam; legislative functions from Amaravati and judicial functions from Kurnool. These are the exact words used by Sivaramakrishnan Committee. The capital’s functions can be distributed among different places. Why all these functions should be delivered from a particular place? The residuary state of Andhra Pradesh suffered twice in the past on account of Chennai and Hyderabad. That is what history tells us. If you lay all your eggs in one basket, you are going to suffer. Then why you want to continue with the same approach without taking into account the past experiences? It is not logical and rational thinking. The insider trading approach in Madhapur of Hyderabad in late 90s is tried again by the previous regime in Amaravati. If the secretariat and assembly or high court do not mean development, then why bother… do not talk about them. The document prepared by the previous regime says that you need Rs 1 lakh crore. Instead of planning to build a so-called city at a place which is not suitable for construction of any mega structures in 33,000 acres land acquired or pooled from farmers, he could have planned something in 500 acres elsewhere. Why does he need 33,000 acres when a mere 500 acre land is sufficient as per the Sivaramakrishnan report? The special investigating team is probing land deals, unearthing benamis of my predecessor and his cronies. People with vested interests purchased lands from poor farmers. Then came the announcement of the capital and subsequent scam. Those who purchased lands at throwaway prices benefited to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. It was just a real estate business by the previous regime to benefit a certain section of people. Once the development is diversified and spread across the state, they become centres of growth in near future. How many major cities does Kerala have? None! And yet, Kerala is ahead of other states in several parameters. Development has to be distributed across the state. Visakhapatnam, Anantapuram, Kurnool and Tirupati and a few other cities can become clusters of development. Ports are being developed. Central Andhra, which is an agriculture hub, can have some agrologistic parks and all can prosper.  What’ll you say to the criticism that you want to downgrade Amaravati to slight Naidu? The charge sticks also because the TDP leader hasn’t been too kind to your administration whom he accuses of spying on the Opposition. This is absurd. Why should we bother about Amaravati? We believe in the overall development of the state. We did not leave Amaravati. The legislature will continue to work from Amaravati. When experts say it is a wrong approach, why don’t you respect their opinion? In India, the concept of referendum isn’t in use. The other option available for taking a decision is the experts’ opinion. Had there been a referendum option available, we would have definitely gone for it. We are confident the people would have given a thumbs up for our decentralised development. Except those 29 villages and 10,000 farmers opposing decentralisation for obvious reasons, the entire state would have stood behind us if a referendum were to be conducted. Since, there is no scope for this, we respected the committee appointed by the central government (and) we appointed our own expert committee. They too have given their opinion. We took the opinion of BCG. Based on the feedback from such quarters, the state’s political executive took a conscious decision that a decentralised model is far better than a centralised model. Mega cities are unwanted, they only drain resources and become a burden on the people. The government’s role is to provide services at optimum cost. We are for decentralised development; we are going for multi-speciality hospitals and medical colleges in all districts (new districts are going to be carved from the existing 13 districts). The spying allegation (by Naidu) is absurd. The DGP{director general of police} asked the opposition to produce evidence which they could not. In fact, when we were in the opposition, phones of our senior leaders were tapped and we had provided official proof to that effect. Your father YS Rajasekhara Reddy was also a political opponent of Naidu. But he’d often say that they started in politics at the same time, in the same party and were friends on that count. Isn’t there a need for rival parties and leaders to work together when the pandemic is posing serious challenges to public health and the economy? They are stuck with the single idea that they should protect their investments in Amaravathi. They have no other agenda. In the last 15 months, he’s only talking about Amaravati and nothing else. Amaravati is not worth discussing. We have said time and again that we are for decentralised development. There’s no way we can consider one single place for development just because you and your colleagues purchased land there. What cooperation you are referring to? After March, he (Naidu) has not set foot in Andhra while the state is battling the pandemic. How are you viewing the recent demands for an overhaul of the Congress, your erstwhile party? Can it stay intact without a Gandhi family member at the helm? Ours is a regional party and is very strong in Andhra. We do not have the numbers to influence national politics despite being the fourth largest party in the Lok Sabha. Our role is confined to the development of the state which was pushed into a disadvantageous position after the bifurcation. We are in the process of rebuilding the state. National aspirations are not of a priority to us. How’d you describe your equation with the BJP whom your party has often supported in the Parliament? Are you a proximate ally or an issue-based supporter? We place the interests of our state ahead of other (matters) and navigate in that direction in dealing with every issue. We believe that the special category status for Andhra will be a reality, if not now, then in the near future. We are optimistic on that count. Our support will be issue-based and will dovetail the betterment of our state in every aspect. We are in the process of rebuilding the state after its reorganisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-in-the-process-of-rebuilding-andhra-cm-jaganmohan-reddy/story-1oXeAQGWLvSwzvKLIzJeOL.html
09-09-2020||India||Fresh Pangong lake face-off complicates Jaishankar-Wang’s face-to-face meet||A fresh face-off between Indian and Chinese troops has added to the complexities of the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries that is being seen as crucial for a breakthrough in the impasse on the disputed border. Hours before external affairs minister S Jaishankar departed for Moscow, where he is set to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, Chinese troops attempted to close in on an Indian position along the LAC on Monday night and fired in the air when they were dissuaded.The face-off, experts said, underlined the fragile situation along the LAC, especially after several incidents on the south bank of Pangong Lake during August 29-30. This is the first time that shots have been fired along the undemarcated border since 1975, when four Indian troopers were killed in a Chinese ambush in the Arunachal Pradesh sector.Jaishankar is set to meet Wang on the sidelines of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting on September 10 – the first time the two leaders will come face-to-face since the border standoff began in May. They spoke on phone on June 17, two days after a deadly clash in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties.Participating in an online interaction on Monday night to mark the release of his book The India Way, Jaishankar pointed to the serious situation on the LAC and underscored the need for “very deep conversations between the two sides at a political level”. He also made it clear India wouldn’t delink the border standoff from the overall bilateral relationship.Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Monday’s face-off illustrated the urgency of reducing friction between troops of the two sides. “I don’t think either India or China have an incentive to go to war over the border dispute, but the increasing intensity and persistence of friction, along with air activity and the presence of loaded firearms may cause them to ‘stumble’ into war,” he said. “An advertent or inadvertent incident at a local flashpoint could now really fuel a broader conflict that neither government wants, as the forces continue to come into contact with each other,” Narang added.At least half a dozen meetings held by local brigade commanders from the two sides since the incidents of August 29-30 have failed to quell tensions on the south bank of Pangong Lake, which has emerged as the latest friction point. Several meetings of the corps commanders and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs too have failed to take forward the stalled disengagement and de-escalation process.The negotiations have been stuck on several key issues, including the mode for determining how troops should pull back at friction points, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Chinese officials have been insisting that troops from both sides should withdraw for an equal distance, while the Indian side has said the withdrawal should be determined according to time it takes troops on each side to deploy to the LAC, the people said.“For instance, in some stretches, a kilometre can be covered by troops on one side in 10 minutes, whereas a kilometre on the other side can be covered by troops in five minutes. Both sides should withdraw to a distance where it takes equal time to deploy to the border,” said one of the persons cited above.Experts said the upcoming meeting between Jaishankar and Wang assumes significance following the lack of a breakthrough in recent talks between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, who too met on the margins of a SCO meeting in Moscow on September 4.Wei contended the responsibility for the tensions lies entirely with India, while Singh said the actions of Chinese troops, including their aggressive behaviour and attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo, violated several bilateral agreements.Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the latest face-off should be seen as “part of Chinese mindgames before the meeting of the foreign ministers to build pressure on the Indian side to get it to make concessions”. “The Chinese are very conscious of how the Indian government is projecting the link between border tensions and the overall relationship. At the same time, the Indian side has emphasised negotiations and dialogue for an amicable settlement. No one may expect a miracle at the dialogue in Moscow but everyone is looking at it with some hope,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-fresh-row-on-lac-india-china-foreign-ministers-set-to-meet-in-russia/story-wK24w9zhnclYtQaSVO5doL.html
09-09-2020||Editorials||When politics dictates law | HT Editorial||On Tuesday, the Sushant Singh Rajput case took a new turn with the arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty in a drug-related case. This newspaper has been critical of the electronic media’s coverage of Rajput’s suicide — and the nature of the sensationalist conspiracy theories that have come to dominate a case which should have triggered a discussion on mental health. But it is not just the media which is in the dock; the problem is with India’s law enforcement apparatus and police agencies. Irrespective of the merits of the investigation underway, what is increasingly apparent is that all central and state agencies appear to be operating under political directions, for this case is now clearly linked to politics. On one hand are those who believe that Ms Chakraborty is responsible for Rajput’s tragic death. This view seems to have the support, if not the concurrence, of leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — and the social media campaign against her has the sanction of supporters of the party. It is, therefore, not a coincidence that it is central agencies which are at the forefront of implicating Ms Chakraborty in a range of cases. On the other are those who believe that Rajput’s death is being used to target the Mumbai film industry and its leading figures, and there is an attempt to muddy a normal police investigation in the matter. It is not a coincidence that the Maharashtra state administration in general is applying the law against those who it sees as critics.The issue here is not who is right or wrong. The issue is the complete politicisation of India’s premier security agencies, which seem to act not on the basis of evidence but primarily on political directions. India’s governance structure, of course, has a framework where the state police in the case of states, and other investigative agencies in the case of the Centre, operate under executive control. Political oversight is important. At the same time, there is a desperate need for autonomy — for as repeated attempts at police reforms have shown, it is when investigative agencies are free of political pressure that they can work fairly. There cannot be any rule of law if those meant to protect and uphold the law cannot do their jobs independently. The Sushant case is yet again proof that India needs to find ways to insulate its legal machinery from political masters. Otherwise, driven by an irresponsible media and partisan political considerations, individual liberty will be at peril.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-politics-dictates-law-ht-editorial/story-gSmju3ns0uwSgRRXI3L3NL.html
09-09-2020||Editorials||Why Iran matters for regional security||India’s external affairs and defence ministers recently dropped by Iran and talked to their counterparts, the first such talks since the pandemic began. Afghanistan, rather than oil supplies, tops the agenda, reflecting the new contours of the bilateral relationship. New Delhi and Tehran have reason to worry about the slow-but-steady withdrawal of United States (US) troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban resurgence that will follow. While Iran has its own problems with the US, and won’t be unhappy that the US troop presence along its northern border is winding down, it has reason to be concerned at the prospect of the present Kabul regime weakening. Tehran is known to have engaged with some Taliban leaders, but remains suspicious of its more hardcore factions, which are often intertwined with the Islamic State Khorasan Province and both are deeply anti-Shia. New Delhi’s views converge as these same Taliban factions are also the closest to Rawalpindi. At a time when Iran’s economy is stressed by sanctions and low oil prices, and its military stretched by deployments in Iraq and Syria, an unstable Afghanistan would not be welcome. The two countries need to coordinate their support for the Kabul regime. The partly India-funded freight corridor from Chabahar to Herat is the most tangible symbol of Afghan-related cooperation. The next few years will require such cooperation to expand into other spheres. As India’s energy ambitions revolve around weaning itself off oil and gas usage, there will be less traction to be gained in the energy sphere. But there will be more work to be done in the realm of regional security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-iran-matters-for-regional-security/story-489wM1cQmB2RAJ7UL95taN.html
09-09-2020||Editorials||The breakdown with China | HT Editorial||On Monday night, India repelled — yet again — a possible attempt by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to intrude into Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This comes a week after India successfully resisted such attempts, and held on to strategic positions on the southern banks of the Pangong Tso. The escalation in tensions in eastern Ladakh is not surprising. With both armies, mobilised in large numbers and staring at each other in close proximity, it is but natural that skirmishes will happen — especially when one army, PLA, wants to change the facts on the ground and force India to accept a new reality. It is also natural because over the past fortnight, there has been a sharp uptick in rhetoric on both sides. All of this indicates that the India-China relationship has broken down at two levels. The first is with regard to the border management framework that has been in place for close to three decades. It is clear that China no longer sees the advantage of maintaining peace and tranquility on the border — and is keen to maintain this peace only on its terms, after wresting territory over which it has no legitimate claim. This is unacceptable to India, and rightly so. The second is with regard to the broader framework of the relationship. For years, India has convinced itself that the dynamic with China has both a cooperative and competitive element — and while this was true, it is also now clear that the competitive dynamic is on the ascendant, and is becoming sharply adversarial. With external affairs minister S Jaishankar scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Moscow on Thursday, it is this breakdown that must be the focus of the discussion. Is it the case that China has decided that it is comfortable with a hot LAC, and an outright adversarial relationship with India? If that is so — and the conversation will give the Indian establishment a sense of Beijing’s mood — India has no choice but to prepare itself in the military, economic, diplomatic domains and respond accordingly. Or is it the case that China has read Indian motivations wrong, that apprehensions can be allayed, and Beijing can be persuaded to disengage and de-escalate? If that is so, it will help tackle the immediate crisis — even though the long- term orientation of the relationship will still be troubled. India must hope for accommodation, even as it prepares for confrontation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-breakdown-with-china/story-NGgsJbepBc7feny4oHAydL.html
