"...the Commission has noted with anguish that many political parties/candidates are still not adhering to the prescribed safety norms during the public gatherings and this is making it difficult for the State/District election machineries to enforce the aforesaid directions fully;...," the ECI noted in its order.Almost a week ago, on April 16, the ECI had issued new orders increasing the silence period for campaigning in the state to 72 hours from the 48 hours existing then. The commission also prohibited any campaigning between 7pm and 10am on all campaign days due to increasing Covid-19 cases."In view of unprecedented public health situation and the imperative of ongoing elections, the commission today (Friday) extended the silence period up to 72 hours (instead of 48 hours) and restricted the period of campaign up to 7pm (instead of 10pm). These orders have come into effect immediately," the commission's April 16 order said.Further, it also directed the organisers of rallies and campaigns to provide facemasks and hand sanitisers to the attendees of such rallies and also asked them to ensure the proper usage of these measures.Watch | Vaccine pricing row: Mamata Banerjee & Sonia Gandhi lash out at PM ModiAmidst the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country, campaigning for the assembly elections became a key point of contention between the political parties in the fray.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is currently under isolation after testing positive on April 20, announced on April 18 that he is suspending all his political rallies in the state following the rise in number of cases.
