Sultan Singh, chief geospatial officer and head of the GIS division for GMDA, said that the application will be used to monitor the growth of trees in green belts and is being trialled at present. “We are testing the application and should be able to launch soon. Due to rising Covid-19 cases, all resources are being used for monitoring that, but the application for monitoring the growth of trees is ready. With this application, citizens can also upload details (related to growth or health) of any particular tree. The system will have details like name, species, the diameter of the trunk, photograph,” said Singh. He added that after all the details have been added to the database, an intervention to improve the green belts in the city will be done on a bi-yearly basis.

18-04-2021||Gurugram||Property dealer held for frauds amounting to over ₹1 crore||The police on Friday night arrested a 41-year-old property from Sector 40 for allegedly duping over two dozen people of at least ₹1 crore on the pretext of selling them plots and apartments in prime locations.The suspect, identified as Naveen Chandela of Paudi Garhwal in Uttarakhand, fled the city last year and moved to Bengaluru in Karnataka but returned to Gurugram for some work, the police said. He was arrested by the crime investigation unit of Sector 40.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the suspect posed as a developer and used an entourage of 14 others for the frauds, in which he made around ₹1.2 crore. “Chandela showed flats across the city to potential buyers and disappeared after taking the booking amount,” he said.Sangwan said they recovered two gold chains, three gold biscuits, two gold bangles and a Haryana developer’s licence from his possession. “We have taken him on seven-day police remand and will be questioning him to ascertain if he was involved in more frauds in Bengaluru and other cities,” he said.Sangwan said they came to know of the frauds after a contractor of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), who was duped, approached the police. Mithelesh Kumar, who works as an HSVP contractor, told the police that he met Chandela, who identified himself as the managing director of AHI Housing, through a friend in February 2020.The police said that when Kumar expressed an interest in investing in properties, Chandela showed him a few flats in sectors 48, 49 and 72, following which Kumar made an advance payment of ₹16.8 lakh for three flats in March 2020.Kumar, in his complaint to the police, said that initially, Chandela kept delaying the process, attributing it to the Covid-19 pandemic. “He started ignoring my calls and later switched off his mobile phone. When I visited his office on Sohna Road, I found it closed,” he said.The police said that Kumar realised he was duped after learning about similar instances during enquiries at nearby offices. A case was registered under sections 406 (fraud), 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 50 police station on March 30. Nearly two dozen people were duped in a similar manner, the police said.Sangwan said that many fraudsters were found to have a realtor’s licence in the past as well. “There have been multiple cases where suspects applied and availed of the licence to show their authenticity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/property-dealer-held-for-frauds-amounting-to-over-1-crore-101618769969543.html
18-04-2021||Gurugram||2,401 new Covid-19 cases take total tally past 80K||The total count of Covid-19 cases in the district crossed 80,000 on Sunday, with 2,401 new infections reported on the day, according to the health department data. Officials said that the positivity case spiked to 14% on the day, surging from around 10% reported over the last week, which is a cause for concern as it indicates a spread of the virus.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that they have ramped up testing and vaccine outreach has also been expanded. While 3,000 tests were conducted on average in the first two weeks of March, the department collected 11,278 samples on Sunday. “We have issued directions to private hospitals to admit only those patients who are serious and require hospitalisation. Also, they must upload the latest data on the availability of beds. Government teams also conducted surprise inspections at private hospitals to check the status of beds to ensure easy access to patients,” said Yadav. Due to the continuous surge in cases, the district administration directed officials of government departments to hold meeting through videoconference, instead of physical ones, and residents to fix appointments through the Saral video application to discuss their issues with officials concerned.The 2,401 new infections took the total number of cases to 81,725. As per the details shared by the health department, two Covid-related deaths were also reported on the day, taking the total number of deaths due to the virus to 378. The fatality rate in the city stands at 0.4%. On Saturday, Gurugram recorded 2,549 cases, the highest single-day spike reported in the city since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Health officials said that one of the reasons for the high number of daily cases is that the latest Covid strain is infectious. On Sunday, the health department noted that 894 patients also recovered on the day, taking the total recoveries to 69,151. However, due to the rising number of cases, the rate of recovery has gone down from 90-99% and stands at 84% at present. The health department on Sunday also vaccinated 3,172 eligible beneficiaries at 60 session sites, including private and public hospitals. Till date, the department has vaccinated 310,000 people in the city. Dr Yadav said that while they working hard to expand vaccination among the eligible population, the low level of vaccination at private hospitals has remained a matter of concern. “To resolve this issue, the health department will ramp up vaccination outreach at sub-centres and also maximise the use of vaccine vans to hasten this effort,” said Yadav. Earlier in the day, the Gurugram district administration issued an order asking government employees and the general public to hold meetings through videoconferencing in view of the rising Covid-19.cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/2401-new-covid-19-cases-take-total-tally-past-80k-101618769970311.html
18-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents fall ill, water contamination suspected||Members of at least 100 households of The View, a residential society in Sector 37 D’s Ramprastha City, fell ill over the last three days, citing contamination of drinking water.Residents said that the problems started surfacing on Friday, as members of a few families reported nausea and diarrhoea, and the situation worsened on Saturday as more residents reported health illnesses.Neeraj Chauhan, a resident of the condominium said that initially, residents thought that this problem was caused due to change of weather, but when over half of the residents fell ill, the alarm bells started ringing. “My children, wife and I suffered these symptoms and had to take leave from office. Most of the residents are suffering due to contamination of water inside the colony,” said Chauhan. Residents said that the instances of vomiting and other illnesses reduced on Sunday after the water was drained from the tank and fresh water filled in them. “We strongly suspect that water supplied in the last three days was contaminated and the samples must be tested. Such an incident should not get repeated,” said Chauhan. Officials of the maintenance agency of the condominium said that water was supplied by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), but that other societies in the area did not report any such issue.“We have got the tanks cleaned and checked the entire supply system but have not found any leakage which could have cause contamination. On Monday, these tanks will be cleaned again and the treated water supplied to flushing systems will also.be drained. For the next few days we will use only freshwater, to find out the problem,” said Sanjay Chaudhary, general manager of Aero Inframart Pvt Ltd, the maintenance agency. Officials of the GMDA ruled out any problem at their end. Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer of infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “It is an internal matter of the society, our supply is completely fine and disinfected. They have a sewage treatment plant installed inside the compound, from where water has been supplied for flushing and other purposes using dual pipe system. We do not know whether the society does regular maintenance or not, but our water supply is as per standards.”Members of the residents’ welfare association said that they strongly suspect that there was contamination of water either due to leakage in the pipelines. “The water in the tanks had too much chlorine and this is beyond the amount that is used by the supplying agency. We have asked the maintenance agency to get water samples tested,” said a senior member of the RWA, wishing anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-fall-ill-water-contamination-suspected-101618769968843.html
18-04-2021||Gurugram||Injured hyena dies during treatment||A hyena that was found injured in the Aravalli forests of Faridabad on Sunday was rescued by the wildlife department but despite their efforts, the animal died during treatment due to serious injuries, said officials familiar with the matter.Ravi Dubey, of the People for Animals Trust, Faridabad, where the hyena was sent for treatment, said that the animal suffered serious injuries to its right leg, most probably from an accident. “The animal was undergoing treatment at Devashrya Animal Hospital but succumbed to injuries. The actual cause of death will be confirmed on Monday after the post-mortem examination report is made available. Prima facie, it seems like the animal must have been injured due to an accident that led to the injury to its right leg. The hyena is also blind, so it might not have been able to find food in the past two days,” said Dubey. Charan Singh, the wildlife inspector for Faridabad, said, “On Sunday morning, we got a call from a resident named Sandeep Yadav, who had spotted the hyena near Badkhal forest area. We rushed our team to the spot and rescued the animal, who was then sent for treatment.” Sunil Harsana, a wildlife researcher and resident of Faridabad, said, “It is unfortunate that the hyena has died, but this indicates a good presence of the animal in the region. The area where it was found has a lot of fragmentation of forests, with different roads leading to Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi. Given that a hyena is being found here, despite such fragmentation, indicates the presence of the animal in good numbers.” A recent study conducted by the non-profit Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), showed a good presence of hyenas in the corridor connecting Gurugram Aravallis, Faridabad Aravallis and the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi. Being shy and nocturnal, hyenas are difficult to spot, but their presence was recorded through signs like pugmarks, dung pellets, scat, kills and scratch marks. After 2017, hyenas from the landscape have also been camera-trapped by wildlife researchers multiple times. As scavengers and mid-level predators, hyenas play an important role in the ecosystem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/injured-hyena-dies-during-treatment-101618769968232.html

Only a fraction of the water flows to the master drains, while the rest causes flooding of the underpass due to backflow, said officials.“During construction of the underpass, one section of the drainage line was inadvertently left behind. It is hampering the drainage capacity of the new line and only a fraction of water is passing through and eventually, flowing towards GMDA’s master leg 2. The rest of it flows back and causes the underpass to flood every time there is heavy rain,” said a senior GMDA official with its infrastructure division.The official cited above said that the GMDA will fix the problems by widening the 350-metre affected section and introducing a pipeline parallel to it, to ensure rainwater flows to the other end at “optimum capacity.”“Iffco Chowk is one of the 19 most critical waterlogging points in the city and its reasons for flooding were examined earlier this year. We are looking to start work by next month and finish it before the monsoon season,” said the official. Waterlogging has been a major problem at the underpass. In August 2019, following heavy rains, the underpass was inundated and closed for 26 hours. “We have identified around 20 (19) critical most waterlogging points in the city. Work has been executed on various fronts to ensure minimal amount of rainwater accumulates at each of these points,” said Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA.The senior official of the GMDA cited above said the authority has completed de-silting the master drains on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road. In addition, the GMDA is also planning on building a culvert near the underpass for ensuring more rainwater can be drained out of the junction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-take-measures-to-curb-waterlogging-at-iffco-chowk-underpass-101618769967453.html

Nripendra Kumar (50), living in Mumbai for over two decades, returned to his native village Jaffarpur in Purnea district on Friday after the sudden alarming spread of coronavirus in Mumbai. “I was left unemployed, with nothing to sustain there.” “I, my wife and a 20-year-old son returned by special train. At Katihar junction, we underwent rapid antigen tests and were negative luckily,” Kumar said.Similar is the scene in Muzaffarpur.Rohit Kumar (35), who managed to get a job in Mumbai after a lot of difficulties in January this year, too returned by a special train on Saturday evening. “I had lost my job at Mumbai last year due to the lockdown. I again managed to get one this year, but announcement of night curfew by the Maharashtra government reminded me of the problems last year, when I and my family members had virtually reached the stage of starvation. I didn’t want this happen again. So, I have decided to return well in time,” Kumar says, adding that he would now look for a job at his native place.Md Shamim, who had planned to join work as a foreman at an industrial unit Devas in Madhya Pradesh, has got his train ticket cancelled. “I have now discarded the idea and would like to stay here,” he said.Raju Kumar, who used to sell Pav Bhaji at a roadside stall in Ludhiana, says he doesn’t want to walk back home on foot like the last year. “So I caught a Jainagar-bound train to reach Muzaffarpur on Friday. I am happy to be here,” he says.No registration this timeUnlike last year, when there was a heavy inflow of migrant returnees, the state government this time has not issued any guidelines for the registration of migrants returning to their villages for alternative employment.Muzaffarpur’s district magistrate Pranav Kumar said any registration for returnees would only be started after getting directions from the state headquarter. Katihar DM Udyan Mishra said though there was no registration camp this time, the administration kept details of returnees since they were being tested for Covid-19. “Those testing positive are either sent to isolation centres or they are home quarantined with medicines and they are under constant medical observation,” he said.Food security“We have not started any special drive for providing foodgrains to migrant returnees so far. Last year, foodgrains were given free under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana from April to November,” said Vinay Kumar, secretary, food and consumer protection department.He said the state government had already added 23.89 lakh ration cards last year, including of migrant returnees, giving coverage to one crore people under the national food security programme. “We have enough foodgrains for providing subsidized ration to all 8.50 crore people covered under the act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fearing-lockdown-migrants-start-returning-home-no-jobs-in-hand-101618764387055.html

In the letter addressed to the principal secretary of the department, he has said he did not wish to own the accountability of patients’ miseries for want of oxygen.Singh alleged that oxygen cylinders was being taken away from the hospital, even through the flow of patients suffering from Covid infections kept pouring in. Hospital officials said they required 400-500 cylinders per day against the current supply of 150-200 units.Principal secretary (health) Pratyay Amrit could not be contacted for his comment.With 8690 fresh cases of Covid being detected in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases have crossed 50,000 mark in Bihar. The situation, particularly in Patna, has turned alarming with none of the hospitals, including private ones, are ready to take fresh cases, citing non-availability of beds.Meanwhile, as many as 11 persons infected with Covid died in the past 24 hours while undergoing treatment at Gaya-based ANMMCH. So far, the district has witnessed 25 Covid deaths. Reports said eight Covid patients died in course of treatment at NMCH during the past one day.The Patna high court has also taken serious exception to the report of non-availability of medical care to the patients and directed the government to make sure that none should die for want of oxygen and medicines. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL), the division bench of Patna high court comprising Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Sah on Saturday scrutinised the steps being taken by the health department to combat the pandemic and asked it to file fresh and incisive report about the preparations by Monday, which is the next date of hearing in the case.Meanwhile, union minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey took stock of preparations at the railway hospitals for treating Covid patients and directed the Drug Controller of India to ensure adequate supply of Remdesvir, a critical anti-viral in Covid treatment, in all railway hospitals at the earliest.The recovery rate in Bihar, which was over 95% during the first phase of the pandemic, has come down to 89.70%.The health department has so far conducted tests on more than 2.50 crore people for Covid, in which more than three lakh were found to be infected with the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nmch-boss-offers-to-quit-cites-oxygen-shortage-101618764327732.html

Announcing this after marathon meetings with the district magistrates and later with the crisis management group during the day, chief minister Nitish Kumar said Sunday that section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) will be imposed as per requirement in town areas and block level during the day to prohibit assemblies of four or more individuals and avoid any crowding. “The district magistrates will ensure that vegetable mandis and roadside vending are staggered and not crowded. All public places like malls, cinema halls, gyms and parks as well as religious places will remain closed and restaurants and dhabas will only provide home delivery or takeaway facility. There will be a cap of 100 people for marriage and ‘shradh’ functions. The government and private offices, already running with one-third attendance, will close by 5 pm while shops will close by 6 pm. Earlier, it was 7 pm. However, it will not apply to essential services,” he said. The announcement was on expected lines after Saturday’s all-party meeting, which was not unanimous on complete statewide lockdown in the state that has a large number of people working in other states. The CM, however, appealed to all the people living outside to return as early as possible, as delay will cause problems to them, hinting that the government might review the situation in the days to come to decide on sterner measures. “The government will make all arrangements. Those in home isolation will be monitored on a daily basis, while those returning will be provided with quarantine facilities like last year at the subdivisional level. A lot of deliberations have been done on every aspect,” the CM said, adding that it was decided to wait for some time before deciding on the possibility of lockdown. Kumar said the government has also taken a decision to develop containment zones like last year to contain the spread of pandemic and increase number of beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and care centres, besides boosting awareness campaign for Covid-appropriate behaviour. The CM said that during the meeting, all aspects were discussed, including reports of oxygen shortage, medicine requirement, especially Remdesivir, and delay in RTPCR reports. “The emphasis will be on fast-tracking testing and vaccination. Early start of treatment is important and for that timely availability of RTPCR reports will be ensured,” he said. The CM said that like the last year, the panchayati raj department will start supply of masks in the rural and urban areas in larger numbers. “Like last year, the government has also decided to give one-month additional salary to doctors and health workers in view of the enormous work they are doing to meet the huge pandemic challenge,” he said. Health minister Mangal Pandey said that the government was ensuring smooth supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injection as also other medicines. “We are in touch with the suppliers and smooth supply will be ensured,” he said. After getting detailed feedback from all the political parties on the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation in Bihar at a meeting called by Governor Phagu Chouhan on Saturday, the CM had said that the government would announce further measures to contain the spread of virus on Sunday after seeking reports from all the district magistrates.

Such action is not right and will not be tolerated in future," he said.To a question on whether the police will take action against the BJP leaders, Walse Patil said he would discuss the issue with his colleagues and take appropriate decision.The Remdesivir stock was not seized, but we feel the stock was more than 50,000, he added.The company director showed the permission letter from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for selling the stock to the Maharashtra government, the minister said.Earlier, when the FDA gave permission to the company director Rajesh Dokania to supply stock to Maharashtra, he had expressed inability to honour the commitment, Walse Patil said."A probe is on whether the stock was to be sold to private parties or to the government. The stock is at present with the company. It was not going to the government. Investigation is being carried out to find out to whom it was being given," he said.The stock cannot be sold to political parties, he said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole demanded action against Fadnavis and Darekar for "pressurising police to let off" the pharma company direction, who is suspected of hoarding Remdesivir injection stock.In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Patole claimed that Fadnavis had told the police that the Remdesivir stock was brought with the permission of union ministers."When Remedisivir cannot be sold to private parties, how did Fadnavis get permission? Has the central government given its nod to the BJP and Fadnavis to hoard Remdesivir?'' he asked.According to police, they had got information that the Remdesivir stock was going to be flown abroad by air cargo, despite a ban on the export of the drug.Police questioned Dokania on Saturday night. On learning about it, Fadnavis and Darekar had rushed to the police station. Their appearance at the police station has now triggered a political slugfest between the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the opposition party over the paucity of healthcare supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-pressurising-cops-maharashtra-minister-on-pharma-firm-remdesivir-stock-101618761072678.html

The national capital also saw 161 people succumbing to the disease on the last 24 hours, the health bulletin showed, with the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagging the spike as a "major concern".Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereThe surge in the number of cases has caused Delhi's positivity rate (number of samples testing positive from total samples) to reach nearly 30% from 24% just a day ago. The rapid pace at which the cases are increasing in Delhi has led to a shortage of beds for patients at hospitals in the city.“Cases are increasing at a fast rate and Covid-19 beds are getting occupied across the city. People are getting admitted in hospitals at an unprecedented rate. There is a major crisis of ICU beds. There are less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi. We are facing a major shortage of oxygen too,” Arvind Kejriwal said earlier in the day.The chief minister has also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he described the Covid-19 situation in Delhi as extremely serious. “There is a severe shortage of Covid-19 beds and oxygen supply...We need your help. Central government hospitals in Delhi collectively have around 10,000 beds, of which 1,800 are reserved for Covid-19. In the light of the severity of the situation, I appeal to you to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. There is a severe shortage of oxygen supply too. Please arrange oxygen for Delhi,” he wrote in the letter.Later in the evening, Arvind Kejriwal took to social media to say that Delhi’s oxygen supply has been reduced and announced that oxygen has become an emergency in the national capital. "Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL," the chief minister wrote on Twitter.The Delhi government had also appealed for Covid care coaches at two railway stations in the city. The request was accepted within a few hours and Union minister Piyush Goyal informing about the same.

Even my regular canteen has closed down and I have very limited money to even go back to my village in Solapur,” said Patil.Like Patil, there are thousands of students who are struggling to find daily meals and other facilities due to the strict restrictions imposed in the city. “Currently, my friend and I are both staying in a rented flat in Gokhale nagar. I am doing my post-graduation from Pune university and my friend is working. Now, we have to cook our own food at home. We fear travelling back to our hometowns,” said Mitali Gandhi, a student. Pune is an educational hub and every year lakhs of students from across the country come here for studies or to prepare for competitive examinations. Sadashiv peth, Navi peth, Kothrud, and the Bharati Vidyapeeth areas are where a large number of students live in hostels, as paying guests or in rented flats. An entire economy is set up to cater to the students, right from food, groceries, and study material. “As the student numbers have gone down, business is also low. When all the things were opened up and students were returning, business was going on well. Now again it is affected,” said Rohan Nalawade, a bakery and ice-cream shop owner in Navi peth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-suffer-due-to-strict-restrictions-many-stuck-in-the-city-101618758386735.html

18-04-2021||Mumbai||BJP trying to ensure Maharashtra doesn't get Remdesivir: State minister Malik||The NCP on Sunday accused the BJP of trying to ensure Maharashtra does not get Remdesivir stock, and wondered why state BJP leaders got scared when Mumbai police questioned the director of a Daman-based company manufacturing the drug used for treating Covid-19 patients.Referring to the appearance of top Maharashtra BJP leaders late Saturday night at the BKC police station after the pharma firm director was grilled, state minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said "something is fishy".Remdesivir is listed for use in serious Covid-19 patients. In view of a sudden spike in demand of the drug due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the Centre last week banned its export till the situation improves.The police on Saturday questioned Rajesh Dokania, director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company that manufactures Remdesivir vials, following information that thousands of vials of the drug to be flown out of the country, an official said.The opposition BJP in Maharashtra objected to the pharma executive's grilling by Mumbai police, saying the state government was playing politics amid the pandemic.It now appears that the stock had been arranged by the BJP for distribution in Maharashtra.On learning that Dokania was being questioned, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and LoP in the Council Praveen Darekar rushed to the police station.Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Nawab Malik said "when two leaders of opposition and two legislators go to the police station late in the night after detention of Dokania, something is fishy"."The BJP is trying to ensure that Maharashtra doesn't get its stock of Remdesivir," alleged Malik, whose party shares power in the state with the Shiv Sena and Congress.Why did the state BJP leaders get scared? The BJP leaders should explain to the people of Maharashtra why they were "favouring" Dokania, he said.Malik also said that after the Centre banned the export of Remdesivir, Dokania had approached the Maharashtra government and sought permission to sell it in the state.State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Minister Rajesh Shingane had met Dokania along with Darekar, he said.Malik said when the police got information that there was Remdesivir stock with the company, Dokania was called for questioning. But, Fadnavis and Darekar along with two BJP legislators Prasad Lad and Parag Alavani reached there.Why did they have to do this? Malik asked."When Dokania showed papers that the FDA permission was given for selling the medicine, he was let off. BJP leaders should clarify what is their link with Dokania," he said.Meanwhile, state NCP chief and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil in a tweet said, "With shortage of #Remdesivir, last night @MumbaiPolice rightly fulfilled their duty to check any supply malpractices/hoarding.""The real Q is: Can any BJP leader, without any info to State govt/Local authorities/Police, procure lakhs of lifesaving drugs @PMOIndia. It's a new low," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-trying-to-ensure-maharashtra-doesn-t-get-remdesivir-state-minister-malik-101618749257154.html
18-04-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal says will work with MCDs to defeat Covid, blame game begins soon after||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s appeal to the commissioners of the three municipal corporations to increase Covid-19 beds in hospitals run by the civic agencies, triggered a blame game on Sunday despite the CM stressing that cooperation between the Centre, state and the municipal bodies was the only way to defeat the pandemic when record infections threatened to overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure in the Capital."I request all three MCDs to provide more beds, we are ready to provide things which will be needed. The Delhi government is preparing beds on a large scale in Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games Village. I request all (the) three MCDs to give maximum medical infrastructure and manpower so that we can use them properly," Kejriwal said in a statement released by Delhi government.Hospitals under the civic bodies in Delhi include Kasturba Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital, Maharishi Balak Ram Hospital, and Girdharilal Hospital. Several of them reserved beds for Covid-19 patients during previous waves of infection recorded in Delhi. While some of them were recently approved as Covid-19 hospitals by the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA), few others were still awaiting the approval, said a senior official of the DDMA. Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal is the chairperson of the DDMA. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is the vice chairperson.The meeting with commissioners of the three municipalities was held through video conference late Saturday evening and was also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain, as per the statement.In a separate briefing on Sunday, Kejriwal said Delhi recorded around 25,500 new cases in the last 24 hour cycle and a positivity rate of 30% -- up from around 24,000 new cases and a positivity rate of around 24%, reported the previous day. He said less than 100 ICU beds remained available for Covid patients and urged the Centre to increase the number of reserved Covid-19 beds to 7,000 from the current 1,800 in the city and also increase the supply of oxygen to hospitals, citing the rapid surge in cases.Kejriwal also asserted that the Delhi government was ready to initiate a door-to-door vaccination drive if permitted by the central government and sought municipal corporations’ support for such proposals. He also underlined that the current crisis could only be solved if all worked together."Central government, Delhi government and MCDs will work together. Only then we will be able to handle the current surge of Covid in Delhi. Even in the first wave, the central government, Delhi government and MCD had successfully worked together in Delhi. We will all work shoulder to shoulder for the people of Delhi and the country. If we get permission from the central government, then we will start door-to-door vaccination on a large scale in Delhi. We need your help," Kejriwal was quoted as saying in the statement. The three MCDs are run by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and have often been at loggerheads with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government led by Kejriwal.It didn’t take long for the blame game to start after Kejriwal’s appeal to the three MCDs. AAP accused the municipal bodies of irresponsible behaviour during the pandemic.“On one side, the Kejriwal government is making an all-out effort to deal with the Covid-19 situation but, on the other side, BJP-ruled MCDs are betraying residents of Delhi. The BJP-ruled MCD has around 3,127 hospital beds in Delhi but they have not provided a single bed for Covid-19 patients yet. It is very shameful that at a time when every citizen is extending their help for Covid-19 patients, the BJP-ruled MCDs are busy doing politics,” said the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.The BJP dismissed the claims as “baseless”.“Before levelling such baseless allegations on MCDs, Mr Durgesh Pathak should ask his Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as to why the Delhi Government is not allowing MCDs to use their hospitals for Covid patients’ treatment. All three MCDs last week itself offered in writing their maximum possible hospital infrastructure for treatment of Covid patients but till today Kejriwal Government has approved only two such offers. They are the ones causing the delay,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-will-work-with-mcds-to-defeat-covid-blame-game-begins-soon-after-101618746319919.html

Passengers who are found positive will be quarantined at home or hospital for 10 days.

Twenty five such facilities will be placed at Anand Vihar by Monday, General Manager Ashutosh Gangal said today.Among other measures put in place by the Delhi government, people comign from Maharashtra will have to undergo random sample collection.

Residents have been advised against visiting the police stations unless in case of an emergency. Meanwhile, complaints can be sent via e-mail at cp.ldh.police@punjab.gov.in. Police have also installed complaint boxes outside the police stations for those, who don’t have access to e-mail. A similar action was taken in July last year after the pandemic broke out and public dealing was resumed only on October 6, 2020, once the Covid-19 cases started going down.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said the step was taken for the safety of people, as complainants often visited police stations in groups.He said all police stations, posts and wings were being thoroughly sanitised and contacts of positive patients were being tested. Advising residents against venturing outside their houses unless absolutely necessary, the top cop assured that the police were available round-the-clock. The police have already indefinitely suspended the “Know your case” scheme due to the resurge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-surge-public-dealing-at-ludhiana-police-stations-suspended-till-april-30-101618745607203.html

It noted that prima facie a monopoly has been created by another family member, Mahendra Pandey, who according to the plea was not allowing Bishan Swaroop to perform puja sewa and claim the share in the offerings and donations.The court directed that all the donation boxes shall now be locked by the court receivers and opened only once every day at the time fixed by the receiver/s either late evening or in the morning in presence of the representatives of the litigants.“In view of this, it is prima facie clear at this stage, that Respondent No.1 seems to have monopolised the bari (turn in performing puja) and the related rights, and is also not giving any proper accounts qua the said bari,” the court order said.HS Sharma, Retd District & Sessions Judge and Anurag Ahluwalia, advocate, were reappointed court receivers for the period till 22/23rd April, 2021 and given the rights to lock the donation boxes and take all required steps to assess the offerings and donations as also the teh-bazari, the April 16 order said.Swaroop alleged he was not being allowed to exercise his rights in the current turn because his mother, late Bishan Devi, being a woman, was declared ineligible despite a 2016 order by a trial court giving rights to the female heir.Swaroop also cited an order of October 28, 2014, passed in his favour as the legal heir of late Bishan Devi, i.e. daughter of late Sh Ram Swaroop, claiming a right over 1/6th share of Ram Swaroop. According to the order of the trial court, the petitioner inherited the right of realisation of 1/6th share of late Sh Ram Swaroop in offerings and tehbazari, from his mother, who was the daughter of late Sh Ram Swaroop.“In the present petition, the share of Bishan Swaroop, who is one of the baridaars during the navratri period, is in dispute. There can be no dispute about the fact that during the navratri period, offerings and the donations which are given at the Kalkaji Mandir are extremely high. This is also clear from the reports received in the earlier petition where the Local Commissioner and the Receivers, who were appointed, have informed this Court that during the navratri period, the footfall in the temple is quite large,” the court said in the April 16 order.It said that the amount collected will be counted by the court receivers and 1/6th share shall be handed over to the plaintiff’s representative. It also directed the receivers to determine as to who is currently running the bari and the manner in which it is being run asking them to file a detailed report at the end of this Navratri period.The judge also noted that the court dealt with a similar case, in respect of various baaridars in the Kalkaji Mandir, during the months of January and February. It said that a detailed order was passed on Feb 5 holding that women, who are legal heirs, will be entitled to exercise their bari and perform the puja rights.“The dispute between the various baridaars in the Kalkaji Mandir has resulted in multiple litigations being filed before the trial courts. In the earlier petition…., this court has been informed that there are over 70 litigations which are pending in respect of the Kalkaji Mandir.“Various branches of families, and the various baridaars who are hundreds in number, keep filing applications/ proceedings before the trial courts, which has resulted in enormous confusion and complete mismanagement at the Kalkaji Mandir. The baris are even auctioned and there are purchasers who have bid for exercising the baris,” the court noted in its order. The matter will now be heard on May 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-receivers-to-assess-donations-offerings-at-kalka-mandir-during-navratri-101618744226785.html

There is a severe shortage of Covid-19 beds and oxygen supply. At our level, we are doing everything that is possible. We need your help. Central government hospitals in Delhi collectively have around 10,000 beds, of which 1,800 are reserved for Covid-19. In the light of the severity of the situation, I appeal to you to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. There is a severe shortage of oxygen supply too. Please arrange oxygen for Delhi,” he said in the letter.Delhi chief secretary also made similar requests to the railway department saying, “We would be grateful if you identify more such facilities upto a level of 5000 beds, as was done last year, so as to meet the huge demand of beds arising out of an ever increasing surge in positive cases this time in NCT of Delhi.”The demand for railway isolation coaches, which were deployed last year, is growing elsewhere in the country as well. The railways’ western zone has received a demand from Nandurbar, a Maharashtra district close to Gujarat border, for around 95 coaches and 1,500 beds. “Each Covid-19 care rake will have 20 coaches, comprising modified Sleeper and General coaches; each coach can accommodate 16 patients.The coaches will be suitably positioned as mutually agreed upon between the district administration of Nandurbar and divisional administration of Mumbai division of Western Railways,” a memorandum of understanding signed between Western Railways and the district authorities on April 11 noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-asks-railways-to-provide-covid-care-coaches-at-2-stations-101618742509863.html
18-04-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: The journey of sangeet natak, the way ahead||I was not introduced to theatre till I was nearly twelve years old. It was not a conscious decision, I suppose it was just something that happened.I was studying in an English medium school and theatre wasn’t a big part of it’s cultural activities. I do not remember seeing students performing too. I had watched a few plays on TV. It was common back then. So, when I wanted to sit at home and watch cartoons and my parents decided to take me to watch a play, I was not too thrilled. But I had no choice and I am glad that I did not! Amongst the many plays I watched before taking the decision to pursue it as a profession, I watched only one sangeet natak, the traditional Maharashtrian musical theatre.Marathi theatre finds its roots in sangeet natak when Vishnudas Bhave staged “Sita Swayamwar” in 1843. Since then Marathi theatre was dominated by Sangeet Natak like “Sangeet Saubhadra” by Annasaheb Kirloskar, “Sangeet Sharada” and “Sangeet Saunshaykallol” by Govind Ballal Deval, “Sangeet Manapman” by Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar, and “Sangeet Ekach Pyaala” by Ram Ganesh Gadkari.These were five-act plays with nearly fifty songs on an average. The performances used to start at sundown and continue till sunrise. Many-a-times the plays were socially and politically relevant. Singer-actors like Bal Gandharva, Keshavrao Bhosale and Deenanath Mangeshkar had become superstars and started their own production companies.People used to come to listen to their songs and it is said that for some songs they would get as much as fifteen encores! It is considered to be a golden era of Marathi theatre. It is also the beginning of the downfall of sangeet natak.Songs started becoming more important than the play and that led to an imbalance in performance. Newer singer-actors were not being curated and the old generation continued performing the roles of the protagonists who were young. This hampered the believability of the performance. Also, with the advent of the radio and other technological enhancements in audio recordings, the audience could listen to their favourite songs at home. As a result, lesser and lesser content in sangeet natak was being produced.By the time I started doing theatre, I remember sangeet natak was described as being boring. I had watched a play while I was in school and honestly, I did not feel like watching another one. So, when I was approached to direct one by singer Rahul Deshpande, I was in a fix. On the one hand, I was just starting my career and absolutely wanted to work with someone like him. But, on the other, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to direct something that was exactly a century old – “Sangeet Saunshaykallol”.I read the five-act script and thought that it had some really fun moments. After a brief chat with a theatre researcher about the play, I met Rahul and the producers and asked if I could have a free hand with the content.Since I had not watched any version of the play, editing it became easier. I quickly edited the text into a two-act structure and narrated it to the team. They were on board. Then came the part about balancing the text with songs. I sat with Rahul and identified the songs that absolutely had to be there. It was a sort of a negotiation, wherein he was insisting that a song should be there because of its historic and nostalgic value, while I was trying to ascertain its place in the edited structure and whether it was adding any value to the play. Once we reached a consensus, rehearsals began in full swing. Before we knew it, we had produced three plays in eighteen months.“Sangeet Manapman” and “Sangeet Saubhadra” being next. I had treated sangeet natak as an experiment and was contemplating whether I wanted to do “Sangeet Saubhadra” because the plot and text seemed dated. The songs were great, no doubt. But Anand Bhate agreed to play the part of Lord Krishna and that character had the most amazing songs.Also, it was the first time that Anand was going to act in a play and I could not resist being the one to direct him.All these plays did well commercially, helped me hone my skills, put me in the coveted Forbes Thirty Under Thirty list and brought me a lot closer to sangeet natak. I enjoyed the form, but longed for contemporary content.“Sangeet Devbababhli” by Prajakt Deshmukh is a good start to newer Sangeet Natak and I hope that more and more plays are written and produced in this format.Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-the-journey-of-sangeet-natak-the-way-ahead-101618743086768.html

It’s shortage, he claimed, could trigger a major crisis any moment as the situation was deteriorating every passing second.Watch | ‘Shortage of ICU beds, oxygen in hospitals’: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal“In the last 24 hours, Delhi recorded around 25,500 new cases, up from around 24,000 the previous day and 19,500 new cases the day before that. The more concerning thing is that the positivity rate in the last 24 hours has gone up to 30% from around 24% the previous day,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing on Sunday.He further said, “Cases are increasing at a fast rate and Covid-19 beds are getting occupied across the city. People are getting admitted in hospitals at an unprecedented rate. There is a major crisis of ICU beds. There are less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi. We are facing a major shortage of oxygen too. Last night, a private hospital told us that they almost ran into a disaster situation last night with a major shortage of oxygen supply.”“We are constantly in touch with the Central government. We are getting a lot of help from them. We thank them for that. Yesterday I spoke with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. He was informed about the situation. Today, I spoke to Union home minister Amit Shah over phone. I have told him that we need more beds. In Delhi, the Central government hospitals collectively have around 10,000 beds, of which around 1,800 are currently reserved for Covid-19 patients. I have requested him (Shah) to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19. The situation in Delhi is deteriorating every second. I also requested that oxygen supply be provided to us immediately,” said Kejriwal.He further said that the Delhi government will be adding more than 6,000 additional Covid-19 beds with oxygen facilities in the next 2-3 days in locations that include Covid treatment facilities set up at Yamuna Sports Complex, Commonwealth Games (CWG) village and premises of Radha Soami Satsang Beas. “We don’t know how many ICU beds we will be able to increase in such a short time. There are limitations. But we have seen that most patients primarily need high-flow oxygen. So, we are arranging more high-flow oxygen systems so that more beds can be converted into oxygen beds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-cites-major-crisis-asks-centre-to-help-with-oxygen-supply-icu-beds-101618732345829.html

They said they couldn't until permissions were given. I spoke with Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and got Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s permission.

He (DCP) said it wasn't communicated to them earlier," the BJP leader added.He added that whatever happened was wrong.However, Singe refuted the allegations that the distributor was arrested and said he was summoned just for an inquiry given the widespread black marketing of the antiviral medication."There's a shortage of Remdesvir in the state and black marketing is rampant. We had got information about this storage facility. Acting in good faith, we only wanted to verify the inputs.

In a late night order on Saturday, the authority said those planning to go for Kumbh Mela any time between April 18 and April 30 must also compulsorily upload their basic information so that they can be tracked on arrival. The authority also said if anyone violates the directive, they will face legal action.“… it has become imperative to mandatorily test, trace and quarantine all those residents of Delhi, who have visited or are going to visit Kumbh-2021 at Haridwar. All those residents of Delhi, who have visited or are going to visit Kumbh, will be required to compulsory home quarantine themselves for 14 days on arrival to Delhi,” the order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev said.Those returning from the Mahakumbh will have to upload their details within 24 hours by Sunday midnight on the Delhi government website www.delhi.gov.in.Also read | 455 FIRs, 164 arrests as cops fan out on Day 1 of weekend curfew“If it is found/reported that any such resident of Delhi, who has returned to Delhi after visiting Kumbh, has not uploaded the requisite details/information, he/she will be sent to the institutional government quarantine centers, as the case may be. The District magistrate of Delhi will ensure tracing and surveillance on a daily basis of such residents of Delhi. They should also ensure quarantining of such residents of Delhi, either at home or government quarantine centers. All district magistrates of Delhi and their counterpart DCPs and all authorities concerned should ensure strict compliance of this order,” it added.Also read | AIIMS director says must go back to earlier strategies to bring down Covid casesThe Delhi government, in addition to asking travellers to the Kumbh Mela to voluntarily submit their information, said it is also in touch with authorities in Uttarakhand so that they can have access to a list of all Delhi residents who have visited the Kumbh festival so far.Experts have raised concerns that the religious gathering will turn into a super spreader event as devotees taking part in 'royal baths' (shahi snan) held at Kumbh on April 12 and 14 were seen flouting all Covid-19 norms and at least 2,000 people tested positive in for the coronavirus about a week's time.Delhi on Saturday reported the highest single-day spike in its daily coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tally with 24,375 new cases in the last 24 hours, according to the health department’s bulletin.

18-04-2021||Delhi||Mandatory registration for Kumbh-bound Delhi residents, quarantine on return||The Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) made it mandatory for residents to register on a Delhi government website before visiting the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar and undergo 14-day quarantine upon their return. Experts however said the order, announced late Saturday night, was too little, too late, as Delhi recorded a new daily peak of 24,375 new Covid-19 cases the same day. A Delhi government official who didn’t wish to be named acknowledged that “such a portal should have been created earlier, preferably before the Kumbh Mela started on March 11 or from April 1, when the cases started rising in Delhi”. The government has no data of the number of residents who went to the Kumbh Mela this year, senior government officials said. Another official pointed out that an earlier advisory RT-PCR tests and self-monitoring of health after return from the Kumbh was not mandatory. The latest order asks residents who visited Kumbh between April 4 and April 17 to compulsorily upload their contact details within 24 hours by Sunday midnight. These details have to be added through a link provided on the Delhi government website www.delhi.gov.in. Those planning to go to the Kumbh Mela till its closure on April 30 also have to fill up the form on the website.“...If it is found/reported that any such resident of Delhi, who has returned to Delhi after visiting Kumbh, has not uploaded the requisite details/information, he/she will be sent to an institutional government quarantine centre for 14 days by the district magistrate (DM) concerned,” read the order, which also asks DMs to trace such residents and monitor them daily. Violations will invite action under sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other legal provisions as applicable, the order added. Devotees taking part in ‘royal baths’ (shahi snan) held at Kumbh on April 12 and 14 were seen flouting all Covid-19 norms and at least 2,000 persons tested Covid-19 positive in about a week’s time, triggering concerns that the Kumbh had turned into a super spreader event. The late night order came on a day when the national capital recorded its highest daily spike of 24,375 Covid-19 cases by far, taking total number of active cases to 69,799. Several states such as Odisha and Madhya Pradesh have also asked returnees to self-isolate and quarantine themselves. Maharashtra, too is considering issuing an advisory in this regard. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for symbolic participation in the last two weeks of the event, including the final Shahi Snan on April 27.But Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the damage has already been done. “Weeks have passed since day one of the Maha Kumbh and thousands must have already returned to Delhi. ...Now, people who returned in the past 14 days will have to be traced and tracked and there is no guarantee that everyone who went there will actually fill the forms. All of the returnees are moving freely, some of whom may even have Covid-19,” he said.A revenue official said it will be next to impossible to identify those who returned from the Kumbh without the pilgrims declaring their details on the government portal.“There are chances that we can track those Delhi visitors who registered in the Uttarakhand government portal. But, it is unlikely that most of them did that,” he said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mandatory-registration-for-kumbh-bound-delhi-residents-quarantine-on-return-101618715425121.html

Against 9, 989 cases recorded cumulatively in the months of January, February and March, the UT saw over 13,000 infections between April 1 and 16. Of the total cases in April, around 8, 500 cases were from Kashmir while 4,500 were from Jammu.The UT had reported its lowest single-day count of the year on February 8 when only 43 cases had surfaced. The surge became pronounced in mid-March and became steeper in April with over 800 cases being reported daily since April 7. Since April 13, when the fresh infections soared up to 1, 269, a record daily count after September 20, the daily cases have been hovering around 1, 000. The month of April also saw 54 deaths – 31 in Kashmir and 23 in Jammu. In the first quarter of the year, the UT recorded 111 fatalities due to the virus.The number of active cases has also rapidly risen – from 593 on February 8 to over 10,000 in April. The number of active cases, as on April 16, was 10,620. Surge was expected: ExpertsExperts say the surge was expected in April. “In the first wave, we had achieved a lot in terms of herd immunity. If everyone had got vaccinated, we would have been much safer now. That did not happen,” said Dr Talat Jabeen, divisional nodal officer Covid. She, however, added that the situation in Kashmir is still better than the rest of the country.“The severity of the disease is less here. We have a sufficient number of beds and the oxygen supply is also enough. We have also asked the officials concerned to perform the mandated 15, 000 RT-PCR tests per million populations daily,” she said.Mushtaq Ahmad Rather, director health, Kashmir, said, “We have asked for increased RT-PCR sampling to have early diagnosis and early treatment which will lead to better outcome. We have also called for increased vaccinations.” OPD services at SMHS suspendedIn view of the surge in virus cases, Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in Srinagar closed its out-patient department (OPD) services from Saturday and added 13 wards for Covid-19 patients. Earlier, the Valley’s largest tertiary care hospital in Srinagar, Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) decided to stop all non-emergency surgeries and admissions to cater to the increasing rush of Covid patients.“Over 203 beds have been designated for Covid-19 patients as the inflow of patients has been increasing. We have suspended OPD services and also stopped routine surgeries,” said Nazir Choudhary, medical superintendent of SMHS hospital.“Many of the patients who are admitted in territory care would obviously be sick,” he said.In northern Baramulla district, the Covid centre at Indoor Stadium has been reopened to meet emergency situations.

The CM, who was accompanied by health minister Rajiv Sezal and health secretary Amitabh Awasthi, presided over a meeting of the stakeholders on Saturday, and said, “The state government does not want to impose a lockdown as it adversely affects the economy and causes great panic among the masses.” He said the second wave is more alarming than the first one with the state crossing the 2,000-mark in terms of active cases in just 20 days. He, however, assured that this time around, the state government is better prepared to face the challenges. “When the first case of Covid-19 was detected in the state, we had only 50 ventilators but now we have more than 600,” the CM said.Jai Ram added the state also has sufficient stock of PPE kits, face masks and hand sanitisers. He said all stakeholders such as NGOs, industrial associations, elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions, urban local bodies, Mahila Mandals and Yuvak Mandals had played a crucial role in fighting the pandemic and their continued support is required to win the battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-cm-says-no-plans-to-impose-lockdown-in-state-101618691422331.html

18-04-2021||Other||Mega plans to develop Chanshal into a world-class tourist destination||The Himachal Pradesh government has set the ball rolling to develop Chanshal valley in Rohru subdivision of Shimla district into a world-class tourist destination.The civil administration in Rohru has submitted a detailed plan to the district administration, stressing on the need to improve road connectivity to the area, located around 14 kilometres from the main Shimla town. The Chanshal Pass links Dodra Kwar with Rohru (Chirgaon), and sits atop the 14,830-ft high Chanshal Peak, which is the highest peak in Shimla district.Sub-divisional magistrate BR Sharma said big projects such as promotion of skiing and ropeway to Chanshal are already under consideration but the administration has suggested a few more activities. Green check post to check garbage disposalThe biggest challenge before the authorities is likely to be that of solid waste management once the area is developed into a tourist hub. To tackle this, the administration has proposed to set up a green check-post, where ₹500 would be charged from every vehicle crossing through. The travelers would be refunded ₹450 if they bring back their garbage, else the entire amount would be forfeited. For disposal of the collected waste, land filling mechanism will be adopted until a proper solid waste management system comes up. Locals to be trained as paragliding pilotsThe plan also proposes to develop Chanshal peak into a paragliding site. It has been suggested to depute a committee of experts to work out the modalities, such as take-off and landing points. There is also a plan to use the 15-km river stretch between Mandali and Sandour for rafting while the reservoir of Sawara-Kuddu Hydropower project could be used for boating.Services of Hatkoti Temple Trust are proposed for management of boating facilities. With a lake, temple and beautiful forest cover, Kharshali is another centre of attraction. Located at a distance of 4km from the main Chanshal Road, it will serve as a gateway point.Government to develop trailsChanshal is at a commanding location with breathtaking all around view. The authorities propose to establish three to four site-seeing points on the peak and equip it with telescopes and proper toilet facilities. For maintenance, local youth clubs will be roped in. For the benefit of trekkers who frequent the famous trails such as Tangnu to Chandernahan, Jakha-Jiskoon to Sangla and Chanshal to Lake Saru, facilities such as resting and camping sites will be set up. The temple of Shikru Devta, the chief deity of the area, is to be renovated and local traditions, costumes, cuisines, songs, dance etc are to be promoted and publicised to add to the attraction.Heli taxi services for peakThe administration also proposes to start heli-taxi services to the peak in summers. An annual Chanshal Festival, proposed for May end when the tourist season is at its peak, will also help popularise the destination. A committee is suggested to be formed to work out the activities of the festival and also make logistical arrangements. It also proposes a disaster management plan for the region.To increase the curiosity of tourists and make it a ‘must-visit’ destination, the administration proposes to put up hoardings depicting the beauty of Chanshal on the Kalka-Shimla highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mega-plans-to-develop-chanshal-into-a-world-class-tourist-destination-101618691002978.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Tarn Taran man held for passing info to Pak intel agency||Delhi Police have arrested a 35-year-old man for allegedly passing sensitive information about army deployment to a foreign intelligence agency, officials said on Saturday.The accused has been identified as Harpal Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran in Punjab, they said.“A highly motivated and radicalised man was arrested for passing sensitive information to foreign intelligence agency. He conveyed details related to Indian Army personnel, army movements, location of army and BSF posts and bunkers on the outposts of India at India-Pakistan border,” a senior police officer said.The money routed through hawala channels was used for funding the espionage operation, he said.According to police, they got a tip-off that the accused was having links with intelligence officers of foreign countries and that he had been receiving funds from his handlers through illegal means for conveying sensitive information regarding national security.During investigation, it was found that he was working as a farm machinery operator. While doing fencing work at the India-Pakistan border, he found a way to convey the secret information or documents across the border, the officer said.“On Monday, police received information that Singh was coming to Delhi. He was about to receive some secret documents from his sources. Thereafter, a trap was laid and Singh was apprehended from Majnu Ka Tila area in north Delhi,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sajeev Kumar Yadav said.During interrogation, Singh disclosed his involvement in procuring sensitive information and further conveying it through different digital channels to his Lahore-based handler Jaspal, police said.He was receiving money from his handler through hawala channel for funding the espionage operation.

18-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi running low on ICU beds, oxygen: CM||Delhi recorded 24,375 cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the highest single-day tally since the pandemic began ravaging countries across the world, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying that the Capital was facing a “very serious” situation amid shortages of crucial drugs and oxygen in the fourth wave, the worst to hit the city so far.One in four people tested for Covid-19 were found to be positive, with the city’s positivity rate shooting up to 24.56%, according to Saturday’s health bulletin. The Capital reported 167 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll so far after Friday’s record of 141. The number of hospitalisations reached 12,669, which was the highest so far.Addressing a digital news briefing after meeting key officials, Kejriwal said Delhi was facing shortages of oxygen and life-saving drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab. Terming the current situation as worrisome and very serious, he called upon the Centre for help, saying it wasn’t clear when the current wave of infections would peak. He said the first day of the weekend curfew largely appeared to be followed by people.The Delhi CM said Covid-19 cases in Delhi are increasing faster than what the administration prepared for, adding that the positivity rate – the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – was more than 24% now. The World Health Organization has said that a rate below 5% for two weeks indicates that the pandemic is under control. “The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is very serious and worrisome. Based on the Covid-19 numbers 3-4 days ago, we assumed that our medical stocks and bed infrastructure were sufficient for now. But given the pace of new infections, Delhi now has started facing shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and tocilizumab,” the chief minister said.He also said that Covid-19 beds were filling up fast due to the steep rise in cases and that the government’s focus was to ensure that all the beds that were added in the city were oxygen beds. He urged the central government to reserve around 50% of the 10,000 beds available in its hospitals for Covid-19 patients.“This wave is three times more severe than the third wave. We still have no idea when the ongoing fourth wave will reach its peak. There can be no room for any laxity as we have to be a step ahead of the Covid-19 curve. A few hours ago, I spoke to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and urged him to increase Covid-19 beds in all Central government hospitals by 50%. During the third wave in November, the central government hospitals in Delhi had 4,100 beds for Covid-19 patients. But in this wave, there are just 1,800 beds reserved for Covid-19 in these central government hospitals. This should be increased, including ICU beds,” he said.Citing examples, Kejriwal said the AIIMS has 1,162 beds, of which only 23 are for Covid-19 patients and the Safdarjung Hospital has 204 of the 2,900 beds reserved for Covid-19.He said the shortage of oxygen was being faced more by private hospitals. “I requested the Union minister to arrange for oxygen as soon as possible and also provide life-saving drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab. We have always got help from the central government when faced with tough situations during this pandemic. We are hopeful the Centre will help us now as well,” Kejriwal said.Also Read | Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, lockdown in Chhattisgarh’s Raipur extended till April 26The CM on Saturday held a series of meetings on Covid-19 management, starting with health officials, followed by all district magistrates and then with commissioners of the three municipal corporations. He directed DMs and MCD officials to ensure there was no black-marketing or hoarding of life-saving drugs and to take strict action against those in violation. He also elaborated on the administration’s plan to increase beds in the city. “All health care infrastructures have a limit to which they can be stretched. Going by the current Covid-19 surge, we will swiftly have to increase Covid-19 beds at a large scale. Even ICU beds are filing up fast. In the next 2-4 days, we plan to add around 6,000 beds. We are trying to provide oxygen in as many of these new beds as possible,” he said.Around 1,300 beds are being set up in east Delhi’s Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games Sports complex. The government is also reopening a Covid Care Centre in South Delhi’s Chhattarpur area with 2,500 beds in a space provided by Radha Saomi Satsang Beas. This number will be increased by another 2,500 by next week. After attaching banquet halls and hotels with hospitals, the city administration has been able to add 2,100 Covid-19 beds, each equipped with an oxygen facility, Kejriwal said.Delhi recorded the highest number of containment zones on Saturday, records showed. As on Saturday evening, the city had 11,235 micro containment zones, of which at least 1,306 were created in the last 24 hours.On increasing complaints of Covid-19 results taking as long as four-five days, he said strict action will be taken against any laboratory found collecting samples more than its capacity. “Delhi has always been known for giving Covid-19 RT-PCR tests results within 24 hours of sample collection. But this week, we have received complaints that results are now taking three-four days. This is happening because labs are taking samples more than their capacity. I have directed all DMs to monitor and check with every Covid lab in their zone. Strict action will be taken against labs that take samples more than their capacity.”Senior officials who attended Kejriwal’s meeting with health officials said the chief minister himself opened the “Delhi Corona” app on his mobile application and randomly called a few hospitals that showed that beds were available.“He (Kejriwal) found that complaints of people that hospitals were not admitting patients despite showing availability in the app were genuine to a large extent. He asked concerned officials to take strict action against hospitals which are updating false information on the app and are denying beds despite availability in reality,” an official who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity.On the first day of the weekend curfew in Delhi, Kejriwal said that people seemed to be largely following the lockdown.“We will be monitoring the situation for the next few days and we will take whatever steps are necessary for the safety of people. I hope the public will cooperate with us just like they have in the past,” he said.Experts said that the mortality was likely to increase further with the city’s health infrastructure getting overburdened. “Delhi is in a bad state. The number of cases in Maharashtra has been rising for quite some time, but Delhi crossed the number of cases being reported in Mumbai and Pune within weeks. When the hospitals start running full and we cannot take care of the patients, the mortality will go up. I think the only solution now is a lockdown to cut transmission. But no matter what we do, it will take at least 15 days for the numbers to come down considering the incubation period of the infection and transmission to contacts,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-running-low-on-icu-beds-oxygen-cm-101618690156747.html

These four centres collectively have a capacity of 726 beds and were shut after a decline in the cases last year, sources at the police headquarters said. “We are seeing 25-30 new cases everyday among the police personnel. A steep rise in infection has also been observed among the family members of the police personnel. Looking at the overall increase in new cases in the city, we are preparing ourselves, and as a result of this, the four Covid centres for the police would also be gradually reopened as the need arises,” said an IPS (Indian Police Service) officer from the headquarters. The first Covid centre in Kalina is likely to be reopened this week, said another senior police officer. The setting up of four dedicated Covid care centres – two at Kalina and one each at Marol and Marine Drive for Mumbai Police had proved to be the most important step taken by the department to save its personal during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Friday said that all possible measures are being taken to prevent the spread of infection among the personnel. “Unlike last year, we have now started calling personnel who are aged 55 and above as well as those with comorbidities to duty owing to limited manpower. But we are assigning them only with indoor duties or table work to minimise their risk of contracting the virus,” Nagrale said. Six Covid help desks, one at the control room and five at each region in Mumbai have been set up, said a deputy commissioner of police-rank officer. “Also in major hospitals, we have deputed police nodal officers for better coordination and sharing of information on availability of beds,” the officer said. “Compared to the November-February period, the cases of police personnel getting infected daily in March and April 2021 have gone up, but due to vaccination, the number of serious patients is very low,” said Rajkumar Vhatkar, joint commissioner of police (administration). Since last April, nearly 8,000 personnel have been tested positive for Covid-19 in Mumbai Police, of whom 102 succumbed to the infectious disease. Currently, there are 541 patients in the force who are undergoing treatment at various facilities. The city police force has also expedited the vaccination drive for its personnel. The Mumbai Police has a strength of 45,000 personnel, of whom 70% have received the first vaccine dose, while 40% have got both the doses. Across the state, 37,644 police personnel have been infected with the virus, of whom 380 (34 officers and 346 constables) have died. Currently, there are 3,495 active cases. Around 33,769 police personnel have recovered, while nearly 10,465 are quarantined, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-dedicated-covid-centres-for-mumbai-police-to-be-reopened-soon-101618690222265.html

The editorial said that the Covid-19 situation would have certainly been brought under control had the Centre reduced the “political dose” and focussed on the fight against the pandemic.On Thursday, India added 217,353 fresh infections and 1,185 fatalities. “The Centre is not ready to tackle the coronavirus emergency properly... China was held responsible for the first wave of coronavirus, [but] Election Commission and the Centre are responsible for the current wave. Covid-19 spread 500 times faster from states where elections were held or is underway... For polls and political selfishness, the rulers of Delhi created a wave of epidemic by not tackling Covid-19,” the Sena mouthpiece said in an editorial published on Saturday.The party blamed election rallies in the four states and Union Territory where elections are underway. It also said that the coronavirus transmission has gained pace due to the Kumbh Mela.“The vehemence of Covid-19 continues, but the election rallies and Kumbh Mela have not being stopped. Lakhs of devotees congregated at Kumbh and took a dip in the Ganges, which led to transmission of coronavirus across the country. But if the Prime Minister is not ready to stop the election mela in West Bengal, then why should the saints and seers be blamed for Kumbh?” it stated.It further added, “Had the Centre reduced the political dose and kept focus on controlling the spread of coronavirus, the situation wouldn’t have gone out of hand. But the government moved the capital to West Bengal and coronavirus devastated Delhi. Once the capital falls, how long does it take for the country to fall?”The editorial said that the Centre should keep its “ego and political gains aside” to tackle the second wave. It added that the Union health ministry claimed that BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)-ruled states are doing better than non-BJP ruled ones, but “[the situation in] Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have forced the ministry to hide their faces”.The Sena mouthpiece said that this is not any state’s failure but a “failure arising from the carelessness of the Centre”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-slams-centre-for-ignoring-second-covid-19-wave-101618690102275.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid beds’ occupancy doubles in Punjab hospitals in two weeks||Owing to the fresh surge in daily infections amid the second wave of the pandemic, the bed occupancy for Covid-19 patients in Punjab hospitals has doubled in the past two weeks. Around 14% of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in the state’s government and private hospitals were occupied as on April 4 whereas the occupancy increased to 31% by Saturday evening, data available with the health department shows. The health department is emphasising the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and increased vaccination of the eligible people. Since April 4, the state has added 43,678 fresh infections and 751 deaths. To tackle the situation, the health department has reserved 8,400 level-2 beds in government and private hospitals for treatment of moderately ill Covid patients and 2,100 level-3 beds, including the intensive care unit (ICU) beds with or without ventilators, for critical patients. Nearly 13% of the level-2 beds and 17% of the level-3 beds were occupied as on April 4. However, around 2,520 (30%) level-2 beds and 735 (35%) level-3 beds were occupied by the patients by Saturday evening. State nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Hospitalisation is gradually increasing in the state amid a fresh spike in infections. The state has enough beds available for level-2 patients in all the districts. High occupancy of level-3 beds is a major concern as it may lead to a high fatality rate. Also, occupancy of level-3 beds is more because people come to the hospital only when they develop severe symptoms and complications. We have enough ventilators, oxygen supply and other equipment to handle the second wave.” Restrictions on elective surgeries up to April 30 Meanwhile, the health department issued fresh notice to all deputy commissioners of the state to restrict all elective surgeries in all hospitals, including government and private facilities, within the state up to April 30. “The state is experiencing the second wave of Covid-19 and it is severe. Number of daily cases has crossed 4,000 and it has started putting more load of level-2 and level-3 isolation facilities. We will thus require more beds for Covid patients and with the increase of patient load on healthcare facilities, all elective surgeries need to be restricted till April 30,” the notice issued by the principal secretary, health and family welfare department, reads. Dr Bhaskar added, “Besides restricting elective surgeries, we have asked private hospitals to reserve extra beds for Covid-19 patients as need may arise anytime. Also, all the private hospitals in Mohali district have been asked to reserve their 60% available beds only for Covid-19 patients. If required, we will issue similar notice in other districts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-beds-occupancy-doubles-in-punjab-hospitals-in-two-weeks-101618689865294.html

The friend also claimed that the duo – Dr Nagendra Mishra, 57, and Dr Suraj Mishra, 28 – had taken the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine last month. “Nagendra and I were so close that we used to meet on most days after our work. I remember him calling me and complaining that their RT-PCR reports have been delayed, owing to which they could not get admitted anywhere. The delay in RT-PCR led to delay in them getting proper treatment. Also, the family had to struggle a lot for beds to get the two admitted,” said the friend Omprakash Munna Pandey, 61, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan (West). Dr Mishra father died at Thane hospital on Thursday night, and hours later, Dr Suraj also succumbed to the infection at a private hospital in Goregaon. Dr Mishra’s wife is also admitted to a private hospital at Dombivli. “By the time Nagendra was admitted to the hospital, his body had 75% percent of the infection. He used to travel to his clinic at Khadavli, Titwala, by local train and had worked throughout the pandemic without any hesitation,” said Pandey. Dr Suraj ran a clinic at Bapgaon, Bhiwandi. “The suspected patients, awaiting their reports, are suffering a lot as they cannot get admitted to a hospital till their reports arrive. And by that time, the infection spreads over their body. I think the government should come up with some measures for suspected patients soon,” added Pandey. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Corporation’s (KDMC) medical health officer Dr Ashwini Patil also admitted that there is a delay in receiving the RT-PCR reports. “There is no information about the two doctors in our records as of now. We have not received their respective files from the hospitals where they were admitted. But as there is a spike in the cases and increased testing, reports are being delayed by three-four days. We are conducting around 5,000 tests daily. We have increased the manpower at our testing lab, and from Monday, the generation of test reports will speed up,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delay-in-test-reports-led-to-death-of-2-kalyan-doctors-friend-101618689802245.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||SIT expedites sacrilege incidents’ probe days after HC rebuff in police firing probe||After Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation reports of the special investigation team (SIT) led by inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in Kotkapura firing case, the SIT probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents has expedited the process to file a supplementary charge sheet. Sources said the SIT led by IGP (border range) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar has been asked to speed up the investigation in the 2015 sacrilege cases and file a supplementary charge sheet. Both 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases are interlinked as two youths had died in the Behbal Kalan firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12. The police also opened fire the same day on protesters at Kotkapura, leaving many injured. An officer privy to the development said an undertaking has been submitted in the court that the new SIT chairman has started the investigation after taking the charge as per the high court order. “Three meetings have been already held since Parmar took the charge as SIT chairman. The SIT has already completed all the investigation at the ground level and now only the record recovered from the CBI needs to be added. The record handed over by the CBI is extensive and the SIT is going through the documents to make a supplementary charge sheet. After the recent order of the high court in Kotkapura firing, the probe has been expedited in these cases,” the officer added. Parmar said investigation on and they are going through the CBI probe documents. “A supplementary charge sheet will be filed in the court after completing investigation. I cannot share more information,” he added. In January this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to hand over the diaries and papers relating to the investigation into the three sacrilege incidents of 2015 to the Punjab Police and asked the state government to replace the then SIT head IG Ranbir Singh Khatra. However, in the order, the high court observed that though it is not discarding the probe conducted by the Khatra-led SIT, the team should be headed by a different officer so as to ensure that “no element of prejudice”, whatsoever, remains in the mind of the petitioner. While in the Kotkapura firing case, the high court has quashed all the investigation report of SIT and asked the state to make a fresh SIT excluding IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. In February, IG Parmar replaced Khatra as the new chairman of the SIT. On March 12, the SIT had informed the court of judicial magistrate Faridkot that IGP Parmar has taken charge as chairman of the SIT. However, Khatra remained a member of the SIT till his retirement on March 31 this year. Khatra was appointed the chairman of the SIT constituted by the state government on April 22, 2020, to probe the cases related to three FIRs registered in connection with sacrilege incidents. The first case pertains to the theft of the ‘bir’ (a copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village near Kotkapura in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. The second was the putting up of a poster at Bargari village on September 25, 2015; and the third was the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found in Bargari on October 12, 2015. In July last year, the SIT had named jailed Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and dera’s three national committee members — Sandeep Bretta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri — as accused and filed a charge sheet against seven dera followers in a case relating to the theft of a ‘bir’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-expedites-sacrilege-incidents-probe-days-after-hc-rebuff-in-police-firing-probe-101618689743240.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Kin react in disbelief: Enough is enough, says relative of Sikh woman killed in Indianapolis shooting||The shocked and grieving families of the Indian-Americans working at a FedEx facility in the US state of Indiana have expressed their anger, fear and anxiety as they came to terms with the loss of their loved ones at a mass shooting that killed eight people, including four Sikhs.Brandon Scott Hole, 19, a former employee at the facility in Indianapolis, carried out the mass shooting on late Thursday before allegedly committing suicide.About 90% of the workers at this delivery service facility are said to be Indian-Americans, mostly from the Sikh community.Late Friday night, the Marion County Coroner’s Office and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) released the names of the victims: Amarjeet Johal (66), Jasvinder Kaur (64), Amarjit Sekhon (48) and Jaswinder Singh (68). The first three deceased are women. Four others were Karli Smith (19), Samaria Blackwell (19), Matthew R. Alexander (32) and John Weisert (74).“Enough is enough, our community has been through enough trauma,” Komal Chohan, granddaughter of one of the victims, Amarjeet Johal, was quoted as saying by the New York Post.Amarjeet hailed from Salempur Masandan village near Jalandhar. She moved to the US around 35 years ago, said Sewa Singh, her brother-in-law of Johal, adding that she was survived by three children and five grandchildren. Sewa Singh said he got several calls from his daughter and son-in-law on Friday night and when he called back, he was informed Amarjit was shot dead. “I am heartbroken to confirm that my “naniji” (maternal grandmother), Amarjeet, is among those killed in the senseless shooting at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis,” Chohan said.She said that several of her family members work at the particular facility and are traumatised. “My nani, my family, and our families should not feel unsafe at work, at their place of worship, or anywhere,” Chohan said.Jaswinder Singh, who lost his life in the shooting, was due to get his first paycheck at the facility this month and was working on the night shift to sort out the mail. “He was a simple man. He used to pray and meditate a lot, and he did community service,” said Harjap Singh Dhillon, Jaswinder’s relative, in a New York Times report.Jaswinder’s killing came as a rude shock to his family at Kotla Naudh Singh village in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district. One of his sons, Gurvinder Singh, with whom he stayed in the US, informed his siblings back home on Saturday morning about their father’s death. “We got a call from our brother early this morning informing us that our father had died in the violence. His body is still in police custody,” said Jatinder Singh, the victim’s younger son. Jatinder said that their parents had migrated to the US eight years ago to be with his middle son. “He had started working at the facility a few days ago and we are told that he had gone there to collect his payment when the shooting occurred,” Jatinder said. He said his parents talked to them two days ago and lamented that due to the Covid-19 pandemic they could not visit India soon. He said that Jaswinder had last come home two years ago. “Little did we know that he would never come again,” Jatinder said. Amarjit Sekhon, another deceased in the incident who began working at FedEx about six months ago, leaves behind two teenage sons who are yet to come to terms with their mother’s death.Rimpi Girn, Sekhon’s niece, said she is struggling to explain her loss of her younger son. “We can’t even think of what to tell him. All of a sudden last night his mom went to work, and she never came back today,” she was quoted as saying in the report.Jasvinder Kaur, who used to travel with Sekhon for her night shifts at FedEx, was to attend her granddaughter’s second birthday celebrations on Saturday. “And today we’re gathering to plan a funeral,” Girn, who is also Kaur’s relative, was quoted as saying by the NYT.For Kamal Jawandha, it was a miracle that both of his parents, who worked at the facility and were present there at the time of shooting, escaped unhurt.Jawandha said that his father had brought his mother food and was getting ready to go inside when the shooting started. His mother hid in the bathroom when the shooting started, the report said.“She’s in deep sadness. She could not sleep. She just can’t stop shaking. She can’t believe this kind of thing would happen here,” Jawandha was quoted as saying by the NYT.Maninder walia, a community member, expressed shock at the shooting incident, saying that it is very hard to understand that it can happen to the community.“We go everywhere. We are all one family. Tragedy has occurred in a particular side of the town and we are all together. Anybody who has been hurt or anything, we mourn for all,” Walia said while speaking to the local WRTV channel.Replying to a question on concerns whether the community is being targeted, he said, “it is too early to say anything and folks who are in the law and enforcement, they are gonna do their thing.” This is the worst Sikh massacre in the US after the Oak Creek Gurdwara mass shooting in Wisconsin on August 5, 2012, where seven members of the community were killed.Although Sikhs began settling in Indiana more than 50 years ago, the first gurdwara was established in 1999. In the last two decades, the Sikh population around Indianapolis has experienced significant growth. Now there are 10 gurdwaras across the state and an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Sikh Americans who have made Indiana their home.

18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Will build Jat Maha Sabha teams across Punjab: Navjot Kaur Sidhu||Former Amritsar (East) MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who nowadays is camping in Patiala, has been taking keen interest in the local politics, especially in Patiala (Rural) and Sanaur constituencies. She even opened a Congress office in Sanaur recently, which is being seen as a move to counter Congress leader Harinderpal Singh Harry Mann, a protégé of MP Preneet Kaur.Addressing the media in Patiala on Saturday, Navjot Kaur said, “Being the state president of women wing of Jat Maha Sabha in Punjab, I will use this platform to build teams across Punjab for the betterment of youth and give them a political space.” On Friday, her husband and former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had taken potshots at Capt Amarinder-led government over the “botched-up probe” into 2015 sacrilege cases. On the family’s political future, she said Sidhu family has always stood for Punjab and Punjabis. “No post matters to us and we are here not for personal gains. We want posts and positions only to serve people. The governments have not been listening to the people,” Kaur said.“Governments are like parents and they should listen to the voice of public. But in the present system, the voice of the public is not reaching the ruling class,” she said, without naming anyone. She also said the government should legalise opium farming in Punjab to end the synthetic drug menace. On Friday, her husband, too, had attacked the government on drug issue.Navjot Kaur also took a swipe at the state government saying that those at the helm should have given ear to her husband’s advice on taking control of liquor trade and sand mining to mop up huge revenue for the exchequer. “The government can earn ₹30,000 crore yearly if it takes over the marketing of liquor and sand mining, instead of giving it to contractors for meagre sums. This amount could be used to create jobs and ensure better market price to farmers for their produce,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-build-jat-maha-sabha-teams-across-punjab-navjot-kaur-sidhu-101618689382849.html

Brar was killed outside a mall in Industrial Area, Chandigarh, in October 2020. Police said both the accused are wanted in a number of criminal cases in several states.

Meanwhile, the younger woman’s bed-ridden brother, aged 40, who was in a coma for the past seven years, also succumbed to the illness. The matter came to the fore after the neighbours went to enquire about elder woman’s wellbeing, who, a few days ago, had suffered injuries after she tumbled in the house. They found the mother-daughter duo lying unconscious, while the son was dead. They immediately rushed them to a hospital and informed the police. Sidhwan Bet SHO sub-inspector Bikramjit Singh said that the mother was declared dead in hospital. Before her death, her daughter told the police that they had consumed poison as they found it hard to make ends meet in absence of a permanent source of income. The SHO said as per the postmortem report, the son had died two days ago due to his illness, while both women died of poisoning. Police have started inquest proceedings. The SHO said the son had fallen off the roof seven years ago and was in a coma since. The family and their relatives had spent ₹18 lakh on his treatment but to no avail. Two years after the mishap, his father died a natural death. The family has a small chunk of agricultural land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/woman-mother-die-by-suicide-bed-ridden-brother-found-dead-too-near-ludhiana-101618689143572.html

18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Delight in a cupwing||Imagine a feathered ball weighing about two ‘tolas’ of gold, stalking moist montane undergrowth and flipping fallen leaves for insects with a deftness worthy of a gambler flicking cards at a casino. A bird reluctant to fly like a ‘bater’ (quail) and virtually tailless! That’s the scaly-breasted cupwing for you, a delightful avian of the Chakki Modh and Jangeshu hills of Solan district. The bird’s lure has spawned a desperate quip among birders of the tricity and from afar such as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata: “Hey, have you managed to spot the elusive cupwing?”The cupwing enjoys the reputation of abiding by the motto: discretion is certainly the better part of viewing valour, the kind of dictum that once veiled medieval princesses from public gaze. As it is a ground-dwelling avian, extreme timidity and the camouflage afforded by its dark warm brown plumage ensure better chances of surviving roving hawks and ground predators. It is the kind of creature that may well jump at its own shadow!Among those who managed to photograph the cupwing in a rare moment in the open and free of bushy clutter was Jatinder Vijh, a Chandigarh birder who possesses an exceptional eye for avian behaviour. “I did not see the cupwing initially but heard a faint rustle among fallen leaves. On cautious investigation, I spotted the cupwing. I observed that the cupwing preferred to trot up a moderate incline and then come down while foraging. It is a rare bird, whose presence is all the more difficult to detect because of its furtive habits. We could spot this beauty only after a tedious effort at scouring the area. But success again proved the premise: ‘If you seek the bird, the bird also seeks you.’ I would say the cupwing is one of the seven little wonders of our part of the birding world!” Vijh, a retired joint general manager from HMT, told this writer.The brave bullyThe digital domain is overflowing with images that capture the predatory actions of charismatic species such as tigers and falcons. But a formidable predator, which resembles a powerful, squatting sumo wrestler ready to lunge in ambush mode, dwells right under our upturned noses. This is the Indian bullfrog, among the largest found in the sub-continent and can sport a length of 160 mm! Most of us are either ignorant about the bullfrog’s power or treat it with disgust as a particularly repulsive, flabby, slimy and slothful creature.Bullfrogs are not wholly ‘ugly’. During monsoons, male bullfrogs sport blue balloons and their skin colour turns a vibrant yellow to attract females just as male purple sunbirds assume darkly iridescent hues and sport golden pectoral tufts in response to the warming moods of spring.The above is more an aside to the bullfrog’s gentler, loving instincts. Here is wildlife scientist SB Mishra documenting what it does for a daily living: “The bullfrog feeds on unusual prey, like invertebrates, small mammals, snakes and birds. Plant matter and several odd objects like human hair, cattle dung and grass are also recorded from its stomach.” Bullfrog tadpoles are even known to relish tadpoles of other species or cannibalise their own! In the Wildbuzz column, I have earlier on showcased the stories of a remarkable bullfrog predating on a Russell’s viper and of another pugnacious specimen which waged a 10-minute-long, blood-spewing struggle with a rat snake before managing to kick the snake in the face and escape from the jaws of death!Bullfrogs are among the 258 species of frogs found across the globe that predate on other frogs. A recent photo-documentation of a bullfrog’s predation attempt on a rice paddy frog in Bangladesh will further add to Wildbuzz readers’ awareness of this awesome predator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-delight-in-a-cupwing-101618687943029.html

Two students of the institute were found infected with the virus and have been taken to the Covid-19 facilities of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said Sreerup Raychaudhuri, the institute’s dean (administration). “Their close contacts have been isolated in our guesthouse. We have also repurposed some faculty and postdoctoral housing as isolation centres. We will take stock of the situation again on Sunday and decide the future course of action,” said Raychaudhuri. While theoretical classes are being held online, laboratory work is done on a rotational basis. With residential campuses across the country reporting high number of Covid-19 cases, institutes in Mumbai are on the edge. The Indian Institute of Technology –Bombay (IIT-B) last week clamped down activity on campus, following a surge in cases when nine cases were detected in 24 hours. However, cases among students have come down this week, said IIT-B deputy director S Sudarshan. “We have a whole hostel wing (of 160 rooms) dedicated for isolation of positive patients, but [there are] less than 20 active cases and a few suspected cases,” he said. In an official email to students last week, the IIT-B administration informed students that the night canteen was shut and mess facility moved out to a different location. For students to move out of a floor after a single positive case is found, they will have to take an RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test. There are around 3,000 students and 2,000 staff members on campus at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residential-campuses-on-edge-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101618687822153.html
18-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra, Centre trade barbs over oxygen supply, remdesivir||After a face-off over shortage of vaccine doses, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government locked horns again on Saturday, this time over inadequate supply of medical oxygen and anti-viral drug remdesivir.State minority affairs minister and NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said chief minister Thackeray tried to contact Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the phone to take up the shortage of oxygen and remdesivir but was told that the PM is on a Bengal tour. The Prime Minister’s Office refuted the allegations, saying that PM Modi himself reviewed the situation of oxygen supply on Friday and the Centre is in constant touch with state governments.“There are queues outside the crematoriums; hospitals are struggling to save the lives of patients as there is a shortage of oxygen supply. Yesterday patients had to be shifted from a few BMC-run hospitals in Mumbai due to oxygen shortage. The Centre has created this chaos-like situation. The chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) was trying to contact PM Modi on the phone but was informed that the Prime Minister is on a Bengal tour,” Malik told reporters.“Nero was playing flute when Rome was burning, a similar situation has been created today as people are dying and the Prime Minister is busy in elections…,” he said.Later in the day, Thackeray confirmed that he called the Prime Minister. “We are in dire need of oxygen as the cases have surged. Currently, oxygen produced in the state is diverted for medical use...I wasn’t able to speak to the Prime Minister on this issue yesterday evening as he was busy with the elections in West Bengal. But we are getting all the assistance from the Centre,” a statement from the chief minister’s office quoted Thackeray as saying.Malik alleged that the Centre has asked exporters not to give stock of remdesivir injections to Maharashtra, else they will have to face action. This is being done to create trouble for the state as it is being ruled by opposition parties Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, Malik claimed.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan spoke to the chief minister on phone and assured adequate and uninterrupted supply of oxygen, health care infrastructure and medicines. He shared the information on his Twitter handle.Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said Thackeray was playing petty politics and should take responsibility for his failure in handling the pandemic.“Saddened to see @OfficeOfUT’s gimmicks on oxygen. GoI, with all stakeholders, is ensuring maximum oxygen production in India...Maharashtra has so far received the highest quantity of Oxygen in India,” Goyal said in a series of tweets.Maharashtra is the worst affected state by the pandemic. It has so far seen 3,770,707 cases and 59,970 deaths. On Saturday, Maharashtra recorded 67,123 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-and-centre-trade-barbs-over-oxygen-supply-101618687762269.html
18-04-2021||Mumbai||BMC forced to move patients due to oxygen shortage||In a first in the Covid-19 pandemic, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had to move 168 Covid patients admitted to various civic-run hospitals across the suburbs, including Bandra, Jogeshwari and Borivali to jumbo centres on account of a shortage of oxygen. Put together, the 150 Covid-19 hospitals (private and government run) in Mumbai require 235 metric tones (mt) of oxygen. However, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the city has been facing a shortage since the past two days, as vendors are reportedly facing a shortage of raw material. “168 patients were safely shifted from Bhabha Hospital at Bandra, Bhabha Hospital at Kurla, Bhagwati Hospital at Borivali, Shatabdi Hospital at Govandi, M T Agarwal Hospital and Trauma Hospital at Jogeshwari as oxygen supply was affected at these hospitals, to jumbo centres,” the civic body said in a release on Saturday. Pednekar, who visited many civic hospitals on Saturday to review the oxygen shortage, said that oxygen capsule plants would be started at Shatabdi Hospital and Bhagwati Hospital. “The production of oxygen was low due to lack of supply of raw materials. I have asked the administration to set up a liquid oxygen plant to have a permanent solution to these issues. Also, the process of starting an oxygen capsule plant at Shatabdi Hospital and Bhagwati Hospital will be starting. We are trying to keep the citizens of Mumbai safe, and the citizens should cooperate with the municipal administration without leaving their homes,” she said. Medical-grade oxygen is used for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients and in other cases of respiratory diseases. The BMC said that while there was no shortage of beds, the problem was one of oxygen supply, and the issue will be resolved in the coming days, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner BMC said.“Despite there being issues in oxygen supply today, there is no shortage of beds. The oxygen supply issue will be resolved soon,” Kakani said. The city started reporting increase number of cases daily since February 10. From over 500 cases daily, the daily figure went up to above 5,000 by March-end to around 8,000 to 10,000 by the first week of April. On Saturday, 8811 new cases were reported in the city, taking the total up to 571018 cases of Covid. The high daily caseload of the second wave has caused a strain on the city’s health care infrastructure. Of the 20,279 beds in the city, around 80% (16,335) are currently occupied. Seen at a granular level, Intensive Care Unit beds and Oxygen beds are next to fully occupied: the occupancy rate is 98% for ICU beds and 88% for oxygen beds. Officials said that while oxygen beds may be available, several smaller private hospitals in the city did not have adequate supply of oxygen on Saturday. Meanwhile, the BMC in a statement on Saturday said, “Majority of private centres may not be able to conduct sessions tomorrow [Sunday] or may conduct for only half a day.” Officials said this was due to a shortage of vaccine doses. On Saturday, 50,725 citizens were vaccinated. Until Saturday, over 1.9 million citizens have been vaccinated in Mumbai since January 16. On Saturday too, vaccination at several centres was affected due to shortage of vaccine doses. Several private and government centres were not able to vaccinate citizens as stock fell short.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-forced-to-move-patients-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101618687642102.html

18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh achieving only 50% of its vaccination capacity||Even as the authorities claim to have created the capacity to vaccinate 10,000 persons a day against the coronavirus, the number of people receiving the dose remains between 4,000 and 5,000 (roughly 50%). UT adviser Manoj Parida said the number of doses administered in the city, when compared to its population, is a grave cause of concern for the administration. “There is no target. If we compare doses administered in other states and UTs with similar population as ours, the saturation is low. The Centre wants to speed up vaccination. We have enough doses for the next 10 days and people should come forward. The health department is looking into the reason for people’s reluctance. Effective strategies will be launched,” Parida added. Doses administered in Chandigarh, however, are highest in the tricity area. In Mohali and Panchkula, around 1.1 lakh doses each have been administered till April 16. In Chandigarh, 1.37 lakh doses have been administered. Whenever new groups are authorised to take the vaccine shot, the vaccination briefly picks up the pace, briefly, but the response loses steam within weeks.In the twelfth week of the vaccination drive that was launched on January 16, Chandigarh recorded a new high of administering the first dose to 20,828 people, its highest number. Overall, the drive started losing steam by March-end. A jump was witnessed again after the co-morbid condition was removed and everyone between 45-60 was made eligible to take the jab. After the new conditions, the number of people in this age group receiving the jab has seen an increase of 80% (from 4,164 persons in March to 29,140 persons in the first 15 days of April). For the group of senior citizens, the participation has dwindled. In March, 32,154 persons aged above 60 received the jab, which translates into 1,050 doses being administered per day. In the first 15 days of April, only 10,680 persons have received the jab for a daily average of 700 in the group. Frontline workers also laggardsThe vaccination for frontline workers is also a concern. Despite warnings from the administration, only 58% health workers have been vaccinated. In other categories of frontline workers, the coverage is 65%.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said there was these workers were hesitant and coverage in this segment was low as compared to other states. “We have tried to address their issues, but many among them are not ready. Among the other eligible groups, the response is tepid. Against the capacity of 10,000, only half is being used,” he added. “People enthusiastic about receiving the jab have come forward and got the doses. Now, people are waiting and watching for side-effects. We are reassuring people that the vaccine is safe and effective,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director UT health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-achieving-only-50-of-its-vaccination-capacity-101618687462754.html
18-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Assistant police inspector booked for raping colleague||An assistant police inspector (API) from Dongri police station was booked on Friday after a female colleague filed a complaint of rape against him.The 30-year-old woman police officer has alleged that API Sandip Peese, 32, had promised to marry her and raped her repeatedly from January 2014 to April 2021. She has also claimed that since she was from a lower caste, Peese’s mother Alka, 50, and his brother Sagar, 30, got him married elsewhere and assaulted her and her relatives when they went to talk to them.The complainant had joined the police force in 2013 and she was posted at Dongri police station after passing her exam. Peese was also posted there and as a temporary staying arrangement, the senior inspector had given them accommodation in police quarters where the woman stayed in one room and male officers including Peese stayed in the room opposite hers.A few days later, Peese began going close to her. However, when she objected, Peese proposed to her. She later agreed to marry him. The two then began meeting each other outside the police station. On January 1, 2014, Peese entered the victim’s room and raped her by promising to marry her after he was promoted. Peese then raped her repeatedly at several places. He also asked her to keep their affair a secret. “When the senior police inspector asked me about the affair, I did not say anything,” the complainant said.On April 2 this year, the woman learnt that Peese had taken holiday and gone to his village for his wedding. When she contacted him, he told her that his parents had tested positive Covid-19. The woman alleged that Peese’s mother and brother abused and assaulted her and her family members and got Peese married to another woman.“Peese had also blackmailed me by threatening to post objectionable photos on internet,” the officer said.On Friday, the victim approached Dogri police station and lodged a complaint against Peese on charges of rape, cheating, threatening, assaulting and also under relevant sections of the Atrocities Act.“We have registered a case against Peese, his mother and brother, and are investigating the case,” said another officer from Dongri police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-assistant-police-inspector-booked-for-raping-colleague-101618687402144.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Grassroots vaccine distribution needed||India and governments across the world are struggling to bring vaccines within reach of 7.67 billion people. Many countries are simply flummoxed by the overwhelming task. In cities, people can visit hospitals for jabs. However, in villages and slums, the vaccines will have to travel to the people. The challenge before developing countries such as India, with large rural populations, is distribution of vaccines to small towns, villages and slums. Of 6,64,369 villages in India, 35.5%, which is 2,36,004 villages, have a population less than 500. It will be an enormous undertaking, to bring vaccines to people in these areas due to lack of motorable roads.Companies are using grassroots distribution techniques to reach consumers in small towns and villages. Middlemen are not available for this ‘last mile distribution’. Companies have innovated techniques such as motorcycle brigades, retail foot soldiers, distribution and propaganda vans and distribution boats. These mass-distribution ideas can be deployed for vaccinations in small towns and villages.‘Covid-19 warrior motorcycle brigade’The ‘motorcycle brigade’ model comprises teams of youngsters visiting villages and slums to retail small packets of toothpaste and washing powder among other essential items. ‘Riders for health’ in Africa visit villages on motorcycles to distribute anti-malaria medicines. The health departments could launch ‘Covid-19 warriors motorcycle brigades.’ These would be health workers, with ice boxes carrying vaccines mounted on motorcycles, visiting villages to inoculate residents. Two health workers on a motorcycle could cover one or two villages daily and vaccinate 500 villagers.The visiting health workers should carry hand-held terminals to record names, ages and locations of the people they inoculate. Small printers, attached to the terminals, can print vaccination certificates. The ‘warriors motorcycle brigade’ programme should inform villages being visited in advance. Then, residents will be ready, at a central place like the village school, temple, mosque or church.‘Covid-19 foot-soldiers’A major challenge in developing countries is to vaccinate people in villages that have no motorable roads at all. Even motorcycles find it difficult to reach some villages due to rainfall and slush. We had initiated a scheme called ‘Mama-Mia distribution programme’, in our company, which translates to ‘hundred mamas distribution programme’. These were 100 housewives who collected a carton of toothpaste every morning and sold the tubes to villagers in their homes.The scheme can be relaunched as ‘Covid-19 foot soldiers’. Health workers could carry an ice-box of vaccines to villages, which are inaccessible by road and vaccinate the villagers. The execution of the programme will require resolving logistical issues such as sourcing the appropriate type and number of ice-boxes.Each team of two ‘Covid-19 foot soldiers’ should aim to cover at least one village with 300-500 vaccines per day. The foot soldiers should carry hand-held terminals and micro-printers to record their vaccinations.‘Distribution and propaganda’ vansTo accelerate vaccinations and create awareness about Covid-19, health authorities should use ‘distribution and propaganda’ vans. These are vans or autos, which undertake vaccinations and propaganda activities. Health authorities can deploy vans with freezers, to transport the vaccines to villages and slums. The workers can vaccinate from the vans.A propagandist distributes masks free to the assembled villagers. He makes announcements on how to avoid infections and videos can be used to demonstrate how to observe Covid-19 protocols. The van can cover two villages per day. If three hundred villagers congregate at every meeting, a van could vaccinate 600 villagers daily.‘Covid-19 warrior boats’Many interior villages are surrounded by backwaters or rivers and are inaccessible by roads. In Kerala , many villages can be accessed only through boats. The company I worked with deployed boats to sell soaps to village shops along the bank of different waterways, including the Amazon River in Peru, Colombia and Brazil. In water-bound regions, health departments can initiate ‘warrior boats’, which will carry medical staff, vaccines and masks. They will visit five to six villages per day, vaccinate and distribute masks. They can also organise demonstrations on Covid-19 protocols. A refrigerated mother ship could carry the vaccines and feed 10 to 15 smaller ‘warrior boats’ every night. Operation vaccine floodGlobally, around 230 vaccine candidates are being researched to fight Covid-19. Of these, ten vaccines are now being deployed. By the end of 2021, we could have 15 to 20 approved vaccines. India should launch ‘operation vaccine flood’, to ensure that by mid-2022 every person is be able to buy a vaccine of choice, from any pharmacist.( The writer, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, is a Mumbai-based management consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grassroots-vaccine-distribution-needed-101618687285725.html
18-04-2021||Other||Many staff of Prayagraj-based MLNMC microbiology lab down with Covid hampering RT-PCR testing||As many as 14 of the 30 trained employees of microbiology department of Motilal Nehru Medical College, where all of Sangam city’s RT-PCR tests of corona are being investigated, have tested positive leading to a backlog of samples, said an official of the department.The head of department, Dr Monica said, “We are somehow managing things with half of the trained staff and no one is ready to get trained because of the increasing numbers of cases. If we get a team only then we would be able to prepare them for investigation, but the problem is there are no volunteers to get trained.”One of the employee of the department without wanting to be named said: “Because of deficiency of ‘fit’ staff, there is the backlog of over 5,000 samples that have to be tested and the staff is under great stress but doing their best in the present challenge.” The official said because of the backlog, people have to wait for three to four days for their report which also pushes the treatment further. The situation is that people have themselves started to reach the microbiology lab, trying to find out their reports. Even more worrying is that if further lab workers become infected, the RTPCR investigation in the district will come to a standstill.“The district administration too has to consider taking the needed steps so that the backlog is cleared and the RTPCR investigation is not hampered by the dearth of staff. If the investigation of the collected samples is reduced instead of increase, then the situation will become worse,” the official said.The RTPCR tests in the department started on April 10 last year and since then it has not found a single researcher. Allahabad University and Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) both have a departments of microbiology where research work is going on. The number of tests can be increased by roping in researchers here in the lab of MLN College, he added.If researchers or the lab of these two institutions along with one private lab are involved, there would be less dependency on only one place for the investigation of RTPCR. This is need of the hour as the Union Health Ministry has passed the mandated that 70% RTPCR and 30% antigen test has to be done to prevent corona infection, the official added.The source suggested that King George Medical University, Lucknow, has set an example by preparing a large number of people to conduct RTPCR investigation here. In view of corona’s growing transition, administrative officials should seriously consider implementing the KGMU formula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/many-staff-of-prayagraj-based-mlnmc-microbiology-lab-down-with-covid-hampering-rt-pcr-testing-101618687284525.html

18-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges all set to upgrade tech for another online academic year||As rising Covid-19 cases have left the current examination process in for a relook, city colleges are preparing for the next academic year. While last year the virtual classroom system was forcefully thrown at the institutes, this time colleges are already busy preparing for the 2021-22 academic year, and the idea is to enhance the system which is already in place rather than make do with the routine.“Last year, our teachers were creating links for classes and sharing the same with students on WhatsApp. At least a couple of times it so happened that someone shared lewd content on the classroom screen while a lecture was on. We took the matter to the cybercrime cell, but we knew we needed a more fool-proof technology,” said Neha Jagtani, principal in-charge, RD National College, Bandra.After completing the last academic year on a free software, the college has now invested in Google classroom package which allots individual IDs to both teachers and students, and only those particular individuals can log in the class with that particular ID. “This way we will know exactly who has logged into the lecture and who tends to misbehave, if at all, in the future,” added Jagtani. Through the new software, only the teacher can now share screen, and this will automatically rule out chances of any miscreants joining the class henceforth, she added.In 2020, the University of Mumbai (MU), after fourth months of lockdown, on August 3 stated that the new academic year 2020-21 should begin from August 7. The circular, which was addressed to all affiliated colleges, stated that with the completion of admissions for all batches, except first-year undergraduate and postgraduate graduate courses, colleges should start virtual lectures for the new academic year until further notice.In a separate circular released on July 31, 2020, the university had clarified the admission rules as well. While all institutes were asked to finish admissions of their current students after promoting them, the varsity had clarified that no outside admissions will be allowed for batches other than first-year.Jai Hind College at Churchgate had invested in a software before virtual classes were a norm and managed to continue regular lectures on the same software once the MU circular was released. However, there were hiccups once more than 6,000 of their students and staff logged into the software at the same time, but the problems were ironed out soon enough.“Technology is so advanced now, we have started the process of upgrading our software to make it more fool-proof and avoid hacking in any way possible,” said Ashok Wadia, principal. He added that while their college was one of the handful of institutes that managed to train their teachers on how to conduct virtual classes last year, this year they have put together a platform exclusively for their teaching staff in order to ensure better team building among the staff.“Every day, teachers find new software and tools that enhance their teaching-learning methodology, and through this new platform, they can now share the same with other colleagues. The idea is to build a strong foundation and help everyone grow together,” added Wadia.Many colleges are also investing in better software to tackle online exams. From hiring third-party proctoring methodology to involving more teachers in the examination process, the idea is to make the examination process more stringent.Institutes have also started working on a different teaching module to help their teachers plan their lectures better and at the same time, also make learning more fun and interactive for students. “We teachers are currently attending virtual workshops organised by our institute to help us incorporate more technology in the virtual classroom. From using basic MS Office to introducing animated videos for science practical sessions, all is being taught to us and this gives us more confidence to tackle the next academic year,” said an assistant professor from a south Mumbai college.While colleges are currently busy planning and preparing for the next academic year, university officials too are brainstorming to make the upcoming academic year less stressful for colleges as well as students. “We are currently focusing on the examination and results process. In the meantime, a team is already charting out a plan for the next academic year, but the same cannot be shared until the government gives us a go ahead,” said a senior official from the varsity. He added that for the time being, the university is making plans assuming that the next academic year will also be conducted online only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-colleges-all-set-to-upgrade-tech-for-another-online-academic-year-101618687282664.html

18-04-2021||Chandigarh||10 people held for violating weekend curfew in Chandigarh||Ten people were arrested for violating the curfew orders as Chandigarh went into weekend lockdown on Saturday.Compliance remained high despite limited checking by police. However, the administration has said that the restrictions will be strictly enforced on Sunday.“Despite various activities allowed, such as interstate travel, we were quite successful in imposing the restrictions. We are thankful to city residents for their compliance and cooperation,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida, adding that police were directed not to impose strict restrictions on the first day. Parida said that on Sunday, when in general there is less movement, even better compliance is expected. “If violations are reported, police will be stricter,” he said.“We have registered 10 FIRs for curfew violation,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal. “The residents themselves stayed indoors. However, police control room vehicles will be making rounds of different areas at night to ensure strict compliance,” he said. Police also issued 12 challans for not wearing face masks, 52 for not adhering to social distancing and 22 for spitting in different areas of the city on Saturday. Fines worth ₹55,500 were collected from the violators.Meanwhile, as hospitals remained open, there was no impact seen on the Covid-19 vaccination drive or testing. While 4,052 people got vaccinated, around 3,000 underwent the test, nearly the same as the average daily figures. The Chandigarh administration had decided to impose weekend curfew on Friday amid a record spike in Covid-19 cases. As many as 481 people had tested positive on Friday in the biggest single-day spike.The curfew is to remain in force for 55 hours, from 10pm on Friday till 5am on Monday. Except for some exemptions, all public movement has been prohibited. Those specially issued a restricted movement curfew pass are also exempted. It can be availed on the official website of the administration: http://admser.chd.nic.in/dpc. Officials are also available on 0172-2700076 and 0172-2700341.Free movement within tricityAs there is no restriction on intercity movement, no nakas were set up at the entry points and people moving from or to Mohali and Panchkula were given free passage through the borders.While tourist spots and major commercial centres such as Sukhna Lake and Sector 17 wore a deserted look, there was considerable footfall at smaller markets, as people ventured out to get essentials despite only home delivery being allowed.“The border with Mohali is open and no vehicle is being stopped, which is so much relief. I had left early fearing checks by the police,” said Jasbir Singh, a resident of Kajheri who has a dairy shop in Phase 1, Mohali. Even domestic helps and other workers, such as gardeners, moving within the city or from Mohali villages to southern sectors of Chandigarh were not stopped. “ I had left home thinking that if cops stop me, I would return, but there was no checking,” said Bala, a domestic help staying in Sector 56. Kishore Mandal, a resident of Palsora who works as a gardener, said, “There are policemen at the junctions, but they are not stopping anyone. They are checking people who are not wearing masks.” “It is a tricity area, and when Panchkula and Mohali doesn’t have curfew, then it becomes difficult to enforce it fully in the city,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida, adding that the interstate traffic, particularly people coming from Panchkula and Mohali to attend their government offices, can’t be stopped.“Our focus is more on creating awareness so that people themselves accept the change,” said deputy superintendent of police Charanjit Singh. “People are adhering to the curfew order and are not moving out. Anyone going out for medication or buying essentials is not being stopped, but we are definitely checking those found loitering.” Traders still call it unnecessaryHowever, traders continued to call the weekend lockdown “unnecessary”. Chandigarh Beopar Mandal president Charanjiv Singh said: “The shopkeepers had complied with the administration’s instructions, but people were still seen coming to the markets.” Naresh Mahajan, president of the Sector 23 Market Welfare Association who runs a grocery store, said: “There was hardly any difference in the market on Saturday. Most people came to the market to shop for essentials and we only got a few calls for deliveries.” With restaurants allowed only home delivery, the hospitality industry did see a major dip in sales. “More than 50% of our weekly sales happen on the weekend. The small eateries will surely suffer, and we request the administration to support us during these testing times,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association.Meanwhile,a large number of people decided to stay home. Rajat Sharma, general secretary, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation, said streets in Sector 45, where he stays, remained empty. Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh chief spokesperson Pankaj Gupta said residents by and large followed the instructions. “However, we need to examine whether such a curfew is actually needed,” he said.Senior deputy mayor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said: “Most residents faced no difficulties during the lockdown. People should use this opportunity to get themselves vaccinated if they are eligible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-people-held-for-violating-weekend-curfew-in-chandigarh-101618686984044.html

Corona graph rising in western UP cities||After hitting bigger cities of the state, now the smaller cities of western Uttar Pradesh are getting overwhelmed with coronavirus cases. In all, 1802 people have tested positive for the virus in eight cities of the region while nine people succumbed during the treatment, as per the health department.However, the reports released by the health department shows a disparity in the number of deaths that are being witnessed. The register at Surajkund cremation ground in Meerut records the death of 24 corona patients between April 12 and April 16 while the health department registers only 10 Covid deaths, in the district, during these four days.The number of corona cases is drastically surging in cities of western Uttar Pradesh that has recorded 1802 fresh cases and 9 deaths in the past 24 hours. The maximum number of positive cases were reported from Meerut with 551 new cases and 2 deaths followed by 362 cases and 4 deaths in Muzaffarnagar, 192 cases and 1 death in Bulandshahr, 272 cases in Saharanpur, 168 in Bijnor, 123 cases and 1 death in Hapur, 60 cases and 1 death in Baghpat and 74 new Covid cases in Shamli district.The health department officials claim that appropriate arrangement has been made in the hospitals for treatment of corona patients and additional beds are being arranged to meet the demands with increasing positive cases. Health department officials said that the district has presently 1935 beds available with oxygen and 335 ICU beds are also available to treat critically ill patients.Dr Ambesh Pawar, the president of Meerut Nursing Homes Association which has 120 registered members claimed that district administration has so far hired services of eight private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “These are not exclusive Covid hospitals, but the separate arrangement has been made for treating Covid patients,” shared Dr Pawar and added that these hospitals all together have 150 to 200 beds available for treating Covid patients.During a meeting with hospital and nursing-home owners on Saturday, district magistrate K Balaji insisted on converting few hospitals into Covid hospitals. “We have motivated a few hospitals to convert themselves as Covid hospitals and hope that some private hospitals would willingly come forward to declare them as Covid hospitals,” said Dr Pawar.Presently, the district has a level 3 hospital for the treatment of Covid patients in LLRM Medical College. The Subharti and NCR Medical College are L2 hospitals. Four CHCs also have converted into L1 and L2 level hospitals to provide treatment to Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meerut-alarming-corona-graph-rising-in-western-up-cities-101618686682049.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s PGIMER running out of beds for Covid patients||Seeing a faster inflow of Covid-19 patients, the dedicated facility at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, has been stretched to its initial capacity with just nine beds of the total 253 remaining vacant on Saturday afternoon.The bed occupancy, which was around 66% just 10 days back, has now reached 96%, prompting the hospital authorities to consider opening new areas to accommodate patients.“The situation is worrisome as more patients who have moderate to severe illness are coming to the institute. The inflow is not only from Chandigarh but from other states as well. These patients come to the emergency, are tested positive for the virus and are shifted to the dedicated Covid-19 facility,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Currently, 94 patients are from Punjab, followed by 65 from Chandigarh, 46 from Haryana and 17 from Himachal Pradesh.“More than 50% of the patients in the dedicated facility are young, which was not the case earlier. The new strain is targeting the young population as they are more mobile. Though there are fewer fatalities in such cases, hospitalisation is needed,” said Dr GD Puri, head of the Covid-19 management committee at PGIMER.A senior doctor, on the condition of anonymity, said that around four patients lose the battle against the virus everyday at the PGIMER. While the institute has shut down routine healthcare services to dedicate more workforce to manage the pandemic, it is concerned about its impact.“We will add more beds as the need arises, but we have to make a proper balance with emergency services the hospitals offer to neighbouring states. We have the resources, but the demand at this time is also increasing. Each facility available should be utilised to its capacity,” said Dr Jagat Ram.Other hospitals better placedAlthough in other city hospitals the occupancy is relatively low, the health authorities have said that more dedicated beds are being earmarked keeping in view the surge.For instance, at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, the initial capacity, including ICU beds, is just 65 beds, of which 57 are occupied. “We are adding around 155 beds at GMCH-32 campus, out of which 23 will have ventilator support as patients with serious complications are being hospitalised now. Similarly, of 100 beds at the Sector 48 facility, 17 will have ventilator support,” said Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department, said: “Panjab University hostels, which were earmarked as Covid care centres, are being opened from Monday. We are also adding more beds with oxygen support at GMSH, Sector 16.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-pgimer-running-out-of-beds-for-covid-patients-101618686623638.html
18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: When the Chandigarh spring beckons||A few months ago, on my flight back to Chandigarh, I had a panoramic view of the tree-lined vistas of Chandigarh. The foliage was so dense that one could not identify much, except some landmarks such as the Secretariat and the Sukhna Lake.I was reminded of the view on the morning of Good Friday (April 2) when I was chauffeuring my son for a photography trip. As we scouted for vantage points to get the best frames, I was struck by the mesmerising views. We enlisted Google’s help to identify trees and I was taken back to my college days in the 1970s when as botany students we would go around the city looking for different trees and plants. Their common and botanical names used to be etched on small metal boards.From mid-March to the next four weeks, Chandigarh’s foliage is a riot of colours. The brilliant transformation of Chandigarh’s winter landscape to the vibrant hues of copper, yellow, purple, red and green happens gradually over three-four weeks in the backdrop of verdant evergreen trees. One can identify more shades of green than in a paint catalogue. An early morning drive on the city’s roads is a pleasurable treat as colourful flowers carpet the ground — in March it is the bright red bottle brush while in April it is the purple Jacaranda or beautiful pink and purple flowers of the Moulmein rosewood. In the afternoon, you can see different hues of green and brown shimmering in the sunlight. At dusk the view is radiant as the leaves and flowers seem to change colour. If there is a breeze, or if it rains the view becomes heavenly. If I were to pick one tree, I would choose the leaning yellow flower trees, the yellow trumpet or Tecona, on the Jan Marg as the most eye-catching.Is Chandigarh’s spring foliage fiesta any less than the famed New Jersey fall or Seattle fall colours? The best time to see the hues of the Seattle fall is the first two to three weeks of October while it is the last 10 days of October in New Jersey. Chandigarh’s spring bonanza seems to last first three weeks of April.My desire to know more about Chandigarh trees was rekindled when a nephew of mine visited us last week. An environmentalist, he was all praise for the founding fathers of the city as he explained that six mature trees offset one tonne of carbon dioxide. Despite having the highest per capita CO2 emission and per capita car ownership in the country, it is probably the lush tree cover of over 100 varieties that maintains the city’s beautiful character. It was interesting to know that of the 60 odd avenue trees in Chandigarh nearly half are from countries as far away as Brazil and Australia. The onus lies on us to preserve our city’s heritage.(The writer retired as a professor of gastroenterology from PGIMER, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-when-the-chandigarh-spring-beckons-101618686562770.html

After high drama for over four hours, UP Police reached the spot and farmers opened the blockade.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the produce of all registered farmers are being procured as per schedule but generation of gate passes was stopped for two days to speed up lifting operations.He said that the movement of tractor-trailers from UP was stopped for two days as it causes traffic jams on NH-44. He said that he has taken up the issue with Shamli district magistrate for arrangements of stay of famers coming from UP.Taking note of tardy lifting in mandis, the Karnal DC has issued strict instructions for action against transporters for delays and tardy lifting.The directions were issued after the DC visited mandis in district and he was not satisfied with lifting of procured wheat.“Tardy lifting causes glut-like situation in the mandis, forcing the government to put gate pass generation on hold for two days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-farmers-block-karnal-meerut-highway-over-non-procurement-of-wheat-in-haryana-101618686083774.html

They cannot ignore calls as there might be a patient in dire condition needing shifting to hospital.”To reduce burden on the helpline staff, the health department introduced two apps to monitor patients in home isolation and check availability of beds in hospitals.Dr Rai said, “But patients prefer to call the helpline numbers. On an average, 3-4 of them are shifted to hospital daily by one of our 62 field staff, as the situation worsens.”Deputy civil surgeon Dr Sanjeev Singla said there are different helpline numbers for the general public where queries on sampling, vaccination centres, availability of reports and drugs, etc are attended.Jhajjar principal medical officer Dr Sanjay Dahiya said they have increased helpline numbers.“There is burden of work on everyone and our helpline numbers are continuously ringing. We cannot predict the number of calls but our staff remains busy answering the queries,” he added.He said they are receiving calls about availability of ambulance, people complaining about having fever, cold and viral, and asking symptoms of Covid.HARYANA RECORDS 7,717 FRESH COVID CASESAnother high of 7,717 fresh coronavirus infections and 32 deaths were reported from Haryana on Saturday.

Several confidential documents of the Indian Army were recovered from him, the police said.Officials said the arrested man, Harpal Singh, was sending sensitive information pertaining to the Army and the BSF through WhatsApp and other encrypted text and voice messaging mobile applications since October last year to his handler based in Pakistan. Preliminary scanning of the mobile phone seized from him revealed that Singh shared hundreds of videos and photographs with his handler, identified by him as Jaspal, in the past six months. “Singh received several lakhs of rupees that were routed through hawala channels for sharing such sensitive information and funding the espionage operation,” said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav. He added the special cell has been working with central intelligence agencies to counter terror activities and ensure no secret information is passed on from India to other countries. During the process, the special cell’s south-western range team received inputs about Singh, a native of Punjab’s Tarn Taran, of having links with intelligence officers of foreign countries and also receiving funds from his handlers through illegal channels for leaking sensitive information having potential to compromise national security. Accordingly, a case under sections 3,4,5 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act and criminal conspiracy was registered on April 11, said the DCP. “The movement of Singh was monitored through surveillance mounted by our team and the military intelligence. We learnt that to mislead law enforcement agencies, Singh worked as a farm machinery operator and also used to do fencing work at the Indo-Pakistan border in Punjab. His job helped him find and create a way to transfer secret information and documents across the border,” said Yadav.On April 12, the team learnt that Singh was coming to Delhi to get some sensitive information from his sources. Accordingly, a team was deployed which caught him with some confidential documents from the Majnu ka Tilla area in north Delhi. During interrogation, it came to the fore that since Singh was born and brought up in a village in Punjab adjoining the Indo-Pak border, he was very well versed with details and locations of the Indian troops posted there. “Since he allegedly used to upload inflammatory posts against the Indian government on his social media account, one Jaspal, who is suspected to be based in Lahore, Pakistan, contacted him between June and July last year,” said a police officer associated with the case requesting anonymity.“Jaspal radicalised him and persuaded Singh to work for him. Later, Singh came to know that Jaspal was based in Pakistan and working for the country’s intelligence agency. He also got a chance to meet Jaspal during his visit to Oman,” the officer said.Yadav said Singh was being interrogated to ascertain the source from whom he was receiving confidential documents and other sensitive information about the Indian Army and the BSF. “Forensic analysis of his mobile phones is being done to unearth the entire network and conspiracy in this case. Identities and roles of other foreign nationals involved in the conspiracy are also being ascertained,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-man-held-for-leaking-sensitive-info-to-pak-agent-101618685603022.html

Vendors say they do not have any more,” said Dr GS Grewal, president, Delhi Medical Association.He said, “If hospitals were using 20 cylinders a day earlier, they are using at least 40 cylinders now.”Similarly, Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary of Delhi Voluntary Hospital’s forum (an association of hospitals), said he received messages from at least three hospitals on Saturday about severe oxygen shortages.Also Read | Everyone above 25 must be able to get vaccinated: Sonia at CWC“If a hospital was using 100 oxygen cylinders during the November peak, it is using over 250 now.

I have a small plant that can produce around 24 cylinders a day, which won’t last long with the high-flow oxygen that Covid-19 patients need. I will admit only as many patients as I can manage on that number,” said Dr Prem Agarwal, medical director, Sanjeevan hospital.The solution, he said, was to divert supply from industrial plants.Bhairav Shah, north India head for Inox Air products, one of the four main oxygen suppliers in Delhi, said, “We have already informed our industrial customers that we cannot supply them for now.

The crematorium in Ghazipur will be the first in Dehi to operate round the clock.The East civic body has at least five crematoriums in its jurisdiction. Mayor of east corporation Nirmal Jain said, “We have decided to run our Ghazipur cremation ground 24x7. We will also start two CNG furnaces at Karkardooma crematorium from Tuesday.

There are at least 23 active Covid-19 cases, including students and faculty members, on the IIT-D campus.IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao said that the institute has advised students to return in view of the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. “We have around 2,000 students on campus. As per the Delhi government rules, we cannot isolate students at the campus and we will have to shift them to quarantine centres. We are told that Delhi quarantine centres are all full at present. We are worried in case something goes wrong, there won’t be any place to shift them. We have just advised the students and nobody will be forced to return,” he said.Rao said “30 students have tested positive” on campus in the last month. “Everything is under control at the campus. The institute is following Covid-19 appropriate precautions,” he said.In an email sent to students and faculty members on Saturday, IIT-D deputy registrar and nodal officer for Covid-19, N Bhaskar, said that at least 15 students, six employees, and two family members of the employees recently tested positive for the infection on the campus. “All are requested to kindly take the necessary precautions and follow the guidelines strictly without any laxity, in the common interest of the safety of the campus community,” he said.Earlier on Friday, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) also advised students to leave for their homes.

18-04-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad says 2 Covid deaths in April, but bodies pile up at Hindon cremation ground||Officially, Ghaziabad has reported just two “Covid-related deaths” so far in April. Yet, on Saturday, when HT visited the Hindon cremation ground in the district, the facility was struggling to cope with the deluge of bodies reaching there. A person at the ground said nearly 60 bodies arrived on Friday, and at least 15 were meant for the electric crematorium, for cremation as per Covid protocols. The situation was no less grim on Saturday — the facility received about 38-40 more bodies, with about eight to 10 meant for the electric furnace.But with the electric crematorium, maintained by the Ghaziabad municipal corporation, going out of order on Friday night, several bodies had to be cremated on Friday on the footpath of the road leading from the ground to the post-mortem house. HT on Saturday spotted charred remains, with garlands placed over them, on the pavement located behind the ground.While the mismatch between the official figures and the situation on the ground is glaring, district officials insisted that only two people have died of the infection this month, while 104 have succumbed to the infection in the district so far.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad, said, “We have only two Covid-related deaths which have taken place in the district in the month of April. Our overall death count is 104 at present. We cannot say anymore.”When asked, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey redirected questions regarding fatalities to the CMO. None of the officials that this paper reached out to was ready to reveal any figures on Covid fatalities or reasons for the rush at the cremation ground.“The rush happened as the electric crematorium went out of order on Friday night and bodies kept coming in large numbers even on Saturday — we estimate around 60 were brought here on Friday and about 38 more on Saturday.The number is high, considering that we normally receive only about 10 to 12 bodies a day. About 18 bodies on Friday were to be incinerated in the electric furnace, as per Covid protocols. Another 8-10 came in for the electric furnace on Saturday,” said a person familiar with the matter at the Hindon cremation ground, asking not to be named.The ground has around 50 platforms for cremation of which nine are newly constructed by the municipal corporation, besides an electric furnace.“Since the electric crematorium was out of order, the 8-10 bodies meant for the furnace were cremated on the additional platforms on Saturday. Since the number of deaths has increased, the waiting time has also increased,” the person said.Ghaziabad municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said, “I have directed that the repair work on the electric crematorium be expedited. We have also appointed staff and a nodal officer to look after arrangements at the site and to ensure that all (Covid) protocols are followed.”For families, however, the pain of losing a loved one was compounded by the long wait to perform the last rites on Saturday.“I came to cremate my father who died of prolonged illness, and we were kept waiting for over one-and-a-half hours with the body,” said Amit Kumar, a resident of Vijay Nagar.Ajay Kumar, who lives in Pratap Vihar, said, “It took more than two hours to perform my mother’s last rites. Most of the families had to wait for a long time but none complained, fearing that it might not go down well with the management.”The official sources said the waiting time for cremations has increased because all bodies were being cremated as per Covid protocols at the Hindon cremation ground.“Several bodies also come from outside the district and the place has to be sanitised after every cremation. Further, platforms remain occupied for over a day so that families can return to pick up the ashes,” said an official from Ghaziabad district administration, asking not to be named.The official also had another reason for the long wait. “The nine new platforms are rectangular in shape and are located in a direction which is considered inauspicious for performing the last rites. Hence most families don’t prefer using them for their loved ones. The modifications will be taken up soon,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/only-two-covid-deaths-in-april-in-ghaziabad-but-rush-forces-hindon-cremation-ground-to-set-up-pyres-on-footpath-101618685422560.html

Such cases can then be addressed without going to hospitals that are already overburdened with more serious patients,” said a senior government official who attended the meeting the L-G and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had with all the DMs. For this purpose, the government and the district administration will provide the required oxygen cylinders or concentrators provided the RWAs and the doctors are ready to run the facilities and are volunteering. A few facilities are expected to start functioning on a pilot basis from Sunday. The decision to create small facilities came after a joint front of East Delhi Residents Welfare Associations (RWA) shot a letter to Kejriwal requesting the same. “Even if 10% of the exponentially increasing home-isolation cases require any medical help in an emergency, by way of oxygen, ICU beds, and ventilators, Govt has nothing to offer and it may lead to increased mortalities. In such a critical situation, can’t we have the Covid-19 oxygen centres in every locality, under every MLA, or under every councillor, to provide at least the life-saving breathing booster by way of providing oxygen to the patient in dire need…?” read the letter.Meanwhile, all districts have also started reaching out to RWAs in their areas. The south district administration wrote to all RWAs in its jurisdiction urging them to identify spaces that could be turned into mini Covid care centres. “In our constant efforts to tackle the surge of cases and as per directions of the chief minister, RWA representatives may please suggest places where Covid care centers can be set up for augmenting the capacity of oxygenated beds. The RWA may identify a place and invite doctors and nurses from the community. The district administration will provide PPE kits, oxygen supplies, medicines, oximeters while other details can be worked out. We are open to your suggestions. Please inform us if you would be willing for such a collaboration,” read the message from the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-l-g-asks-dms-to-open-oxygen-centres-in-every-locality-101618685421926.html

Chief Justice RS Jha has also tested positive for Covid-19, an official said adding that his condition is stable. Limited physical hearing of cases had started on February 8. A high court official said that the decision to suspend physical hearings was taken after a meeting between the high court administration and top law officers of both the states and the Centre, and executive members of the Bar association. Between March 2020 and February 8, the high court was hearing cases through virtual hearings and it resumed limited physical hearing in February on the Bar body’s demand. In another development, the high court has asked sessions judges in both the states and Chandigarh to assess prevailing local conditions, including the intensity of spread of covid-19 in their areas of jurisdiction, and accordingly decide at their own level on whether to hear cases through the physical or virtual mode. It emphasised that guidelines from the state governments and the Centre should be strictly followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcsuspends-physical-hearing-chief-justices-tests-positive-101618681942751.html

Devarshi Mandal, also a member of Prasad’s legal team, told PTI that they will move Special CBI court in Ranchi on Monday to seek his release.The former Bihar chief minister, who was undergoing treatment at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences for two years, was shifted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in January.Explaining the release procedure, Mandal said they have sent an application to Prasad for his signature, and will submit this to the CBI court here Monday along with the HC order. The CBI court will then send the order to Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi, where Prasad was housed before being moved to a hospital. The Birsa Munda jail authorities will send the relevant papers to Tihar jail in Delhi, who will manage the release process, Mandal said.Prasad has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession. He secured bail in two cases on the grounds of completion of half the sentence period, and moved a bail plea in the third case on similar grounds.The case is related to the fraudulent withdrawal of ₹3.76 crore from the Dumka treasury between December 1995 and January 1996. Prasad is facing trial in two more cases.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lalu-gets-bail-after-over-3-years-in-jail-101618678041422.html
18-04-2021||Pune||Class 10 exams unlikely to be cancelled: MSBSHSE chairman||After the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) cancelled the examination for Class 10 amid surging cases of Covid in the country, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Certificate (MSBSHSE) has clarified that Class 10 exams are not likely to be cancelled in the state. Officials at the state board said that unlike CBSE, it is not possible for MSBSHSE to cancel Class 10 exams. Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE said that as of now the exams are postponed but they will be conducted for sure at a later date. “Students of Maharashtra are at remote places and the number of students appearing for Class 10 exams is huge. In that case, it is unlikely to cancel the examination. Due to the increase of Covid cases right now, the final board exams are postponed. However, they are very unlikely to be cancelled,” said Patil. Last week, the Cambridge international board also decided to cancel the Class 10 and Class 12 exams and instead promote students on the basis of school assessment. Along with the CBSE, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) also said that Class 10 students have a choice and can opt to not appear for offline exams. For students who choose not to appear for the offline examination, a fair and unbiased criterion will be devised for evaluation, said the board in an official statement. Speaking about the Class 10 examination by the state board in Maharashtra, Avinash Takawale, principal, Poona Night High School and Junior College said that as major boards across the country are cancelling Class 10 exams, and Maharashtra should do it as well. “Firstly, it will be a very unfair decision for Class 10 state board students to appear for the exam when CBSE board students are not. The criterion for admission in Class 11 is merit. Students may not perform very well as in the last one year they don’t have the habit of writing for three hours. There are other reasons as well. For example, students in rural parts of Maharashtra have faced many challenges in online education. It will be unfair to them as well,” said Takawale. He further added that because of the postponed exams of Class 10, the results will be late and so will be the admission process for Class 11. “This time as well, students of Class 11 are struggling as they have got less time to finish their academic year due to late admissions. The situation will be more or less the same this time for Class 10 pass outs,” said Takawale. He added that the uncertainty around Covid is giving a lot of stress to students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-10-exams-unlikely-to-be-cancelled-msbshse-chairman-101618676841338.html
18-04-2021||Pune||Covid-19 testing protocols take a dive at Pune airport||While Pune city is under curfew and strict restrictions, the Pune airport where passengers are arriving from across the country has seen a dip in following strict testing protocols. Passengers have complained about not getting their test reports once they step out of the airport on time while others have claimed that passengers are not even asked for negative reports which are mandatory for people coming from Delhi and the most infected states. Currently, Lifenity Wellness is providing RT-PCR testing facilities at the Pune airport. Rahul Mhadekar the manager in charge of the Covid19 testing Kiosk at the airport said, “We get about 20-40 patients who need a test done either upon arrival or while departing. Not all states need the mandatory RT-PCR reports, but some do. We ensure to provide the report within 24 hours as most of them need it for professional reasons and before departing. However, most of the time we also see passengers who do not have a smartphone, or an email id or even technical knowledge to send the report in such cases the report gets delayed in reaching the passenger.” One such passenger, Jagat Kishor Prasad was awaiting his report for the samples he submitted at the Pune airport. Prasad said, “It has been days and I have still not received my RTPCR report. The customer care of the concerned laboratory is also not responding, and I am allowed to enter inside the airport without a ticket.” Passengers from Delhi need to have a negative RTPCR report or get themselves tested. A passenger who travelled via a Delhi flight on 14th April said, “I was one of the few passengers who disembarked the flight last. Some officials were asking for the negative report but after some time they left and around 20-30 passengers who were still awaiting their luggage and waiting near the conveyor left unchecked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fall-in-testing-protocols-at-pune-airport-some-pax-allowed-in-unchecked-101618676661349.html
18-04-2021||Pune||MSRTC buses to ply only with minimum of 10 passengers||Dinkar Mendhe, a construction worker from Sangli district faced a tough time to travel back to his village when he got to know that scheduled ST buses have been cancelled from the Swargate ST stand. According to the fresh directives, the MSRTC bus depots have been instructed to allow a bus to leave only if there are a minimum of 10 people on board. On the other hand, there is a huge rush of passengers at the Pune railway station to travel across the country. Since strict restrictions have been imposed on the state, many workers and labourers are returning back to their states from Pune. “It is difficult to survive here in Pune, my labour job at one of the construction sites stopped due to the new restrictions. I live with my family of four persons, and we have left with very few money. So, we have decided to return back to my village in Sangli district,” said Dinkar Mendhe. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) Pune division has cancelled all the scheduled bus operations from Pune. “Since there are fewer number of passengers traveling by ST buses, we have instructed all our depots to allow a bus to depart only when there are more than 10 passengers on a certain route,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune divisional controller. A contrary scene is being witnessed at the Pune railway station with passengers rushing back to their villagers across the country. “I am going back to Patna in Bihar, as the barber shop where I was working is closed. We are not able to do any work and earn now, so I am going back to my home. I will return back once things normalise in Pune.” said Ramratan Pandey, a barber. Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson said, “We have given additional special trains on various routes across the country. As there is a heavy rush of passengers going towards North India, several new special trains have been provided by the railways. In the last couple of weeks, there has been a considerable amount of increase in the number of daily passengers travelling through various trains starting from Pune.” Due to the fear of strict restrictions, several migrant workers who had returned back to Pune at construction sites have now again started going back to the villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-buses-to-only-depart-with-minimum-of-10-onboard-101618676541333.html
18-04-2021||Pune||Covid second wave: After Remdesivir, Pune city faces shortage of Tocilizumab||After Remdesivir, the city is now facing a shortage of Tocilizumab injections, an essential drug in the treatment of severe Covid-19 patients. This is the next drug to be given after Remdesivir which is used to treat patients with moderate symptoms while the latter works for those who need intensive care unit (ICU).For the past 15 days, the city hospitals have been facing a shortage of both drugs and are forced to look for alternatives. The drug is most costly and used for patients with severe symptoms. Unlike six doses of Remdesivir patients often need only one dose of Tocilizumab.Vitthal Sandbhor ( 60), has been hospitalised at the Baner, dedicated Covid hospital (DCH), and his family has been looking for Tocilizumab injections for the past three days, but to no avail. One of the patient’s relatives said that they tried to call relatives and friends in Mumbai to possibly send the drug to Pune, but could not get any injection and now the doctors await to begin the treatment.Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble hospitals, said, “There is a shortage of both, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, in the city for the past 15 days. We have alternatives, but sometimes we do not even get the alternative medicines. We need medicines to control the spread of the infection and to stabilize the vitals.”In the last two days, April 16 and 17, Pune district got 5,646 injections of Remdesivir when the demand has gone up to 8,209 for a day for patients.Dr Nitin Lohokare, who runs Mahesh Smruti hospital, said, “We are facing a shortage of the drug since the past 15 days and it has been found effective earlier too when used on a patient at the right time. In the absence of the drug we are presently using Inj Alzumab 1.6 mg /kg and it is equally effective, but it has high chances of an anaphylactic reaction. T Baricitinib can also be used which is now available in India.”However, the drug also comes with certain limitations. Dr Girish Date, senior consultant and intensivist at Sahyadri Hospitals, said, “One has to be vigilant for bacterial infection after use of Tocilizumab and hence as practice surveillance cultures are sent after 48 hours of administration of Tocilizumab to pick up any bacterial infection and act accordingly.”“The use and dosage of Tocilizumab depends on indicators including worsening hypoxia, increased required for ventilation and markers like D-dimer, IL 6 and ferritin. It must be noted that since Covid is relatively new there has been no proven study about the efficacy of these medicines which were primarily used as a treatment in other diseases,” he said.Pune Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have now stopped answering calls from relatives as the city does not have any available stock of the drug.SB Patil, FDA joint commissioner Pune division did not respond to the calls, but a senior official confirmed that there is zero stock available of Tocilizumab in the city.No evidence of Remdesivir drug’s effectiveness: WHOThe World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guideline development group (GDG) expert panel, which includes experts from around the world including four patients who have had Covid-19, concluded that Remdesivir has no meaningful effect on mortality or on other important outcomes for patients, such as the need for mechanical ventilation or time to clinical improvement. The panel acknowledged that the certainty of the evidence is low and said the evidence did not prove that Remdesivir has no benefit; rather, there is no evidence-based on currently available data that it does improve important patient outcomes.Maharashtra state task force explained that while Remedesivr is not a life-saving drug in Covid, it is helpful during the second to the ninth day of illness and not thereafter. It arrests the replication of the virus and therefore reduces the in-hospital stay and convalescence of the patient by one to two days.How does Tocilizumab work in Covid-19?As per the US department’s National Institute of Health, the use of Tocilizumab (single intravenous dose of 8 mg/kg of actual body weight, up to 800 mg) in combination with dexamethasone (6 mg daily for up to 10 days) in certain hospitalised patients who are exhibiting rapid respiratory decompensation due to Covid-19. The patients included in this population are, recently hospitalised patients who have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within the prior 24 hours and who require invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen (>0.4 FiO2/30 L/min of oxygen flow) (BIIa) or recently hospitalized patients (not in the ICU) with rapidly increasing oxygen needs who require Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and have significantly increased markers of inflammation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-second-wave-after-remdesivir-pune-city-faces-shortage-of-tocilizumab-101618674981226.html

We are working on redevelopment of the water bodies by deepening them wherever needed. Once the pipeline is laid, a valve will be set up so that these water bodies get water throughout the year, which will help in groundwater recharge and act as a source of water for wildlife in the region,” said Subhash Yadav, divisional forest officer and head of urban environment division, GMDA.He said that the area has eight to 10 water bodies and once the pipeline work is completed by June, around 3 million litres per day (MLD) of treated wastewater will be supplied to these water bodies.The project was proposed at the GMDA’s authority meeting conducted last week, which was headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The consolidated agenda of the eighth authority meeting states, “The water bodies will be utilised for filling the treated water from sewage treatment plant, Behrampur, as otherwise, this water is going to Najafgarh jheel. This project will be helpful in solving the problem of submergence of farmers’ land in Daultabad and nearby villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-fill-water-bodies-in-aravallis-with-treated-water-101618423912465.html
