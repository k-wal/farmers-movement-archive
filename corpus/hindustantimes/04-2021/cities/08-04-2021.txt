Government servants, police, hospital, fire, media houses, fuel stations, bank and insurance, power companies and grocers are among those exempted provided they carry a valid identification card, according to separate but similar orders from both districts. Those travelling to and from airports, railway stations and bus terminals too would be exempted if they produce their travel ticket.According to the Uttar Pradesh health department’s bulletin released on Thursday, 134 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar and 108 in Ghaziabad, the highest single-day spike this year for both districts. The total count in Gautam Budh Nagar was 26,821 with a death toll of 93. In Ghaziabad, the tally was 27,809 with 103 deaths.Educational institutes shutIn-person classes are barred in all government and private educational institutes, except medical, paramedical and nursing institutes, the orders read.“However, all examinations, including practical tests, shall be held as per schedule and are exempted from this order. There shall be an intensive enforcement of masks and other Covid-19 protocols in public places including the work places, by the police, incident commanders [zonal officer who will ensure containment measures] and departments concerned,” read the order from Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate (DM) Suhas L Y. Unlike Delhi, the districts will not be issuing e-passes to those who wished to be exempted from the curfew.“Staff from private companies involved in essential work (such as food delivery) will also be allowed to move during the night if they carry their authentic identification,” said Suhas. “Any violation of this night prohibition order will lead to action under section 188 (disobeying order) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.”In Ghaziabad, the district gave an extra hour of exemption to restaurants and its employees to take up sanitisation and cleaning. Their curfew will begin from 11 pm.“With restrictions in place, we hope that we can check the spread of infection,” said Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Prasad. Experts said the move will have a limited impact and that the focus should be on round-the-clock surveillance and containment measuresDr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), said, “The move will deter night life, parties, restaurants and even late-night functions. When people know that there are restrictions, they will automatically prefer not to move out. However, the officials should also consider early closure of markets. Further, they have started ascertaining containment zones, there should be restriction on movement of people. Otherwise, there will be no check on spread of infection.”“Instead of night restrictions, we have been repeating that authorities should focus on enforcement of covid protocol in markets, weekly markets and other public places besides the containment zones. Night restrictions will serve a limited purpose, but enforcement is must during daytime and will have a larger impact. Side by side, there is also a need to increase the vaccination coverage. But many private vaccination centres are already facing short supply of vaccine,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). On April 6, a bench at the Allahabad high court headed by its chief justice issued directions to the state government regarding Covid situation while hearing a public interest litigation.It said that the state government should examine viability to have night curfew to check late evening and high social gatherings; district administration and police authorities to ensure that there is 100% masking in every district of UP; no overcrowding takes place; adherence to all Covid protocols during the ongoing Panchayat elections and to check the viability of vaccination for one and all and not just citizens above the age of 45 years besides chalking out of a door to door vaccination program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/night-curfew-imposed-in-gb-nagar-and-ghaziabad-till-april-17-101617906588109.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Woman and four accomplices held for killing her husband for insurance money||A 35-year-old woman and three others were arrested and a 17-year-old boy was apprehended in connection with the murder of her husband, whose body was found in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar near Samaipur Badli in outer Delhi four days ago.The man was murdered allegedly for objecting to his wife’s relationship with another man (also arrested) and they wanted to allegedly claim the insurance money after his death, the police said on Thursday.Police said the entire murder plot was hatched by the woman and her 32-year-old male friend. The two hired three persons, including the minor boy, to execute the murder. The five had made two failed attempts to kill the man between March 30 and April 2, before they eventually killed him on the night of April 3 -- by covering his face with a cloth and smashing his head and face with stones at an isolated place in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Rajiv Ranjan Singh.DCP Singh said the body was found on April 4 and a murder case was registered at the Samaipur Badli police station. While carrying out a combing operation around the crime scene, the police on April 6 spotted a woman wandering about with a 15-year-old boy.“As her activities looked suspicious, the police team questioned her. She broke down and confessed to the crime. She disclosed that her friend, Mukesh Walia, was also with her but he fled after seeing the police,” said the DCP, adding that Walia was later arrested and his interrogation led to the apprehension of the other three suspects, two of whom were identified as Sachin and Vikas. The identity of the minor boy has been withheldDuring the interrogation, DCP Singh said it was revealed that all five persons worked in massage parlours and knew each other. Walia entered into a relationship with the woman and started living with her and her three children, when her husband was admitted to a rehabilitation centre for his alcoholism. When he returned home, he objected to his wife’s closeness with Walia and used to assault her as well.“It was because of that reason that the two planned to kill him and roped in the other three persons,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-and-four-accomplices-held-for-killing-her-husband-for-insurance-money-101617905508066.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||HC dismisses plea seeking court directions to control new Covid wave||The Delhi high court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea seeking directions to the Delhi government to initiate immediate measures for controlling and minimising the impact of the recent wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.On Thursday, Delhi reported 7,437 fresh Covid-19 cases and 24 deaths. The city currently has 23,181 cases and a positivity rate -- the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested -- of 4.57%.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said the government has been doing everything to control the impact of the viral infection and it was not inclined to entertain the plea.“Everything is being done by the government, from maintaining mask and social distancing guidelines, and people are getting vaccinated... The prayers stated herein are all general prayers, what else do you want the government to do?” the court said.The court said the prayers by petitioner lawyer Rakesh Malhotra are vague and gave him the liberty to file another application with specific prayers and suggestions.The application was filed in a disposed of petition which had sought to increase the Covid-19 testing capacity in the national capital and get speedy results. The court, while hearing that plea, had passed various orders on the management and containment of Covid-19 in Delhi and had also continuously monitored the pandemic situation. In his plea, Malhotra stated that courts have resumed in-person functioning from March 15 and jail inmates, who are brought to courts for cases, meet their relatives on the court premises and there is a likelihood of a Covid-19 spread, both within and outside the jail. He urged the court to direct that such inmates be asked to appear for hearings through video conferencing.He also said local markets, shopping malls, restaurants and cafes are seeing a huge rush and many visitors are not following social distancing norms now wearing masks properly. Malhotra sought appropriate directions from the court so that such carelessness may be avoided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-court-directions-to-control-new-covid-wave-101617905447505.html

Officials said the factory was vacant when the blaze started, and no lives were lost in the incident. However, three fire fighters sustained minor injuries. The fire also engulfed some portions of the third floor by the time it was controlled by nearly 100 fire fighters and 27 fire tenders.Officials of the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said the blaze began in a room that stored chemicals used to make adhesive tape, as police officers said they suspect that a short circuit may have led to the fire.DFS chief Atul Garg said their control room was informed about the blaze around 8.30am, after which 15 fire tenders were sent to the factory. Later, the fire department sent 12 more tenders to douse the blaze, he added.Occupants of neighbouring buildings were vacated as a precautionary measure. Even as the blaze was controlled around 2pm, cooling operations continued till the evening.

The NHAI had suspended work at the site following the incident and formed a four-member technical committee to launch a probe in the matter.The NHAI officials said that debris was removed after the expert team visited the site and inspected it in detail. The launcher used for installing concrete segments — that was damaged in the incident — will also be removed, said the officials, adding that the material for testing, which will be sent to a laboratory, will also be obtained once the debris is removed.Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said that the concrete segments at the site won’t be launched until the technical experts submit a report. “The removal of debris started on Wednesday, and it will be over soon,” Jambulkar said.According to the L&T officials, the incident took place when they were removing a slab between pillar 108 and 109 as it had developed a crack during stressing of the cables. The slabs collapsed during the process, and the real reasons will be revealed through a technical probe, they added.On March 29, the NHAI said that the officials of the contractor and design companies were suspended following the accident.The 29-kilometre Dwarka expressway is being developed in four phases, and it will connect Kherki Daula and Mahipalpur on National Highway 48, via Dwarka.

These roads were encroached upon by developers and a few locals who constructed shops there in violation of the rules.The GMDA officials said that a large enforcement team was deployed to clear the encroachments along with earth-moving machines that were used to demolish the permanent structures.Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, said that developers had constructed structures using tin sheets and permanent walls to encroach upon arterial roads dividing sectors 58 and 59. Likewise, encroachments were made upon arterial roads dividing sectors 59 or 60. “These encroachments were removed with the help of earth-moving machines, and the roads that were blocked were cleared. Some of the shopowners and developers submitted in written that they would remove their material and structures within 10 days. These people have been given time as our objective is not to cause loss, however, if the encroachments are not removed, then we will carry out the demolition drive,” Lot said.The enforcement team has also removed encroachments on a service road in Sector 63A, where labour huts, generators, and a site office were constructed by a developer. It was built illegally, and was obstructing a major road, said the officials. The GMDA officials said that all roads in developing sectors, that have been encroached, will be cleared, and action will be taken against the violators.“We are in the process of issuing notices to the violators in other sectors, and if they don’t clear the areas on their own, we will take action against them,” Lot added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/major-demolition-drive-carried-out-on-arterial-roads-dividing-gurugram-sectors-101617904188435.html

For other fire tenders from different parts of the city, it took them nearly 35-45 minutes as the conditions in the city’s oldest market once again proved to be a major hurdle for rescue and relief operations.The delay in reaching Sadar Bazar during a fire incident is not unfamiliar to the fire department in Gurugram. When a three-storey building was gutted in fire after firecrackers stored inside a godown caught fire in August 2016, the fire department officials took nearly an hour to reach the spot. The officials took over 30 minutes after a four-storey bakery caught fire in October 2015.Commenting on the fire incident on Wednesday evening, IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO), said the delay was due to the traffic jam in the evening. He attributed it to the vehicular congestion in Sadar Bazar and the panic situation in the market area. At least 25 fire tenders were dispatched to the location. The same reasons had been cited for the delay in the past two incidents.The fire department officials took over nine hours to douse the flames on Wednesday. They admitted that a swifter response could have limited the blaze.“When the first batch of fire tenders arrived at the spot, the blaze was limited to the top floor of each of the building, and it seemed that it could be controlled through quick response. But the time taken by the remaining fire tenders to reach the spot led to a massive delay in executing a comprehensive dousing operation,” said Kashyap, adding that despite the Gurugram traffic police cordoned off a 200-metre section of the Jail Road — between Harish Bakery and Sohna Chowk — and diverted vehicular traffic to alternatives routes till Thursday afternoon, the sheer vehicular congestion inside the market at Basai Road, and the panic situation resulted in further delay.“While the fire tenders got caught up in the peak evening traffic jam on Wednesday, we had to endure a further delay as there were a large number of vehicles parked inside the narrow lanes of the market. We had to find vehicle owners and get them to move them elsewhere as we could not access the site properly,” Kashyap added.The incident occurred when the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) was executing its second pedestrian trial at the market. In the first trial, the market was supposed to be completely vehicle-free , but on March 20 — the first day of the vehicle-free trial — the MCG faced heavy resistance from the shopkeepers as they wanted to allow entry of vehicles into the market, citing a business loss. The MCG ceded to the shopkeeper’s demands following deliberation.Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, said that the civic body is pushing for making the market vehicle-free following the fire incident. “The fire incident at the market highlights the importance of making Sadar Bazar a vehicle-free zone. Our utmost priority is to safeguard the residents, and we are trying to familiarise customers and shopkeepers with the need to stop bringing their vehicles into the market through the ongoing pedestrian trials and aiming to make it a permanent feature amid gradual changes,” said Singh.Jitender Kumar, joint commissioner, MCG, had stated last week that the civic body is contemplating to make the market a vehicle-free zone in its third trial. Kumar couldn’t be reached for a comment on Thursday.Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Traders Association, admitted that a lot of vehicles are parked inside the market, especially near the street where the blaze occurred. He said that the MCG needs to provide adequate parking measures before kick starting the vehicle-free trial. “The entire situation is a like double-edged sword. While we acknowledge that the streets at the market are too narrow for vehicular movement and it is a major obstacle in rescue and relief operations, unless the MCG provides adequate parking facility, a vehicle-free trial will remain redundant. Where will shopkeepers and customers park their vehicles without any proper parking facility,” said Gupta, adding that the MCG’s construction project of multi-level parking for Kaman Sarai and Sadar Bazar — both located in opposite ends of the market — is yet to start, despite a foundation stone being laid in November 2018.The MCG has faced litigation issues, land acquisition problems, and design challenges for the project over the last three years, and the project remains in a limbo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/narrow-lanes-delay-fire-response-as-sadar-bazar-fails-to-learn-its-lessons-101617904187801.html

No injuries were reported in the incident, fire department officials said. The fire was reported at 6.43 pm on Wednesday and 25 fire tenders and a 42-metre hydraulic ladder were used in the operation.“Initially, two fire tenders were sent to the spot from Bhim Nagar fire station and three more from the Sector 29 fire station. However, the extent of the blaze was extremely high and difficult to control. Subsequently, almost all fire tenders from the Gurugram fire department and tenders from DLF, Honda and Indian Air Force were used for dousing operations,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer.Kashyap said that the 42-metre hydraulic ladder of the Gurugram fire department was used for dousing the blaze on the fifth floor of the hardware store — where the extent of the blaze was the highest — to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby shops.“The blaze was controlled around 1 am and doused by 4 am on Thursday. However, due to the heavy presence of chemicals inside the hardware store, sparks continued sporadically, and tenders were used to douse the flames,” said Kashyap.He said that all items were removed from the plywood store to ensure there was no fire trapped below the surface. However, as they were unsure of the structural stability of the hardware store, items are yet to be removed from it.“We aren’t certain of the structural stability of the hardware store and did not want to take any chances. Hence, items have not been removed from the building so far. Smoke is still emitting from the building and we are working on various alternative measures to finalise the best way to proceed ahead,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said that 24 of the 25 fire tenders returned to their respective fire stations by 12.30 pm on Thursday, with one fire tender from Bhim Nagar station retained at the spot as a precautionary measure.“We were able to control the blaze at the right time, as the basement of the plywood store was filled with wooden items and if it was engulfed in flames, then the blaze could have continued till late Thursday afternoon and may have endangered the structural stability of the plywood store as well,” said Kashyap.Fire department officials said that the owners of the two stores blamed each other for the fire, and are yet to ascertain the cause of it. Both the stores did not have a no-objection certificate from the fire department, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sadar-bazar-fire-doused-after-nine-hours-101617904127255.html
08-04-2021||Gurugram||SMC plans to demolish 50 illegal farmhouses on Aravalli land in Raisina||The Sohna Municipal Council (SMC) has started formulating a strategy to demolish around 50 illegal farmhouses constructed on Aravalli land in Raisina, officials familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Sandeep Malik, executive officer, SMC, said, “We sent notices to the illegal farmhouse owners last month, and gave them seven days to respond. We are now going through the responses and formulating a strategy on how to start the demolition work. We are finalising the number of illegal properties to be demolished, which is likely to be close to 50 farmhouses.”“Any construction raised on a forest area, or an area otherwise covered by the notification dated 07.05.1992, without any permission of the competent authority (after the date of the said notification) has to be treated as illegal, and such a forest land has to be restored (sic),” the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ruled in October 2018, in the case of Soniya Ghosh v/s State of Haryana.After the judgment on June 6, 2020, the SMC had served show cause notices to more than 400 farmhouse owners in Aravalli Retreat on the grounds that they were constructed in violation of the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).Following instructions by the NGT, the deputy commissioner ordered on June 11, 2020, that the land use category of ‘gair mumkin farmhouse’ be struck from revenue records and replaced with ‘gair mumkin pahad’ — the original nomenclature. This move would have set the precedent for demolition of the properties, which was opposed by local residents, who moved the High Court. The High Court then ruled that their (farmhouse owners) side should also be heard. After the order by the High Court, the SMC sent show cause notices to farmhouse owners in March 2021. Around 150 illegal farmhouse owners were sent notices in March, and more notices are being sent to the remaining ones. Over 400 farmhouses have been constructed illegally in Aravalli land in Raisina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/smc-plans-to-demolish-50-illegal-farmhouses-on-aravalli-land-in-raisina-101617904067285.html

Dhiraj Kumar, the joint commissioner for Swachh Bharat Mission, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said, “An eight-member delegation from Telangana had visited the Bandhwari landfill site on Wednesday to learn about the biomining method followed by MCG to treat the legacy waste. The team is working to replicate a similar model for treating legacy waste in their state.” Kumar said that there was no official agreements or partnerships signed as the team was visiting to just understand the concept. “We follow a whole scientific process of biomining, where waste is separated into biodegradable waste, inert waste and then refuse-derived fuel. The delegation wants to replicate this process to treat waste in areas near Hyderabad,” Kumar said. The delegation also visited waste treatment plants in Delhi and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delegation-from-telangana-visits-bandhwari-to-learn-about-waste-treatment-101617904007809.html

A similar situation was witnessed on Thursday night as vehicles lined up for a kilometre by 10.30pmGurugram police officials said they received more than 60 distress calls at their control room from commuters who were stuck in a jam after 10 pm.Dinesh Kumar, who commutes to Gurugram from Delhi’s Uttam Nagar every day, said, “Only one lane was operational due to which only one vehicle could pass through the barricade at a time, resulting in a jam. The journey from Gurugram to Delhi has become exhausting.”Kumar called on the police to make arrangements for daily commuters and ensure their smooth passage.Although there were no restrictions on traffic movement on the expressway on Tuesday night, when the night curfew in Delhi was announced, barricades were placed on the Delhi side on Wednesday. Inspector Balbir Sjngh of Delhi Police said that on Wednesday 44 challans were issued for mask rule violations. More than 15 police personnel were seen checking vehicles and enquiring commuters’ reasons for entering Delhi. Only one vehicle was allowed to cross the barricade at a time, which, coupled with the entry of heavy vehicles, worsened the situation and led to the traffic pile-up.However, the situation on the other carriageway, leading from Delhi to Gurugram, was relatively better as the city, unlike Delhi and Uttar Pradesh’s NCR cities, does not have a curfew in place.Teams of the Gurugram police, however, continued to periodically check vehicles between 10 pm and 5 am.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, DLF, said that they have not received any communication from Delhi Police regarding the night curfew or restrictions on traffic movement. “We have deployed five police control room vans and 10 bikes at strategic points of the national highway to ensure smooth traffic flow on the main carriageway. We are only checking suspicious vehicles,” he said.A Delhi resident who works in the city said that the Delhi Police should either ask the companies to ensure they relieve their staff by 9 pm, so that they do not have to face inconvenience, or mark a designated lane for daily commuters. “It took 40 minutes to cross a one-kilometre stretch as heavy vehicles were also using the same lane, leading to snarls. Drivers of commercial vehicles were seen taking an extreme right to avoid paying toll tax, which was also a reason for the congestion, as the toll plaza staff was chasing and penalising them,” said Bikram Kapoor, who works in Udyog Vihar.The border routes connecting the neighbouring state of Rajasthan and districts of Rewari, Jhajjar and Nuh were not affected at night, said police.Goel said three police teams were deployed at Sirhaul toll on Thursday to regulate vehicular movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/checks-at-delhi-lead-to-traffic-pileup-101617904007232.html
08-04-2021||Gurugram||NGT directs authorities to pay compensation in Bandhwari landfill case||The principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), hearing a petition about legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill site on April 7, asked authorities concerned to pay compensation for restoration of the environment and continue biomining work at the site. The court directed the Haryana chief secretary to periodically monitor the work being carried out at the site.The order, released on Thursday, does not mention the compensation amount, but officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that it amounts to ₹148 crore, which will be used for remediation of legacy waste at Bandhwari. However, MCG officials said this is not a penalty and that it is to ensure sufficient funds for restoring the environment.The order stated that the compensation may be deposited in a separate account and used for the restoration of the environment. “Since the tribunal has already monitored the failures of the authorities for sufficiently long time, the state must now take ownership of its basic responsibility in the interest of rule of law, protection of environment and public health. The authorities may take further remedial action consistent with earlier orders of this tribunal,” the order read.According to Vinay Pratap Singh, the commissioner of MCG, who was present at the hearing on Wednesday, the NGT said that its previous orders in the case must be strictly complied with by the state government authorities, with better monitoring.“Considering the commitment and the progress done in the last one month, the NGT has ruled that work of biomining should continue and compensation of ₹148 crore, as assessed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), must be deposited in a separate account by the MCG, which can be used for environmental restoration. This is not a penalty, but a reservation for environmental restoration of Bandhwari landfill so that there is no dearth of funds,” said Singh.The green court was hearing a petition filed by environmentalist Vivek Kamboj, the founder of Delhi-based Hariyali Welfare Society, a non-governmental organisation.“Having regard to serious past failures and sensitivity of the issue, the chief secretary, Haryana, may personally monitor compliances periodically. As directed earlier, compensation in terms of orders of this tribunal dated 14.02.2020, 28.02.2020 and 14.12.2020 in OA 606/2018, compliance of Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and other environmental issues may be deposited in a separate account and used for restoration of the environment,” the order stated.The NGT also took cognisance of a report published in HT in the edition dated April 5, regarding waste allegedly being dumped in forest land by MCG, terming it “a way to reduce the waste in the landfill.”The MCG also submitted an action plan to the NGT on April 5 regarding the treatment of legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill. As per the action plan, the MCG has increased 90% waste processing capacity from the previous date of hearing (March 9), with the installation of eight additional trommel machines for the treatment of legacy waste. The MCG told the court it processed 57,521 metric tonnes of waste since the last hearing, stating, “239,493 metric tonnes of legacy waste has been scientifically treated through bioremediation and around 40% of volume reduction is achieved.”The MCG stated that as per a drone survey of the landfill conducted on April 3, “Current height of dumpsite is reduced from 40 metres to 36 metres… area of around 2.1 acres has been reclaimed.”The petitioner, however, expressed disappointment at the order.“If the government had been working efficiently, then we would not have had to knock the doors of the court. Money cannot compensate for the environmental loss suffered by that area. In the last hearing, the court had given firm instructions and it seemed like they would take strict action. What has happened that the court has now asked the state government to monitor the process?” said Kamboj.On March 9, the principal bench of the NGT, hearing the petition, gave authorities the last chance for ensuring “meaningful action on the ground level” to clear the waste.The Bandhwari landfill receives around 2,000 tonnes of waste every day from both Gurugram and Faridabad. Municipal solid waste from both these cities is being dumped at the site since 2015. As per a report by a report submitted to the NGT by the CPCB in September 2020, the height of the dumpsite increased to 36 metres from 27 metres (recorded by CPCB in February 2020) and the total waste dumped stood at 3.1 million tonnes, approximately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ngt-directs-authorities-to-pay-compensation-in-bandhwari-landfill-case-101617903948659.html
08-04-2021||Gurugram||Containment zones increased to 61, condominiums affected||The district administration on Thursday increased the number of containment zones in the city from 35 to 61, covering several gated communities and condominiums on the Golf Course Extension Road, Sohna Road, Southern Peripheral Road and adjoining areas, to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections, even as the city continued to record a spike in cases, with 741 infections reported on Thursday.Health department officials said that most of these condominiums fall under the jurisdiction of public health centres at Badshahpur, Palta, Bhangrola, Daultabad and Fazilpur. They said the situation is unlike last year when most cases were concentrated in urban villages and plotted colonies.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that opening of offices and factories, relaxation in holding social functions and laxity in observing Covid norms, such as wearing masks, are the primary reasons for the surge in the Covid-19 infections. “There has been a slight change in the pattern of the spread and more cases this year are being reported from condominiums. Due to rising cases, the localised spreads were identified. The district administration has accepted our recommendations and increased the containment zones to 61 from 35,” said Yadav.Yadav also said that the department has increased testing to 8,000 on Thursday, which is an increase of 3,000 from about 10 days ago. “The infected people and areas are being isolated and contained to stop the spread. We have also increased vaccination in different areas and extended to industries as well, to tackle the situation,” he said.As per the details shared by the health department, 10 containment zones were notified under the Badshahpur public health centre (PHC), all of which are located inside condominiums.Health officials said that instead of sealing entire towers, they have notified specific floors as containment zones. For instance, in Ireo Victory Valley, the department has notified 12 floors of a tower as a containment zone.Further, five containment zones notified under Bhangrola PHC and three notified under Fazilpur PHC also fall inside condominiums, officials said.Two containment zones were also notified in Tulip (one tower) and GPL Eden Heights societies, under the Palra PHC near Badshahpur.According to the health department data, containment zones were also notified in Rajiv Nagar East and West, and Sheetla Colony, under Rajiv Nagar and Bhondsi PHCs, due to a surge in cases in plotted areas. Three containment zones were notified under the Chanderlok PHC as well, as cases have been rapidly rising in the area, officials said.Meanwhile, Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, also held a review meeting with the nodal officers, during which he reiterated that all safety precautions to curb the spread of the virus must be enforced in markets and public spaces. Garg also said that around 300,000 people in the district were vaccinated till Thursday and efforts are being made to extend the vaccine outreach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/containment-zones-increased-to-61-condominiums-affected-101617903947849.html
08-04-2021||Gurugram||Daily spike of Covid-19 cases at highest of 2021 for second consecutive day||The number of Covid-19 infections continued to spike on Thursday, with the district reporting 741 new infections, marking the second consecutive day when the daily spike this year reached its highest. The positivity rate in the district is currently at 7.8%, as per the health department data.Officials of the district health department said they are working hard to reduce the positivity rate and are planning to start collecting samples and conduct vaccinations at metro stations and three large shopping malls in the coming days, in response to the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. The district administration on Thursday held a review meeting at the PWD guest house to discuss the Covid-19 situation, wherein officials decided to start sampling at public places, including metro stations and malls.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Session sites for vaccination will also be set up at the malls. The objective is to widen testing and vaccination. We have also asked authorities to enforce safeguards strictly.”The total number of cases in the district currently stands at 67,490, while the number of active cases is 4,455, of whom 4,160 are isolated at home.The health department on Thursday collected more than 8,000 samples for testing that included both RT-PCR and antigen tests. Officials said that they are expecting the cases to rise and, as such, are ready to meet the situation. “The city residents will have to follow the safeguards religiously, as the health department can only test, isolate and vaccinate. The onus to prevent the spread is on citizens, by following safety protocols,” said Yadav.As per the vaccination data shared by the department, over 16,000 persons got vaccinated at 154 session sites on Thursday, with around 300,000 people being vaccinated in the district so far.Health officials said that a positive development on the vaccination front is that number of jabs in private hospitals is also rising. “More than 40% of people eligible for vaccination have been covered and in coming days, numbers will increase,” said Yadav.The department also issued directions to private testing labs and hospitals to properly collect the credentials and mobile phone numbers from people being tested to ensure effective contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/daily-spike-of-covid-19-cases-at-highest-of-2021-for-second-consecutive-day-101617903947246.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Woman arrested for driving car that ran over elderly couple in Dwarka||A 28-year-old woman was arrested on Thursday for being behind the wheels of a car that allegedly mowed down an elderly couple in Dwarka four days ago, police said.The accused has been identified as Nupur Choudhary, they said. Earlier, her elder sister was arrested in connection with the incident who claimed that she was driving the car when the accident happened.Shanti Swaroop Arora (79) and his wife Anjula Arora (62) were run over by the car on Sunday evening, following which police arrested Deepakshi Choudhary (30), the elder sister of Nupur. She was apprehended on charges of rash driving and causing death by negligence.Shanti was a retired government official, while Anjula was a homemaker.However, police on Wednesday said the victims’ family had raised suspicion over who was actually driving the car.Police had said, “Deepakshi Choudhary accompanied the injured to Manipal hospital. She stated that she was driving the vehicle and committed the accident. She also produced her documents to the investigating officer. However, victim’s family raised doubts that her sister was driving the vehicle.”During investigation, it was found that Nupur, who works as a probationary officer in a public sector bank in Uttam Nagar, was driving the car at the time of the incident, a senior police officer said, adding that she has a learner's licence.“Both Nupur and Deepakshi have been arrested. Nupur has been arrested for committing the accident and Deepakshi for misleading the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.According to police, Deepakshi was trying to be protective in an attempt to prevent Nupur from getting booked in the case. Another possible reason could be that Deepakshi wanted to save Nupur as she is a government employee and a criminal case registered against her might have an impact on her job.However, there would be further clarity in due course of time.The incident occurred at Sector 11 on Sunday evening and CCTV footage of it went viral on social media.In the video, a Baleno car hits the couple and runs over them. A woman comes out of the car, goes to the rear side of the vehicle and later calls somebody after taking her mobile phone from the car. Police said they are checking the CCTV footage of the area and investigating the matter to ascertain the exact sequence of the incident. Further investigation in the case is in progress, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-arrested-for-driving-car-that-ran-over-elderly-couple-in-dwarka-101617902802175.html

08-04-2021||Ranchi||Reserve 10-25% beds for Covid-19 patients: Health dept to pvt hospitals||Concerned over sudden rise in Covid-19 cases, state health department has asked all private hospitals across Bihar to reserve 10-25% beds for treatment of infected patients, an official said on Thursday.State health secretary KK Soan wrote to all deputy commissioners (DC) of the state on Wednesday, asking them to ensure reservation of 10-25% normal and ICU beds of total capacity at private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.The secretary in the letter asked the DCs to hold meetings with private hospitals in their respective districts within 48 hours and inform the department about the progress.Jharkhand saw a sudden spike in cases of Covid-19. The number of cases doubled in a week. On April 1, state recorded 690 cases in a day, while on April 7 the case went up to 1312.An analysis of the daily bulletin of state health department shows that the state registered 6,707 cases in a week from April 1 to April 7 and as many as 38 people died of Covid-19 during the period.Of the total cases, about 50% cases have been reported from Ranchi. The district has registered 3,325 cases in first week of April and 17 people lost their lives.Health officials, however, claimed that the state’s recovery rate is higher than the national average, while fatality rate is much lower than the country’s rate. State’s recovery rate is 93.11%, while country recovery rate is 91.70%. Jharkhand’s fatality rate stands at 0.88%, while country rate is at 1.30%.Till now, 22 private hospitals have dedicated 806 beds for the Covid patients.As per the bed availability report of the Ranchi administration, the district has arranged a total of 2305 beds, of which 804 beds are occupied. However, major challenge for the administration is to arrange oxygen supported and ICU beds. There are 361 ICU beds available with the administration, while 200 are already occupied. Similarly, out of 566 available oxygen beds, 391 are already occupied.Jharkhand chapter president of Association of Healthcare Provider India (AHPI) Jogesh Gambhi said, “The private hospitals having oxygen supported and ICU facility have already reserved more than 10 per cent beds, while some of them reserved more than 25% beds as per government order.”He said, “The hospitals having less than 25 beds are not in a position to treat Covid patients as proper segregation is required.” Jharkhand has over 500 small and big private hospitals, of which, 70 are at Ranchi, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/reserve-10-25-beds-for-covid-19-patients-health-dept-to-pvt-hospitals-101617899627507.html

As a result, backlog of samples has been increasing with each passing day.SNMMCH principal Dr Shailendra Kumar on Thursday admitted that over 2000 samples are pending for the test. But the step has been initiated to clear all pending samples as soon as possible.Deputy commissioner (DC) and DDM chairman Umashankar Singh has ordered testing of all OPD patients of medical college and Central Hospital of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) in wake of new wave of the pandemic. Samples are being collected in large numbers per day.Per day, around 1000 samples also come from OPD . Since RT-PCR testing is done only at SNMMCH in the region, besides Dhanbad, samples of Giridih and Jamtara districts are also being tested at this lab.During first wave of Coronavirus , the district health department used to send samples for testing to Mahatma Gandhi Memorail Medical College Hospital (MGMMCH) in Jamshedpur and Kolkata lab for clearing backlog at SNMMCH.“We have 100 beds for treatment of Covid patients, including 30 at ICU, and almost all of them are currently occupied”, said Dr Shailendra kumar, principal, SNMMCH.However, Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme (IDSP) district officer Dr Rajkumar Singh said that there is no dearth of beds and district is prepared to cope up with the situation despite rising cases.“DDM has reopened dedicated Covid Care units, including Central Hospital (100 beds), East Railway Regional Training Centre Bhuli (200 beds), SNMMCH (100 beds), Nirsa Polytechnic ( 100 beds), Tata Steel Jamadova ( 25 beds) and SSLNT women’s hospital (only for pregnant Covid positive patient)”, said Dr Rajkumar Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dhanbad-medical-college-accelerates-testing-as-over-2k-samples-pending-101617899626724.html
08-04-2021||Patna||32 chickens, goats, ducks, rabbits done to death by raiders||Unidentified miscreants attacked a farmhouse located at Baikatpur-Tapasthan falling under Khusrupur police station of rural Patna and killed 12 goats, 32 chicken, eight ducks and six rabbits after taking the night guard hostage, police said on Thursday.According to police, Kashwatola-Baikatpur native Rajesh Sinha alias Raju owned the farmhouse where he had started keeping livestock after he returned from Mumbai with his family during the 2020 lockdown. Sinha, a landlord who owns 40 bighas of land in rural Patna, had also constructed a pond at the farmhouse for fish cultivation.On Wednesday night, four masked men barged into the farmhouse, held night guard Sunil Gope hostage at gun point and carried out the slaughter.On getting information, Sinha reached the farmhouse and found goats, chicken, ducks and rabbits dead. Veterinary officer Dr Sudhansu Kumar said, “Autopsy found the animals were strangled to death.”Sinha has lodged a police complaint. Fatuha subdivisional police officer Rajesh Kumar Manjhi said the reason could be either business rivalry or property dispute and an inquiry was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/32-chickens-goats-ducks-rabbits-done-to-death-by-raiders-101617899507394.html
08-04-2021||Patna||Panchayat polls set for delay, plans to run local bodies by administrators||Amid indications that panchayat polls could be delayed owing to technical hurdles being faced by the State Election Commission (SEC) in procuring multi-post EVMs, the state government has started working on a plan to appoint administrators to run rural local bodies after expiry of their five-year term in mid-June. The panchayati raj department has started making necessary legal provisions so that the three-tier panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), from gram panchayat level to district boards, could be taken over and run through administrators. The total number of top PRIs posts in Bihar is 8,659 while total number of posts in PRIs, including gram kutheries, stand at 2.58 lakh. In simple terms, it means the state government officers of different ranks, mainly those posted at the block and district level, would be given charge of rural local bodies and will discharge all responsibilities pertaining to development works and use of funds. “While there are no provisions in the Bihar Panchayat Act, 2006, to run the PRIs through administrators, certain provisions are there in the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007, for administrators to run urban local bodies. We are studying related laws and making necessary provisions so that the rural local bodies could be similarly run after expiry of their term in mid-June,” said additional chief secretary, panchayati raj department, Amrit Lal Meena. “There are chances that panchayat polls would be delayed,” he said.Asked who would be the administrators for the PRIs, Meena said the government would notify the designated officers soon. This will be the first time in the last 20 years since 2001 panchayat polls when administrators would run the PRIs. Admittedly, the impending delay in holding panchayat polls has come as a setback for the state government and the SEC, though preparations are afoot to hold the election at the earliest once the decks are cleared for procurement of multi-post EVMs. The Bihar government has already sanctioned over ₹300 crore for purchase of EVMs to hold panchayat polls, a first in the state. The delay in procurement of EVMs has been ostensibly caused because the Election Commission of India (ECI) has not given clearance to the ECIL (Electronic Corporation of India), Bengaluru, to provide 15,000 multi-post EVMs of M-3 model with SDMM module sought by the SEC, Bihar, despite communication between the two poll panels since last year, sources said. Aggrieved by ECI’s reluctant stance, the SEC in February moved the Patna High Court filing a writ seeking judicial remedy so that ECIL gets the ECI nod for providing EVMs. The case is being heard by the High Court. While SEC officials say there is no question of holding panchayat polls without EVMs, senior officials of the panchayati raj department said there was always an option of using ballot papers to conduct polls. “The SEC will have to take a decision on whether they want to hold polls through ballot papers or not,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/panchayat-polls-set-for-delay-plans-to-run-local-bodies-by-administrators-101617899387360.html
08-04-2021||Other||On the brink, Bihar hopes to get 8.9 lakh doses today||Bihar, which has achieved 17% first dose Covid-19 vaccination coverage against the target population of 10.41 crore (Census 2011), was forced to close down some session sites, refuse vaccines to many private session sites and go slow on the inoculation drive as it faced a shortage of vaccines. The Centre was airlifting 8.9 lakh doses of vaccines on Friday to tide over the crisis, said officials. Darbhanga civil surgeon Dr Sanjiva Kumar Sinha said, “We will have to stop the vaccination programme in the district on Friday due to shortage of vaccines. If we get the stock by Friday evening, we will resume the vaccination drive from Saturday.” The state’s second dose vaccination coverage against eligible beneficiaries was 14%, said officials. Sheohar led among the total 38 districts, achieving 25.4% first dose vaccination coverage, followed by Nalanda (23.6%) and Patna (23.3%). In terms of second dose vaccination coverage of eligible beneficiaries, Sheohar, however, achieved only 10.7%, Nalanda 11.8% and Patna 20.2% , said a health officer who did not wish to be identified. As cases of coronavirus rise, reporting a single-day high of 1,527 new infections on Wednesday that was six times the cases reported before Holi, Bihar has seen a sudden increase in the number of people opting to take the vaccine shot. The irony, however, was that most of the beneficiaries opted for walk-ins over pre-registration, keeping officials guessing about the number of vaccine vials to be allocated to a particular session site on a given day. This has led to heavy rush at some urban vaccination centres, leading to shortage of vaccines at some session sites. Private vaccination centres claimed they faced hardship in getting the vaccine on Thursday. “Officials at the Gardanibagh hospital initially refused us vaccines this morning, when 100 people had already queued up at our centre for vaccination. After much persuasion, we were allotted seven vials in two lots later in the afternoon against our daily requirement of 11-12 vials of Covishield, which suffices for 110 to 120 people. We have been advised not to hold back beneficiaries for vaccination tomorrow, as getting the vaccines is doubtful,” said Dr Amulya Kumar Singh, director of the Akshat Sewa Sadan in Patna. The Nestiva Hospital, another private vaccination session site at Yarpur locality in Patna, claimed it had not received any vaccine till 1pm on Thursday. The GS Neurosciences, another private vaccination session site in New Patliputra Colony of Patna, claimed to have received only two vials of Covishield in the morning, against its average daily requirement of 10 vials (1 vial of Covishield suffices for 10 people). The Murlidhar memorial health facility at Barh subdivision, a private session site, was advised to close down for Thursday and Friday, said district health officials. The state vaccine depot at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna had exhausted its stock of vaccines on Tuesday itself. Reserve stock of Covaxin, the other vaccine approved for inoculation against Covid-19, had depleted altogether at the state vaccine depot. The Patna civil surgeon office on Thursday alerted session sites, other than medical colleges, through a common WhatsApp group message that the vaccine was not allotted to any centre on Thursday and anyone who finds it in use should inform the office. “We were left with 8,380 doses of Covishield at the state vaccine depot that we allocated to the district vaccination store, Patna, on Tuesday. We are left with no vaccines at the state depot. This crisis has emerged for the first time since the vaccination drive began on January 16,” said an official requesting anonymity. Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, however, denied any vaccine shortage in the state. “The Centre will not give us 2 crore vaccines in bulk for the target population of 45 years and above. It keeps replenishing the stock from time to time and is committed to providing as many vaccine vials we need,” said Kumar. “We have sent our requirement on vaccines to the Centre, which supplies them from time to time based upon the utilisation that shows up on the CoWIN portal. We also follow up our vaccine requirement during our virtual meetings with the Centre,” said Manoj Kumar, “Bihar has so far received 46,55,650 doses of the vaccine since the Covid-19 vaccination drive began pan-India on January 16. We were left with 4,16,390 doses on Wednesday. We will get the next lot of 8.9 lakh doses of vaccines tomorrow (Friday),” he said.

08-04-2021||Delhi||Covid spike calls for debate: To be or not to be back on campus? Students, teachers opine||After more than a year of online classes, since most educational institutions were shut in March last year, the students of Delhi University have been constantly appealing to reopen the campus. But, the recent news of St Stephen’s College campus lockdown — after almost 13 students and two staff members reportedly tested Covid positive post an educational trip to Dalhousie — has put a question mark on whether the demand to reopen campus is justified at present. But, nothing seems to deter Delhi University students from insisting to reopen campuses for physical classes, although coronavirus cases in the Capital have begun to see a spike of late. ‘Can reopen colleges in a phased manner’Avantika Kanojia, a student of Sri Aurobindo College, says, “What happened with St Stephen’s students is unfortunate. But going for a trip is different from taking classes. They turned out to be positive after they went out, and not by being on campus... We will have to deal with coronavirus, but education is an integral part of our lives. We can definitely reopen colleges in a phased manner, classes can be done for say three days a week. Because it’s getting difficult for everyone to cope with online classes as there’s no proper study structure.”No exposure when in online modeThe digital petition to reopen campus, which has now seen 5,800 signups, states multiple reasons for the demand, including inability to find a good network connection in remote areas, or access to growth avenues provided in offline college. Deepender Sharma, a student of Kirori Mal College rues, “I’m in my first year here and haven’t interacted with my peers yet. I stay in Rewari where the network coverage isn’t great.. Kabhi kabhi toh messages tak nahi jate. Meetings start bhi nahi hoti, and when teachers ask for response then our voice disappears, which makes them think we are not attending the class. Students like me applied to DU for the exposure that one gets, and to be part of extra curricular activities – none of these are we getting in the online campus mode!” More Twitter campaigns plannedThe #ReOpenDU protestors had a recent Twitter campaign on April 6, wherein they urged students to voice their concerns and demanded the administration to chalk out a plan for reopening of DU. Students who were part of this protest say that their repeated demands for reopening campus have been persistent because the administration hasn’t responded to the concerns raised by the students. “Our motive is to ask the DU administration as to why are they not replying to the queries of students. Our emails don’t get responses, we don’t have access to libraries; in case the campus needs to remain closed then the issues we have with online classes, course material etc, needs to be resolved at the earliest,” says Tanuj Rattan Singh, a student of Dyal Singh College. Teachers feels safe to keep campuses closed, but not for long In view of the recent rise in cases in the Capital, DU administration on April 3 released a circular asking students to avoid physical presence on campus unless necessary. Sumit Nandan, an assistant professor at Hindu College feels that the university should remain closed for a while as a preventative measure. “University of Delhi is a microcosm of India. Thus, in the wake of the recent surge in the different parts of the country, it will be sagacious not to open the colleges for offline teaching for another few weeks. Although, I personally feel that online teaching and OBE don’t augur well for the education of the students. But the pandemic has put us in an unprecedented catch-22 situation; it’s like choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea!” Geetesh Nirban, professor, Kamala Nehru College, also believes that keeping educational institutions shut for long is affecting the psychological well-being of people. She opines, “It’s one of the toughest phases for students and professors as both communities are digitally fatigued and psychologically stressed due to virtual mode of functioning for a year now. With surge in cases, uncertainty regarding reopening looms again on DU but teaching and learning being a social process cannot go for eternity without human connects. With appropriate cautions, strict guidelines, we have to think of reopening selectively. The community in education sector need to start the campaign for intensive vaccination drive among all associated with education so that normalcy returns in this important sector too.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-spike-calls-for-debate-to-be-or-not-to-be-back-on-campus-students-teachers-opine-101617897417063.html

He said unit owner Mohd Yusuf had been arrested after registering an FIR under charges of putting human life into danger and causing death due to negligence at Bijnor city Kotwali. Mohd Yusuf told the police that he had license for cracker manufacturing, but further investigation was on over violation of the license norms and other aspects, he said. The SP said the deceased were identified Ved Pal, Chintu, Pradeep, Sonu and Brij Pal, all residents of Bakshiwala locality on the outskirts of Bijnor city. He said the investigation so far had revealed that the fire broke out due to leakage in containers filled with chemical used for cracker manufacturing. He said as many as nine workers were working at the time of the incident and they initially tried to douse the flames but failed due to lack of proper fire extinguishing equipment. He said the workers tried to escape when the flames spread all over the unit but were trapped inside and charred to death. Four workers saved themselves by jumping out of the open window of the house. He said the bodies were pulled out of the debris when fire tenders doused the flames after four hours and sent for post-mortem examination. He said a team of forensic and fire experts had been called to the spot to ascertain the exact cause behind the fire.

08-04-2021||Delhi||Savdhani hati, durghatna ghati: Five places we are letting our guard, mask down!||India crossed one lakh Covid-19 cases on a daily basis for the first time, and recently Delhi Police reportedly arrested four people and fined several restaurants, night clubs and hotels for flouting Covid safety guidelines, following a two-day special drive to crackdown on violators amid the rising coronavirus cases in the city. This brings us to think of places where we are letting our guard down knowingly or unknowingly, and becoming vulnerable to the virus, and in the process also getting challaned. Agree to disagree? Wait till the food arrives?At restaurants, many of us immediately take off our masks upon entering the eatery or as soon as we get seated. Blame the hunger mode, but in the eagerness to order and devour food, many of us often forget to wait for the food to arrive! “While dining out one will have to take off the mask, but it usually takes around 8 to 10 minutes for the first drink or food to arrive at the table,” says Pawan Soni, founder of a Gurugram-based foodie group. The fact that some people are getting challaned as they bring their mask down when waiting for the food to arrive, makes Soni opine, “If the government authorities feel that guests should continue wearing the mask for that a longer duration when at an eatery then this call should be taken basis a scientific research, before challans are issued to people. Also, the guidelines on occupancy percentage, which in my opinion should be kept around 60 to 70 per cent of the restaurant capacity, should be clearly spelt out by the same authorities. This will help restaurant to at least stay afloat and pay their employees. Night curfews in my opinion only cause fear and lead to rush at stores during day time.” Click Click! At the wedding, when everyone is so ecstatic to get that perfect picture, in the brief moment when many take off their masks to make themselves identifiable in those memorable clicks, it’s again a compromise with one’s health. Isn’t it? “At my sister’s wedding, there was only family and we were all wearing matching masks, but to get the perfect picture, we all eventually decided to take off our masks. Ye to sach hai ki jitne marzi designer mask pehen lo, kisi ki bhi photo achhi nahi aati mask mein. To ab shaadi ki photo to zindagi bhar yaad rahegi, usme bhi mask na utarein to kaise chalega,” questions a Delhi-based corporate professional on condition of anonymity. Trial room troublesTrying on apparels at a shopping store? How would one know whether it’s looking good unless the complete face is visible in the mirror. But, trial rooms are one infamous spots where most people inadvertently or inadvertently take off their masks. “The other day we went to a sports store to buy gym tights and tee, and while my BFF was busy trying a pair of shorts, I couldn’t help but try a top, too. And the moment I was trying it on, my mask came off. It was not my intention but it so happened. Sigh. I did sanitise my hands after that, but it’s so inconvenient to wear masks while trying clothes, and takes away all the fun of shopping at a physical space,” says Sonam Sethi, a Gurugram-based corporate professional.Train matters! At the metro station, waiting for your train to arrive? Challans are also being recorded in metro trains! “But sometimes I remove my mask while waiting for the metro train when on the platform since I have to change the metro lines quite a few times and it does feel exhausting when rushing between trains,” says Samar Khan, a Delhi-based artist, adding, “Whenever it looks safe and the platform isn’t too crowded, I tend to pull down my mask for a bit and breathe until I catch another train or see a hoard of people coming towards me.” The lure of green Because it’s an open air spot, and you are out to catch that much needed fresh air during morning walk or excercise a bit, do you too remove your mask? Yatin Wadhwa, a Delhi-based businessman, says, “I wear a mask before entering the park. And I pull it down when no one’s around. But I immediately pull up when crossing someone to be on the safer side. But one spots so many people walking without masks just because it’s open air, why, I wonder?” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/savdhani-hati-durghatna-ghati-five-places-we-are-letting-our-guard-mask-down-101617896151314.html

The party leaders and workers will light lamps at their party offices, homes and Ambedkar statues, announced the party on Thursday. “On the instruction of the party’s national president Akhilesh Yadav, the party will celebrate the day as Dalit Diwali across the state. In every district of the state and across the country, the party’s leaders and workers will light oil lamps at party offices, homes, public places and Ambedkar statues and pay homage to Ambedkar,” said the party’s state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary in a statement. “The lamp lighting would symbolise an attempt to dispel the darkness that engulfed the country under the BJP rule. Under the BJP rule, the Constitution is under threat. The Constitution given by Dr Ambedkar had dispelled the dark days,” said Chaudhary. Chaudhary in the statement said that there was no doubt that at every step, the BJP government had shown contempt of the Constitution. There was intolerance towards freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the spirit of social, economic, and political justice had been badly dented. The BJP government was working with the aim of political vendetta, he said.

Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said here on Thursday that the state had stock of 9.8 lakh doses. Each day, on an average about three lakh doses were being given to the beneficiaries and the state had adequate dose for three days. The state government had launched a focused vaccination drive after surge in Covid cases. The central government was likely to supply the Covid vaccine on Friday and Saturday, he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the state health and family welfare department to increase the vaccination cover by inoculating 5 lakh beneficiaries daily. Uttar Pradesh tops the country in Covid vaccination, surpassing Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, giving 5,01,599 Covid shots on April 5. The vaccination drive had been expedited in the urban and rural areas, Prasad said. When asked about the shortage of the vaccine in Varanasi, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, NOIDA and other districts, Prasad said adequate supply of the vaccine had been made to the districts. Rather than shortage, it was the question of management at vaccination centers. Some centres in various districts witnessed large rush of the beneficiaries since April 1 when the third phase vaccination for people above 45 years was launched, leading to shortage of the vaccine. The health department had set the target of 100 vaccinations in each session. Along with registration, the people had walk-in facility at all the vaccination centres. The cold chains had been directed to ensure regular supply to ensure that maximum number of the beneficiaries got vaccinated, he said. On Monday, 5 lakh beneficiaries got the shot , 4 lakh were inoculated on Tuesday, 2.50 lakh on Wednesday and 3 lakh would be given the shot on Thursday, he said. The state health and family welfare department had decided to organize special vaccination programme for the employees working in government and private offices from Friday. The employees above 45 years would be inoculated. In the first phase, the offices having 100 or more employees had been selected. The government employees would get the shot at government hospitals whereas the employees working in private offices would be inoculated at private hospitals, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-augment-inoculation-drive-up-asks-centre-for-more-vaccines-101617895847425.html

They said a police team will soon be sent to the Banda jail for this purpose. The Barabanki police have collected many photographs in which Ansari is seen using the same ambulance for his transportation from jail to different places, said an official. “Around four years ago, Ansari’s aides had badly beaten up a journalist of a renowned Hindi daily when he clicked photographs of the ambulance when his motorcade was passing through Hazratganj crossing in Lucknow. His aides had even snatched the journalist’s mobile phone and returned it later after the intervention of some senior police officers,” said the official. The matter of Ansari using the private ambulance for his transportation was highlighted by the media when he reached Mohali court in the same vehicle on April 1. The UP police registered an FIR, after it was found that this ambulance bearing a registration number of UP’s Barabanki was reportedly registered on the basis of a fake identity card of Mau resident Dr Alka Rai since December 2013. The FIR was initially lodged with the kotwali police of Barabanki on the complaint of Barabanki assistant road transport officer (ARTO) Pankaj Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barabanki-cops-to-quiz-mukhtar-in-ambulance-case-101617886306791.html

Education and transport will be made free for girls in Bengal. Anti-Romeo squads will be formed in Bengal to deal with those who loiter around girls schools," he said.Anti-Romeo sqauds were launched in Uttar Pradesh to ensure safety of women soon after Adityanath assumed power in 2017. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her party, the TMC have often referred to the Hathras gangrape case to mock at Adityanath government's policing for women and the law and order situation in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The top BJP leader criticised the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and derided it for failing to bring in any positive change in the ten years that it has been in power."Where is the paribartan (change) that Mamata Banerjee had promised ten years ago? he asked.When Trinamool Congress came to power in the state a decade ago it had promised to serve 'maa-maati-manush' (mother, motherland and people), which became its slogan."What happened to that slogan? I have come to ask Mamata Banerjee about it. Why is Bengal not a safe place for women? This soil had produced so many social reformers. What happened to the youth of the state who have become frustrated?" he asked.Adityanath claimed that Banerjee has no compassion for the youth, farmers and development. "But she has compassion for the TMC goons" .Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said it had been passed by Parliament and TMC had fanned violence against it in West Bengal.The violence that occurred in West Bengal due to the legislation of CAA in Parliament had been fanned by the TMC. In UP the government had recovered money from those who indulged in violence and damaged public property, he said."Here in Bengal, TMC is all for appeasement for the sake of vote bank. Mamata Banerjee supports cow slaughter. In UP cow slaughter is not allowed. If anybody is found to be involved in it, the person goes to jail", Adityanath said."TMC is not allowing central schemes to be implemented in West Bengal. Violence, anarchy and corruption have ruined the state", he added.Expressing confidence that the BJP will come to power in Bengal, the saffron party leader said after the election results are declared on May 2 The TMC goons will be sent to jail. There will be an end to hooliganism and rule of law will prevail".Adityanath also iterated the need for a 'double engine' government the government of the same party (BJP) at the Centre and the state for faster development of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/antiromeo-squads-in-bengal-if-bjp-is-voted-to-power-yogi-adityanath-101617886075088.html

At least 190 firearms licenses belonging to gangsters, their families and aides had been revoked during this period, they said. A senior home department official said not only dreaded gangsters like Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmed, but others with criminal antecedents were also hunted down by the police since the formation of the Yogi Adiyanath-led BJP government in UP. The last four years saw many criminal gangs in the state being dissolved as the police made strong chargesheets against them in courts. “For example, the court sentenced dreaded gangster Akash Jat to three and seven years’ imprisonment in two cases while his aide Amit Bhura got jail term for three years and one year in the same cases,” he emphasised. A senior police official said gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari was lodged in Banda Jail, while Atiq Ahmed was in Central Jail in Sabarmati, Gujarat and Brijesh Kumar Singh alias Arun Kumar Singh, was lodged in Varanasi Jail while gangster Om Prakash alias Babloo Srivastav was in Bareilly jail. Other dreaded criminals like Munir were lodged in Mandoli Jail, Delhi; Khan Mubarak in Hardoi Jail; Amit Kasana in a Delhi jail; Akash Jat in Ghaziabad Jail; Uddham Singh in Azamgarh Jail; Yogesh Bhadaur in Siddharthnagar Jail; Ajit alias Happu in Bareilly Jail, Sushil alias Moonch in Kanpur Jail and Sanjiv Maheshwari alias Jeeva in Lucknow Jail, he added. He said other gangsters on the list were Sundar Bhati alias Netaji lodged in Hamirpur jail of Kasna; Anil Dujana alias Anil Nagar in Gautam Buddh Nagar jail; Singhraj Bhati in Gorakhpur jail; Ankit Gurjar in Maharajganj jail; Subhash Singh Thakur in Fatehpur jail; Dhruv Kumar Singh alias Kuntu Singh in Ballia jail; Umesh Rai alias Gaura Rai in Rampur Jail; Tribhuvan Singh alias Pawan Kumar in Mirzapur Jail and three criminal brothers Mohammad Salim and Mohammed Sohrab and Mohammad Rustom were lodged in Fatehgarh and Kanpur jails. The official said the UP police seized immovable and illegal assets worth over ₹1,000 crore from the 25 arrested gangsters. The state government was also realizing expenses for demolition and evacuation of properties from the gangsters. The state government also tightened the noose around those running illegal slaughterhouses and demolished many such abattoirs. There was a crackdown on gangs involved in parking collection rackets, illegal fish trade, illegal coal business and land mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/25-dons-close-aides-put-behind-bars-in-4-years-101617884866204.html

08-04-2021||Patna||Patna HC to watch all NH projects in state to clear bumps||Taking a serious view of inordinate delays in land acquisition for major road projects in Bihar, the Patna High Court has started the monitoring all the national highways in the state to pass necessary orders for removal of hurdles in their completion. Taking suo motu cognizance of the matter, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, in the last week of March, ordered the court registry to register 40 writ cases so that the problems of each national highway could be taken up separately to speed up the process of land acquisition. “The authorities shall expedite the process for acquiring the land with respect to each one of the projects for which the amount stands sanctioned. What is disturbing and distressing is, as is evident from the NHAI (National Highway Authority of India) affidavit, that only 15% (approx.) of the amount stands released and the remaining amount is pending, inter alia, for want of passing of the awards as per law,” the court observed. The counsel for the NHAI, SD Sanjay, said the court would now monitor progress on a regular basis to ensure that hurdles in land acquisition were removed without delay. “The HC is already monitoring NH-83 (Patna-Gaya-Dobhi), NH-77 (Hajipur-Muzaffarpur), NH-2 (Varanasi-Aurangabad) and NH-80 (Munger-Mizachauki via Bhagalpur),” he said. The NHAI had submitted in tabular form the current status of all the 43 projects undertaken in the state before the court and it pointed to delays in most of the cases for one reason or the other, viz. land acquisition of over 3,700 hectares in various parts, finalization of tender or allotment of work, handing over possession of land etc. Land acquisition was, however, the biggest issue. As per the affidavit, during the Covid-19 pandemic in the financial year 2020-21, NHAI sanctioned ₹11,327.45 crore as payment for acquisition of land with respect to various projects undertaken in Bihar. The amount pertains only to the projects undertaken by the NHAI and not any other agency. However, ₹2,066.09 crore stands released and the remaining amount of Rs. 9261.36 crores is yet to be released due to delays in land acquisition. The bench said that it had, in several orders repeatedly, emphasized the need of setting up of places of public conveniences on the National Highways and also need for setting up of petrol pumps having such facilities. “The ministry of petroleum and the National Highway Authority of India have a workable plan for providing such facilities, which surely, when implemented in the State of Bihar, would not only boost its economy, but also generate employment so as to check migration of the residents of Bihar seeking employment outside the State. We cannot forget that all arterial roads to East/Northeast India passes through Bihar, which also has an international border,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hcto-watch-all-nh-projects-in-state-to-clear-bumps-101617884265087.html

Some people will go to court against these ministers and then they will have to quit," he claimed without naming anyone or elaborating further.Patil said there is a possibility that the allegations against Transport Minister Anil Parab may also be clubbed with the probe into charges against Anil Deshmukh."Maharashtra is a fit case for President's rule," the BJP leader said, adding his party was not making the demand.He said from what is going on in the state, experts should explain what else is needed to impose the President's rule."If you want to blame the Centre for everything, why not give the state administration to the central government?" be asked.Patil alleged that Anil Deshmukh was a "hypocrite" as he had moved the Supreme Court against the Bombay HC order for a CBI probe into the allegations against him."In the resignation letter, he (Deshmukh) says he is quitting to facilitate a free and fair probe, and the next day he moves the apex court against the probe," Patil said.The BJP leader said the MVA government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in Maharashtra defended Waze so aggressively during the state's budget session that the Assembly had to be adjourned nine times."Now you don't trust him," he added.Patil alleged that the MVA government was indulging in an "organised crime"."If the evidence comes out on paper, provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) will have to be invoked," he claimed.Talking to reporters in Nagpur, senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said the claims made by Waze in his letter are serious and there is a need for deliberation on it."The things that are coming out and happening are not good for the reputation of Maharashtra and the state police.

According to Article 243-E of the Constitution, an election to constitute a panchayat shall be completed before the expiry of its duration, which is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. The BJP-JJP government has come in for criticism for delaying the elections.

Also read: Opposition parties flay Punjab govt’s move to ban political gatheringsAAP MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and Dhindsa Junior confirmed the meeting. Both parties evinced interest in working together to take on the ruling Congress, Akalis and the BJP, but are still to work out alliance modalities. Parminder Dhindsa said they held talks with senior AAP leaders to form an alliance. “There was a discussion on the political scenario and consensus that the aim of both parties is similar. This was a preliminary meeting. We will discuss the details in subsequent meetings. The idea is to build a wider front of like-minded parties,” the Lehra MLA said, sounding optimistic about an alliance with the principal opposition party. However, Cheema said the talks with Dhindsa were positive, but these were not about an alliance between the two parties. “The AAP will not form an alliance with the SAD (Democratic). We will go it alone in the elections. There was a discussion about Dhindsas joining the AAP. Sukhdev Dhindsa ji was affirmative. You will see them joining the party soon,” he said. He said both the AAP and the SAD (Democratic) are working to save Punjab and will come together on a common platform to raise the voice of the people and hold the Congress government accountable. The father-son duo was among the important leaders of the Akali Dal, but rebelled against the Badals. They were expelled from the SAD in February 2020. Though the AAP is insisting on going it alone, the party had contested the 2017 state elections in alliance with the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), which was given five seats, of which it won two.

08-04-2021||Delhi||DU students amp up skills to seek sponsorships creatively in Covid times||Gone are the days when students of Delhi University approached potential sponsors, for various college and department fests, in a suited and booted avatar with documents in their hands to prove their credentials in the past. This is Gen Z, and they communicate with the world via the language of social media, which includes memes, reels and Insta stories! And when on a mission to get sponsorship for their department or college, nothing, not even Covid can stop them from coming up with innovative ideas to make the deal. Take for instance the fashionistas of the campus, who are doubly happy to star in reels asking for sponsorships as they have another chance of showing their #OOTD. “Asking for sponsorship while sitting at home isn’t easy. You have to quickly catch a brands attention and for that you have to be trend setting and different. This is why we chose to make reels and stand out from the usual way of requesting for sponsorships!” says Roshni Kapoor, president of Debonair, fashion society of Daulat Ram College, adding, “My teammates made a hilarious reel requesting for sponsorship for Promenade, the annual event of our fashion society. There were many bloopers and hilarious cuts while making it, and they all had fun.” And if you thought that the fun and games in offline campus is limited to lit sponsorship requests, check out the equally hilarious meme appeals from students approaching sponsors. “I’ve a meme page and been approached by so many societies of DU requesting for media partnerships. The trend of sponsorship is clearly changing. Everyone wants to be sponsored and partnered by fun pages that have relatable content and genuine traction. Some societies and departments are pretty creative, and they approach their media partner and sponsors with proposals in reel or meme format. This in fact attracts the target sponsor and media partner in a better way,” says Sahil Raj, admin of a meme page that has sponsored DU societies.Confirming the shift in creative meme and reel proposals for media partnerships, admin of a campus meme page, _dumemes, Vinit Mehta from Hansraj College, opines, “It’s a brilliant concept to ask for sponsorship via fun reels and memes. As a media partner and a meme page in charge, I would certainly be excited to see creative sponsorship proposals rather than the drab ones. I recently came across a reel of two students enacting an entire skit in North Campus and asking for potential sponsors to contact them. So with the shift in digital campus, where society presidents can’t possibly go out and visit offices of potential sponsors, it’s best to get creative with social media tools that are handy! And what can be more eye grabbing today than a viral reel?”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-students-amp-up-skills-to-seek-sponsorships-creatively-in-covid-times-101617872613754.html

Participating virtually in the national committee meeting, convened by the Prime Minister to finalise plans for the celebrations, the chief minister said, “We are all fortunate to celebrate this event in our lifetimes and I urge Modi ji to ensure that this historic event is commemorated not only at the national but also at the global level.” He said Guru Tegh Bahadur, also known as Hind Di Chadar, stands as a shining symbol of our country’s pluralistic tradition and secularism, and his supreme sacrifice, “Sis diya par sirr na diya”, forms an important part of India’s history. Also read: Important for new generation to know stages of Guru Tegh Bahadur’s life: PMInfra at Baba Bakala, 78 villages to be upgraded Briefing the Prime Minister on the memorandum sent to the Centre, Captain Amarinder said his government plans to recognise towns and villages associated with the life of the Guru in the state by upgrading their infrastructure. Besides Amritsar, the town of Sri Anandpur Sahib and Baba Bakala are significant in this regard. In addition, he said that there are 78 villages in the state graced by the Guru. The proposal sent by the state government includes projects for developing infrastructure in and around Sri Anandpur Sahib, Amritsar and Baba Bakala; rejuvenation of village ponds and traditional water bodies for water conservation in 78 Punjab villages that were visited by the Guru; and setting up Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur School of Textile Technology and Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Handicrafts at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, and Sathiala, Baba Bakala, respectively. May 1 event with Covid protocol in place The chief minister urged the Centre to release a stamp on the occasion besides commemorative events across the country and at all Indian missions abroad to carry the message of Guru Tegh Bahadur’s life. He said the main programme on May 1 is being finalised keeping in mind the Covid situation particularly in Punjab. The chief minister thanked Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for making elaborate plans for celebrations of this historic event across the country. “I’m grateful to you for giving such prominence to this event, as normally it is left to the state or communities to manage such celebrations,” he said, while appreciating Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s assurance of organising befitting celebrations in his state, too. Besides Modi and Shah, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge also participated in the virtual meeting.

08-04-2021||Pune||10 leopard cubs reunited with mothers in last 2 months in Pune||Three leopard cubs, less than 15 days old, were reunited with their mother early hours of Tuesday, after being found at a sugarcane field in Pune’s Junnar taluka last week. This is the second such case in the area since March 20, when two 45-day-old cubs, found in a sugarcane field in Junnar’s Ozar village, were reunited with their mother. A total of 10 cubs have been rescued and reunited with their mothers since February in the region.In all cases the cubs were found by farmers harvesting sugarcane crops between December and late March- early April. Officials said farmers in the area occasionally sighted leopards, especially around this time of the year, and alerted the forest office, who took help from Wildlife SOS, which runs a leopard rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar.“While harvesting their sugarcane crops, local farmers stumbled upon three tiny leopard cubs huddled together amidst the tall, dense fields in Vadgaon Sahani village... The cubs were brought to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Center for a brief medical examination. Identified as two males and one female, the cubs were estimated to be about fifteen-days-old,” Wildlife SOS said in a statement.Veterinarian Dr Nikhil Bangar, who examined the cubs for ticks and injuries, found them to be in good health. An initial attempt to reunite the lost cubs with their mother on the weekend remained unsuccessful. However, the cubs were placed in a box and left in the same field where they were found late Monday night.“After a long night of waiting, the mother leopard was seen slowly approaching the field at dawn. Relieved to be reunited with her cubs, the leopard quickly knocked over the box and took her precious babies away to a safer location,” said Dr Bangar. The operation was captured with a camera trap placed nearby.Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Harvest season in Maharashtra often coincides with leopard cub season, which puts both humans and these elusive wild cats in a rather sensitive and conflicting situation. We are grateful to the villagers who took the right step by informing the Forest Department.”Yogesh Ghodke, Range Forest Officer in charge of the area, explained that Junnar region has a significant leopard population, forced to seek refuge in tall, dense sugarcane fields due to the rapid loss of forest cover, leading to such encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/10-leopard-cubs-reunited-with-mothers-in-last-2-months-in-pune-101617862593575.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||‘New tactic to write from jail’: Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut on Sachin Vaze’s letter against Anil Parab||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday came out in support of Maharashtra’s transport minister Anil Parab, who has been accused in an extortion case by suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, and termed the claims a political conspiracy.“A new tactic has come to light wherein people who are in jail write letters. This is a political conspiracy. I know Anil Parab, he can never indulge in such work. I can assure, no Shiv Sainik can take a false oath in Bala Saheb Thackeray's name,” Sanjay Raut was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Shiv Sena leader was referring to Sachin Vaze’s four-page letter in which he has alleged that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and sitting transport minister Anil Parab asked him to collect money from businessmen and establishments, but he refused. Similar allegations were made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Anil Deshmukh who was accused of ordering Sachin Vaze to extort ₹100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. The case is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).On March 25, Sachin Vaze, who is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case, had requested the court to allow him to say something in connection with the extortion case. The court asked him to put his submission in writing. However, when he brought the letter on Wednesday, the court refused to accept it.Anil Parab has dismissed the allegations and called it a conspiracy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “In order to defame the Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray), it was necessary to vilify someone close to the Chief Minister and this is a part of agenda being pursued by the BJP,” he told reporters and added that he was ready for inquiry by any agency be it the NIA, RAW or anyone and that he would fight this case legally.“For the last two days, BJP workers were saying Anil Parab's name will surface and he'll have to resign. How did they know Sachin Waze will give a letter? It's clear that there's a plan of defaming Maharashtra Ministers,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Anil Parab said if he was found guilty, his chief Uddhav Thackeray would hang him to death.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and former home minister Anil Deshmukh could not reach out for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-tactic-to-write-from-jail-shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut-on-sachin-vaze-s-letter-against-anil-parab-101617861326617.html

08-04-2021||Education||Delhi: Scholars race against time to complete research work||Fareeha Iftikhar and Kainat Sarfarazhtreporters@hindustantimes.comNew DelhiEven as universities across the national capital switched to the online mode for classes and exams over the last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many institutions were hard-pressed to find a digital alternative for research work.In the last 12 months, MPhil and PhD scholars across universities were unable to conduct experiments in the university laboratories as they could not access library services, which is critical for completion of a thesis, or engage in field visits due to the lockdown.Although the University Grants Commission (UGC), in view of the pandemic, has provided a six-month extension to PhD scholars scheduled to submit their thesis in December last year and June this year, many students said that they might still not be able to complete their thesis work. Research scholars and postgraduate students of science and technology programmes started resuming their work in labs in phases after a nod from the UGC in November.Ishita Manna, a PhD scholar at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) whose soil samples were ruined due to the closure of the laboratory for over eight months, said that she will have to travel back to Beas Kund in Himachal Pradesh to collect new samples. The soil samples collected from different parts of the country were kept in the TL/OSL lab (thermoluminescence/optically stimulated luminescence), used by research students of the Centre for the Study of Regional Development (CSRD) at JNU. The samples were rendered useless due to a termite infestation in the building.“I have to go back to collect fresh samples in May or June whenever the weather is better, and the snow melts. I don’t know if I will get the exact sample again or not. I can’t even change my research subject at this stage. If I don’t get samples, I will have to write in my PhD thesis about whatever has happened. I can’t wait any longer and lose one year. I have to complete my PhD and find a job,” she said.The situation was worse for PhD students in far-flung areas with electricity and internet connectivity issues. Khalid Imtiyaz, a fourth-year PhD student at Jamia Millia Islamia whose area of research includes cancer cells, was planning to submit his thesis by the end of his fourth year itself. But he said it will have to wait now.“My scholarship was valid only till the fourth year, so I had planned to finish my work by then. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at my own expense. While researchers across the country and the world were unable to access their labs, students in Kashmir faced more challenges as our internet too wasn’t working. Downloading a single research paper often took around two days. As a result, we could not keep ourselves aware of the developments in our field of literature. Now that we have returned to universities, there is a huge backlog of work. I have not taken an off in the past three months,” he said.Social sciences scholars also felt the heat of the lockdown. A PhD scholar at the JNU’s School of Social Sciences, whose research topic is “population studies”, said, “We can’t even start writing the thesis without proper field work. I was supposed to complete my field work last year and my thesis work by 2022. But since my field work was not done last year due to the pandemic, I could not start anything else as well. The deadline for completing my PhD is 2022. I am extremely anxious.”Faculty members said as the labs remained inaccessible for several months it affected both equipment and research work. Moshahid Alam Rizvi, who teaches in the department of Biosciences at Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “While library resources were shared in digital format, many journals could only be accessed on university servers. Many researchers also lost their work because labs were shut for too long,” he said.A professor at DU’s chemistry department, who wished not to be named, said, “Many of our students who have to submit their thesis in June are still lagging behind. They are still unable to use the laboratories properly since some of our equipments has been damaged during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/delhi-scholars-race-against-time-to-complete-research-work-101617847195125.html

The conflict, ostensibly over fishing rights, is believed to be the flash point in a simmering dispute between two upper castes, Brahmins and Rajputs.Five persons, including a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, were killed by Jha and a group of 50 armed people at Mahmudpur village under Benipatti police station on March 29 in a fight over fishing rights in a local pond. The incident took place when people were celebrating Holi, when Jha and the group of men carrying firearms and traditional weapons like swords came near the house of one Ranvijay Singh and started firing indiscriminately. They also attacked people with swords, according to the first information report (FIR) filed by the family of the deceased.Police said the dominant Rajput community of the village controlled the pond, something that did not go down well with Jha and some Brahmins in the area.Kumar said: “On March 29, the group led by Pravin Jha opened fired on the family of Ranvijay Singh over an ongoing dispute over fishing from a pond between Mahmudpur and Gebipur villages. In the brutal attack, Ranvijay Singh and his cousin Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, Rana Pratap Singh (assistant sub-inspector in BSF), Amrendra Singh (inter-state cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh, succumbed to their injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently admitted to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.”Preliminary investigations by the police have revealed that the pond is owned by Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay Singh), but that another group from Gebipur wanted to capture it. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged against Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (close associate of Pravin Jha) after the two groups clashed over the fishing rights. They filed cases against each other. Sanjay is currently in jail for cases under the SC, ST Atrocities Act as Safi belong to the Scheduled Caste community.Kumar said a case has been registered against 35 persons, including 18 Brahmins and 13 Rajputs, and dozens of unidentified accused. “So far, 14 accused have been arrested and sent to jail while one prime accused Navin Jha is still absconding,” he said.The incident has brought to fore the rivalry between the upper castes in Bihar. The state had witnessed more than six dozen caste-related massacres in 1990s but most of them were confined to central Bihar.There are scores of private armies raised by upper castes such as Rajputs and Bhumihars in Bihar — Ranvir Sena, Lorik Sena, Bhumi Sena, Kisan Sangh and others. The Ravan Sena of Benippati was raised in 2018 and is only the second militia of the Brahmin community; it used to operate largely in Madhubani. “Of late, it has become active on social media in some pockets of Gopalganj as well,” said a police officer on conditions of anonymity. Villagers said that Jha, who sported a big moustache, preferred the name Ravan.The other Brahmin sena, the Parshuram Sena, formed by dreaded gangster Santosh Jha, who broke away from CPI (Maoist) in early 2000, is believed to largely focus on extorting money from road projects. It has allegedly killed over a dozen engineers and supervisors in the last one decade. Santosh Jha, a sharpshooter, was serving a life term for the murder of two engineers and was being tried in about 20 criminal cases when he was shot dead on the premises of a lower court in Sitamarhi on August 28, 2018.According to his Facebook profile, Ravan was preparing to contest panchayat election and had already declared himself as Mukhiya or headman. Police officials in Darbhanga range said that the Ravan Sena chief was a former district president of Bajrang Dal. “After he floated Ravan Sena, it started playing an active role in local politics,” they added. The Bajrang Dal is the youth wing of the Viswhwa Hindu Parishad and affiliated to the RSS, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Bajrang Dal district convener Aditya Kumar denied that anybody by the name of Pravin Jha was associated with the Dal. “He took part in 2017 Ramnavmi procession as a commoner. It is just possible that he might be using the name of Bajrang Dal to establish supremacy in the area,” said Kumar.A legislator of the ruling Janata Dal (United), Sanjay Singh,who visited the village after the killing as a member of the party’s fact-finding team, described Jha as a “ruffian, who indulged in extortion”.Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said only two cases were lodged against Jha in the district. “We are interrogating him for more details about him and his aides.”Rival parties alleged that Jha was also into bootlegging in the state where there is prohibition. “The locals informed us that he is also involved in illegal trade of liquor,” said RJD MLA Chetan Anand. However, the police said that no case related to this has been lodged against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/caste-clash-between-brahmin-and-rajput-groups-over-control-of-pond-leaves-5-dead-101617839610420.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Funeral homes ready for rise in Covid-19 toll: MCDs||Ashish Mishraashish.mishra2@htlive.comNew Delhi Taking note of the steep rise in Covid-19 cases, and apprehending a similar rise in related fatalities, Delhi’s three civic bodies on Wednesday said they are prepared to deal with any potential increase in deaths.Authorities of the north, east and south civic bodies said they have resources to handle 450-500 Covid-19 fatalities (confirmed and suspected) every day across their 21 facilities — crematoriums and burial grounds.According to the daily health bulletin, the city recorded 5,506 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday and 20 deaths. The city recorded the highest single-day deaths on November 18 last year during the third wave of the infection in the city, when 131 people succumbed to the disease. As new infections and deaths peaked during the third wave, crematoriums struggled to cope with the increased fatalities. There were reports of people waiting outside crematoriums and cemeteries for five to six hours to conduct last rites. The Delhi high court, too, had asked the government to indicate steps it had taken to manage crematoriums and graveyards in the national capital.Covid-19 deaths have increased sharply in the national capital over the past few weeks, since the outbreak of the fourth wave.In the first week of March, the Capital recorded less than two daily deaths of the infection. This number jumped to 15 in the first week of April, giving rise to fears that the city’s crematoriums may struggle to meet demands, if the spike continues.“Seeing the current steep rise in Covid-19 cases, we cannot help but be apprehensive about the possibility of the death toll rising too. So, we have made standby arrangements. At Nigambodh Ghat, we have opened three more CNG furnaces. We have also added 16 cremation platforms,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North corporation, said.He said their crematoriums and graveyards can perform nearly 200 last rites a day.Data from the three civic bodies showed that there are 21 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (confirmed and suspected) are being cremated or buried.Of these, eight facilities are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, eight under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).“We have eight facilities, including crematoriums and burial grounds, where Covid-19 bodies are disposed of. These facilities can handle 215 bodies per day. We have also made additional arrangements to perform last rites of Covid-19 victims,” Narendra Chawla, leader of the house, SDMC, said.He said that a new CNG crematorium, with two furnaces, was inaugurated in Green Park in February, and the facility can be converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility if required.Sandeep Kapoor, former chairman standing committee, EDMC, said the civic body has dedicated five crematoriums and graveyards for Covid-19 victims and added that there is no rush at any of the facilities so far.“We will increase the number of wood pyres if need be. We have also ample space available in graveyards and, so far, there is no cause to worry,” Kapoor said.Experts, however, say the city is better prepared this time around to keep the Covid fatalities low.“We still cannot be sure whether the disease is less severe this time around. However, the case fatality ratio is definitely lower now as compared to the first wave of cases (last March-April). This is because the hospitals were not well equipped back then; there was a shortage of PPE kits, beds, non-invasive and invasive ventilators.“The treatment protocol had also not been finalised — now we know what to do at what stage of the disease. Also, people have become more aware. They are coming to the hospitals on time,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology, AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/funeral-homes-ready-for-rise-in-covid-19-toll-mcds-101617826614625.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Opposition parties flay Punjab govt’s move to ban political gatherings||The Opposition parties on Wednesday slammed the Punjab government over its decision to ban all political gatherings till April 30. The Shiromani Akali Dal said the decision to ban all political gatherings was a direct fallout of the “resounding success” of its ‘Punjab Mangda Jawab’ rallies, adding that the Congress government had resorted to this step to prevent the “public anger from boiling over”. In a statement, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema claimed the SAD rallies had been exposing chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s alleged false promises made to the people before last polls. “This has upset the plans of Prashant Kishore who has given the suggestion to ban public rallies to contain the damage being cause to the Congress,” said Cheema. The Aaa Aadmi Party said the ban on political rallies is an attempt by the Congress government to derail the farmers’ agitation at the behest of the Centre. “When cases were at a peak last year, the CM was taking out tractor rallies with party leader Rahul Gandhi in Punjab. Now the opposition is getting tremendous public response and the Congress is losing ground, so he has announced a ban on political rallies,” said leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/opposition-parties-flay-punjab-govt-s-move-to-ban-political-gatherings-101617828153266.html

The work to remove debris continued for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. “No labourer was found trapped in the debris. But we are still taking due precaution while removing the rubble,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/one-more-worker-dies-in-ludhiana-factory-roof-collapse-owner-sent-to-police-remand-101617826950492.html

08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Three Punjab ministers to meet Piyush Goyal over procurement, DBT standoff today||Three Punjab cabinet ministers will meet Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Thursday to resolve the standoff between the Centre and the state government over making land records mandatory for crop procurement and implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. State ministers Manpreet Singh Badal (finance), Bharat Bhushan Ashu (food and civil supplies) and Vijay Inder Singla (public works) along with Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh will also take up the issues of recovery of incidentals and demand for 3% rural development fund (RDF) for procurement in the previous kharif season. The state government claims RDF as its right, saying it is an important source of income for carrying out development works in rural areas.Punjab’s four procurement agencies led by the state food and civil supplies department have made arrangements for procuring 130 lakh tonne wheat by setting up 3,700 mandis to adhere to Covid-19 protocol of social distancing. The meeting is crucial particularly when the farmers from Punjab and other states are staging protests at the Delhi border seeking repeal of the Centre’s three agriculture laws. The Centre wants arhtiyas (commission agents) to be out of the procurement scene by depositing crop directly into the accounts of farmers through the public finance management system. On the other hand, the state government says arhtiyas play a pivotal role in the procurement process by charging 2% dami on the crop sale.“Procurement in Punjab can’t take place in the absence of arthiyas as they support the mandi operations by cleaning, weighing, filling, loading and unloading of crop,” said a food and civil supplies department official. “We got the appointment with the Union minister after several requests. We hope to resolve all the issues,” said Bharat Bhushan Ashu. On Wednesday, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh held a virtual meeting with the arhtiya association, Ashu and officials of the food and civil supplies department.The arhtiyas announced that they will shut the mandis operations from April 10 as a mark of protest if their issues were not resolved. “We will not let weighing and loading of the wheat crop in case the Centre is adamant to go ahead with DBT,” said VK Kalra, president of an arhtiyas association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-punjab-ministers-to-meet-piyush-goyal-over-procurement-dbt-standoff-today-101617826890233.html

08-04-2021||Chandigarh||As Flipkart gets land for fulfilment centre, Amazon may follow suit||After a six-month holdup, the allotment of 140 acres to e-commerce company Flipkart for setting up its fulfilment centre in Gurugram’s warehousing and transport hub at Patli Hazipur, Manesar, by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has opened avenues for e-commerce giant Amazon. Officials said they had already held a few rounds of discussion with Amazon and certain other e-commerce companies who evinced interest in buying such sites. After allotment to Flipkart, the corporation has about 60 acres of land in two disjointed chunks at Patli Hazipur left for sale. The site to Flipkart was allotted at ₹3.22 crore per acre at bare shell cost, thereby meaning HSIIDC would not provide either external or internal infrastructure for the site and creating it would be the responsibility of the allottee. Only infrastructure development charges which included cost of development of major infrastructure project like the KMP-e-way, which is next to this site, has been levied, officials said. Flipkart was originally allotted 140 acres in October last year but the handing over was delayed following objections by industries and commerce minister Dushyant Chautala who wanted the corporation to explore a better price for the prime site, initially allotted at ₹3.09 crore per acre at bare shell cost. The Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB) headed by chief minister then asked the corporation to put a few more similarly situated warehousing sites for e-auction to explore the market. Four warehousing sites of comparatively smaller sizes were put up for auction, but there was zero response. Subsequently, the HEPB approved the allotment to Flipkart on Tuesday but at a slightly higher rate. “The problems in the Flipkart created a bit of confusion. But we had a series of interaction with Amazon team, and they have evinced interest in buying 40-acre land, adjacent to the Flipkart site,’’ said a top official. HSIIDC officials said that the Patli Hazipur chunk of land was at a prime location. It is located close to KMP expressway and Gurugram-Pataudi road. Thus, it’s ideal for companies who wanted to have better connectivity for movement of goods from warehouses to destination cities “Normally, companies wanted to set up warehousing space look for change of land use mode where they get the site at about ₹2 crore per acre. But bigger players like Flipkart and Amazon don’t mind spending more for such sites which are comparatively expensive but strategically situated. The KMP e-way is a mere five-minute drive away from this site,’’ an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-flipkart-gets-land-for-fulfilment-centre-amazon-may-follow-suit-101617826290671.html

We have been providing anti-rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin free of cost to patients at the clinic,” he said.Dr Rather said the new effort is aimed at overcoming the drawback with sterilisation programme.“Earlier, the volume of sterilisations was low as we had limited infrastructure. We could not perform more than 15 sterilisations per day. But now we want to conduct 5,000-6,000 sterilisations per month,” Rather said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/srinagar-mc-to-sterilise-vaccinate-50-000-dogs-in-6-months-101617825810450.html

While medical students are struggling with practical surgical classes being held online, PhD students are unable to access labs in their host countries and the language barrier is getting worse while studying online,” said a statement released by these students.After spending a year back home due to the Covid-19 imposed lockdown around the world, the recent statement released by the Chinese government still gives no clear deadline on when the entry restriction for international students holding study visa ends. In a statement made public on March 22 by the Indian Embassy in Beijing, China, the embassy has clarified that the recent decision of the Chinese government related to visa facilitation for foreigners visiting China does not apply to foreign students. “Chinese authorities at various levels continue to maintain their position that, on account of last year’s announcement by ministry of foreign affairs of the People’s Republic of China to suspend temporarily the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese visa and residence permits following the outbreak Covid-19 in many countries, the visa suspension on foreigners stays until further notice,” states the official statement released by the embassy.Students are now worried about their future. A third-year student from Jianghan University in Wuhan, said, “Most of us want to withdraw our admission from China and continue our education elsewhere. However, the National Medical Commission (NMC) of India mandates that we finish our course from the institute we got admitted to.” Apart from theory, colleges are now holding practicals online. “Our seniors are being taught surgery online,” she added.According to data from the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in 2018 and 2019 China received around 500,000 international students each, the third highest in the world after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Official data shows that in 2018, over 23,000 Indian students were enrolled in various programmes in China. Indians represent the fourth largest group of international students in China, after South Koreans, Thais and Pakistanis. “Many of us were scheduled to arrive to our host countries before the April term, and have been forced to leave our jobs, apartments and belongings in the host countries…Given the circumstance, it is wise to allow only essential travel and with proper care and quarantine, these host countries can easily bring back their students and allow us to pursue our education physically along with our batchmates from the host country,” said the statement released by students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/medical-students-studying-in-chinese-univs-approach-un-for-help-to-be-able-to-get-back-to-their-colleges-101617825749563.html

Listing their demands, ZPSC chief Mukesh Malaudh said dalits wanted their share of common reserved land in villages on lease for 33 years (not just a year, as is the system now), and quashing of all FIRs against union leaders. One-third of the common land is reserved for Dalits. Bathinda, Ludhiana and Patran roads from the town remained blocked for three hours with protesters blocking traffic at the Mahavir Chowk. Malaudh added that the government should distribute entire land above the Ceiling Act in the state and loan of micro-finance companies on labourers should be waived. “We want a permanent solution of the common reserved land auction as upper castes and dalits clash over this land every year. Dalits are thrashed and police register cases against us when we hold protest,” added Malaudh. Sangrur SSP Vivek Sheel Soni said he had sought a list of FIRs registered against them, adding that the matter would be resolved soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-dalits-protest-for-increase-in-lease-period-of-village-common-land-to-33-years-101617825690360.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||With 812 cases, J&K sees six-month high||Jammu and Kashmir’s coronavirus cases hit a six-month high with 812 new infections, pushing the UT’s case tally to 1,34,827, health officials said on Wednesday. The death toll mounted to 2,018 as the UT recorded six fresh fatalities – four in Jammu division and two in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 465 were from Kashmir division and 347 were from Jammu. Of the total cases, 257 were travellers. J&K had recorded an all-time high on September 12 when 1,698 infections were reported in the UT.Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) president Nisar-ul-Hassan said the region was facing a second wave. “Second waves of pandemics have been seen to be harsher,” Hassan said, giving the example of 1918 Spanish flu.“Covid is following the same suit. The second waves of coronavirus in the United States and Europe were uniformly worse than the first. Kashmir is currently under the grip of a second wave and the cases are rising and hospitalisations, too,” he said.Officials said with 239 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 138 in Jammu district, 79 in Udhampur, 78 in Baramulla ,62 in Reasi and 42 in Budgam. Seven out of 20 districts reported single-digit cases. The number of active cases, which has been rising steadily since March reached 5,053, officials said. After the peak in the first wave in September, active cases had declined steadily as the year ended to reach a low of 593 on February 8 and 9. Since February 9, the UT has added 4,460 active cases in around two months.“If countermeasures are not put in place, we could end up having a situation that could be worse than what we saw last year. People are experiencing pandemic fatigue and have thrown caution to the wind,” Dr Hassan said.On Wednesday, 254 patients were discharged from different hospitals, including 192 from Kashmir and 62 from Jammu. As many as 1, 27,774 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate down to 94.76 % from around 98% in the first fortnight of February. Over 6.32 million tests have been conducted in the UT so far. Dr Hassan said that the emergence of the new variants could make the new wave worse. “Some of the variants can make the virus more infectious, deadly, or even resistant to vaccines and treatment,” he said “The second wave is infecting more younger people than the first one. And, after a couple of weeks, many of them are likely to infect the elder members of their family and when that happens, serious illnesses and deaths will go up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-812-cases-j-k-sees-six-month-high-101617825632466.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ready to follow SOPs, but agitation won’t end: Tikait||Ambala As the nation recorded highest coronavirus cases in a day on Tuesday, Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait has said the protesting farmers are ready to follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the prevention of the spread of virus, but the agitation won’t end anytime soon. “Government should not think that coronavirus can end our agitation as it happened with Shaheen Bagh. It won’t end until our demands are met. We are ready to follow the guidelines,” Tikait told the media in Yamunanagar on Wednesday. He hoped that the government will accept farmers’ demands by November as the agitation on the Delhi borders will complete a year. “But we are ready to take it till 2023. We are ready to resume talks with the government,” he added. He said the main problem in the country is lack of a strong Opposition at the Centre. “Had there been strong Opposition in Parliament, need for such protests would have never arisen,” he said. Another senior peasant leader, Gurnam Singh Charuni, who also addressed union activists, said, “Government is trying to create an adverse situation like it happened during the Jat agitation in 2016.” He said at the SKM meeting, the leaders decided that the protests against the political leaders will continue but without any violence or provocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ready-to-follow-sops-but-agitation-won-t-end-tikait-101617825631281.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Amid stir, Maharashtra may relax curbs for some sectors||After protests by retailers, traders and other sectors to the partial lockdown, the state is expected to tweak its standard operating procedures (SOPs), giving relaxations to a few sectors in the next few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his meeting with them hinted at the relaxations. Two days after the partial lockdown was imposed, traders and shopkeepers took to the streets, protesting against the lockdown, as confusion and ambiguities over the guidelines led to chaos in the past two days. Thackeray later held meetings with the organisations representing retailers, traders and bodies representing chartered accountants and company secretaries on Wednesday. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte held a video conference with all district collectors and civic commissioners to clarify about the confusion. Thackeray has assured the retailers he would reconsider the decision of shutting shops and offices in the next two days. “The restrictions imposed are out of compulsion amid the second wave. Not only traders and business, even the state is facing losses to the exchequer. We will definitely reconsider the decision and offer some relaxation after a due deliberation with task force, police administration and other departments,” he said. Thackeray also warned retailers and traders to ensure the guidelines are followed. “If there are 1.5 million workers employed in the shops and establishments in Mumbai, their mobilisation leads to the risk of spread of the virus. Similarly, the movement of people engaged in other sectors will also lead to crowding,” he said. The associations representing traders told the CM that the sentiments of their members are extreme. “We pointed at the contradiction in the decision of lockdown as hawkers are allowed, while shopkeepers have to stay shut; industries are open but raw material vendors are shut. We are ready to keep the shops open in staggered timings and on limited days,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade. Thackeray also held a meeting with representatives of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and Institute of Company Secretaries of India and told them to submit an SOP that will help in the maintaining staggered timings and encouraging culture of work from home. Kunte took stock of the situation in various districts. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who held meetings with some of the trade bodies, too had demanded to revisit the decision of the partial lockdown as it has badly hit the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-stir-maharashtra-may-relax-curbs-for-some-sectors-101617825629702.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha active cases may cross 1.1mn by April||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra is likely to cross the 1,100,000 mark by April 30, without adequate measures to control the spread of the virus, such as imposing restrictions on movement or business, according to the state health department. These figures are significant because the highest number of active cases in the entire country was around 1,100,000 during the previous wave of Covid-19 in September 2020, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the state health department said on Wednesday. The issue was discussed during a video conference with the central government on Wednesday morning, Vyas said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also urged citizens to strictly follow restrictions imposed by the state government during the past few days, wear face masks in public places, and maintain social distancing. During an interaction with the media on Wednesday, Thackeray said, “It is important to create awareness about the real situation of Covid-19 on ground, so citizens can be careful and reduce stepping out. Many businesses are urging the government to allow them to operate as usual. We do not want to hamper any business or inconvenience citizens. We want to reduce non-essential commute and crowding at public places to control the spread of the infection.” According to the state’s original projections, Maharashtra would have crossed 472,000 active Covid-19 cases by April 12. However, Maharashtra has already crossed this figure as of Tuesday. “Our second wave began around February 11. Now, we are recording more cases than we predicted. The state has already recorded 50% more active cases during this wave, in comparison to its previous wave in September 2020. If cases increase in this proportion, by April 17, we will have around 568,000 active cases,” Vyas said. The maximum number of active Covid-19 cases in September 2020 was around 300,000, as opposed to 472,283 as of Tuesday. To streamline availability of beds for needy Covid-19 patients, health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday directed all district collectors and municipal commissioners to adopt Mumbai’s model of centralised bed allotment. “We have noticed patients struggle to find beds and approach individual hospitals to check availability. Beds will be allotted to Covid-19 patients through a centralised system at every district and municipal corporation level, so patients don’t have to run from one hospital to another,” Tope said.In the state, 80.51% Covid-19 beds, 32.77% oxygen beds and 60.95% ICU beds are occupied. Vyas said, “Overall the state has sufficient beds. However, some cities such as Nagpur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Latur and Yavatmal are facing a bed crunch. We will increase infrastructure.” Maharashtra will start purchasing oxygen from neighbouring states in the coming days, to meet its oxygen demands for critical and serious Covid-19 patients. Maharashtra government produces 11,500 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day of which about 850 MT is used per day at present, but is likely to utilise its entire stock per day within a week. Tope also announced that the government is mulling capping retail price of the drug, Remdesivir, which is sold at as high as ₹4,000 per injection at present, while manufacturers sell every unit at ₹800 to stockers. This price is likely to be capped at ₹1,200. The state has requested the Centre to supply 4,000,000 vaccine shots to be able to meet its target of vaccinating 600,000 beneficiaries per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-active-cases-may-cross-1-1mn-by-april-101617825569594.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha lockdown: Fearing return of woes, migrants rush back to hometowns||Vishal Kori, 25, is perturbed by the memories of last year’s Covid-19 lockdown, when he had to walk for 10 days to his native place Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. He was among the millions of migrants, the bulk of Maharashtra’s workforce from March-end onwards, who trudged for days together, braving the scorching summer heat to reach their destinations. However as the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, these migrants made a comeback after some months. According to the state, at least 1.2 million workers from states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha left Maharashtra after the lockdown was announced on March 24. This time as the mini lockdown is imposed, Kori wants to take no chance as he stands in a railway ticket queue to go back to his native village. “I am not taking any chance as Mumbai faces a large number of Covid-19 cases and my shop is shut. It is better I go back fast before things turn ugly,” said Kori, who works in a footwear shop. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government imposed a mini lockdown from Tuesday in view of the surge in Covid cases, which has now reached above 50,000 per day across the state. “Mumbai is not safe anymore and it is better I go back to Jharkhand. I don’t think I will come back again as I will search for a job in Delhi or Noida,” said Jamal Khan, 44, a chef in a hotel in the city. Traders, especially in the hospitality sector, are worried. Mirah Hospitality, which runs 14 hotels including Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Maharashtra, which was currently operating with 650 staff members, has seen 300 workers going back to their native states. “There is no way we can stop them. Some of our staff are trying for jobs in Bengaluru and Delhi,” said Aji Nair, COO (food and beverages division), Mirah Hospitality. Currently the government has allowed hotels and restaurants to only offer parcel services which has paralysed this sector. The Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), which represents the traders, called it a sorry state of affairs. “Our members are trying their best to dissuade these workers from going back. However if the government continues with this mini lockdown and does not allow us to open our establishments, there is no way we can retain them. This loss of labour will hurt the state’s economy,” warned Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT. “We were barely recovering when this mini lockdown was imposed. We have taken loans and paid our license fees in advance,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-lockdown-fearing-return-of-woes-migrants-rush-back-to-hometowns-101617825509553.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||24x7 home deliveries now allowed||Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday allowed home deliveries of food and all essential supplies (e-commerce) through all online service providers like Zomato and Swiggy 24 hours on all days through the week. This decision was taken by Chahal with chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in order to give certain relaxations. Along with this, movement of maids and house helps is also allowed between 7am and 10pm on all days of the week.Currently, e-commerce delivery is allowed between 7am and 8 pm and for restaurants takeaway/home delivery is permitted between 7am and 8pm on weekdays. On weekends, home delivery is allowed between 7am and 8pm. However, Chahal in an order has relaxed this to allow the same round-the-clock.The BMC chief has also allowed keeping eye clinics and opticians’ shops open, along with allowing movement of maids, cooks, drivers, house helps, nurses and medical attendees providing services to senior citizens and ailing people at home between 7am and 10pm on all days of the week.Further, Chahal in the circular has stated, “Students or candidates who have to attend various exams including the competitive exams are allowed to make necessary movement to attend the exams during the weekend lockdown and their examination hall tickets should be considered valid for the same. They are allowed to be accompanied by one guardian or parent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/24x7-home-deliveries-now-allowed-101617825449564.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Cases may start to dip in city post April 20: BMC chief||As the city is under a mini lockdown with the shutting of non-essential shops, malls and religious places, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained that this will help in controlling the spread of the virus. According to BMC, the number of cases being reported daily might stabilise within the next 10 to 12 days, and a downward trend might start post April 20. However, it will be dependent on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by citizens, BMC officials added.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told HT, “If we look at the current scenario in the city of a second wave, the daily cases being reported in the city have almost stabilised between 8,000 and 11,000 daily cases. If this trend continues, cases will start going down post April 20, but this remains only if citizens continue to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”Chahal added, “Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccines for those eligible are the two most important things for citizens to follow. We need to undertake Covid-19 vaccination on the lines of polio vaccination, and for this we are trying to mobilise citizens. The BMC is yet to get permission for door-to-door vaccination, and hence I have requested elected representatives from the city to mobilise citizens for Covid-19 vaccination.”The city has reported increased cases since February 10, from the earlier below-500 cases. Mumbai’s daily cases went up to 1,000 by February-end, 5,000 by March and around 10,000 cases by the first week of April. The positivity rate has gone up from 5% to around 26% by the first week of April.Experts said the number of cases can go down in the next two to four weeks. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “In case of Mumbai, we are looking at different timelines. My assumption is that the situation should improve in the next two to four weeks. But citizens need to behave in a Covid-19 appropriate manner, and asymptomatic patients need to understand and not block a bed.”Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of Microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “With so many restrictions, the caseload should go down in the coming days. However, we need to ensure no crowding in local trains, buses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cases-may-start-to-dip-in-city-post-april-20-bmc-chief-101617825330203.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Class 9, 11 students to be promoted without exams’||Class 9 and 11 students in state board schools will be promoted to the next class without giving exams, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad declared on Tuesday afternoon. The decision is still awaiting a nod from the office of the chief minister. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Gaikwad said that in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases and the resultant school closures, it has been decided to promote Class 9 and 11 students without conducting assessments or exams this year. “While schools and teachers continued teaching students online and extended a lot of learning support even offline, the year has been tough for students as schools have remained closed for most of it. It is thus decided to promote students to the next class this year so as to ensure that they do not suffer due to the pandemic and the resultant learning losses,” stated the minister in the statement. Earlier this month, the education department had decided to promote students of Classes 1 to 8 to further classes under the no-detention policy under the RTE Act. However, for Class 9 and 11, schools and junior colleges usually hold exams and students who fail to clear these exams and the following reexams are detained in the same class. This year, however, owing to the pandemic and the resultant learning losses, students will not be detained under any circumstance and shall all be promoted to the next class, as per the minister. Meanwhile, the minister stated that there is a demand to conduct online exams for Class 10 and 12 and to postpone them due to rising infections in the state. “However, students from rural parts of the state are demanding offline exams as many of them have issues with respect to connectivity. Similarly, postponing exams might have an impact on students writing their competitive exams as other boards like CBSE and ICSE still have their offline exams scheduled. We will take the interest of all students in mind before coming up with any change in the decision,” stated the minister. While the HSC (Class 12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, 2021, SSC (Class 10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 33 lakh students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from the state board every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-9-11-students-to-be-promoted-without-exams-101617825329584.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants police protection to sexual abuse survivor, friends||Raising concerns over the threat to the lives of survivors of sexual assault and witnesses in light of the situation in Uttar Pradesh, the Bombay high court (HC) said it did not want the situation to be repeated in Maharashtra, and hence directed the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of Mira-Bhayandar Police to provide protection to a sexual assault survivor who had approached the court seeking the same. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing a plea by the survivor on Tuesday, was informed by advocate Trupti Bharadi that her client hailed from Rajasthan and that she was forced to work in a dance bad in Mumbai by her parents in 2011, when she was 17 years old. Bharadi further submitted that thereafter her client, her three sisters and four minors were forced into prostitution and were also sent to Dubai on three occasions between 2012 and 2014 by an agent. Bharadi claimed that after the survivor came to know that she was pregnant in March 2020, her father threatened to kill her if she refused to continue with prostitution. She continued with the pregnancy and gave birth in August 2020. However, due to the threat from her father, she left his house and started living with a friend. Her father then allegedly sent two people to coerce her into going back into prostitution in December last year, following which the woman filed a non-cognisable complaint with Bhayandar police. Her father allegedly also threatened her friend, prompting the friend to lode police complaint against the father at Kashimira police station. However, Bharadi claimed, the police did not take any action on the complaints, and hence her client approached the court seeking directions for registration of a case and for providing police protection to them. Additional public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde for the police submitted that a first information report (FIR) was registered under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Immoral Trafficking Act against the woman’s parents. Shinde further added that as a new investigating officer had taken over the case, and he would require some time to investigate the matter. Shinde said the officer would submit the report before the court after two weeks. Responding to this, advocate Bharadi said some persons who had allegedly committed the offences were not made accused in the case and added that their should also be added in the FIR. He further urged the court to monitor the investigation and provide protection to the complainant and her friends who supported her till the names are added in the FIR. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “We know what is happening Uttar Pradesh; witnesses are killed. We do not want that situation in Maharashtra.” While the court allowed the police to investigate and submit a report, it held that it was necessary to provide police protection to the petitioner and witnesses free of charge till further order. The court also sought a compliance report in the next hearing on April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-police-protection-to-sexual-abuse-survivor-friends-101617824969608.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||4 farmers arrested for attack on Kurukshetra MP Nayab Saini||Karnal A day after the windshield of Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Kurukshetra Nayab Saini’s car was damaged during a protest by the farmers in Shahbad, four people were arrested on various charges, including attempt to murder. They were produced in a court and sent to judicial custody, police said. The police did not disclose the details of those arrested but a statement issued by the Kurukshetra SP’s office claimed that 15 people were booked under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC for the attack on Saini who was escorted out unharmed though. The police action ruffled the farmer community and hundreds of them reached Shahbad police station and staged a dharna. Farmers threatened to intensify their agitation if those arrested were not released at the earliest. Farmers laid siege to the main entrance of the police station amid heavy police deployment. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains said they asked the police to release innocent farmers who have no role in the attack. He said the government was misusing power and using police to suppress their agitation. Farmers have formed a five-member committee for holding talks with the police. Kurukshetra SP Himanshu Garg did not respond to the phone calls and text messages sent to him. On Tuesday, MP Saini had visited Shahbad when BKU (Charuni) activists blocked his way and showed black flags. The MP’s car was escorted out after its rear windshield was broken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-farmers-arrested-for-attack-on-kurukshetra-mp-nayab-saini-101617824791435.html

But with the spike in cases, the allotment and admission is taking 5 to 7 hours. Sometimes, it’s even more, leaving many in the lurch, said attendants of patients.A 55-year-old woman from Sitapur Road had to wait till 4 in the morning before she could get a bed in a hospital after her Covid sample tested positive at 1am. Despite all efforts by doctors, she could not survive. “Her sample was taken at 5pm and the report came at 1am. Despite being in isolation, she had to wait for hours in a serious condition. She was admitted and doctors made every effort, but she lost her battle for life,” said a relative.On Wednesday, Lucknow reported the 1,333 fresh Covid cases, the highest in a day so far while UP logged 6,023 new cases. The state and the city also reported 40 and six Covid deaths, respectively.As per statistics, the number of ICU beds is insufficient (475 operational beds for 8,852 active cases). “To reduce mortality, public movement must be curbed immediately. This infection multiplies geometrically, hence 2,000 new cases can come in just two days. With a human-to-human spread pattern of this virus nothing will work other than controlling the movement of the people,” said a senior faculty of a medical institute. A health official said, ‘The bed capacity in hospitals should have been doubled as the virus is more infectious now. The central government has already conceded that the second wave is infecting more people than the first wave.” Earlier, the SGPGI had operated 201 beds with an additional 30 in the holding area till the cases had started subsiding. This time, the institute already has 210 beds (nine more than last year) in the main hospital and 40 in the holding area (10 more) where 146 patients are currently admitted. In wake of the Covid surge, PGI officials plan to take the bed strength to 300 in the main hospital over the next 15 days. Similarly, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences has 200 beds where 130 are high dependency unit (HDU) beds and 20 ICU beds, as per the data on Wednesday morning. The institute is now increasing the numbers. “We are adding beds for Covid facility from today and shortly 150 ICU/HDU beds will be available for patients,” said Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson for the institute. At the King George’s Medical University (KGMU), 293 ICU beds are operational. “We have 272 patients in the ICU and 36 in isolation at present,” said Dr Sudhir Singh. The total strength of KGMU Covid facility is of 504 beds that it had used for patients during the first wave. Against a total 3,914 beds (including 2,781 isolation beds, 698 high dependency unit (HDU) beds, and 435 ICU/ventilator) at 32 government and private hospitals in October, the present strength is 2,225 in Lucknow including 1,121 isolation, 629 HDU and 475 ICU beds. BOXMed institutes asked to increase bed strengthLUCKNOW Medical institutes have been asked to increase the number of beds in their Covid wards, including ICU beds with ventilator support. In a letter, Alok Kumar, principal secretary (medical education), asked all government, private medical colleges, KGMU, SGPGI and other super-speciality institutes to increase bed strength. “With the surge in Covid cases it is important to enhance facilities for patients. Hence, the institutes/facilities where bed occupancy in Covid facility has been over 60% should expand their facilities to a maximum limit,” stated the letter. The letter particularly mentions Lucknow, where the case positivity rate is high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-covid-surge-wait-for-beds-in-hosps-gets-longer-in-lucknow-101617824791899.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||NIA court extends Sachin Vaze’s custody, permits CBI to grill him||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday extended custody of suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze till April 9 in connection with his alleged role in parking an explosives-laden car outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February. The special court also permitted the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to interrogate Vaze in connection with the preliminary probe directed by the Bombay high court (HC) while he is in NIA custody. The special court also remanded former police constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor, booked for their role in Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s murder case, in judicial custody. NIA while seeking Vaze’s custody argued that they needed his custody to unearth the cash trail, source of procurement of gelatin sticks which were planted in the car found outside Ambani’s residence as well as the motive behind murder of Hiran. The agency on Wednesday informed the court that there is ₹1.5 crore in Axis Bank in the name of a company floated by the accused. The agency also claimed that Vaze had given ₹36 lakh and ₹40 lakh to his accomplices. He had also allegedly purchased six high-end vehicles. “We need to know the source of money; was he extorting money for himself or for others? How does an assistant police inspection rank officer have such a huge amount in his account?” the NIA said. The agency also claimed that it was a deep-rooted terror conspiracy, and hence they have to probe if the money found in Vaze’s account was used to procure the gelatin sticks and where it was sourced from. “More time is required to unearth the cash trail, existing accounts of the accused and whether this money has direct connection with gelatins,” NIA said. In the Mansukh Hiran murder case, the agency claimed that Vaze and other accused had hatched the conspiracy to eliminate Hiran on March 2 and 3. “Hiran was a co-conspirator in the explosives case and has been eliminated. The accused has direct connection with the case. NIA needs to find motive behind his murder,” the probong agency stated.

08-04-2021||Mumbai||NIA grills Param Bir Singh, Pradeep Sharma in Antilia bomb scare and Hiran murder cases||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing the Antilia bomb scare and the murder case of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, questioned former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh for four hours on Wednesday. Encounter specialist and former police personnel Pradeep Sharma was also questioned for seven hours at NIA office in south Mumbai. Singh reached NIA office around 9.30am. NIA recorded his statement in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case as he was the Mumbai Police commissioner and arrested accused Sachin Vaze, who was then in-charge of the crime intelligence unit (CIU), was allegedly directly reporting to Singh. Soon after the explosive laden-Scorpio vehicle was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, the case was transferred to the CIU and Vaze was made an investigating officer. Singh has been appointed as the director general of Home Guards after he was shunted out from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner on March 17 after NIA claimed that Vaze was the mastermind behind planting the explosives-laden Scorpio near Antilia and seized an Innova of Mumbai Police which was allegedly trailing the Scorpio on February 25. Sharma reached NIA office around 12.45pm and left around 8.20pm. During an investigation, NIA found that Sharma had visited the Mumbai Police commissioner’s office on March 2 and had allegedly met Vaze in CIU office and also met Singh. NIA has been questioning him to find out whether he was involved in the meeting and whether he was part of the conversation with Vaze and Mansukh Hiran when Vaze was reportedly asking Hiran to take responsibility of planting explosives in his own Scorpio. Hiran, who was allegedly not ready to accept the responsibility, went missing on March 4 evening after he left his house to meet an officer named Tawade near Ghodbunder Road in Thane. Later on March 5, Hiran’s body was found near Retibunder in Mumbra. The probing agency is now conducting an investigation to find out if Vaze was involved in Hiran’s murder and whether he took help of others to execute his plan to frame or eliminate Hiran. Apart from Vaze, former police constable Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gor are in NIA’s custody for allegedly providing logistic support in Hiran’s murder. Sharma was a senior inspector of anti-extortion cell in Thane before he resigned from the police department in July 2019 and joined the Shiv Sena. He contested and lost in 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections from Nallasopara constituency against Hitendra Thakur. Sharma was previously suspended from police department owing to corruption allegations but was reinstated in 2005. He was also named in Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya encounter case and was arrested in 2010, but was acquitted in 2013 by a lower court. He re-joined the Mumbai police force in 2017 and was in-charge of anti-extortion cell (AEC) in Thane when Singh was Thane commissioner. NIA officers also recorded statement of a deputy commissioner of police of Mumbai Police’s crime branch who visited the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3. The agency wanted to verify certain details with all concern people present in the CIU office at the time when Hiran met Vaze. The DCP visited the NIA office on Tuesday afternoon and he was examined for around three hours. He left the NIA office in the evening, said an NIA officer. However, a senior Mumbai Police officer said the DCP had visited the CIU office for some other work and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.As of now, NIA has recorded statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in both the cases, said an NIA officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-grills-param-bir-singh-pradeep-sharma-in-antilia-bomb-scare-and-hiran-murder-cases-101617824550659.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt sets target of 2 lakh shots per day in Punjab||With the Covid infection rate reaching 7.7% and the case fatality rate (CFR) hitting 2% in the state, chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday set a vaccination target of two lakh shots per day. The CM also directed the health department to ramp up sampling to 50,000 per day, besides vigorously pursuing contact tracing to 30 people per positive patient. Expressing concern over the high CFR rate, the CM said these deaths, many of which are avoidable with timely treatment, pain him. He directed chief secretary Vini Mahajan to undertake public awareness campaign to motivate people to approach hospitals at early stages. The CM said the death audit should be done by all districts and private facilities, which are not participating in the expert group discussions, should be encouraged to do so.Amarinder, who was informed by the health department that the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, was refusing to admit patients from Punjab despite being referred through proper channels, said he would take up the matter with the Prime Minister at Thursday’s video conferencing meeting and would request him to direct the hospital to reserve at least 50 ICU beds for patients referred by the state government. He also asked the chief secretary to address the issue of vaccination hesitancy by undertaking well-designed media campaigns. The CM said he would again urge the Union government for relaxation in the age criteria for vaccinating people under the age of 45 years in areas showing weekly doubling of positivity rate. He reiterated his demand that the Union government should allow vaccinations to all potential superspreaders, students above 18 years, teachers, councillors and sarpanches.On vaccination supply, the chief secretary informed the CM that the Union government had assured that the state would not face any shortage.Director general of police Dinkar Gupta informed the CM that all districts were taking penal action for violation of Covid protocols and so far, 2.03 lakh people had been taken for RT-PCR tests after they were found not wearing masks in public. He also said that 43,000 challans have been with a collection of ₹3.6 crore fine. A total of 206 FIRs have been registered and 246 people arrested for violations, the GP said. Catering to maximum patients from Punjab: PGIIn response to the Punjab government’s demand for more ICU beds, PGIMER, Chandigarh, has said maximum number of patients treated at the institute are from Punjab.The statement came after the Punjab CM said that he will ask the PM to direct the institute to reserve at least 50 ICU beds for patients referred by the state governmentThe annual census of PGIMER for 2020 shows that it provided tertiary-level medical care to patients from five states with proportion of Punjab being the highest, according to the institute’s press release. PGIMER admits only severe and critically-ill Covid patients in the NHE Covid Block. Presently 50% of the total 166 patients admitted to the PGIMER, belong to Punjab. All ICU beds in the Covid Block are full and 50% of these are occupied by patients from Punjab, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sets-target-of-2-lakh-shots-per-day-in-punjab-101617824550247.html
08-04-2021||Other||All ambulances of govt, pvt hosps be used for Covid patients: CM||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that district magistrates should take a call on the closure of secondary schools in districts reporting more than 100 Covid cases per day or having a over 500 active cases. DMs in such districts should also take appropriate decision on controlling the movement of traffic during night hours. Under no circumstances, movement of medicines or food material should be hindered, he said.

The number of cases in these districts was higher though there was a decline in the positivity rate, added the CM. He said special secretary level officers should immediately be deployed for monitoring in these districts while contact tracing should be ramped up. Yogi said those found without a mask should be penalised. He said the Covid situation was deteriorating in some southern states along with Maharashtra and there was a possibility of UP’s people coming back to the state from there. All districts had done exemplary Covid management work in the state in 2020, he said. “With our team work, we will win the fight against Covid this time too,” he said. He said the minister for medical and health and minister for medical education should visit districts along with officers. The ministers should give appropriate directives to bring about an improvement in the situation. He said himself would make surprise inspections in Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur in the next few days. He emphasized that all the ambulances of government and private hospitals should be used for carrying Covid patients. “These vehicles should be linked to integrated command control centres and patients should get immediate response,” added the CM. Yogi Adityanath said V-C of respective development authorities be given a greater role in districts where officers of district magistrate or chief development officer ranks were infected. He said additional director (health) level officer should give their services if chief medical officer was infected.

08-04-2021||Mumbai||CBI records statement of Dr Jaishri Patil in preliminary probe ordered by Bombay HC||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recorded the statement of complainant Dr Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guest house in Santacruz (East) in connection with the corruption allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Dr Patil’s statement was recorded after the Bombay high court (HC) directed CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and submit a report in 15 days based on her petition.Patil reached DRDO guest house around 3pm on Wednesday where the CBI team is stationed. CBI questioned Patil for almost five hours and called her again on Thursday to record further statement. Patil said, “I have submitted the evidence that I have and will visit CBI office again to give further statement.”“I have received several threats on phone as well as on social media from many organisations pressuring me not to speak and give statement to CBI officials against politician” said Patil.On Tuesday evening, CBI registered a preliminary inquiry based on the HC order, and a team comprising six officers reached Mumbai from Delhi the same evening to investigate the matter. A CBI officer said a second CBI team from Delhi comprising around six more officers, including a superintendent of police, also reached Mumbai in the afternoon. Before registering the preliminary enquiry, CBI had consulted their legal team. CBI officers also approached the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday seeking permission to record the statement of former police officer Sachin Vaze who is in NIA custody for allegedly planting a explosives-laden vehicle near the industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25. Vaze had also been named by Singh in his eight-page letter to Maharashtra chief minister wherein he alleged that Deshmukh has asked Vaze and two other officers to collect ₹100 crore from bar and restaurants in the city. The NIA court granted permission to CBI to record Vaze’s statement in connection with the corruption allegations. CBI will also record statements of Singh and the other officers mentioned by Singh during the preliminary enquiry. While directing CBI to conduct a preliminary probe on April 5 in a 52-page judgement, the HC had observed that Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on Patil’s complaint which had pointed to a cognisable offence being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” It further observed that as the state police force was under Deshmukh [he resigned after HC’s directions for probe], it would serve the ends of justice if a preliminary probe was conducted by an independent agency such as CBI. “Deshmukh is home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” the bench noted in its judgment. “The allegations made by Shri Param Bir Singh are serious in nature and against the highest functionary of the government of Maharashtra when it comes to the functioning of the police department. Prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of the police department is at stake. If there is any amount of truth in such allegations, certainly it has a direct effect on the citizens’ confidence in the police machinery in the state. Such allegations, therefore, cannot remain unattended and are required to be looked into in the manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of a cognisable offence,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-records-statement-of-dr-jaishri-patil-in-preliminary-probe-ordered-by-bombay-hc-101617824309429.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hritik-Kangana row, copyright violation cases taken away from CIU||Two cases, including the row involving actors Hritik Roshan and Kangana Ranaut, which were previously investigated by now-suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze have been taken away from the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) which has been at the centre of controversies lately. After Vaze’s arrest in the Antilia case and the subsequent revelations about his way of working, joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambhe directed the cyber police station to take over the probe of Roshan’s case on Wednesday.The decision to take away the two cases from CIU was taken after a quick review of the cases handled by Vaze during his nine-month tenure after his reinstatement in June 2020. In the past, high-profile cases registered by the Mumbai Police were being transferred to CIU and Vaze by then police commissioner Param Bir Singh, police sources said.Roshan had lodged a complaint with the cyber police at Bandra-Kurla Complex in 2016 against an unidentified imposter who had allegedly sent emails to several women. The cyber police had then recorded the statements of Ranaut and her sister while probing the case.The reason for the row between the two actors was an email id. Ranaut claimed to have received messages from Roshan from the id, proving they were in a relationship. Roshan, however, said he never had such an email id and added that it was an impostor who had been communicating with Ranaut all along.In December 2020, Roshan’s lawyer made a complaint to Singh about no progress in the case. Following this, Singh had transferred the case to CIU which was then headed by Vaze.Similarly, another case of copyright violation involving the chief executive officer of Maha Movie television channel was also transferred from CIU. Puneet Mehra, son of late filmmaker Prakash Mehra, had filed a complaint of copyright violations with Juhu police last year. He had alleged that their film Zanjeer starring Amitabh Bachchan and Pran was allegedly telecasted on Box Cinema channel on March 12, 2020 without their permission. Mehra holds copyrights of the film.Some of the accused in this case are also named in the TRP manipulation case, hence the case was earlier transferred from Juhu police to CIU. However, the case has been transferred to unit 9 of the Mumbai Police’s crime branch for further probe, a crime branch officer confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hritik-kangana-row-copyright-violation-cases-taken-away-from-ciu-101617824129454.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Top ministers asked me to extort money: Vaze||Suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze alleged on Wednesday that top Maharashtra ministers asked him to extort from businessmen and establishments, echoing similar charges by former Mumbai commissioner Param Bir Singh that are being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Vaze, who is currently being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly planting explosives in a car outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house in February and killing businessman Mansukh Hiran in March, made the allegations in a letter he intended to submit before the special NIA court hearing his case.The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government denied the allegations. Transport minister Anil Parab debunked Vaze’s allegations saying he was not involved in any extortion case and it was the BJP’s conspiracy to defame the MVA government.“In order to defame the Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray), it was necessary to vilify someone close to the Chief Minister and this is a part of agenda being pursued by the BJP,” Parab told reporters. “I am ready for an inquiry by any agency whether NIA, RAW or anyone. I am even ready for narco test,” he added.In his four-page letter, Vaze alleged that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and sitting transport minister Anil Parab asked him to collect money, but he refused. He also said that he was approached for money by a man claiming to be close to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.NCP chief Sharad Pawar was not available for a comment. Former home minister Anil Deshmukh did not respond to calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/top-ministers-asked-me-to-extort-money-vaze-101617824130085.html

08-04-2021||Mumbai||DCP, ACP contradict Param Bir Singh’s allegations about Anil Deshmukh||Amid leaks of various letters and complaints surrounding controversial cop Sachin Vaze, who has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the bomb scare case outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia, statements of two Mumbai Police officers, who have been named as key witnesses by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter while making allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh about demanding a monthly ₹100 crore collection, got leaked on Wednesday. In the statements, the two officers have contradicted Singh’s version. A crime branch officer has confirmed the genuineness of the statements.Statements of deputy commissioner of police (establishments) Dr Raju Bhujbal and assistant commissioner of police (social service) Sanjay Patil which were recorded as suo motu measure by joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambhe as head of the crime branch immediately after Singh’s letter to CM mentioned the two officers from his department.Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Vaze to collect extortion money and had also attached a chat with Patil to corroborate the same. However, Patil in his statement to the joint commissioner (crime) stated that he met Deshmukh on March 1 to brief him about some bars and hookah parlours in Thane. On the same day Vaze met Patil and told him that the home minister had asked him if “ ₹3 lakh were being collected from the 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai”, according to Patil’s statement. It was a query and not a demand, Patil stressed.It was Vaze who informed Patil and Bhujbal about his alleged discussion with Deshmukh over collection from 1,750 bars and restaurants. The same was never discussed with Patil and Bhujbal independently by Deshmukh. Patil also stated that he doesn’t know if Vaze met the home minister in person.Singh had also stated that on March 4 Patil and Bhujbal had visited Deshmukh’s official residence Dyaneshwar, but in their statements the two maintained that the three never met.“On March 4, Deshmukh’s secretary Palande was seen asking Bhujbal if such (huge) amount is collected from city’s establishments? To which we (Patil and Bhujbal) responded him in negative,” Patil stated in the statement.Patil further added that he never met the home minister before or after March 1.Singh, in his letter, had cited content of chats with Patil about discussion on Deshmukh demanding money. However, Patil stated that these discussions were pertaining to Vaze informing them about Deshmukh allegedly asking him about daily collection of money from establishments. The chats were not about Deshmukh directly asking Patil for collecting money, the officer said.After recording statements of the two officers, Bharambhe informed the home department about it. A crime branch officer said it was important to record the statements of the two immediately, before they could come under pressure by anyone. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is carrying out the preliminary probe on the orders of the Bombay high court in Singh’s allegations on Deshmukh, would also be independently recording statements of Bhujbal and Patil. Bhujbal and Patil did not respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dcp-acp-contradict-param-bir-singh-s-allegations-about-anil-deshmukh-101617824009395.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Decks cleared for domestic airport on air force land in Ambala||Ambala Decks have been cleared for the domestic airport project in Ambala Cantonment with an agreement between the district administration and the defence ministry for using air force land, officials said on Wednesday. The project was lingering for almost two years over the land. Officials in a meeting at the Air Force Station on Tuesday discussed and mutually agreed on the land for the project and the location of gates. As per a statement issued by the administration, the air force officials have agreed upon allowing land next to Mama-Bhanja Peer on the Jagadhri Road to be used for the project. “It has been agreed that one gate will open on the Jagadhri road and the other inside the station, so that the flight operations from the air force strip could take place safely,” the statement read. Ambala being a sensitive zone due to the presence of large army apparatus and force, the land selection was lingering for quite some time, especially after Rafale jets were stationed here last year. Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said other than district revenue officials, representatives of the Airport Authority of India and Cantonment Board were also part of the meeting. The DC had inspected the land in Garnala, Barnala and other adjoining villages of the station last year. He also held several meetings with the defence officials to resolve the issue. On February 23, Haryana home minister and local MLA Anil Vij had met defence minister Rajnath Singh to discuss the issue. This was his third such meeting. On Wednesday, Vij said there will be a transfer of nearly 15 acres near the station and the construction will be done by the ministry of civil aviation, after necessary approvals. “The airport has already been cleared under Udaan-3.0 scheme by the ministry and I expect that the flight operations for Lucknow and Srinagar will start within two years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decks-cleared-for-domestic-airport-on-air-force-land-in-ambala-101617823830334.html

08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Issues galore in Chandigarh MC’s garbage collection drive||The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s takeover of the door-to-door garbage collection in the city, now in its fourth month, is still facing teething problems, leaving many residents dissatisfied with the new system.In Sectors 1 to 30, the situation has improved over time, but in most other localities, the MC is struggling to achieve seamless collection of waste.Even as the civic body has pressed its own collection vehicles into service this time, three of its MRF (material recovery facilities) plants are yet to become operational. This has resulted in a longer turnaround time of the waste collection vehicles.With the MRF system, the MC would be able to replace around 40 Sehaj Safai Kendras (SSKs). The construction of two MRFs has already started, while the tendering process of the third one was recently finalised. Two of the MRFs will come up in Phases 1 and 2 of the Industrial Area (one near the MC public health store and second near 3BRD), and third one will be set up adjacent to the garbage processing plant in Sector 25. The MRF near 3BRD is expected to be ready by April-end. “The start of MRFs will help reduce the time taken by garbage collection vehicles to cover each sector. Currently, once in every trip, the collector vehicles have to go dump the waste at the Sector 25 processing plant. Since all the vehicles turn up there around same time, the dumping process takes longer,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav.What the residents sayMeanwhile, residents have been complaining about inadequate collection of garbage in the southern sectors, especially from the first and second floors of the residential units. “This is particularly causing much trouble to senior citizens and persons with disabilities. While the mayor and even the MC waste management rules have stipulated that waste would be picked up from people’s doorsteps, but in reality, many areas are being given a miss,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO).Joginder Singh, president, Sector 38-A and B resident welfare association, said, “The MC vehicles came inside the sectors only for a couple of days. Thereafter, the cart-based collectors picked up the waste and carried it to the MC vehicles which were stationed at a central location near the sector.”Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed), said, “In Sector 43, the MC vehicles only came for two days and then the cart-based collectors picked up the waste. They segregated the garbage near our houses and then dumped it in the MC vehicles. The situation is similar in the northern sectors like Sector 28.”“In Sector 33, sometimes garbage is picked up on rehris and at times it is done by a garbage van. But the collectors neither wear masks nor take any other safety precautions. Moreover, time to collect garbage is also not fixed,” said Kuljinder Sra, general secretary, Sector 33-B RWA.Meanwhile, under the current system, the MC-deployed vehicles are not collecting waste such as dry leaves. “Garbage is being collected by the same persons who were engaged by us after the MC retained them. But they are now refusing to take dry leaves, horticulture waste and broken pots etc. The civic body has not provided any facility for such waste,” said Kidar Nath Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 46.MC commissioner Yadav said, “I have directed the MC officials to post four attendants on vehicles so that garbage can be collected from the first and second floors also.”Now, most of the informal sector garbage collectors, who were earlier picking up waste through the cart-based system, have also joined the MC, added Yadav.User charges in water bills from JuneThe MC has started collecting garbage user charges in some sectors through point of sale (POS) machines. So far, it has collected ₹18 lakh in user charges through the POS mode.It is planning to add these charges in the water bills from June onward. “All the data regarding the waste collection drive, like total number of kitchens and plot size, is being formulated and once the same is finalised, we will start adding user charges to water bills,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/issues-galore-in-chandigarh-mc-s-garbage-collection-drive-101617823052764.html

08-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays minority status of Chandigarh’s St Kabir School||A division bench of Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the minority status of St Kabir School, Sector 26.The order has been passed by the bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Rajesh Bhardwaj, confirmed senior standing counsel, UT, Pankaj Jain.It was in March 2020 that a high court bench had dismissed a February 2018 plea filed by the Chandigarh administration challenging the minority status given to the school. In a fresh plea, the administration appealed against the decision.The school was granted minority status in March 2014. Chandigarh has 22 minority schools, and out of the 13 schools that opted for minority status after 2012, only two got a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the UT administration.There has been a spurt in the cases of schools seeking minority status after the apex court directed in 2012 that minority schools were not bound to reserve 25% of the seats under EWS category for entry-level classes under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. The city has a total of 82 private schools.The UT has argued that as per the 2011 Census, Sikhs constitute the second largest majority after Hindus in Chandigarh. With minority status, the school goes out of the purview of the RTE Act for reservation to EWS and the administration is left with no control over fee regulation and no parent can approach it in case of any complaint, the UT had told court.“(St Kabir) School has complete monopoly and can function without any fear of state supervision or accountability,” the UT argued. It added that the school has not got an NOC from the administration, and the commission granted it minority status even after the UT contested the same.In another case of minority status in August 2018, a high court single judge bench had ruled against minority status obtained by Vivek High School, Sector 38, on a plea by the UT administration. Vivek High’s appeal against that judgment is pending before a division bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-stays-minority-status-of-chandigarh-s-st-kabir-school-101617822869818.html
08-04-2021||Chandigarh||Udayvir Dhillon elected Zirakpur MC president||Udayvir Singh Dhillon, 32, son of Mohali Congress president Deepinder Singh Dhillon, was elected the president of the Zirakpur municipal council for a five-year term on Wednesday.The election was held during the first meeting of the newly elected members of the House, amid a boycott by the Shiromani Akali Dal councillors. No polling took place for the posts of senior vice-president and vice-president. The Congress had won 23 out of the 31 seats in the civic body elections held in February, grabbing the majority from the Shiromani Akali Dal, which had been in power for two decades but managed only eight seats this time. NK Sharma, Akali MLA from Dera Bassi, said the party boycotted the meeting as its demand to conduct elections on all three posts was ignored. Udayvir said the elections to other posts were not held as it was decided by all members. “We will hold the elections for the two posts in the next meeting,” he said. ‘Will remove all encroachments’Udayvir, who is also the Punjab Youth Congress general secretary, won from Ward No. 12. He did his schooling from St John’s High School, Chandigarh, and completed a five-year law course from Punjabi University, Patiala. After getting elected as the council president, he listed removal of encroachments from Zirakpur his top priority. “Before the elections, we gave the slogan of Smart Zirakpur, and we will work towards achieving it,” he said, adding that a committee comprising both councillors and officers will be constituted to identify and remove encroachments.Udayvir said that after more than a decade of unplanned development, the city finally got a master plan in 2009, which has not been implemented yet. “The population is expected to shoot up to 8 lakh by 2030, but now we will change the picture of Zirakpur,” he said.The new council president said even though the MC collected ₹170 crore as development charges from builders, it has failed to elevate the infrastructure, which will be looked into. On unauthorised buildings, he said: “We will first conduct a survey and accordingly take action.”Among other priorities, he listed better waste management, making Zirakpur pollution-free, automated traffic signals at intersections, and construction of community toilets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/udayvir-dhillon-elected-zirakpur-mc-president-101617822810553.html
08-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s stock of vaccine doses to last three more days||Maharashtra is facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses and had to shut down several vaccination centres. It has already requested the Centre to provide adequate stock as it has set a target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries a day, said Rajesh Tope, state health minister, on Wednesday.The state is left with 1,400,000 vaccine doses, which will last only three days. It has demanded a stock of four million doses a week from the Centre.Maharashtra tops the chart in vaccinating maximum beneficiaries across the country. Currently, it is covering 450,000 beneficiaries a day and the health minister guaranteed that it will cross the 600,000 mark in the next two-three days, provided it gets adequate stock from the Centre.Tope urged the Centre to prioritise Maharashtra and if required, delay stock supplies to other states as it is the most affected state in the country. The demand to the Centre was made in a video conference meeting chaired by the union minister of health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan. Tope attended the meeting along with the health minister from six other states on Tuesday evening.“Union minister Prakash Javadekar had asked us to double the vaccination numbers and had assured to provide adequate stock. We accepted it as a challenge and increased the daily vaccination to 450,000 from 300,000. However, we have started facing shortage of vaccine stock and have to shut down many centres across the state as there is no stock left there,” the health minister told reporters later. “We have a stock of 1,400,000 vaccines left, which means the state has a stock of three days only and then vaccination would be stopped if fresh stock is not provided. We need a stock of at least 4,000,000 vaccines per week. As health minister of Maharashtra, I can guarantee we will achieve the target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries in the next 2-3 days as we have planned mobilization of the resources in that manner,” Tope added.“Vaccination is the most effective measure to control the pandemic at present,” the health minister said, urging the Centre to provide adequate stock and if needed, delay supplies of the stock in other states as the daily cases have breached the 50,000 mark in Maharashtra.He avoided making any allegations of bias against the Centre, but pointed out that there is a difference between what they say and what they do, when it comes to handling the Covid-19 pandemic. “I don’t believe the central government doesn’t want to provide vaccine stock as they have been doing it regularly, but the pace is slow. Dr Harsh Vardhan (union health minister) is a very soft spoken and helpful minister and urged him to give more attention towards Maharashtra,” he commented.Responding to the remarks, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the state government is expected to discuss the issue with the Centre, instead of disclosing them before the media. He stressed that Maharashtra is getting maximum stock of vaccine from the Centre, compared to other states.“The state government should discuss issues with the Centre instead of running away from the situation by speaking about issues in the media. The state government asks the opposition party (Bharatiya Janata Party) not to bring in politics in handling Covid-19 pandemic but its ministers and the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) do the same,” Fadnavis told reporters.He said that the state is getting enough stock for the target group on a regular basis for vaccination. “Sometimes it happens that the stock is left for a few days but then fresh stock arrives from the Centre as supplies are going across the states,” Fadnavis clarified.To increase vaccine production, the state owned Haffkine Institute has already sought permission from the Centre for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech that has developed Covid-19 vaccine — ‘Covaxin’. It has also sought permission for fill and finish operations of Covid vaccine in which Haffkine Institute will only fill vaccines in bottles and make them ready as a product.Haffkine is a public sector undertaking owned by the state government and has developed a number of vaccines that include anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-stock-of-vaccine-doses-to-last-three-more-days-101617822811108.html

The number of active cases also crossed the 500,000 mark with 501,559 active infections. The increasing number of cases in Maharashtra has started burdening its health infrastructure.

It also stated that 32.77% oxygen beds and 60.94% ICU beds are also occupied across the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to citizens last week, had indicated that the availability of beds will be a huge concern if cases continue to rise at its current pace. Between April 1 and 7, the state has reported over 360,000 new cases. Dr Pradip Vyas, principal secretary, the state health department, in a meeting chaired by Thackeray on Wednesday, said the number of patients in the state has increased thirty-fold since February 2021. On February 11, 2021, the state had 30,265 active cases. Vyas also said as per an estimation by the Centre, the number of active cases is expected to increase up to 1.2 million by the end of April. If compared to the first wave, there were 310,752 active cases on September 17, 2020, the state said.

State environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday tweeted, “The 2nd surge that is higher than the 1st has put massive pressure on our doctors, medical staff, frontline workers, Govt and Local Self Govt staff. But more worrisome is the rising cases in this pandemic. I urge all to stay home, stay safe and not endanger self or others.” In a meeting chaired by Thackeray with various trade bodies, Dr. Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, said, “The second wave is like a tsunami, we have to take all the required steps to prevent it. The new strain is also affecting young people and children. The solution lies in breaking the chain of the virus.” A surgeon from Mumbai tweeted, “BMC war room staff is really trying hard to get people the beds they desperately need. But the situation is very grim. I’m continually flooded with calls for beds of patients whose oxygen levels are crashing rapidly.

08-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Masks must in pvt cars, even if driving alone, says Delhi high court||It is compulsory for people to wear a mask in a private vehicle even if they are driving alone, the Delhi high court ordered on Wednesday, ruling that a private vehicle on the roads is also covered under the definition of a public place.The high court also came down on four lawyers who petitioned the court last year against fines imposed by the Delhi Police for violating the mask rule, observing that compliance by lawyers encourages common people to wear the masks.A single judge bench of justice Prathiba M Singh held that a moving vehicle, even if occupied at a given point in time by one person, will be a “public place” due to the immediate risk of exposure to other persons in varying circumstances to the outside world.“A mask acts as a suraksha kavach (protective shield) which will prevent the spread of the deadly virus,” the HC said, recalling that several experts, doctors and researchers have emphasised the need to wear face masks right from the early days of the pandemic.The judge said that a person driving alone could get infected while visiting a market, their workplace or a busy street, and go on to infect others who occupy the vehicle later.“If a person is travelling in the car alone, the said status is not a permanent one. It is merely a temporary phase. There could be other occupants in the car prior to the said phase and post the said phase. There could be elderly family members or children who may be picked up from the school or even simply friends or colleagues may travel in the car in the immediate future. Such persons can also be exposed to the virus if the occupant was not wearing the mask,” the court said in its 32-page judgment.Saurabh Sharma, a lawyer who was fined ₹500 for not wearing a mask, had challenged the penalty in his petition filed in September last year. Sharma said the officers who imposed the fine had failed to provide any executive order to establish that it was mandatory to wear masks while travelling alone in a private vehicle.Sharma’s petition echoed a view that had been articulated by many people on and off social media who argued that people should be allowed to take off their masks when driving alone.“Advocates as a class, owing to their legal training have a higher duty to show compliance especially in extenuating circumstances such as the pandemic. Wearing of masks cannot be made an ego issue. Compliance by advocates and lawyers would encourage the general public to show greater inclination to comply,” said the court.The Centre, which had first made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places in April last year, did not take a stand and left it to state governments to see how they wanted to implement the rule.Residents of the national capital, however, have reservations about the high court ruling.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi’s joint resident welfare association (RWA) forum, said the decision was “not fair”.“We have no option other than to obey the court order. But I think wearing a mask while driving a car with all windows closed should not be made mandatory. When all windows of a car are closed and the person is in the vehicle, then it is a private environment. The court should also take cognisance of political rallies and protests where hardly anyone is seen wearing masks or following social distancing norms,” Vohra said.It is not clear if the HC’s ruling will persuade other states to review their stand on the matter.Political parties seem to have opposing views on the ruling.Mudit Aggrawal, vice-president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, said, “I urge the court to reconsider their decision… This will lead to unnecessary harassment and corruption without any actual benefits in controlling Covid-19 cases.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, welcomed the decision.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We support the court’s ruling. We have even run mask and sanitiser distribution campaigns. We call upon our workers to encourage use of masks by distributing them wherever they are needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-masks-must-in-pvt-cars-even-if-driving-alone-says-delhi-high-court-101617821832429.html

But on Wednesday, there were 145 buses from BMTC, 1,124 private buses and 2,000 maxi cabs were allowed to ferry people as permitted by the transport department,” said an official of BMTC, requesting anonymity.Thousands of people were left stranded in Bengaluru and other parts of the state as buses account for most of the mass transport options in Karnataka and its capital.With buses off the road, auto-rickshaws and cabs reportedly charged over double the average cost of commute in most places.Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar on Wednesday wrote to the Railways for special train services to mitigate the impact of the bus strike.“This (strike) will cause severe hardship to travelling public. In addition due to upcoming festivals there will be a rush of people going out of Bangalore to their native places,” Kumar wrote in a letter to the general manager of the southwestern railways.The chief secretary requested for special trains on April 9 and 10.“The government has not called us for any talks but continue to give statements in the media that they are ready for talks. The government has asked to call off the strike and then come for talks which is conditional and could prolong the stalemate,” Vijay Bhaskar, a senior office bearer of the transport workers union, said.He said the government had threatened to use Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against them and was also creating an adverse public opinion against their legitimate demands to be paid on par with government employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bus-services-hit-as-rtc-workers-begin-strike-101617822089763.html

Jarkiholi, who is accused of sexually exploiting a woman after promising her job, was to appear before the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case, but he failed to do so after testing positive for Covid-19. Following his discharge, he was shifted to his house in Gokak. Citing Covid-19, Jarkiholi refused to talk to reporters waiting outside the hospital. On Tuesday, SIT officers visited the hospital to confirm reports of the BJP leader’s admission. An SIT officer told HT that doctors have advised Jarkiholi to remain in quarantine at home for two weeks. The officer added that the SIT will take a call on questioning him based on expert opinion. Jarkiholi was earlier questioned by the SIT on March 29, when he had sought four days’ time to answer their questions. Jarkiholi’s lawyer Shyam Sundar told reporters on Monday that his client could not appear for questioning because he was unwell. “I have been now officially informed that he has tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted at the Gokak government hospital. Based on inputs from the doctors as to when he will be fit, accordingly, we will inform the investigation officers,” Sundar said. The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the SIT to submit a report on the investigation so far. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, while issuing notice to the state government and other respondents, said, “We direct the respondent (SIT) to place on record in a sealed cover, report on the investigation so far carried out. Report shall be tendered on the next date-April 17,” read the order. During the hearing of two petitions filed by advocates Geetha Misra and S Umesh, the lawyers had claimed that police officials leaked sensitive investigation details to media personnel with ulterior motives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jarkiholi-shifted-from-hospital-to-stay-in-home-quarantine-101617822029768.html

Or have they granted him a special status…,” Yatnal said in Bengaluru on Wednesday.Yatnal has openly sought the removal of 78-year-old Yediyurappa from the top chair. He said Yediyurappa has already got a bonus of two years as chief minister and should resign on his own after April 17. The bypolls to two assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat will take place on April 17.The BJP has given Yatnal a show cause notice, but there has been no real effort to control the leader or his tirade against his own leader.Yatnal’s stand has given the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) more ammunition to attack Yediyurappa, who faces dissent from within his own government. Several BJP legislators have claimed that they have not been given any grants for developmental works as Yediyurappa continues to help turncoat ministers.Senior BJP leader and rural development and Panchayati Raj minister KS Eshwarappa had recently approached the Karnataka governor to complain that Yediyurappa had bypassed the minister and awarded projects from his department to legislators and others in violation of procedure and rules.Eshwarappa softened his stand against Yediyurappa on Wednesday as he said the national leadership was looking into the issue.“It’s a lie that I filed a complaint against the CM. The question of lodging a complaint does not arise at all. Yediyurappa is our CM. He is my leader,” Eshwarappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yatnal-continues-tirade-against-cm-101617822029183.html

In comparison, Bengaluru took 118 days from its first Covid-19 case on March 8, 2020 to breach the four-figure mark on July 7 last year, when it reported 1,172 of Covid-19 infections, according to government data.

On the growing number of cases, K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare minister on Wednesday said the government will take up more testing where positivity is high. “Nearly 5,000 cases have been reported in Bengaluru alone with a positivity rate of 5.56%. 25 out of 35 deaths in the state have been reported in Bengaluru. Tomorrow I have called a meeting of all senior officers of BBMP, Bengaluru Urban and Rural Districts. The prime minister will also hold a video-conference with all CMs,” he added.The highest case count in a single day in Bengaluru was on October 8 last year when it reported 5,121 infections in 24 hours. But the rapid pace of infections in the second wave, said to have commenced in the beginning of March, is likely to outdo that figure by within another week, experts said. The city has seen only two days without any fatalities due to Covid-19 this year, which highlights the severity of infection. Dr. CN Manjunath, director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research and member of the state’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19, said Bengaluru was taking around one fourth of the time taken last year. “Transmissibility in the second wave is faster and definitely higher as well,” Dr Manjunath told HT. According to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) total positive cases in the city came down from 18,551 in December last year to 10,311 in January and 6813 in February this year, until it saw another spike. Total positive cases went up to 31,886 in March and stood at 17,292 in April so far. Experts said the “release phenomena” saw an increased participation in religious fairs, political events, marriages and other public gatherings that later turned into super-spreader events. Dr V Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19, said there was a graded lifting of lockdown restrictions after the first wave, which helped control the spread. But people continue to move freely “as though Covid-19 has come and gone”. He said people had adopted caution even after the lifting of the restrictions, but that has now faded with time. “There is tremendous laxity in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Dr Ravi said. “This is being driven by clusters that occur in crowded cities and closed spaces,” he added. According to experts, the chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government, which continues to look at people entering the state, has failed to look within for the problem or find an appropriate solution to contain the surge. Meanwhile, the Bengaluru City Police have ordered a ban on use of gyms and swimming pools within the city. They have also imposed Section 144 of CrPC in the city. Bidar, where one of the bypoll constituencies (Basavakalyan) is located, reported 214 new cases on Wednesday, while neighbouring Kalaburagi reported 205 cases. Mysuru, about 125 km from Bengaluru, continued to see a sharp spike as it saw 243 new cases while Tumakuru reported 204 new cases. The mutation of the virus, experts said, showed a possibility of higher transmissibility but nothing to indicate so far conclusively that they were more severe.The Karnataka government hopes that increasing its vaccination cover will help the state contain the growing number of cases. Starting April 11, Covid-19 vaccination can be distributed in all private and government work places that have at least 100 beneficiaries above 45 years of age, the state government said in a statement on Wednesday.“Several large IT firms and industries had earlier requested us to allow vaccination at their premises. Companies can now provide vaccination to their employees at their offices if there are more than 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries. We have crossed 50 lakh inclinations in the state today. Soon we will reach 1 crore,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare minister said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-reports-rapid-growth-in-covid-cases-101617821969200.html

They found $8,000 during the search and tried to flee with it,” said the officer.As the suspects fled, the woman tried to chase them but she was allegedly assaulted. The suspects escaped in their car with the money even as the couple contacted their language interpreter in Delhi.The police were subsequently alerted and a case of robbery was registered. The suspects remained unidentified until late Wednesday evening.The couple arrived in Delhi from Russia in late March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/russian-couple-robbed-of-8-000-in-karol-bagh-101617820649532.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 5,506 Covid-19 cases, 20 more deaths||The fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to surge in Delhi, with cases hitting a fresh high for the year on Wednesday after 5,506 new infections were recorded.The seven-day rolling average of infections also crossed the 4,000 mark, which is for the first time since December 4 last year, indicating the return of the city’s Covid graph to levels not seen since the third wave that lasted from October to December in 2020.With a little over 90,000 tests, the city’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among the total samples tested — also shot up to 6.1%, on Wednesday, the highest since December 1.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a test positivity rate below 5% for a two-week period for an infection to be considered under control in an area. Delhi crossed this threshold on Monday for the first time in 124 days. The positivity rate dropped just below 5% on Tuesday, on the back of a record 103,453 new tests.Delhi’s fourth wave has seen infections rise sharply, with the number of cases increasing from less than 1,000 to over 5,000 within 16 days, showed Delhi government data.“Delhi, where there were less than 200 cases for two to three months, has crossed the 5,000 mark within three weeks. The infection has been around for a year and we know that the best way to protect oneself is to wear a mask and maintain social distance. I urge people to follow these precautions,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.Delhi also added 20 more deaths of Covid-19 to its toll, taking the overall fatality count to 11,133 on Wednesday.More than 15 people died of the infection on average daily over the last seven days. In comparison, 7.7 deaths were recorded on average daily the week before and 3.5 deaths the week before that.“The increase in the number of deaths always follows the curve of the infection. The severity of the infection is at the peak between the eighth and 12th day, so if the incidence is high today, the impact on deaths will be seen 10 days later,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).He added that mortalities have been fewer this year because people are more aware and reach hospitals on time. Health care facilities also have clinical protocols in place for appropriate treatment.The number of people hospitalised has been increasing sharply too along with the number of cases.Almost 3,000 beds have been added over the last one week; the occupancy has hovered at around 46% however.“The bed situation is getting worse by the day. Everything is gradually filling up as the number of cases goes up. Hospitals are again moving from non-Covid to Covid services,” said Dr Anant Mohan, head of the pulmonology department at AIIMS.The number of people in home isolation crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday. There are over 19,400 people living with the infection currently in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-5-506-covid-cases-20-deaths-101617820469646.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Few follow the rules at Delhi’s busy weekly markets||New Delhi: On Wednesday, when the national capital reported over 5500 fresh Covid-19 cases at a positivity rate of 6.10%, many weekly markets across the city were packed to capacity, with most shoppers clearly flouting social distancing norms.HT visited two such markets and saw poor compliance of social distancing protocols with shoppers jostling with each other for space.Last week, the Delhi government identified weekly markets among several super-spreader areas where enforcement efforts and awareness campaigns were required.At the weekly Wednesday market in Govindpuri, mask discipline was poor with little to no social distancing, despite public address systems relaying announcements about standard operating procedures.Tina, 18, a resident of Govindpuri, who was at the market along with her siblings and mothers, said that the market was crowded as usual despite the government confirming that Delhi was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection.“The market is usually crowded on Wednesday. If you go by the crowds, you’d think that the pandemic is over,” said Tina, who goes by her first name. She said that while there were announcements reminding people to maintain physical distancing, shoppers were not mindful of the rules.Pooja Jaiswal, another visitor, who was seen without a mask, said that she was surprised by the footfall at the market. “I’m in Delhi for a short visit and decided to do some essential shopping. I didn’t anticipate that the market would be crowded to this extent,” said Jaiswal.Vendors in the market, however, said that they were reminding visitors to wear masks and follow all protocols. “Out of 100 people, if 2-3 people are not wearing a mask, we cannot blame the entire market. We can’t do much if someone doesn’t want to follow the rules,” said Manish Kumar, who runs a fabric shop during the weekly market.Kumar said that night curfew, which started on Tuesday night, will have terrible consequences for vendors who were already facing losses.“Things were getting back on track for us since January but once again, they are going downhill. Due to the curfew, our earnings will be reduced by 50%. We are following all protocols but continue to suffer. Since it’s summer, people use to step out to shop in the evening around 6-7 pm. By the time, we start selling, it’s already 8 pm and by 9 pm, we need to start wrapping up. When will sell our goods?” said Kumar.The government has imposed night curfew until April 30 across Delhi, from 10pm till 5 am.At the weekly market at Sadiq Nagar, lack of mask discipline was the main concern. A significant number of people were seen lowering down the mask to speak or they had worn it incorrectly.Due to a relatively lesser crowd, visitors maintained sufficient distance from one another. Delhi police officials were making announcements at the market. “We are reminding people about the curfew timings so that they can return home well in time,” said a police official, who did not wish to be identified.Shopkeepers said that social distancing was not a problem since limited people were stepping out due to the recent surge in cases. They said that while protocols were being followed, the business had suffered. “If 80% of our customers used to come earlier, only around 20% come now. The numbers have reduced after Holi. Our earnings have been affected and will further reduce if restrictions continue,” said Suresh Kumar, 69, who runs a grocery shop at the weekly market. Kumar said that the government had not taken any steps for the welfare of hawkers despite the losses they had suffered in the past year.Another shopkeeper, Baleshwar Singh Yadav, said the footfall has gone down due to the fear of Covid-19. Yadav said the curfew was detrimental to the business of hawkers. “The fear of Covid-19 has set in again. They (shoppers) are not stepping out anyway. To add to our miseries, the government has imposed a curfew,” said Yadav.Ramesh Kumar, head of the South Delhi Weekly Market association, said all vendors had been given directives to enforce SOPs and they were doing the same. Kumar said that the association had arranged for public address systems at different markets to ensure that rules are followed. “We have hired people to manage crowds and also make announcements regularly through the speaker. We are following all rules but the government should think of our welfare too. If we set up our markets at 6-7 pm and start wrapping up by 9 pm, we hardly get any time to conduct business. Our livelihood depends on these markets. The government should think about us as well,” said KumarRP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said that the local police were trying to curb social distancing violation at the weekly markets by prosecuting violators aggressively. “With the district administration, we are dishing out challans to as many violators as we are able to. We already have a public announcement system in place, but we are trying to dissuade them from being careless by fining them,” said Meena.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-few-follow-the-rules-at-delhi-s-busy-weekly-markets-101617820409555.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Police fan out to spread the word as Delhi adjusts to night curfew||From making announcements asking people to reach homes early to issuing fines to violators, the first two days of the implementation of the night curfew in the capital saw teams of Delhi police personnel hitting the roads much before the restrictions started at 10pm on Tuesday and Wednesday.Led by district deputy commissioners of police (DCP), the police teams were spotted in prominent markets like Connaught Place and Khan Market, in addition to other important stretches across the city. Officers said multiple teams have been formed at every police station to check curfew violations.The night curfew -- from 10pm to 5am -- till April 30 was ordered by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease.Data shared by the police showed that police filed 200 FIRs, temporarily detained 534 violators and fined 842 people for not wearing masks on the first day of the night curfew. Police said the focus on Tuesday night was on informing people about the new rule, adding that more teams will be posted on the roads from Wednesday night.Owners and management of banquet halls, restaurants, bars and shopkeepers in markets were among those against whom FIRs were filed under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Disaster Management Act.Also Read| 'Parties were being held': Delhi health minister on why night curfew was imposedPolice said that almost all the 1,000 police control room (PCR) vans spread out across most market places in the city, using their loud speakers to advise people to stay indoors. In southeast Delhi, police teams coordinated with managements of gurdwaras, temples and mosques to inform citizens about the curfew rules.Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said police across the city are stringently following the DDMA directions on the curfew.In New Delhi area, which has prominent markets such as Connaught Place and Khan Market, district DCP Eish Singhal said, “Before 10pm, our officers had started making announcements. Through word of mouth, news of the curfew had spread and most people complied with the rules. We issued 76 challans and registered one case. Our intention is not to just prosecute people, it is also to ensure that they start complying with the rules and head back home on their own well in time before the 10pm deadline.”In north Delhi, police focused on ensuring that only people engaged in essential services were on the road. “We ensured that vehicles engaged in delivery of essential items were not stopped. Many vehicles take the Ring Road (that passes through north Delhi and connects the national Capital with nearby state of Haryana) to enter or leave Delhi and we helped such goods pass the district without any hindrance. We also visited markets in the Walled City and ensured that only people engaged in essential services were on the road. There are trucks that load and unload items that come under essential services in Old Delhi market. We did not face any problems as people were cooperative. We issued around 40-45 challans against those who were flouting the night curfew rules,” said the north district’s DCP, Anto Alphonse.In southeast Delhi, which has areas such as Lajpat Nagar, New Friends Colony and Jamia Nagar, the curfew rules were announced from loudspeakers of masjids, gurdwaras and temples. The guidelines issued by DDMA were circulated among locals through social media. “All streets, passages and subways connecting the main roads were blocked using barricades to restrict the movement of vehicles for better imposition of night curfew,” said the south east district’s DCP RP Meena.Each district administration also deployed teams on Wednesday to enforce the rules.“The respective MCDs have been asked to ensure restaurants and markets are shut by 10pm. Further, SDMs have been directed to be on the field from 9pm to midnight to monitor the situation. Teams have also been deployed from the DM’s office to assist the police. Also, the district control room will work round-the-clock at the DM’s office to monitor the curfew and to issue e-passes,” said another revenue official.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the seven-hour-long curfew was imposed in the capital as people were found organising parties and other events where Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, were often ignored. “The night curfew has been imposed because there were reports about parties, which cause unnecessary gatherings and put people in close contact. Hence the night curfew is aimed to avoid this situation because if even one is positive among the 50 people, all 50 would test positive,” he said while interacting with reporters.Also Read| Night curfew in Delhi to control Covid-19 spread. See picturesGovernment officials, essential workers and those travelling to airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres and hospitals are exempt from the seven-hour night curfew, with some requiring e-passes. The order mandates all restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments to shut by 10pm.Pending e-passes adds to worryMeanwhile, a large number of people complained of not getting e-passes despite applying through the Delhi government website -- www.delhi.gov.in -- on Wednesday. Some even queued up at various DMs’ offices, hoping to get the pass.“The application status keeps showing ‘pending’. I work in a medical shop in Rajouri Garden which remains open round-the-clock. Now, because my e-pass is getting delayed, I have to shut my store at 9pm itself today because my staff and I will need at least one hour to reach our homes. I hope the government expedites the e-pass system,” said Ritesh Singh, an owner of a medical store.Data showed that till Wednesday noon, the 11 districts of Delhi had collectively received 73,154 applications for e-passes, out of which 6,133 were approved, 34,759 were rejected and 30,940 were pending.A senior revenue official said that the pendency is also because of certain grey areas for which different districts have raised queries. “The revenue headquarters has received queries from district administrations on whether e-passes should be granted for food delivery persons, airport cargo transport, weddings and so on. Other queries also include whether construction activities and operation of small factories and production units should be allowed during the curfew hours. A detailed clarification on these issues are likely to be issued on Thursday,” said the official on condition of anonymity.When asked about the pendency in applications and issues with the government website, Jain said, “It has begun from yesterday only. So, I think these teething problems will be sorted out in a day or two.”Talking about the effectiveness of the night curfew, the health minister said such curbs cannot be limited to certain parts of the city. “It has to be applied to all of Delhi. However it has been done only for the time being and we will analyse the impact. It is not a harsh decision as people generally finish their work by 10pm. Taxis are allowed and if someone is coming from outside and have valid tickets, they can travel. For restaurants and hotels, the timing is anyway 11pm. I believe that the condition of the virus spread is not mellow, so we have to be aware and careful. People talk in extremes, either they are in favour of a complete lockdown or none at all. There has to be a middle ground as well,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-fan-out-to-spread-the-word-as-capital-adjusts-to-night-curfew-101617820410199.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||As Covid-19 cases rise, Delhi health minister Jain warns of another peak||With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spreading at a fast pace in the state, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday expressed concerns that the new cases may cross the previous record of 8,593 recorded on November 11 last year.“In Delhi, where less than 200 cases were being reported each day for two to three months, the number has crossed the 5,000 mark within three weeks. The pace at which the cases are increasing, we worry that it might break the previous record. We cannot say anything for sure, but many other states have a higher positivity rate than Delhi,” said Jain.“Delhi’s positivity rate is 5%, it’s 25% in Maharashtra and 16% in Chhattisgarh; many states have a positivity of over 10%. If the positivity rate in Delhi increases to that level, think about the situation we will be in,” he added.Delhi reported 5,506 cases on Wednesday after conducting over 90,000 tests, putting the positivity rate at 6.10%. This is the highest positivity rate the city has seen since December 1. The city also saw 20 deaths on Wednesday.The government has already directed officials to increase the number of beds in 11 government and 54 private sector hospitals. The city has already added over 2,000 beds in the last two to three days and another 2,000 are likely to be added in the next couple of days, taking the total number of available beds for Covid patients to around 10,000.The government has also instituted a night curfew between 10pm and 5am. “There were reports of people partying. What happens when people gather in large numbers and are in close contact unnecessarily? Even if one person is positive and 50 people have gathered, all of them get it. The measure is not for a long time, but for a short while to control the number of cases. We will see what the impact of the night curfew is. It is not a harsh step. People usually finish all their work before 10pm. This step is between a complete lockdown and complete relaxation,” said Jain.He also informed that 84,213 Covid vaccine shots were administered till 10 pm on Tuesday, of which 75% were given in government centres and 25% in private hospitals.“People over the age of 45 years need the vaccine more, but those between 18 and 45 are getting infected now. It is spreading among them because they are mobile. They are not getting a severe disease but they spread it to their parents, grandparents,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-cases-rise-jain-warns-of-another-peak-101617820351498.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Food corporation not procuring wheat at MSP in Delhi, alleges Rai||Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday alleged that the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which comes under the central government, has not yet opened counters for procurement of wheat at Delhi’s grain markets at the minimum support price (MSP) – an allegation that was denied by the Union ministry of food and public distribution and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).MSP is the assured price at which the government buys major farm produce to give farmers assured returns for their yield. It also acts as a base price for private traders. MSP applies to 23 crops, which include paddy and wheat.“FCI has not opened a single counter for wheat procurement in Delhi, yet it is making false claims of purchasing the crops at MSP rates from April 1. Despite three letters of plea addressed to the FCI, it has not opened its wheat procurement counters, forcing farmers to sell their wheat below MSP through commissioning agents. The central government determines the MSP and the FCI purchases, but the BJP is falsely accusing the Delhi government of not buying wheat at MSP,” said Rai, who is in charge of the agriculture department in Delhi.“This is the reality of the Prime Minister’s assurances of buying crops at MSP. This is why it is imperative to have a law for MSP. It is our demand that the Central government begin purchasing wheat at MSP from Najafgarh and Narela Mandi, and also investigate and act against those making false claims of shops opening in Delhi from April 1,” said Rai, expressing solidarity with farmer groups who have gathered at Delhi’s borders against three contentious farm laws passed in the Parliament and demanding a new law concerning MSP.However, a spokesperson of the Union ministry of food and public distribution dismissed the allegation and said, “The contentions of Delhi state government are not true.In fact the FCI Delhi region is fully prepared to procure wheat from farmers of Delhi at three centres -- FSD Mayapuri, FSD Narela and APMC Najafgarh mandi,which have been completely operational from April 1, 2021. Till date, 158 quintals of wheat from FSD Narela has been purchased by FCI Delhi region.”The Delhi BJP said in a press statement, “FCI has started the purchase of wheat at MSP in Narela from April 5. On the other hand, farmers in Delhi are still looking forward to the fulfilment of two promises made by the Kejriwal government. First, the payment of 50% over and above MSP to farmers and, second, free electricity for irrigation lines. Tomorrow (Thursday), Delhi BJP’s Kisan Morcha will hold a demonstration near the chief minister’s residence demanding payment of 50% above MSP and free electricity for farmers.”Delhi has around 800 hectares of agricultural land, show government records. Most of it is located in the western, northern and north-west peripheries of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/food-corporation-not-procuring-wheat-at-msp-in-delhi-alleges-rai-101617820350854.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Covid protocols in place inside schools, social distancing norms flouted outside||While Delhi schools have started taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of students appearing in the ongoing offline pre-boards and practical exams, amid the spike Covid-19 cases, many parents raised concerns about the physical distancing norm being violated outside several schools in the national capital.Currently, students of classes 9 to 12 (academic year 2020-21) are allowed to visit schools for examinations and board exam preparations. While the majority of private schools in Delhi have already completed their class 9 and 11 exams, the only students going to school are those in classes 10 and 12, whose practical exams are underway.In government schools, students of classes 9 to 12 are going to school for their practicals, pre-boards, and mid-term examinations.Despite clear guidelines from the directorate of education (DoE) for ensuring the entry and exit of students in a staggered manner, large groups of students can be seen outside many schools, violating physical distancing norms.Outside the government girls’ school in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave, a large number of students could be seen without face masks and standing in groups on Wednesday afternoon. Similar scenes were seen outside several schools at ITO, Minto Road, Jasola, and Subhash Nagar, among other areas.Also Read| Covid-19: Few follow the rules at Delhi’s busy weekly marketsAnju Chaudhary, the mother of a class 9 student at a government school in Subhash Nagar, said, “I had gone to pick my son from school on Wednesday after his midterm exam and I saw students standing in large groups without maintaining any distance. We have heard in the news that students of many schools have tested Covid-19 positive recently and the violation of norms makes me fearful about the safety of my son. The government should either postpone the exams or instruct schools to ensure the safety of children. ”Many parents shared similar concerns. Sushil Kumar, the father of a class 12 student at a private school in Jasola, said, “My daughter is going to the school for her practical exams these days and I have seen how students violate the mask rule and social distancing norms outside the school. It makes me doubt the precautions being taken inside the school as well. She has to appear for her board exams from May 4. What will happen if something unfortunate happens now?”Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, said the government should either postpone the exams or issue fresh guidelines to schools. “This fresh wave of Covid-19 is scary. Several cases have been reported among students and teachers in the past few days,” she said.At least seven students tested positive for Covid-19 at Arya Kanya Gurukul in New Rajender Nagar on Monday. The principal and some staff members of another private school, DAV Sreshta Vihar, had also been tested Covid-19 positive last week. Besides, another private school in west Delhi on Monday cancelled a scheduled exam after a class 12 student tested positive.Several principals said it is a challenge for them to ensure physical distancing outside the school premises. The principal of a government school in Karawal Nagar said, “Most of our teachers are busy with invigilation work, while others are busy with distribution of books, ration and even Covid-19 related work. It’s not possible for schools to deploy staff members outside the campus to ensure enforcement of social distancing norms. It would be better if the government could deploy some civil defence volunteers for the purpose.”A senior official at the Delhi government’s education department, who asked not to be named, said, “It’s not possible for the government to postpone practical exams of board classes at a time when the CBSE board exams are near. Schools have already been directed to strictly abide by the Covid-19 protocols. The government might consider the ongoing midterm exams for class 9 and 11 as their final exams if the situation continues to remain the same.”Meanwhile, officials at several schools, both government and private, said they have stepped up the Covid-19 preventive measures. Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar, said, “We have fixed seats for every student so that they can directly go to their assigned room, sit at their assigned seat and take the exam. We have also assigned duties to our staff at the gates to ensure students do not stand in groups while entering and leaving the school premises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-protocols-in-place-inside-schools-social-distancing-norms-flouted-outside-101617820350227.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Will not demolish Lal Masjid, Centre informs Delhi HC||The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that it will not demolish the Lal Masjid, an ancient mosque situated on a disputed land near Lodhi Road in the national capital.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma told justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that the Union government will not demolish the mosque till April 29, when the case will be next heard by the court.The submission came on a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board, challenging the demolition order of the mosque in village Aliganj, alongside Link Road. The Waqf Board plea, filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, said even when the land dispute is pending before the Waqf Tribunal, the Centre and the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) have asked them to vacate the mosque as the structure was going to be demolished.On Tuesday, the court asked the Centre and the CRPF if they had plans to demolish the mosque.The Waqf petition has also said since time immemorial, the land in question has been occupied by a graveyard and the Lal Masjid. However, in 2017, the land of the graveyard was taken over by the Centre, a dispute which is pending adjudication before the Waqf Tribunal.On Tuesday, appearing for the Waqf Board, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose submitted that even though the tribunal was made functional and appointments were made on court orders, since December 2020, the tribunal is not operational as the posts of two members are lying vacant.He had said the Centre’s Land and Development Officer (L&DO)is taking advantage of the situation and on March 31, the SHO of Basti Nizamuddin police station visited the site and told the imam that the mosque will be demolished since the area was to be used by CRPF for canteen, barracks and parking.He sought that the tribunal be constituted and the matter be decided before taking any untoward step.On Wednesday, justice Sachdeva, while taking on record the statement of the ASG, also asked the Delhi government to expedite the filling of vacancies in the Waqf Tribunal.

The BJP, however, alleged that AAP workers were not wearing masks or distancing during the protest.The Delhi Police broke up the protest, arguing that no gatherings in the city are allowed, as per Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders.Senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the country’s population of 1.3 billion has the first right over Covid-19 vaccines that have been produced and manufactured by scientists in India.“Before Pakistan and Afghanistan, every Indian citizen has the right to get vaccinated first. It is being said that one of the widespread variants of coronavirus is affecting children below the age of 15. Today, the number of Covid-19 cases in India is among the highest in the world, because of which the country is getting defamed globally. But instead, the Centre is planning to export the vaccine to 68 countries only for the Prime Minister to gain applause,” he said.The Delhi BJP, however, lashed out at the AAP for allegedly shirking Covid norms.“The people of Delhi are questioning the double standards of the AAP. On one hand, the AAP government is slapping fines of up to ₹2,000 on people for not wearing masks. On the other, the party is holding protests where no one is wearing a mask or distancing,” said Praveen Shankar Kapoor, of the Delhi BJP. htc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-protests-against-vaccine-exports-101617820349003.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Civic bodies keep crematoriums ready to cope with possible rise in Covid death toll||Taking note of the steep rise in Covid-19 cases, and apprehending a similar rise in related fatalities, Delhi’s three civic bodies on Wednesday said they are prepared to deal with any additional toll if the need arises. Authorities of the north, east and south civic bodies said they have resources to handle 450-500 Covid-19 fatalities (confirmed and suspected) every day across their 21 facilities — crematoriums and burial grounds. According to the daily health bulletin, the city recorded 5,506 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday and 20 deaths. The city recorded the highest single-day death on November 18 last year, during the third wave of the infection in the city, when 131 people succumbed to the infection. As new infections and deaths peaked during the third wave, crematoriums struggled to cope with the increased fatalities. The Delhi high court, too, had asked the government to indicate steps it had taken to manage crematoriums and graveyards in the national capital.During the third wave, people had to wait outside crematoriums and cemeteries for five to six hours to conduct the last rites of loved ones who succumbed to the virus.Covid-19 deaths have increased sharply in the Capital over the past few weeks, since the outbreak of the fourth wave. In the first week of March, the Capital recorded less than two daily deaths of the infection. This number jumped to 15 in the first week of April, giving rise to fears that the city’s crematoriums have struggle to meet demands, if the spike continues.“Seeing the current steep rise in Covid-19 cases, we cannot help but be apprehensive about the possibility of the death toll rising as well. So, we have made standby arrangements. At Nigambodh Ghat, we have opened three more CNG furnaces, taking the total count to six. We have also increased the number of platforms for cremation to 120 from 104,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said.He said their crematoriums and graveyards can perform nearly 200 last rites a day.Data from the three civic bodies showed that there are 21 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (confirmed and suspected) are being cremated or buried. Of these, eight facilities are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, eight under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). Officials said these facilities can dispose of the bodies of nearly 400 people who have died of Covid-19, if operating at full capacity. “We have eight facilities, including crematoriums and burial grounds, where Covid-19 bodies are disposed of. These facilities can handle 215 bodies per day. We have also made additional arrangements to perform last rites of Covid-19 victims,” Narendra Chawla, leader of the house, SDMC, said.He said that a new CNG crematorium, with two furnaces, was inaugurated in Green Park in February, and the facility can be converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility if required.Sandeep Kapoor, former chairman standing committee, EDMC, said the civic body has dedicated five crematoriums and graveyards for Covid-19 victims and added that there is no rush at any of the facilities so far.“We will increase the number of wood pyres if need be. We have also ample space available in graveyards and, so far, there is no cause to worry,” Kapoor said.Experts, however, say the city is better prepared this time around to keep the Covid fatalities low. “We still cannot be sure whether the disease is less severe this time around. However, the case fatality ratio is definitely lower now as compared to the first wave of cases (last March-April). This is because the hospitals were not well equipped back then; there was a shortage of PPE kits, beds, non-invasive and invasive ventilators. The treatment protocol had also not been finalised -- now we know what to do at what stage of the disease. Also, people have become more aware. They are coming to the hospitals on time; almost everyone has a pulse oximeter to monitor their oxygen saturation,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/civic-bodies-keep-crematoriums-ready-to-cope-with-possible-rise-in-covid-death-toll-101617820291481.html

Names and personal details of protected witnesses are redacted in their statements.The high court, which had on March 18 reserved its order on Tanha’s bail plea, had asked the police to file written submissions, unredacted copies of witness statements and other relevant documents.During the proceedings, the court also frowned on the prosecution for the absence of unredacted statements of the witnesses with them.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Rajat Nair, representing the police, said these are protected witnesses and the unredacted copies are with the trial court only. He pointed out that when the investigating officer had applied for protection of witnesses, the statements were signed and sealed by the trial court judge and redacted copies were given to the investigation officer.Tanha has challenged a trial court’s October 26, 2020, order which dismissed his bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tanha-bail-plea-hc-seeks-unredacted-statements-of-protected-witnesses-101617820290841.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||DMRC steps up measures to ensure social distancing on trains, inside stations||With Covid-19 cases in the city on an upward spiral, the Delhi Metro has stepped up crowd control measures to ensure social distancing inside stations and aboard trains, including increasing the number of enforcement teams and temporarily shutting entry into Metro stations to limit crowds.The Delhi Metro’s ridership has increased consistently since the service resumed operations in September 2020 after the lockdown. Data seen by HT shows that the average passenger journey in September last year was 619,242, but it crossed 2.6 million in March this year.The increase in the number of commuters, officials admit, has made crowd management challenging. The Metro on Tuesday temporarily closed entry to four stations on the Yellow line (Samaypur Badli to HUDA City Centre) to control the swelling crowds.While entry to Patel Chowk, Chandni Chowk, New Delhi and Chawri Bazaar stations was closed for around 10 minutes, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials said passengers were allowed to deboard trains and exit the stations. “This is part of our crowd control measures to ensure social distancing at the stations and on trains,” said a DMRC official.DMRC officials said that though passenger journeys have increased since September, they are still just around 50% of the numbers recorded during the corresponding period last year. For instance, the Metro recorded 4.3 million passenger journeys in March 2020.With the Delhi government on Tuesday imposing a night curfew between 10pm and 5am, the Metro body expects the number of commuters to drop as well. According to the state government’s guidelines, only essential service providers with valid ID cards and government-issued passes are allowed to travel in the Metro after 10pm.The DMRC has also stepped up measures to check for Covid-19 protocol violations.“We now have seven teams — up from four earlier — to crack down on violations. The number of penalties issued has increased considerably in March, when cases began to increase,” said a DMRC official.In September last year, 5,180 people were penalised for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. But in January and February this year, the numbers dropped to 3,131 and 2,823 respectively. But the number of penalties has again increased. A senior DMRC official said, “In March, we penalised 7,058 people for violating Covid protocols. Since we resumed operations, 29,267 people have been penalised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-steps-up-measures-to-ensure-social-distancing-on-trains-inside-stations-101617820290213.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||Clean Yamuna project: 13 effluent treatment plants slapped with fine of ₹12 crore||Environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has issued show cause notices to 13 common effluent treatment plants (CETP), which are entrusted with the treatment of wastewater in the city, and imposed environment compensation charge of over ₹12 crore for violating protocols under the Clean Yamuna project.“In a bid to fulfil the decision of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to clean the Yamuna by 2023, the DPCC has issued show cause notices for imposing total environmental compensation of ₹12.05 crore to 13 CETPs. CETPs have been found not complying with prescribed effluent standards even after repeated directions being given by the DPCC. The Delhi government has found CETPs to be non-functional or not properly functioning, as a result of which the Yamuna is getting more polluted,” said Rai in a press statement.He further said the compensation was calculated on the basis of monthly analysis reports of the DPCC. “CETPs play a key role in treating the polluted waters from the industries, and, therefore, the prescribed effluent standards must be maintained. After repeated interventions in cases where they have not complied with our directions, stern action has been taken and we will monitor the situation,” Rai said.According to Rai, 13 CETPs, with a total capacity of 212.3 MLD (million litres daily), are in operation in Delhi. The CETPs, which are in Wazirpur, Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, SMA, GTK, Okhla, Mangolpuri, Nangloi, Badli, Jhilmil, Lawrence Road and Naraina, have been constructed to treat industrial effluent/wastewater generated in the 17 industrial areas of Delhi.While 11 of them are managed by cooperative societies, two are operated by a private limited company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clean-yamuna-project-13-effluent-treatment-plants-slapped-with-fine-of-12-crore-101617820228931.html
08-04-2021||Education||JNU imposes night curfew in line with Delhi govt's order||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration has imposed a night curfew on its campus from 10pm to 5am till April 30, in line with a Delhi government order that puts in place similar restrictions in the national capital.A notice issued by JNU registrar Anirban Chakraborti on Tuesday said that as part of the curfew, dhabas and canteens on campus will shut by 9pm, and library timings will be restricted.“Dr BR Ambedkar Central Library will stay open from 9am to 8pm on weekdays, and 10am to 6pm on weekends and holidays till further notice,” the notice read.“However, there will be no restrictions on the movement of people engaged in emergency services, in cases of medical emergency, and on the supply of goods during the curfew period on the production of a valid ID card,” it added.People travelling to or from the airport, railway stations, or bus terminals will be exempt from the curbs as well, upon producing valid tickets. Shops selling groceries, fruits, medicines, and ATMs have also been exempt.Movement within campus, and all entries and exits will be “restricted” for all residents. The University’s security branch has been asked to comply with the instructions and ensure that all gates are shut during the curfew period.“Anyone who violates the above directions and Covid-19 protocols... shall be liable for disciplinary action,” the notice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnu-imposes-night-curfew-in-line-with-delhi-govt-order-101617820169486.html
08-04-2021||Delhi||19 Tihar prisoners hospitalised after testing Covid positive, jail on high alert||At least 19 prisoners in the Tihar Jail have tested positive for Covid-19 and are admitted to different city hospitals, senior prison officials who were aware of the matter said, adding that the authorities were high alert and monitoring the health of all inmates.A senior prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said it was suspected that a new asymptomatic inmate may have spread the infection. The jail staff, designated front line workers, has already been vaccinated.However, with the number of inmates at its highest at 20,120 --- twice the jail’s sanctioned capacity of 10,026, experts have cautioned that immediate measures should be taken to decongest the prison so that adequate measures for isolating new inmates before being transferred to barracks are taken and social distancing is observed. Experts suggested that the government may consider releasing convicts on special parole and interim bail like last year when prisoners were released after the pandemic broke out.Last year, when the pandemic broke out, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole to ensure social distancing in jail. However, between February 6 and March 18, almost all have surrendered, leaving little space for isolation of suspected cases and new inmates, a second prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said.“With prison population increasing daily, breaking new records, it will be difficult to create space for isolation.The government should at least release those convicts who had surrendered on time in February,” the officer said.Advocate Ajay Verma, former convener of the National Forum for Prison Reforms -- a group of lawyers that fights for implementation of reforms across prisons — said, “The government should immediately start work on decongesting the jail. Prisoners who surrendered in February and March could be sent back temporarily again on parole on interim bail. If such prisoners did not pose a threat when they were out for nearly 10 months, why would they be a threat again. It is important to have social distancing in prison.”A second officer, who also requested to remain anonymous, said with thousands of prisoners who were released on special parole last year being back in jail, the situation has worsened. “We are on high alert and monitoring the health of all inmates. Between February 6 and March 18, around 6,000 prisoners surrendered after staying out of the jail for nearly a year. These prisoners were released on special parole and interim bail last year when the pandemic broke out, as one of the first measures to decongest the prison. During the first three waves of the infection, they were all out. It is an unfortunate coincidence that they have returned while the cases have started rising again,” the officer, who is also involved in the Covid containment measures, said.Until February, when the 6,000-odd prisoners were out on Covid-19 parole and interim bail, the prison department designated jail number 2 in Tihar complex and another jail at Mandoli for isolating new inmates. But now, these jails are packed with prisoners.Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel confirmed that 19 prisoners have tested Covid-19 positive and were admitted to different hospitals in the city.“As a precaution, we have admitted the prisoners to hospitals. The prison population has crossed 20,000 but we are taking all possible measures within the jail complex to ensure social distancing. Our officers are at work round-the-clock and checking for possible symptoms among prisoners.We conduct an extensive medical examination of all inmates once arrive at the prison. Those who show any flu-like symptoms are immediately quarantined,” the director general said.Officials said a separate drive to vaccinate prisoners above 45 years of age is also on. Until Tuesday evening, at least 161 prisoners above 45 have been vaccinated, they added. The jail hospital in sub-jail number 3 has been designated as a vaccination centre.Former Tihar law officer, Sunil Gupta, who worked in the prison for more than three decades, said, “It is important to decongest the prison. We have in the past used school buildings as temporary jails. If the population is now over 20,000, the authorities should not take any chances. During the Emergency, when the prison population was increasing, the jail administration had set up tents and created more spaces within the prison complex. Some steps have to be taken immediately.”Till date, two prisoners have died of Covid-19. As many as 293 jail officials, including the director general Goel, were infected but they have all recovered. At least 139 prisoners have been infected till date, according to the prison’s Covid data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-over-20-000-inmates-packed-in-its-jails-19-test-positive-at-tihar-101617820168981.html
08-04-2021||Noida||Noida: Night curfew, cap on guests plague weddings||The night curfew imposed in Delhi on Tuesday, coupled with the Uttar Pradesh government’s guidelines capping the number of guests attending weddings in the state, has come as a blow to Noida. People are either cancelling their booking in banquets and halls for wedding functions, or worrying over which guest to invite and whom to leave out.Banquet operators said they have been getting calls from their clients to cancel and refund their bookings.“Three weddings planned in our hall were such where the bride’s side is from Noida but the groom’s side was supposed to come from Delhi. It is nearly impossible for the baraat (wedding procession) to arrive in Noida before 10pm. Many guests have to go back home to Delhi. Because of such issues, two of our bookings have been cancelled,” said the manager of a wedding hall in sector-16’s World Trade Tower.Pavan Verma, a resident of Green Arch apartments in Noida Extension, has postponed the engagement ceremony of his daughter that was scheduled to take place on April 25.“As soon as I heard the new guidelines on Monday, I decided to cancel the booking for the ceremony. Thankfully, the banquet hall owner has agreed to refund the token amount paid after a deducting 10%,” said Verma, who had booked a banquet in Greater Noida.Another banquet hall owner said the restrictions are hurting those who have bigger halls.“Big banquet halls are operated in a way such that it can accommodate up to 300-400 guests. With the restrictions in place, we will have to increase our prices if only 100 people are allowed because the fixed prices will be same, be it for a gathering of 300 people or 100. Because of this, clients have cancelled bookings with us and moved to smaller banquets where prices are lower,” said Shashank Gupta, who runs Rajdhani party hall in sector-104, adding that smaller banquets will charge much less for a gathering of 100 people.“Moreover, we have to give in to clients’ requests for refund on booking amount and return the money,” said Gupta.Making arrangements for stay of Delhi guests With just a fortnight to go for a host of functions lined up for majority of weddings, most residents in Noida who had functions planned are now finding it embarrassing to ask some of their guest to not come for the ceremony.“The wedding invites have already been sent. Earlier, we had decided the groom’s side will have 100 guests and the bride’s side will have another 100. However, now we have decided to have 50 guests each from both sides and brainstorming on whom to say sorry to and whom to invite,” said M C Singhal, whose son’s wedding has been planned at a banquet hall in sector 62.He added the banquet hall owner offered him a solution. “The banquet hall owner said since there is a cap on the number of guests in one hall, he will make a booking for another hall in my name so that I can invite all 200 guests. However, I refused as I do not want to violate any guidelines,” he said.Those who have guests coming in from Delhi are also in a fix. “We have a ring ceremony planned for April 24 and the wedding is scheduled for the next day. Since a night curfew has been imposed in Delhi, I doubt if our guests will be able to leave the ring ceremony on April 24 before 10pm. In such short notice, I have little option but to arrange for their overnight stay in Noida itself,” said Mina Chaturvedi, whose daughter’s wedding will be held at a banquet hall in sector 71.Some people are making changes in timing of their functions so that guests coming from Delhi can leave on time. “We have a mehendi function in sector-104 that was earlier supposed to start at 7pm. Now, we have preponed the timing to 5pm so that guests coming from Delhi can leave before 10pm,” said Prakhar Mohan Mathur, a resident of Sector 75.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-night-curfew-cap-on-guests-plague-weddings-101617817528558.html
08-04-2021||Pune||Indiscriminate use, hoarding of Remdesivir create injection shortage in Pune||City hospitals have started facing acute shortage of Remdesivir as there has been a surge in demand for the injection. As per the current needs, Pune requires at least 8,000-8,500 vials of the drug daily and gets a supply of about 16,000-17,000 vials every alternate day. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have stated that hoarding of the injection could cause artificial shortage while Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that indiscriminate use of the life-saving injection is being administered without following protocol issued on March 23 this year. To curb the misuse of the drug, the district administrations have now been asked to investigate any indiscriminate use of the drug and also capped the price of the drug between ₹1,100 and ₹1,400. The health minister on Wednesday said that to curb the shortage of oxygen the state might also decide to shut industries that consume maximum oxygen. During the Wednesday’s press conference, Tope said that all district administrations have been asked to ensure that every injection is used judiciously. “During the meeting with officials from each district, I stressed on the monitoring if there’s any indiscriminate use of Remdesivir. The state is getting 50,000 doses every day and all of them are being consumed, leading to shortage,” said Tope. The anti-viral dose is being used to treat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome patients before it was directed for Covid-19 treatment last year. Currently, doctors and hospitals are prescribing the injection even for those suffering with mild problem of breathlessness, Tope said, adding it’s a violation of the protocol. In view of those instructions, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has instructed Covid hospitals to buy only the required stock of Remdesivir and not to hoard stock. Also, hospitals have been asked to maintain a register with each patient’s name and address to ensure that the right patient gets the injection. The hospital must return unused vials to the patient’s relative. FDA joint commissioner for Pune division, SB Patil, said, “Pune needs about 8,000 vials daily as of now and we have only 4,000 vials available. We will get replenishments by tonight. We usually get 16-17 thousand vials every alternate day so there is no shortage as of now. We have hospitals to ensure that they have to buy only the required vials of Remdesivir and not stock estimating for the future.” Tope said the process to increase beds in all major hospitals has begun. Tope said, “We will increase 200 more beds for Covid in BJ medical college, 200 at Dalvi, 500 at Baner and 200 at COEP. To cope with shortage of oxygen, if need be, we will shut the industrial units consuming maximum oxygen and the refilling sites will be monitored to ensure any leakage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/indiscriminate-use-hoarding-of-remdesivir-create-injection-shortage-in-pune-101617811827906.html
08-04-2021||Pune||Pune artistes change professions to cope with, and survive lockdown uncertainties||For many stage artistes, the 2020 lockdown was a sort of bring down the curtain on their career. They had to change their profession for survival and now fresh restrictions have left them with uncertainties. With no permission for stage shows throughout the year, artistes explored various options for financial support. Prasad Kulkarni who is known for his magic tricks across Pune was left with no work in 2020 due to restriction on public shows. Along with colleagues, he started Kulkarni vada pav centre on Sinhgad road in May 2020. “We sold one vada pav for one rupee during the first three days to attract customers. It worked as people started visiting our shop regularly. With people liking our quality, financially things began to fall in place for us,” said Kulkarni. With restrictions imposed again, Kulkarni and his colleagues are in a spot, again, apprehensive about the future of their vada pav centre. “With only the parcel system allowed, the business had definitely hit and it is the same for all eateries. We changed our profession to survive, but if this also does not allow us to earn then it will become difficult to survive,” said Kulkarni whose video online on problems faced due to the lockdown got viral. “Actually the video was to only portray the difficulties people are facing and there was no political motive against the state government. Many people took it the wrong way and now I am getting calls asking for explanations about the video. Breaking the chain of Covid transmission is a must, but total lockdown will hurt the economic condition badly,” Kulkarni said. Another artiste, Chaitali Majgaonkar Bhandari, who is a stand-up comedian from the city was left with zero income for seven months (March-September, 2020) before she started selling puppets online. “Before the lockdown, I had a monthly income of ₹1 lakh which went to zero. From October I started to sell puppets which brought me stability. I used to conduct online shows, but it is completely different then performing in front of a live audience. “Thing were getting normal and I did many shows between December-February. Now activities are again on halt due to the lockdown and it will make things difficult for many artistes,” said Bhandari. “Artistes are creative people and many find ways to survive, but some will not cope with another long lockdown,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-artistes-change-profession-to-cope-survive-lockdown-uncertainties-101617810630143.html

Union minister Prakash Javadekar, who hails from the city, is in talks with the Army authorities as Pune is seeing record rise in virus cases. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The city’s health infrastructure is struggling with the spike in Covid cases during the second wave. We have requested Javadekar to ask Army authorities to get beds at the new command hospital. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao will also meet the central government and Army representatives.” The Rs380-crore newly constructed Southern Command hospital was inaugurated by Chief of Army Staff General MM Naravane on January 8, 2021. The hospital has 1,082 beds. The mayor said, “We have requested at least 450 beds for Covid treatment but are likely to get around 350 beds.” With Pune being the Southern Command’s headquarters and the Army having strong health infrastructure in the city, PMC plans to seek more help to address the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-seeks-450-beds-of-southern-command-hospital-for-covid-treatment-101617803306985.html
