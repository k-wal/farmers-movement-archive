23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid 2nd wave, Himachal’s Kashmiri migrants stare at an uncertain future||Food insecurity, unemployment and economic vulnerability loom large over Himachal Pradesh’s ‘Kashmiri Khans’ yet again, with the government imposing fresh restrictions to control the spread of the pandemic. Last year, when the Prime Minister had suddenly imposed a nationwide lockdown, it had triggered mass exodus of these sturdy workers, known as ‘Khans’. When heavy snowfall and landslides brings life in the hill state to a grinding halt, it is these brawny workers who clear the roads of snow and uprooted trees and ensure uninterrupted supply of essential services. They also lug heavy loads to areas inaccessible by road. Some of these Khans work as scrap and old newspaper collectors, salesmen and porters. Since the British era, these workers, who have been given the sobriquet, camel of the hills, for their unparalleled strength and endurance, have been virtually carrying the state’s economy on their shoulders.A year on, these indispensable workers, have been left in a lurch yet again as the second wave of infections tears through the state, forcing businesses to close and travel to come to a standstill. This year, these migrant daily wagers, who make up the informal sector, are not trudging back home but their means of earning a living have dried up, leaving them vulnerable and their future uncertain. No avenues of earningAt least, 8,000 Kashmiri workers are employed in the capital city of Shimla, most of whom are porters and labourers. “The Khans are the lifeblood of the capital, but their avenues for earning have shrunk,” says Inderjeet Singh, president, Shimla Beopar Mandal.“Many of them, who had returned home, have not come back this year. Though migrant labourers from different areas flock to Shimla but we implicitly trust the Khans as we have a long history with them,” he says.With restrictions adversely impacting tourist influx in Shimla at the peak of the tourist season the Khans are worried about their livelihood . “I searched for jobs after graduating, but did not get any. So, I came to Shimla two years ago and started working as a labourer with a local contractor,” says Imitiaz, 28, of Watnarh village in Anantnag.“I was to get married but I had to defer the plan as our income has dried up,” he adds.Tourism, the mainstay for many“We are keeping tabs on the situation and advisories are being issued by the government from time-to-time. Last year, too, we faced great difficulty though the administration had arranged for us to the go home,” says Fiaz Ahmad, president, Masjid Intijamia Committee.‘Many Khans had just returned after a year looking for avenues to earn a livelihood. Now, they are unsure if they will be able to fend for their families in the coming days,” he said. Many youngsters from the Valley are employed as tourist guides with local hotels and also bring guests . A few of them work as commission agents.n However, tourist inflow to the town has drastically declined after the government has imposed restrictions in wake of surging Covid cases. Almost 100% booking have been cancelled.“ I used to work as a tourist guide but now I work at the local saw mill in Lakkar Bazaar. However, I am not sure how long it will last,” says one of the labourers. With numerous Kashmiris rendered jobless, many are keen to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-2nd-wave-himachal-s-kashmiri-migrants-stare-at-an-uncertain-future-101619201458106.html

This means that out of every 100 samples tested, 10 returned positive.The state, that was testing around 35,000-40,000 samples every day, cleared its backlog of untested samples on Thursday, resulting in the steep surge in positive cases.Jharkhand, till Friday morning, was yet to test 15,772 samples piled up at seven different laboratories across the state. The maximum 3,552 samples were pending at Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital, while only 633 samples were pending at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS).According to the health department’s April 23 morning bulletin, state capital Ranchi reported the maximum 1,467 cases and 53 deaths. Hazaribagh, however, registered an unprecedented growth after detecting 1,065 new cases. East Singhbhum, with its headquarters in Jamshedpur, unearthed 729 cases and reported 14 deaths.Five other districts--Ramgarh, Deoghar, Koderma, Bokaro and Palamu--too reported high number of cases with each discovering more than 400 cases.According to experts, the state’s biggest cause of concern was the high number of deaths. Jharkhand has reported 602 Covid-19 deaths so far in April alone.“We have been caught unprepared this time, as we did not care to strengthen the health infrastructure at all, presuming that the pandemic was over. Indications of scientific community were grossly ignored. The measures taken to contain the first wave were also undone at many places this time and the result is before everyone to see,” said Dr RK Jha, former professor and head of department of medicine, RIMS.He added, “This wave came just like a sea tide. It contains a new virus strain, that is either a double mutant ‘Indian variant’ or ‘UK variant;’ or even recently discovered triple mutant ‘West Bengal variant’, which is much more infectious. It is infecting children and young generation of both genders equally in larger numbers.”Recently published reports underline that the average hospital stay of admitted patients was getting longer, suggesting more complications and, therefore, more deaths, he said.The daily spike in positive cases also pushed the number of active cases to over the 40,000-mark, posing a big challenge for health mandarins in effective management of cases. In Ranchi, almost all hospitals, both in government and private sectors, were running at full capacity with all Covid-19 beds occupied. To make things worse, there was a huge scarcity of oxygen supported beds and ventilators. People, observing home isolation, have also been wandering in search of oxygen cylinders.According to the bulletin, Jharkhand has so far reported 184,951 cases, including 142,294 recoveries, 40,942 active cases and 1,715 deaths.

Chief minister Hemant Soren announced the same through his official Twitter handle late on Thursday night.According to officials in the state health department, the decision was made to waive off financial burden of people during the pandemic. Soren said, “The government is working day and night to help people during this period of drastic transition. I believe we can beat coronavirus with cooperation from all.”Earlier, the state government urged the central government to reduce the previous age limit of 45 for vaccine beneficiaries in light of the rapidly spreading infection among younger people.The Union government recently on Monday announced that all persons above 18 years of age will be eligible for Covid-19 shots from May 1. The registration for the same will begin from April 28.The Covid-19 vaccination drive started in Jharkhand from January 16. As per a bulletin of the state health department, more than 25.15 lakh people were administered the first dose of the vaccine till Thursday, while over 3.93 lakh people received their second dose.However, a decline in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed on Thursday, that some health experts blamed on the confusion arising due to the ongoing week-long lockdown in the state that began April 22. However, no major change was witnessed in the case of second dose beneficiaries.Even though state nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad expressed his inability to comment on the matter, as he was also suffering from Covid-19 infection, officials at a vaccination office said the drop in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed, while it partially increased in case of second dose.“There are many reasons behind the slight fall in case of first dose. There may be confusion over lockdown, while some may be scared of visiting vaccination centres due to the sudden case surge. However, we are working to address the issue and we hope it will increase soon,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. He said vaccination awareness vehicles were being flagged by many districts to educate people about its importance.Jharkhand on Thursday recorded its highest ever single-day spike with 7,595 new cases, while as many as 106 people died due to the disease. The state registered 64,536 cases in between April 1 April 22, while 601 people died during the period due to the virus.Vaccination progressDate First Dose Second doseApril 22 12,439 8,783April 21 16,393 8,263April 20 22,381 12,656April 19 18,758 7,622April 18 28,067 7,788||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/free-vaccination-for-all-above-18-101619195996444.html

23-04-2021||Patna||Bihar presents its oxygen plan in HC||The Patna High Court on Friday said there is deficiency in supply of medical oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients in Bihar and directed that the shortfall be met through proper coordination between the state and the Centre at the earliest.Presenting its action plan, including status of oxygen supply before the court, the Bihar government’s senior counsel, Ranjit Kumar, told the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah that adequate oxygen was available as per the requirement of existing oxygenated beds, while it is striving for more in view of increase in demand due to spike in Covid-19 positive cases.Additional solicitor general KN Singh said the Centre has allocated 194 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen to the state, which the state would require to lift. “However, so far the state was getting less supply, may be due to logistics problems,” he said.The counsel for the state government said the state was also planning to augment oxygen availability, including by installing pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plant and a proposal for this has also been sent to the Centre. Earlier, the state government had demanded 300 MT from the Centre.“At present, PMCH and NMCH plants produce oxygen at the rate of 300 litres per minute, while Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Bettiah and Madhepura medical college and hospitals have a capacity of 280 liters per minute. Besides, Pawapuri hospital will have its functional from May 1, while those at Gaya and Bhagalpur will get operational from May 21. Together, the capacity will go up to 2620 litres per minute,” he said.The bench, however, told the state counsel to let the people know what the state has and what it does not have in the public domain through portal and newspaper advertisements. It also sought to knwo why the state suffered shortage mid-April when it claims no shortage today.The court had earlier sought to know the state action plan, including availability and the mode and manner in which the state planned to supply to different dedicated Covid hospitals and dedicated Covid healthcare centres, as also private hospitals. The shortage of oxygen was also corroborated by the report of the registrar general of the HC on the death of Gagan Mishra, an HC officer, reportedly, because of unavailability of oxygen in various hospitals in the city of Patna. The court had asked for a report.Taking serious note of the facts mentioned in the report regarding the paucity of oxygen in the State, which is a crucial medical requirement and an essential critical component for treatment of COVID-19 patients, the bench had requested Ranjit Kumar to seek detailed instructions from the State of Bihar in respect of the effective steps which have been taken and are proposed to be taken to tide over the situation arising out of reported acute shortage of medicinal oxygen in the state of Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-presents-its-oxygen-plan-in-hc-101619195817670.html

The incident took place around 11 pm.“Junior doctors have gone on strike after joining duty at 11 am on Friday as they were at the receiving end of attendants’ anger again. The Patna district administration is not providing adequate security to prevent such incidents,” NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh alleged. Junior Doctor’s Association president Ramchandra Kumar said they would continue to boycott work till proper security arrangements are made on rge campus. The attendants allegedly ransacked the hospital premises as well as ICU of the Covid hospital, a dedicated unit of NMCH, on Thursday night in which some junior doctors received minor injuries. Association president Kumar said it all began when a woman from Buxar district, admitted on April 11, died during the treatment. Her attendants were informed about her critical condition and two of them were allowed into the hospital. When the doctor declared her death, the attendants allegedly attacked the junior doctors there. It remained unclear whether there was any argument before the assault. “The attendants attacked the doctors plastic chairs and iron stool. They also tore curtains and damaged trollies,” said an eyewitness. On getting information, the hospital superintendent, deputy superintendent Dr Saroj Kumar and other officials reached the spot and tried to pacify the doctors. One of the attendants who had indulged in violence was detained by the police. On the other hand, attendants alleged the woman died due to negligence of doctors. A senior official of health department said the government would take all steps to ensure doctors’ security and urged them to return to work immediately. Meanwhile, Patna district magistrate Dr Chandrasekhar Singh asked senior superintendent of police Upendra Sharma to deploy at least 60 police persons in the premises of NMCH, where 371 Covid patients are currently being treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nmch-doctors-strike-work-for-2nd-time-in-12-hours-101619195816352.html

Though our effort is like a drop of water in an ocean, it was much needed. We were getting requests for oxygen so we managed to procure concentrators for the needy under-privileged patients," said Amarpreet Singh, director of Khalsa Aid Project (Asia Chapter).Singh said his organisation will procure more oxygen concentrators in the coming weeks, taking the number from present 65 to 100.Oxygen concentrators, witnessing a massive surge in demand amid the crisis in Delhi, is a portable medical device used for delivering oxygen to individuals with breathing-related disorders. It filters the surrounding air, compressing it to the required density, and then delivers purified medical-grade oxygen into a pulse-dose delivery system or continuous stream system to the patient."Seeing the present situation we are trying to procure more machines to serve maximum (number of patients). The organisation has set up an online Whatsapp registration process to avoid physical contact. We are also trying to procure oxygen cylinders to fight this situation more efficiently," said advocate Puneet Singh, a trustee of Khalsa Aid India. The national capital on Thursday logged a record 306 Covid-19 deaths and 26,169 cases with a positivity rate of 36.24 per cent, the highest since the pandemic began a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/khalsa-aid-to-provide-free-oxygen-concentrators-to-covid-19-patients-in-delhi-101619193639633.html

23-04-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Of Quiet Rage and Silent Screams||Let’s face it, there have been times during these harrowing past few days, weeks and months when you have felt, as if like Alice, you’ve fallen into a bottomless rabbit hole from which you may never emerge. Or as if you are trapped in an endless re-run of a dystopian science fiction series such as the Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, where dark irony, morbid suspense and mounting horror lurk behind the most ordinary and everyday aspects of our lives. After all what else can you say about a time in which ‘being negative’ is the best piece of news you can receive; in which the constant wail of ambulance sirens convey profound despair, rather than hope; in which oxygen cylinders, meant to save lives, become the cause of mass deaths; in which doctors, nurses and other medical personnel face breakdowns and sickness and critical exhaustion; and above all, in which the leaders we put our faith in are the very ones who let us down? Today, the world as we know it, in the vice like grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, seems as if it’s been placed wrong side up or inside out. As if we woke up on January 1, 2020 to a parallel universe, one where the rules had been changed overnight and all that we once took for granted, suddenly seemed distorted, awry … set asunder. So how else to describe these strange times except in oxymoron, those figures of speech that combine two seemingly contradictory or opposite ideas, to cunningly reveal a deeper truth, through their quirky nuance? In fact, could there be another time which would lend itself so gloriously to the confounding polarity of the oxymoron? To begin with, consider the ‘fine mess’ we’re in, locked as we all are, ‘alone together’, like the ‘living dead’, surrounded by a ‘deafening silence’ as we attempt to carry on with our lives and ‘work from home’, while constantly worrying in our ‘wakeful sleep’ about everything, including if our test results the next day will turn out to be ‘false positive’. How else to describe ‘ feeling numb’ at the sight of endless queues of ‘anxious patients’ outside hospitals and the crush of bodies ‘packed loosely’ outside morgues, waiting their turn? And above all else, what are we supposed to do when it’s an ‘open secret’ that our leaders are ‘clearly confused’ and ‘definitely undecided’ about how to save lives, and that the situation from the ‘ground up’ appears to be getting ‘progressively worse’? Meanwhile, solutions appear to be ‘growing smaller’ by the hour and we seem ‘far closer’ to the real and present danger. Who will know of the ‘quiet rage’ we feel at the ‘foolish wisdom’ of banging pots and lighting diyas to ‘flatten the curve’? Who will hear our ‘silent screams’ at the sight of ‘small armies’ of ‘barely dressed’ men congregating at the Kumbh or unmasked multitudes gathering at political rallies, which ‘any one’ will tell you is a ‘sure bet’ of spreading infection. Indeed, the ‘true story’ of this ‘tragi- comedy’ is that ‘almost exactly’ a year after it began, it’s as if life has played a ‘cruel joke’ on us and ‘once again’ it seems as if we are forced to go back on a ‘working vacation’, with hand washing and ‘social distancing’ becoming ‘one more’ ‘unusual routine’ and ‘new tradition’ in our daily lives. As the dangers of disease and death seem ‘incredibly real’, the ‘only choice’ we have is to lump it (which, in my ‘unbiased opinion’, is an ‘unacceptable solution’). After all, it is ‘hardly easy’ in ‘human nature’ to remain ‘hopelessly optimistic’ and say the glass is ‘half full’ in the face of ‘increasing losses’ and ‘negative growth’ ( Not forgetting the ‘additional reduction’ in the country’s GDP). ‘Good grief’, how on earth are we expected to ‘act natural’ at a time of such ‘controlled chaos’? ‘Small wonder’ then that we feel a ‘conspicuous absence’ of empathy when our leaders appear on ‘live recordings’ mouthing ‘essentially useless’ platitudes and ‘false truths’, which only convey to the general public that they do not have any ‘action plan’ for ‘disaster relief’; and as if this were not ‘seriously funny’, we find ourselves ‘crash landing’ into a ‘pretty ugly’ situation where nearly every one we know is ‘highly depressed’, and the only ‘unsung heroes’ are the ‘extra-ordinary’, ‘back room, front line’ workers, and the ‘uncrowned king’ through it all is none but the ordinary long-suffering ‘private citizen’. How much more can we take? After all, even the most ‘painfully beautiful’ sunsets cannot distract from the fact that we are now the ‘waking dead’ and that ‘modern history’ will record that a cosmic ‘practical joke’ seems to have been played on us, with an ‘apparently invisible’ virus upending our lives; and that there’s ‘nothing much’ to do but ‘scale down’ our expectations, because in the end, there is ‘very little’ accountability and it is ‘quite unlikely’ that any one will ‘stand down’ or display a ‘little more’ empathy or even some ‘conventional wisdom’ during the course of this dystopian, ‘virtual reality’ ‘war game’ we are currently experiencing. What else to do in such times but try and hold on to our ‘forgotten memories’ of the bad old good days, when going viral was an aspiration and when being positive was a virtue?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-of-quiet-rage-and-silent-screams-101619192161344.html

23-04-2021||Pune||The fight for Remdesivir continues||A total of only 250 doses of Remedesivir were supplied to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run hospitals, whereas as per the civic body’s health department, there are 1,328 critical patients in the city. The shortage of Remdesivir injection has left families of critical Covid positive patients in distress. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the wife of a 38-year-old Covid patient who is admitted at a PMC-run hospital said that the first dose of Remdesivir was administered to the patient on Tuesday. “The second dose was given on Thursday, and there is no supply as of now of the injection. In the open market, the drug is not available, and the hospital doesn’t have the injection either. As there were plenty of cases found wherein paracetamol was supplied in the bottles of Remdesivir, we cannot even try to find the medicine in the open market. My husband is critical. I don’t know what to do,” she said. Dr Madhuri Gare, in charge at Dalvi Hospital in Shivajinagar said that the injection is administered to a critical patient based on various factors. “The injection is supplied to the hospital by the PMC and until 2 pm, there was no supply. By evening, 40 doses of Remedesivir were allocated to the hospital. There are around 162 patients on oxygen supply and around 10 patients in ICU as on Friday,” said Dr Gare. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief at the health department of the PMC said that there is a shortage of the medicine. “We have over 1,300 critical patients in PMC and the supply we received on Friday was just 250 injections. As we are getting less doses, we are sending less doses to the hospital as well,” said Dr Wavare. Due to the acute shortage of the injection that has continued from last few weeks, the district administration has made it mandatory for hospitals to provide the injection to the patient so that the families of the patient do not hunt for the medicine. As per the district administration, the drug is supplied to the PMC, which in turn allocates the drug to hospitals. On Thursday, 6,400 injections were allocated to hospitals in PMC and Pune rural with a total bed capacity of 10,874. This allocation does not include PMC-run hospitals. Ahead of the shortage, many cases of selling fake Remdesivir injection also came to the forefront.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/the-fight-for-remdesivir-continues-101619190656199.html
23-04-2021||Pune||Experts suggest vaccinating children below the age of 18 to control cases in that age group||In the deadly second wave of Covid-19 that has hit India, a large number of children below the age of 18 are getting infected, with some even having severe symptoms. In an attempt to control this trend, doctors and experts have suggested that vaccination among children will help keep the numbers low. Of the total cases, around 3.03 per cent positive patients are below the age of 10 years whereas 6.73 per cent of the total positive cases are between the ages of 11 years to 20 years. Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, head of neonatology and paediatric, Sahyadri Hospitals said that the infectivity rate in children is more, fever presentation is more and is resulting in the infection spreading to families including grandparents. “Therefore, vaccination in children especially in the age group of 10-18 years will help. This is because this is the most active age group where children play and mix with their friends and families. While most of the trials worldwide have happened in the adult age group, the knowledge should be extracted and seen whether it can be applied in paediatrics,” Dr Suryavanshi said. Dr Ganesh Badge, consultant paediatrician at city-based Columbia Asia Hospital said that vaccinating children is under trial in the U.S. “The results of this trial by Pfizer-BioNTech are very encouraging as the phase three trials of adolescents between 12 and 15 years with or without prior evidence of Covid infections, demonstrated 100 per cent efficacy and robust antibody responses. Moderna has also begun a phase 2/3 study of children aged between six months and 11 years. However, it is important that a separate clinical trial is held in India before approving any such vaccine. Improving the vaccine coverage of the adult population in India will also help protect children,” said Dr Badge. Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of the paediatric ward at Sassoon General Hospital said that during the second wave many children are testing positive. “Some children are also critical with severe symptoms of Covid-19. Isolating a child from Covid positive patients is important to ensure the safety of the child,” said Dr Kinikar. Dr Suchit Tamboli, a paediatrician said that vaccination for children below the age of 18 years is expected to start in July or August. “India should start a trial of vaccines for children below the age of 18 years. We need to take care of the children by using masks, hand wash, sanitizer, and social distance till the vaccine arrives. Parents should report to paediatricians if the child has fever, cold, cough, loose motions and is not responding to usual treatment and also if has a history of contact with Covid positive patients,” said Dr Tamboli. Dr Suryavanshi added that isolation of children below the age group of 14 is particularly difficult as they always want to be with their parents. “In such a case the one with better immunity should get involved and take care of the child during the isolation period. It is also important to ensure the child wears a mask during isolation at home,” said Dr Suryavanshi.

Both the governments and Chandigarh administration on Friday assured the high court that people not covering their mouth or nose properly with face masks will be treated on par with those not wearing them at all and will be liable to same punitive action. The assurance was given in a suo motu plea initiated by the high court in view of surge in Covid-19 cases in both the states and the UT. The court has now disposed of the plea. During the hearing on Friday, Haryana government submitted that nodal agencies in every district headed by the deputy commissioner are functional. It was also informed that secretary, legal services authority in every district will also be a member of the said committee as he receives number of complaints. The committee will meet daily, the government had told the court. Punjab too assured that a committee on the similar lines will be constituted to consider the grievances of the public. As of Chandigarh, it said that a war room has been constituted for the purpose. To the submissions that certain private hospitals are charging exorbitant fee for their services, both the governments and UT assured the court that such grievance will be promptly looked into and punitive measures shall be taken against such medical facilities. Further, assurance has been given that surprise checks will also be conducted on such private facilities. More personnel will be deputed to attend distress calls and helpline numbers will be widely publicised, it was assured. It was also undertaken that authorities will depute officials of the municipal bodies/health authorities to ensure that mask etiquettes are followed by the public. Heads of the public as well as private institutions will sensitise the employees to wear masks properly, it was submitted. The court has asked the authorities to submit daily reports with the respective district and sessions judges’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/those-not-wearing-masks-properly-to-be-fined-too-in-punjab-haryana-chandigarh-101619190476112.html
23-04-2021||Pune||Cops irked by commuters’ false reasons to venture out||According to police posted at various check posts across Pune, commuters are giving false reasons in order to venture out during the strict lockdown imposed by the state government to control the surge in Covid-19 cases. “I am going out to feed pigeons”- is one reason which people tell the cops. “Since morning, there have been four people who have given the exact same reason we allowed two of them go as it was 8 in the morning, however, we had to turn back the other two since it was 11am,” said Sunil Kumar, traffic police constable who was on duty at the University Road police check post. From April 22, the government has only allowed essential service vehicles to ply on the streets of the city. “The order is strict for all; we need to confirm the commuter’s genuine reason or an essential service ID card. Many people are still needlessly coming out. We are imposing a fine on them,” said Kumar. Traffic police at Aundh check post caught 10 people who came out without any essential reason until 12 noon. “Only home delivery is allowed but still people are coming out to get food parcel. We consider some of them by giving a warning but next day again people make the same mistake,” added Vishal Those, traffic constable. Aditya Kadgale who paid a fine of ₹500 said, “I did not come out without a purpose. I stay where the map does not show the proper location to the delivery apps, hence I had to get my food parcel.” Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, “Many people are still not taking the orders seriously. In the coming days more check posts will be installed across the city. The situation is grim that’s why there are so many restrictions in place. People should stop coming out unnecessarily.” “If people continue to flout the rules, the administration will be left with no option but to impose restrictions like last year,” added Shrirame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cops-irked-by-commuters-false-reasons-to-venture-out-101619190416119.html
23-04-2021||Pune||Seven days into infection, nasopharyngeal sample may lead to false RT-PCR negatives: NIV director Dr Abraham||During a public seminar on genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-19 which was attended by the national laboratory heads from across the country including the National Institute of Virology (NIV) director Dr Priya Abraham, it was revealed that despite severe Covid-19 symptoms, a person may test negative for the infection through RT-PCR. Dr Abraham said that there have been multiple reports in the media about RT-PCR negative individuals unable to get admission into hospital even though they are gasping for breath and are unable to get access to the oxygen because of the negative report. “There are multiple factors which could lead to this. Due to the extreme stress due to the situation in a clinical setting, the sampling could be inappropriate; individuals may be appearing late for sampling and typically if they come after seven days into the infection the sampling from the Nasopharyngeal area may reduce sensitivity of the nucleic acid leading to a false negative of the RT-PCR. The other factors could be efficiency of the acid kits being compromised as they were not stored or transported properly and so the reverse transcription enzyme or the polymerase enzyme may lose the integrity. Also the added pressure on the laboratory staff due to the current situation as they are also being infected differs from the ideal situation,” Dr Abraham said. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) members also said that in Maharashtra they sequenced around 4 per cent or 71 sequenced samples that detected with Variants of Concern (VOC) of the 1,779 samples sequenced. Of these 1,723 were community samples and 56 were from travellers.The INSACOG is a 10-member group which was formed by the Government of India for large scale sequencing of genome sequencing. Dr Abraham said, “To identify the variants we have to first sequence them, then detect them, which is done through amplification process most commonly known as RT-PCR tests. Since the pandemic RT-PCR has been the gold standard for diagnosis and detection of the infection since the beginning of the pandemic. Over 99 per cent of the times, we are able to identify the virus and are able to allow us to then go on to sequence and identify the variants which are being discussed.” She further added that normally an RT-PCR picks up variants of every kind and today the acids are approved and validated by the government are fully capable of picking up the UK variant, the double mutation variant, the Brazilian variant and also the South African variant. The webinar was arranged by the department of biotechnology, ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India on Friday on genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-19 to highlight the importance of sequencing genome of SARS-CoV-19, and the work done by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) in ascertaining the current status of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, establishing a sentinel surveillance for early detection, and determining the genomic variants in the unusual events/trends. Research laboratories across the country had started sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from April 2020, however these were mostly samples collected randomly across the country. The first report of a UK variant of concern was published in December 2020 and the government immediately established INSACOG which is a national multi-agency consortium for large-scale sequencing of viral genome collected in a systematic manner with complete metadata. Ten laboratories of the department of biotechnology, CSIR, ICMR and Ministry of health and family welfare, were brought together. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), MoHFW was given the responsibility to correlate the clinical aspects and coordinate collection of samples from the states. So far about 20,000 samples have been sequenced and about 1,500 variants have been identified across the country. These are mainly the UK and South Africa variant and a small number of Brazil variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/seven-days-into-infection-nasopharyngeal-sample-may-lead-to-false-rt-pcr-negatives-niv-director-dr-abraham-101619190356112.html

A bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rekha Palli was hearing separate pleas of two private hospitals, Bram Healthcare Private Limited and Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre, flagging the scarcity of oxygen and the condition of seriously ill Covid-19 patients.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereIn its plea, Batra Hospital said that it has currently admitted 352 Covid-19 patients. “The conditions of some of the patients are extremely critical and life-threatening and if they are not provided with a continuous supply of oxygen, it could turn out to be fatal for the patient,” it said. The hospital said that as of Friday 8:30am, the available stock of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) was 1900 litres and said it will last only five to six hours with the present consumption rate. The hospital has been discharging stable patients and has stopped new admissions.The city’s Bram Hospital said it is occupied with more than 150 patients of which more than 100 are on oxygen support. According to the hospital’s petition, they require 125 oxygen cylinders per day but now are left with only 35 cylinders. The hospital informed the court that it has tried to get oxygen everywhere but could not get any response either from the administration or police. “Even the filling station does not have the oxygen,” the hospital claimed and said that in this scenario the oxygen they have will last only for three to four hours.Following this, the Centre, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, submitted that control rooms have been set up to coordinate with the nodal officers of state governments for the management of oxygen supply. The control room has officers from all departments and hospitals can contact the nodal officer, the Centre told the court. Udit Prakash is the nodal officer in Delhi. “This is done so that the Centre can intervene whenever there is any obstruction of oxygen transportation by local authorities,” he said.The bench said if the requirements are not met even after contacting the nodal officer, the hospitals shall contact senior advocate Rahul Mehra and lawyer Satyakam, before approaching the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/on-oxygen-shortage-plea-hc-tells-delhi-hospitals-to-first-contact-nodal-officer-101619182209116.html

And, their appeal was met with equal enthusiasm. The dabbawalas have raised over ₹20 lakh in just four days with the help of a fundraiser organisation as more than 1000 people have donated so far through Milaap.“When I first spoke to the dabbawalas, I got to know that more than 2000 of them are struggling to make ends meet. I sensed the urgency of their appeal and felt that a campaign on Milaap can be of great help for them. The response has been great so far with more than 1000 donations in less than a week,” Debosmita De, a marketing operations associate with Milaap, said.Ulhas Shantaram Muke, the president of the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, thanked everyone who came forward and showed their support. “The campaign on Milaap has raised over ₹20 lakh in just 4 days. This is a great ray of hope for us to procure ration and pay off our rents in this challenging time,” Muke added. “We have worked hard every single day to build this system. Dabbawalas are in a lot of trouble now. The situation is such that a 100 ₹note is equivalent to ₹10,000,” Sopan Laxman Mare, a Dabbawala, said.As the 130-year-old delivery network has seen the business plunge by nearly 90% with many offices in Mumbai still closed, the Dabbawalas have also urged the Maharashtra government for financial help. “Out of the 5000 Dabbawalas, only 400-500 were working. With new lockdown restrictions, only 200-250 are now left. We are again urging the government for financial help,” Vishnu Kaldoke, Mumbai dabbawala spokesperson, told news agency ANI earlier this month.The Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced fresh restrictions on travel, attendance in offices and wedding functions to check the Covid-19 spread. The effect came into force from Thursday night.Maharashtra, facing an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, is already under severe restrictions since April 14.

However, over the past last two weeks, passenger traffic at the Pune railway station has increased dramatically. For better movement of passengers, entry to the station premises is from the front end of the railway station. Staff deployed by the civic body is not enough for the large number of passengers coming in. A maximum of five PMC staffers are on duty to check hundreds of passengers. Harsha Shah, president, Railway Pravasi Group, said, “Passengers coming in from outside the state is huge and practically, it is not possible to check each and every one. PMC health department needs to increase staff deployed for checking exit at the station premises.”The exit gate for all the incoming passengers is from the Raja Bahadur Mill road gate, using the newly built foot overbridge (FOB). Passengers are checked on this FOB by staff from the PMC health department. “We are checking passengers coming in from other states to Pune. We are checking the RTPCR test reports of passengers. Those passengers who do not have the reports have to undergo a rapid antigen test at the station. Each and every passenger’s contact details are with us,” said Chandrakant Walemad, a PMC health department official. Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson said, “Pune railway division is always prepared to help the civic administration. All needed help and support is provided to them, whether for thermal checking or Covid test reports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-understaffed-for-covid-check-on-passengers-coming-in-at-pune-railway-station-101619180456185.html

However, so far, patients have not come,” the top railway official was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government hasn't commented whether people are being admitted to those coaches. The Delhi government on Sunday urged the Railway Board to make special Covid-19 care coaches available at two railway stations like last year as cases of the viral disease were increasing at a rapid pace in the city. Emphasising that facilities at government and private hospitals available in the national capital were getting strained due to the “tremendous” increase in Covid-19 cases, Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev wrote to Suneet Sharma. “…request you to kindly arrange Covid bed facilities at Anand Vihar and Shakur Basti Railway Stations with full logistical support, requisite medical and para-medical staff and oxygen facilities etc on an emergent basis,” Dev said in his letter.The request was approved by the Centre within a few hours. Union minister for railways Piyush Goyal assured support to the Delhi government and said that over three lakh isolation beds can be arranged if the states demand. “Govt under PM @NarendraModi leading the fight against COVID-19: 50 COVID-19 isolation coaches with 800 beds ready at Shakur Basti Station & 25 coaches will be available at Anand Vihar Station in Delhi.

23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Spring snow causes extensive damage to apple orchards in Himachal||Widespread rain, intermittent snow and heavy hail caused extensive damage to apple orchards in Himachal Pradesh on Friday. The state department of agriculture and horticulture has instructed field officials to assess the damage to cash crops. The worst-affected orchards are in Kumarsain, Kharapathar, Jubbal, Rohru and Chopal in Shimla district. “The state horticulture department said that a large number of fruit-laden apple trees were either uprooted or their branches broken due to the snowfall. “The unprecedented hail and snowfall has caused immense damage to the apple and other fruit crops in the state, particularly in areas above 7,000 ft where orchardists have lost around 1 crore apple boxes. Trees where anti-hail nets were in use were severely damaged. The state and Centre should recognise this as a natural disaster, assess the damage and provide assistance to fruit growers at the earliest,” Lokinder Singh Bisht, president, Progressive Growers’ Association (PGA). Horticulturists say such heavy snowfall in April is unprecedented. “I have never seen such heavy snowfall in April. The damage to the apple crop will be immense,” says Mahijit Rathore 44, president, Nawar Valley Apple Association. The ₹60,000 crore apple economy is the mainstay for over 2 lakh farming families in Himachal Pradesh. Apples are mainly grown in Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur and a few regions of Chamba , Sirmaur and Lahaul and Spiti . “Earlier, we suffered because of the drought-like situation. Now, untimely snow has dealt a severe blow to the apple economy. The government should provide relief to growers,” says former parliamentary secretary Rohit Thakur . The snow has also damaged other cash crops in Himachal Pradesh. “We have requested the government to provide relief to farmers,” said former state Congress chief and Nadaun legislator Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu. Roads blocked, power supply hit The inclement weather disrupted road transport in the remote regions of Chamba, Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts. As many as 423 electricity transformers were damaged due to thunder and lightning in Chamba, Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts, while 178 main and lateral roads were blocked on Friday. According to the state disaster management authority, 140 roads were closed in Lahaul and Spiti district. Traffic was affected on seven routes in Kullu, nine in Pangi and one in Salooni and five in Bharmour in Chamba district. Power supply was affected by damage to 35 transformers in Pangi, 93 in Pooh, 53 in Kalpa, three in Nichar, six in Kullu, 166 in Lahaul and 67 in Kaza.

The demand for oxygen has gone up by three times. This is a challenge. The steel industries, which are the biggest manufacturers of oxygen for their own consumption, offered to provide oxygen. But the issue is related to oxygen transportation. For this, special tankers have been ordered and the government is helping them in transportation. The supply chain can improve in 5-7 days," he said.He also said doctors should ensure that the oxygen should be used in a judicious manner.Regarding the hospitalisation of the Covid-19 positive patients, Dr Trehan said, "Patient's lungs' condition, blood test reports, comorbidities, and age create a scenario under which we can say if it is right for them to be hospitalised...I did like to tell doctors to keep in mind that who has to be recommended to hospital.""Anyone who gets an RT-PCR positive report should not immediately start thinking that they have to be hospitalised. They should first contact a doctor. Hospitals have a COVID app. At Medanta, we have such an app too, you fill in the details and get a call from a doctor," he added.The Medanta chairman said that there is no need to panic. "The understanding of patients, wastage of oxygen and judicious use of oxygen by the hospitals can bridge the supply of oxygen. We have to use the resources carefully," he said.Tehran further said, "The balance between COVID care centres run by hospitals and hospitals must coordinate. This will rationalise the use of oxygen, increase the availability of beds and the public will not panic.""We can win the war if the public will support us. The government is responding to the demands. Remdesivir injection should not be used unnecessarily," he added.India recorded 3,32,730 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day spike since the pandemic broke out last year. India has crossed the mark of 3 lakh Covid-19 cases for two consecutive days now. This has taken the cumulative count of the COVID infection in the country to 1,62,63,695.The country has recorded 2,263 new deaths due to Covid-19 in the last 24 hours.

23-04-2021||Patna||HC raps state govt, orders to make public available Covid beds at NMCH||The Patna High Court has directed the state government to make it public that all the 500 beds at the state’s first dedicated Covid hospital, Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, are open for Covid-19 patients. Just two days ago, the court was told that he NMCH had 160 beds and that the hospital found it tough even to manage that number due to shortage of oxygen supply. Its acting superintendent even threatened to resign on the issue. However, the Bihar State Human Rights Commission (BSHRC), which was directed by the HC to get an inspection of the NMCH done, told the court Wednesday evening that there were 500 beds, including 400 with oxygen facility and 70 ventilators, available at the hospital, as all the non-Covid patients had left, while 175 were occupied with Covid patients. Surprised, the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah asked as to why there was bed shortage when the NMCH alone had 500 beds available. “Telling the court that 325 beds for Covid patients are vacant at NMCH is farce, absolute farce. If 325 beds are vacant, make it public It will be a big help. People don’t know if it is really so,” the court said and the state government’s counsel Ranjit Kumar to ensure information about vacant beds at the NMCH was made public and the status of oxygen supply was provided. The court was also informed by another counsel that on April 17, NMCH had shown a total capacity of 160 beds for Covid-19 patients, 146 general 146 and 14 ICU beds. The next hearing in the case is again scheduled for Friday. During the course of previous hearing, the court was also informed that two hospitals, namely Medanta and Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital in Patna, are going to be utilised for admitting and treating Covid patients. ESIC Hospital at Bihta will also be fully equipped to deal with Covid rush. On Monday, the court had observed that “in the wake of this extraordinary and alarming situation prevailing in the State, different organs are required to act in unison to meet the present challenge posed by the outbreak of second wave of Covid-19 pandemic”. “Serious issues have been raised about deaths taking place in various government and private hospitals because of lack of supply of oxygen. This court cannot overlook such aspects. If the court reaches a conclusion that Covid patients have been or are being allowed to die because of lack of oxygen supply, it will surely intervene and pass appropriate orders in this regard,” the HC said. The court also took note that an officer of HC succumbed to Covid for want of oxygen supply in the hospitals. “We direct the Registrar General, Patna High Court, to submit an exhaustive report to this Court explaining in detail the circumstances in which the said HC officer died,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hc-raps-state-govt-orders-to-make-public-available-covid-beds-at-nmch-101619177275523.html

23-04-2021||Pune||Slam dunk: Staying fit through peaks and valleys of NBA season all about “periodisation’||Diving into the preparation of a player for the gruelling competitive NBA season gives a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to prepare for the rigors of the highest level of competitive basketball. With the NBA playoffs (and the new play-in format) fast approaching, the past few weeks have seen a number of NBA stars beset with serious injuries, which could have major implications on their team’s hopes of winning the NBA championship. Particularly notable were the injuries to Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young and Kevin Durant. In some cases, particularly for teams in smaller media markets, the injuries can have major implications beyond just the current season, being that it takes a huge amount of patience to build and develop players through the NBA draft, compared to luring free-agent superstars to join a team. With such huge consequences on the line, this brings us to the next part of our series. How is it possible to navigate and adapt a player’s training and preparation throughout the course of an NBA season to keep them at their peak physical levels during the playoffs?Coming off a preseason and training camp, players have to be ready to handle playing approximately three games each week from October until the middle of April. In fact, other than a week for the NBA All-Star break, NBA players get no time away from late September until the middle of April. The best players usually need to then be at their peak performance and physical levels from April until June, when the NBA Finals are played. In planning a player’s training, it is therefore, important for a player to understand how much they will be playing throughout the season. Players that are not playing in games will undoubtedly have to do more practice and physical conditioning in order to keep themselves ready to handle the intensity and competition of an NBA game. Breaking up the season into periods of high and low-game and travel density allows a player to understand whether to focus on recovery or building themselves up at a particular point in the season. For players who are playing a large number of minutes, it may be necessary to train with heavier weights less, than players who are playing once every five or six games. Players playing a large number of minutes may be better served focusing on recovery in order to be primed and ready to play the next game. Dividing the season in this manner allows trainers and players to focus on a specific goal in a small window of time, and after this goal has been accomplished, they can then review the results and set the goals for the next time period of the season, deciding whether to increase or decrease the intensity of their workouts according to what is being required of a player during the game. This planning strategy is usually referred to as “periodization”. Countless times throughout NBA history, the health of players during the NBA playoffs has been a deciding factor and resulted in a “what-if” scenario. Most recently, one can recall the importance of Chris Paul missing Game 7 for the Houston Rockets due to a hamstring injury, as their bid to topple the Golden State Warriors dynasty was unsuccessful. By following a periodisation plan through the competitive NBA season, training staffs can ensure that players stay healthy for the entire duration of the year and are performing at their highest possible physical condition during the NBA playoffs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-staying-fit-through-peaks-and-valleys-of-nba-season-all-about-periodisation-101619176496221.html

23-04-2021||Delhi||Police braving the odds to help Delhiites fight back Covid||“Anyone can hold the helm, when the sea is calm, it takes khaki to weather a storm,” tweeted Sanjay Kumar Sain, DCP, North-East. He dedicated this to assistant sub inspector (ASI) Sushil Kumar, who performed the last rites for a man whose family refused to accept his body. But this, is just one of the brave acts, in the face of adversity, of Delhi Police. Since the pandemic erupted, the cops in khaki have been on their toes. Right from attending distress calls for medicines to arranging injections and oxygen cylinders for hospitals and individuals, the cops are going an extra mile to make the Capital’s residents win the battle against the second wave of Covid-19.Like Sushil Kumar, Sub Inspector Dharmender Sharma helped cremate a 93-year-old Covid patient, Gangawati Sharma, in Dwarka. He says, “This is my responsibility.” Intimation was received at PS Dwarka, North regarding her death and the cop arranged an ambulance. “The body was shifted to RTRM Hospital for further procedure, and later for cremation. Since it was difficult for her family members to come, to perform the last rites became my call of duty. Weekend curfew tha toh kisi ko pata nahin tha kaise karna hai. Maine pehle procedure check kiya toh dispensary ke number mile. Then I send all her documents including Covid report and Aadhar card to RTRM hospital, and contacted an ambulance service, after which the cremation could take place. I feel proud that in such circumstances my service gave me this opportunity to help someone in need!”In another incident, Yogender Dhaka, a 49-year-old head constable stationed at Mayur Vihar, timely helped a Covid patient get access to Remdesivir injection. “Mere paas phone aaya ki patient bahut pareshan hai. Maine ek dost ko phone kiya aur arrange karwa diya. It felt really good to help them, and we are trying our best to help as many people we can,” says Dhaka. The families of Covid patients are grateful to Delhi Poilce for their constant support. Anjana Goswami, a resident of Vasant Kunj, says, “I’m extremely thankful to Shukhdev Singh Mann, SHO, Kalindi Kunj who went out of the way to arrange an oxygen cylinder for my 78-year-old mother. She was very serious, and Mann did a wonderful job! The manner in which the Police are saving our lives, and risking their lives for us, is commendable. We salute such people!” Appreciating the efforts of cops on social media, Dr Anil Goyal, a urologist, recently tweeted: “On behalf of Goyal Hospital & Urology Centre, I extend my sincere thanks to Joint CP Shri Alok Kumar and his team for helping on tidying over oxygen crisis today. Together we shall be able to defeat the corona.” Chinmoy Biswal, DCP Crime and PRO, Delhi Police says, “During the first wave of coronavirus, we provided food, dry ration and other essential help to the migrant labourers and those in need. This time also we haven’t failed yet to help with medicines, oxygen cylinders and other requirements for hospitals and individuals. We are going beyond our call of duty to help in this critical situation, but I feel there should be a system in place to take care of all these arrangements.” For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-braving-the-odds-to-help-delhiites-fight-back-covid-101619166236326.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu steps up attack on Capt, questions role in sacrilege case||Sharpening his attack on Captain Amarinder Singh on the 2015 sacrilege incidents and drug trade, Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday questioned the role of the chief minister, accusing him of making the advocate general a scapegoat for the setback to the state government in the Punjab and Haryana high court. In a tweet, Sidhu said, “Is the sacrilege case not the top priority for the (state) home minister? Evading of responsibility and making only the advocate general (AG) a scapegoat means the executive authority has no supervisory control. Who controls the AG? The legal team is just a pawn in this game of shifting responsibilities?” Also read: Sidhu shares old posts, says one man responsible for 2015 sacrilege incidentsOn April 9, the high court quashed the Kotkapura police firing probe conducted by a special investigation team (SIT), led by Punjab Police inspector general Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh. The SIT was constituted by the state government, but the court asked the government to reconstitute it without Kunwar Vijay Pratap on board. Kunwar Vijay Pratap opted for voluntary retirement but not before hitting out at Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda, alleging that that the legal team led by him did not strongly defend the Kotkapura police firing case in the court. Sidhu, the Amritsar East MLA, has joined the issue with this tweet and held the chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio, responsible for the failure to defend the probe in the court. This is the fifth attack the former state minister has launched on the chief minister in a week. On Wednesday, he blamed “one person” for having colluded with the culprits, while sharing his old clips against the sacrilege issue on social media. He, however, neither disclosed the name of the person, nor did he clarify about the culprits he was talking about. Responding to a letter by lawyer and former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA HS Phoolka on April 19, Sidhu said they should shake the chief minister to make him perform his duties and act against the accused in the sacrilege and police firing incidents. The sacrilege of a bir (cop) of Guru Granth Sahib took place in Bargari village of Faridkot district in 2015. During post-sacrilege protests, two Sikh protesters were killed in police firing at Behbal Kalan village. Protesters were also injured in the police firing at Kotakapura during the SAD-BJP rule. The Congress came to power in 2017, assuring voters of justice in the sacrilege incidents besides ending drug abuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-steps-up-attack-on-capt-questions-role-in-sacrilege-case-101619165875724.html

He added that all passengers coming from West Bengal to Bhubaneswar or Jharsuguda airports would be mandatorily subjected to institutional quarantine or paid quarantine for 14 days at facilities identified/ordered by district magistrates/ municipal commissioners.From Friday morning, district collectors of Balasore and Mayurbhanj set up border check posts on all inter-state roads including national highways along the West Bengal border.The triple mutant variant (B.1.618) is a new lineage of SARS-COV-2 that has been formed by a combination of three variants of the virus. It, apparently, can evade the human immune system, experts say. West Bengal, which reported a total of 11,948 Covid-19 cases on Thursday with 23 per cent positivity rate, is believed to have its cases driven by the triple mutant. On Friday, Odisha reported 6,215 cases, its highest single-day surge, while 8 people lost their lives to the deadly virus.The quarantine order for people from West Bengal came as beds across various Covid hospitals in the state neared exhaustion. At VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital in Sambalpur, where cases are surging, the 225-bed Covid hospital has run out of beds. “All 225 beds, including the 50 bed ICU wing, are fully occupied. We are trying to add 300 more beds including 50 ICU beds in the next few days,” said VIMSAR principal Lalit Meher.Similarly, the situation in Sundargarh district, which has the highest number of 5,055 active cases among the 30 districts, is no better. All 520 beds in three Covid hospitals in the district are full.In Bhubaneswar, all 771 beds in SUM hospital were reported full while all 150 beds in Aditya-Ashwini Covid hospital were occupied. Similarly, no ICU beds are available at Hi-Tech hospital while all 50 beds in Nilachal hospital have been occupied.With Covid beds almost exhausted, the state health department ordered that all private hospitals with 30 beds or more must ensure the provision of a minimum 50 per cent of general beds and 50 per cent ICU/HDU beds for the treatment of Covid patients.“It is observed that the private hospitals are treating the non-Covid cases but when they find such patients to be Covid-19 positive during the treatment they immediately request the government machinery to shift such patients to a government Covid facility. It is observed that the private hospitals are also not admitting Covid-19 positive patients with a plea that they do not have Covid beds. This has resulted in an increased load on government Covid facilities,” a health department order said.Meanwhile, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday assured the Centre of providing all cooperation as lack of medical oxygen crippled the fight against Covid-19 in Delhi and elsewhere in the country,“It is a war-like situation and Odisha will extend all cooperation in the fight against Covid at the national level including ramping up oxygen production to assist other states in this emergency situation,” said Patnaik during his discussion with PM Modi.Patnaik’s assurance came in the backdrop of the acute shortage of oxygen faced by Delhi and many other states in the country at present. As per the allocation made on April 21, Delhi will get 70-tonne of liquid medical oxygen from Odisha. Rourkela Steel Plant will provide 40 tonnes a day while Tata Steel plant at Kalinga Nagar will provide 30 tonnes daily.Additional chief secretary, Odisha health department, PK Mohapatra said the current oxygen manufacturing capacity of the state is three times that of oxygen consumed during the peak first wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/14day-quarantine-mandatory-for-people-coming-to-odisha-from-west-bengal-101619161137184.html

Mane will be produced before the special NIA court for remand on Friday.Mane, a 1995-batch Maharashtra police service officer, was in-charge of Unit 11 of the Mumbai Police crime branch in Kandivli. NIA officials said he was under the cloud of suspicion since March 13, when controversial Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze was arrested in the case, so much so that the team had inspected several official vehicles assigned to the Unit 11.Also Read | Hiran murder: Naresh Gor applies for bail, claims he was never contacted by VazeIncidentally, the caller who had contacted Hiran on March 4, had also identified himself as crime branch officer Tawde from Kandivli, and drawn him out of his Thane residence for a meeting along Ghodbunder Road.Hiran went missing after he stepped out at about 8.30pm on March 4. The next day, his body was found dumped in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered with a scarf.NIA suspected Mane was involved in the murder. Sources said he was present at the Criminal Intelligence Unit, which was then headed by Vaze, along with one more police officer on March 3, when the plan to eliminate Hiran, linked to the explosive-laden Mahindra Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, was allegedly hatched.NIA, which is investigating both the cases, has so far arrested Vaze, his former colleague at CIU, assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, former policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-bomb-scare-hiran-murder-case-another-mumbai-police-officer-arrested-101619158015369.html

A group of young people, who had survived the first wave of Covid-19 last year, are getting ready to join their duty at various state-run hospitals in the city after a gap of almost four months. “It was on January 20 this year that I had last been attached to any hospital treating Covid patients. Thereafter, I was asked to go home as Covid-19 cases had declined. Now that cases have shot up again, I was asked to join from April 20,” said Tohidul Mollah, 19, member of the Covid Warrior Club and attached to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. It was in June 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic had struck, that the West Bengal government started Covid Warrior Clubs which comprised mostly young people who had survived Covid-19. They were stationed as attendants in various hospitals to help doctors and nurses in the treatment Covid-19 patients. There were around 680 of such warriors from across the state. However, once the number of cases began dropping, their services were not needed anymore. “Most of us were asked to go home when the cases dropped from around 4,000 per day in October last year to less than 200 early this year. The state-run hospital, where I was stationed along with a few others, even stopped giving us lunch. Dinner and breakfast were, however, served at Salt Lake stadium where several such warriors were staying,” said Bapan Dewan, a club member from Murshidabad district. Also Read | PM Modi to address rally virtually in Bengal due to Covid surgeThe daily count of Covid-19 cases in the state shot up to 11,948 on Thursday and the government is more than willing to have the volunteers back. “Covid Warriors were engaged on a contractual basis against a monthly remuneration of ₹15,000. Now that cases have surged, their contracts have been renewed till May 31,” said a senior government official. The state had around 63,500 active cases till April 21 out of which around 6,700 patients were admitted in various government-run and private hospitals. Members of the club are mostly deployed in the city-based hospitals where the rush of patients is higher. “We are back in action to help in the fight against the second wave. When the first wave had hit and people were scared to go near Covid-19 patients, we attended to them; helping them with food and medicines, sometimes taking them to the toilet and at times, boosting their morale as we had survived the disease ourselves,” said Mukhtar Sk, a 34-year-old member of the club attached to the Covid ward in the state-run NRS Medical College and Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengals-covid-warrior-club-back-in-action-as-cases-continue-to-soar-101619157295318.html

Director, Subhasis Chaudhuri, on Tuesday, announced that some units of the device were now being used by the Travancore Devaswom Trust in Sabarimala, Kerala. “We have been asked by the Trivandrum Police to give a live demonstration for the department procurement,” said Seema Periwal, a senior programme manager for NCETIS. Six units of BEAGLEZ are also in use by three departments of the Indian Army. BEAGLEZ is a light-weight hand-held device that can detect Trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), Semtex and other plastic explosives used in home-made, military explosives and improvised explosive device (IED).The device can find application in screening people, checkpoints, post-blast search, vehicles, buildings, terrorist hotspots, places of importance, crowded establishments and environment.BEAGLEZ was designed and commercialised by a team of researchers led by Anil Kumar, professor in the department of chemistry at IIT Bombay, in collaboration with Bigtec Labs, a Bengaluru-based science and technology company. The device has sensitivities that can be at par with canines. The first two units of BEAGLEZ were donated by Bigtec to the temple trust in Sabarimala which has now shown interest in buying the product.The device uses Amplifying Fluorescent Polymers (AFP) for detection. AFPs are conjugate polymers that exhibit solid-state fluorescence when excited by light of a particular wavelength. “There’s a polymer coating on the sensor of the device. A capillary unit sucks air in and when the air passes over this coating, the coating glows. However, if there is an explosive in the air, the polymer will stop glowing,” said Kumar.While the device has a worldwide patent for its technology, it also has three device other design patents to its name. “We are constantly working on improving the design and we are adhering to global standards for the same,” said Kumar.Bigtec is the only indigenous manufacturer of the hand-held explosive detector. “BEAGLEZ is the smallest and lightest in its category and doesn’t require any extra accessories. While an import brand of the hand-held detector can cost approximately ₹18 to 22 lakhs, the selling price of BEAGLEZ is priced in the range of ₹12 to 15 lakhs depending on the volumes,” said Periwal.“We believe that BEAGLEZ will play a catalytic role towards the ‘Make-in-India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiatives. We look forward to seeing the use of this product at various strategic places,” said Chaudhuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitb-researchers-design-hand-held-explosive-detection-device-101619157174737.html

There is an acute shortage of oxygen across the city but for now, the crisis has been averted.”Hospitals in the National Capital have issued distress messages about dwindling oxygen supply. The crisis prompted the Centre to invoke the Disaster Management Act to ensure its unrestricted supply after Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday blamed police forces of the two neighbouring states for preventing inter-state movement of oxygen tankers.Earlier on Friday morning, the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said in an SOS: “Oxygen will last another 2 hrs. Ventilators and Bipap [non-invasive ventilation] not working effectively. Resorting to manual ventilation in ICUs [intensive care units]... Major crisis likely. [The] lives of another 60 sickest patients in peril. Stop catastrophe. Need Oxygen to be airlifted urgently. Governments please help. We have warned.”Also Read | AIIMS Delhi faces staff shortage, stops contact tracing of exposed medicsPolice said no oxygen contingency arose in the hospital and that there was no dearth of it. The hospital had oxygen stock that would have lasted for three hours, they added. It received 2,000 cubic metre supply in a tanker that arrived there at 9:20 am on Friday. The hospital requires between 9,500 to 11,000 cubic metres daily, the police said.An oxygen tanker was earlier stuck in Rohini as the driver did not know the route and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital staff later escorted it.Deputy police commissioner (central) Jasmeet Singh said the hospital did not make any distress call seeking a green corridor.Police said the hospital informed them they had at least three-hour stock and also one container was on its way.To be sure, a green corridor is not provided to every vehicle. Police provide it only after receiving distress calls. Oxygen vehicles are not stopped in any case.Police stationed a liaison officer at the hospital.

To meet the rising demand and also create livelihood, the national rural livelihood mission (NRLM) has, yet again, given the task of mask making to women in villages.Several women self-help groups (women SHGs) are now engaged in mask-making while some are involved in the production of sanitisers and PPE (personal protection equipment) kits as well.“Mask is considered an important tool in safety against Covid world over. Under the circumstances now, women SHGs in many districts are engaged in cotton and khadi double and terrible-layer masks. Currently, women in a total of 1,208 SHGs across the state are engaged in mask-making,” said UP state rural livelihood mission (Upsrlm) director, Sujeet Kumar, in a government statement.Kumar said that till April 18, these 1,208 women SHGs made 9.39 lakh masks while 17 women SHGs made 1,248 PPE kits.“We are supplying cloth, cotton and khadi, to the SHGs and also the design for the mask-making,” he said in the statement, adding, “arrangements have already been made for procurement of these masks made by the SHGs. A system has been created to make these masks available at reasonable rates to departments like health, panchayati raj, food along with the police administration.”Talking about last year’s work, Kumar said that the women with SHGs produced 1.02 crore masks, 50,714 PPE kits and 13,675 litres of sanitiser during the first wave of the infectious disease.Last year, during Covid-19 time, the women SHGs also worked for the distribution of ration in eleven districts (Sultanpur, Sidharthnagar, Mainpuri, Mahoba, Kanpur Nagar, Basti, Banda, Bahraich, Bagpat, Barabanki and Aligarh). At that time, more than 125 SHGs distributed ration and cooked food for the needy.

Moreover, the quarantine of asymptomatic contacts should be discontinued as well, the hospital informed, adding that from now onwards, only the symptomatic healthcare workers should be tested and only those testing positives are to be isolated and managed as per clinical protocols.In view of the current situation of COVID19 leading to insufficient resources for contact tracing & shortage of staff...Only symptomatic health care workers should be tested & only testing positive be isolated& managed as per the clinical condition: AIIMS, Delhi (22/4) pic.twitter.com/UVEqbsWR19India recorded the world's highest daily tally of 314,835 coronavirus infections on Thursday, with the second wave of the pandemic crushing its weak health infrastructure. In Delhi alone, where hospitals are running out of medical oxygen supplies, the daily rise was over 26,000. As many as 306 people were reported to have died of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in the national capital and overburdened healthcare resources are forcing people to turn to makeshift facilities.AIIMS Delhi held a Covid-19 review meet at 8:30am on Thursday, under the chairmanship of its director Randeep Guleria, in which the new directives for healthcare workers were issued, as per the notice shared by ANI. "In view of the current situation of Covid-19 leading to insufficient resources for contact tracing, and shortages of staff, the risk assessment and contact tracing of exposed HCW and quarantine of asymptomatic contacts should be discontinued. Only the symptomatic HCW should be tested and only those testing positives be isolated and managed as per the clinical condition," the notice reads.The notice further details prerequisites for the healthcare workers who test positive to rejoin work, once their conditions improve. "HCW who test positive may be able to join work after 10 days' period from the onset of symptoms, provided that they are afebrile for at least the last 24 hours without the use of antipyretics and symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath) have improved.

23-04-2021||Delhi||Tug-of-war for oxygen keeps Delhi on brink||Several hospitals in the national capital issued new distress messages about their dwindling oxygen supply as the crisis continued on Thursday, prompting the Delhi government to hit out at what it described as “jungle raj” by neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The Union government, too, made new interventions, invoking the Disaster Management Act to remind all states that anyone restricting supplies will face punitive action under the law, while the Delhi Disaster Management Authority appointed two senior bureaucrats as nodal officers to ensure smooth movement of tankers and directed the Delhi Police to provide security logistics from manufacturers’ sites to various health facilities.Throughout Thursday, however, hospitals continued to issue SOS messages saying they were short on supply, with some blaming states for supplies being halted there. “This jungle raj has been going on for three days,” said Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, referring to the alleged blockades by the police forces of the two neighbouring states.“Some hospitals in Delhi have run out of oxygen completely. They don’t have any option available. I have been receiving calls, messages, e-mails. We have been making internal, makeshift arrangements, but this cannot continue for long,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, spoke on the issue of oxygen crisis, asking states to come down heavily on hoarding and fix responsibility with local administration in cases of obstruction. He told officials to ensure a “smooth, unhindered” supply of oxygen to various states at a review meeting on Thursday.The problem came into focus early on Tuesday when several hospitals in the Capital said they were on the verge of supplies running out, which would end oxygen support to critically ill patients. The problem recurred on Wednesday and Thursday, with close to 1,000 patients being in danger on both days.On Thursday, multiple hospitals -- including Sir Ganga Ram, Saroj, Holy Family, Aakash, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty — said they had either run out of their liquid medical oxygen and had switched to back-up cylinders, or were soon in danger of running out. Some even discharged patients and asked them to go to other facilities.“Our officials and even the Central government officials have tried to talk to officials in these states, but the situation on the ground has not changed. Our tankers are still waiting outside the plants. In the plants located in Haryana, only tankers from that state are being allowed to go in for refilling,” said Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 in Delhi.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal later raised the issue with his Haryana counterpart.The Union government increased Delhi’s quota of daily oxygen supply from 378MT to 480MT on Wednesday, but officials said even this may not be adequate and the additional capacity was likely to take time to arrive.“The Centre decides the companies from which we get oxygen. The revised quota that the Centre has allotted to us, a substantial part of it is to come from Odisha. But it will take several days to bring oxygen from Odisha to Delhi by road. We are exploring if bringing oxygen from there by air is possible. We are trying for that,” Kejriwal said.A government spokesperson said supplies may reach the city too late. “What remains a matter of grave concern is that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 MT oxygen from Odisha (70 MT) and West Bengal (30 MT) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. Our citizens, our hospitals, our city are running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140-metric tonne which Haryana has to supply is yet to leave for Delhi,” said the spokesperson.On Friday, PM Modi is also scheduled to meet chief ministers of regions with a high Covid-19 burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tugofwar-for-oxygen-keeps-delhi-on-brink-101619127460474.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Women’s safety, proper drainage on top of my mind: Raman Goyal||Bathinda’s first woman mayor, Raman Goyal of Congress, is scheduled to assume office on Friday. This will be for the first time that the Congress party will be ruling the municipal corporation. Goyal had defeated BJP’s Seema Arora by 1,134 votes from Ward 35. She belongs to a known business family of the city. Goyal is a graduate in humanities and education and was a homemaker before she started delving into politics. She enjoys singing ‘bhajans’. Vishal Joshi spoke to her to know what her vision for the development of the city. Excerpts of an interview: What are your immediate priorities for the city? Installing a web of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras to curb crime against women and to have a proper drainage system are my top priorities. There is a need to streamlining city’s traffic management with a long-term perspective. I will make sure to take the police department on board to make city safe for the women. How do you see the financial health of the civic body? I will join the mayor’s office on Friday and I do not have exact details. But the finance minister and Congress legislator from Bathinda Manpreet Singh Badal has assured liberal financial support for pro-people works. Have you set any timeline for ongoing city projects? Poor drainage system is a blot on Bathinda city. Even a moderate rainfall inundates the city and administration has to take out boats. Work to strengthen stormwater is underway and it will be ensured that work gets completed before the monsoon sets in. Any plan to expedite pending development projects? I will expedite works of shifting bus stand to a new location on the National Highway-7. Multi-level parking near fire Brigade Chowk will mitigate traffic nuisance to a large extent in the old locality of the city. To improve Swachh Survekshan ratings, more public participation will be ensured. Your election as mayor led to an open opposition by a party colleague. It was a unanimous decision with the consent of the party leadership. Jagroop Singh Gill Ji is the senior-most councillor and I will keep seeking his guidance on various issues of the corporation. There are no groups among Congress councillors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/womens-safety-proper-drainage-on-top-of-my-mind-raman-goyal-101619125013511.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s health infra on brink of collapse||At 9pm on Thursday, there were a mere 15 ICU beds – of them only four with ventilators – remaining for Covid-19 patients in India’s national capital, the Delhi government’s hospital resource reporting app showed. The vacant beds accounted for 0.32% of the 4,663 ICU beds for Covid-19 cases.Of the 20,443 regular hospital beds for people with the coronavirus, only 10.5% -- or 2,141 – were available at the same time on Thursday.These numbers illustrate the near-collapse of the health infrastructure under the burden of a record number of infections. While these numbers are dependent on how frequently and accurately hospital staff updates them, HT’s monitoring of the Delhi Corona website showed vacanacies at hospitals have significantly dropped in the past two days.In the case of ICU beds, there was a peak of 34 vacancies that was reported on Wednesday morning before the number dropped soon after. For most of Thursday, there were fewer than 20 ICU beds available.The number of vacant beds has followed a clearer fall, dropping from roughly 2,700 available on Tuesday evening to a little over 2,100 late on Thursday.As on Thursday, there were 91,618 active cases in Delhi – the first time this number was above the 90,000 mark. The city added 26,169 new cases in the past 24 hours and recorded 306 more fatalities.Experts say the numbers capture a crisis that has been unfolding for several weeks now and could drive up mortality as lives that can be saved with medical attention are lost.“The situation in Delhi is very bad; it is turning out to be a Brazil-like situation. People are going from hospital to hospital for the want of beds. When hospitals are full and we can’t take care of patients, the number of deaths will go up. I believe they have set up a system in Maharashtra where a centralised helpline takes patients information such as name, age, oxygen saturation, reports of X-ray or CT scans and direct people to hospitals accordingly. There should be a similar system in Delhi,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.A doctor from one of Delhi’s big private hospitals, which is finding it difficult to refer patients out of its emergency department, too, said a centralised system was needed to cut down on the number of deaths.“Every day there are patients who are brought dead to our emergency department. They have been going from hospital to hospital looking for beds. We lose patients because they are lying on the floor instead of the ICU they need. We have more patients than we have oxygen points. A solution would be for the government to take stock of the number of beds across the city and refer patients wherever beds are available. Hospitals such as the one built by the army should be meant for such referral patients,” the doctor said, asking not to be named.“So far, there was hardly any difference in the mortality during this wave and the previous one, proving that the virus is not more fatal. However, the deaths may be higher now because the health system has been overburdened. And, we keep on adding more cases every day for which we need to add more infrastructure every day,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The situation could ease by a small degree later this week as the Union government decided to revive the Covid-19 case facility in Chattarpur, which will have 500 beds with oxygen support to begin with.The facility, set up during the waves of infection recorded last year, was closed on February 23 when the outbreak appeared to have receded. It is now expected to be opened in three days’ time with the Indo-Tibet Border Police managing operations.“Delhi government has assured us they will set-up the infrastructure in maximum three days and hand over the facility to us. Our team of doctors and paramedics is ready. It will be operational in two-three days,” director general of ITBP, SS Deswal, told HT.The facility, named Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, is at the Radha Soami Beas grounds.“The Delhi government had sought medical officers and para-medical staff from the ministry of home affairs to man the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Chhattarpur, which is being re-operationalised. The Ministry of Home Affairs has designated ITBP as the nodal force for operating the facility,” a home ministry spokesperson said.“It has been decided to provide an adequate number of medical officers and para-medical staff to man 500 oxygenated beds to Sardar Patel Covid centre, Chhattarpur in Delhi,” said an MHA letter reviewed by HT.An officer, who didn’t want to be named, said they are hoping to increase the number of beds to 1,500 by the first week of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-health-infra-on-brink-of-collapse-101619124867420.html

The vigilant troopers responded with fire and the suspects managed to flee taking advantage of the darkness and standing wheat crop in the fields,” a senior BSF official said. “Though its seems to be an infiltration attempt, we are also looking at the possibility of an attempt to sneak in drugs or weapons into the Indian territory. A search operation in the area is still on,” he added. In July 2015, three gunmen dressed in army uniform opened fire on a bus and then attacked the Dinanagar police station in Gurdaspur district. The attack resulted in the death of three civilians and four policemen, including a superintendent of police (SP).The investigation after the attack had suggested that the three militants, who were killed during the siege at the police station, had come from Pakistan after crossing the Ravi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-foils-intrusion-bid-along-indo-pak-border-in-pathankot-101619124594097.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||International drug cartel: ED books ex-Ludhiana village sarpanch, 7 others for money laundering||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case of money laundering against Gurdeep Singh Rano, former sarpanch of Rano village in Ludhiana district, and seven other persons in the high-profile international drug cartel case. The other accused are Ravez Singh Dhillon, Akashdeep Singh, Babaljit Singh, Iqbal and Ramneek Singh, all from the Khanna area of Ludhiana district, and NRIs Simran Sidhu (based in Italy) and Tanvir Singh Bedi (based in Australia). The agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR) under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of probe details shared by the Punjab Police’s special task force (STF) headed by additional director general of police (ADGP) Harpreet Singh Sidhu and other documents. The ED started its probe looking into the money trail in the case with links in Australia and Pakistan. “We will investigate as where the drug returns were invested and will start the attachment process of properties bought from the money. The role of Punjab Police officials and others whose name cropped during the STF probe is also under lens. We will proceed according to evidence,” said a senior ED official. The ED in its probe found the accused used to smuggle heroin and other narcotic substances from Pakistan and other countries through shipping containers. Then they used to stock the contraband in the various parts of the country and sell it in Punjab and elsewhere. The probe also established that Rano and other accused had close ties with police officials and many gangsters. The STF had arrested Rano in November last year and seized eight cars, including a Jaguar, a Q7 Audi, a Toyota Fortuner and a BMW, from his palatial house. It had also recovered 5.39 kg heroin and illegal arms from him in a special operation. Rano, who owned only a scooter till 2015, allegedly amassed property of ₹50 crore in a span of four years. Also, he used to move around with police security. In March this year, the Punjab government suspended five senior police officers, including inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal who is already facing suspension in the 2015 police firing cases; assistant commandant (4th battalion) Pathankot, Varinderjit Singh Thind; Faridkot superintendent of police (detective) Sewa Singh Malli; and DSPs Parminder Singh Bath and Karansher Singh for their alleged complicity with Rano.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/international-drug-cartel-ed-books-ex-ludhiana-village-sarpanch-7-others-for-money-laundering-101619124593029.html

Those aged above 50 in the state continue to remain the most vulnerable in 2021 as well with data showing that 82% of the total fatalities were from the age bracket in the second wave.Last year, 77% of the total deaths were from the age group.So far, Punjab has witnessed 8,189 deaths of which 5,341 took place last year.While the state’s case fatality ratio (CFR) in 2020 was 3.2%, it has come down by 1.8% in the second wave to 2.6%.The trend of fatalities also remains almost the same during the second wave with 30.2% of those succumbing to the infection from the 61-70 age group compared to 28.3% last year.

23-04-2021||Delhi||Safer policing: None over 58 on PCR van duty, only virtual meets||With the Covid-19 pandemic further tightening its grip on the national capital, the Delhi Police on Thursday removed all personnel aged 58 years and above from the police control room (PCR) van duty, besides advising all station personnel to have only virtual interactions with the public. The force’s in-house meetings are now being held in open spaces within police stations, officers aware of the developments said.Over 8,000 police personnel have tested positive for the virus and 38 have succumbed since the beginning of the pandemic. At least 432 personnel have contracted Covid-19 until Thursday since the current wave of infections started.Given that one in every three people who get tested for the coronavirus disease are turning positive in Delhi, and in view of the week-long curfew to contain the virus spread, police personnel are now acting as frontline workers. They are managing containment zones, enforcing curfew norms , arranging oxygen cylinders and rushing Covid-19 patients to hospitals, apart from maintaining law and order.A senior police officer said, “For now, we have ordered that all persons aged 58 years and above should not be posted on PCR van duty. Compared to other units, the personnel with PCR vans are testing positive for the disease more. The PCR van is the first responder at every spot -- its personnel visit homes when people call 112.”After a meeting of the police brass on Saturday, all personnel were told to keep sufficient stock of PPE kits because police vehicles are also doubling up as ambulances. The 112 number (police control room) is getting over 150 calls requesting ambulances. In the past 48 hours, there were six cases of police vans rushing Covid-19 patients to the hospitals.A station house officer of a south Delhi police station said, “Our meetings with complainants are virtual now. This is being adopted by other police stations, too, and it is safer for complainants as well. All they have to do is to inform one of our designated officer at the station gate. They will get a time and phone number for the video call.This is better than visiting the station, which is a closed space. In-house meetings are now being held on the lawns.”A second senior police officer said that, at the New Friends Colony police station in south-east Delhi, tents have been erected outside the station for visitors. “There is an audio-video system at the gate for the visitor to connect with the station. Every paper (copies of complaints brought by visitors) is disinfected before it is taken inside or handed back to the visitor. Apart from PPE kits, we have also given our personnel, protective eye gear that health care professionals use to shield themselves from the virus,” the second officer said.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said police stations across the city are “adopting different measures to remain safe on the job”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/safer-policing-none-over-58-on-pcr-van-duty-only-virtual-meets-101619124017210.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Prayer, witnessed||It is morning and the newspaper vendor, passing on his bicycle, is carrying front pages filled with dreadful news on Covid-19. The narrow lane is otherwise empty, more or less — it goes past Jama Masjid’s gate no. 2, in Old Delhi. The entrance to the mosque is locked. The popular tea stall nearby is closed. But then the city is under curfew due to the pandemic. The only people to be seen are a few families sleeping on the pavement — they’ve been living here for years. The only other living being around is a brown dog snoozing on a manhole.Now a rickshaw puller enters the scene. He stops his carriage in front of the twin Sufi shrines of Hazrat Sarmad Shahid and Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah, which stand in front of the Mughal-era mosque. The puller is wearing a check lungi, his head covered in a white gamcha. The shrine’s door is open and, inside, a rose seller is perched on his stall. But the puller doesn’t seem like he wants to enter the dargah. He gets off the rickshaw, stands in front of the marble screen of the shrine, and raises his arm as if in supplication. He closes his eyes, his lips moving soundlessly. The man stays in this posture for about five minutes — each passing second feels like a sea wave, coming quickly and receding the next moment, its impact lingering on.The lips finally stop moving. The eyes open. The palms reverently touch the forehead. And the rickshaw puller looks around absentmindedly.Responding to his interlocutor, he reveals that he was praying.For himself?He shakes his head.For his family?I have no family, he says.Then?“I was praying to Baba to take back the bimari,” he says in a low voice. He means the coronavirus.Has he got symptoms?He shakes his head again. “I was praying for all of us.”Reluctant to give away his name, he excuses himself politely, sits back on his seat and pedals away towards Urdu Bazaar. The lane is lifeless again. The homeless families who were sleeping on the pavement continue to sleep. The dog hasn’t stirred a bit. The rose seller is as still as a statue. It is as||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-prayer-witnessed-101619123448967.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Property tax: MC slaps ₹7.5 crore dues notice on Panjab University||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has served a ₹7.5 crore notice on Panjab University (PU) for non-payment of outstanding property tax dues.Earlier, the MC had served a ₹13.61 crore property tax notice. But, after reconciliation meetings between the two authorities, the revised figure of ₹7.5 crore was reached.The MC had stated that four property IDs referred in the earlier letter have been raised on the basis of area details submitted by the university. After going through a survey conducted by Punjab Engineering College (PEC), it has been found that the PU has not submitted the detail of the full area.“However, after fresh communication with the PU officials, it was decided to exclude some of the properties which were earlier considered part of the university in calculating property tax,” said an MC official dealing in the matter.The commercial properties in the PU, and some other buildings like school have now been excluded from the calculation of property tax. PU will not pay for these buildings now. Notices to these building will be served separately for payment of their outstanding tax dues.“PU claimed that some buildings were constructed after 2004 and the commercial areas are under private persons. So, we have excluded these buildings,” said the official.The university, it is learnt, has agreed to pay the full revised amount of the pending dues. “At present, we have not set any deadline for the payment. The MC is offering a rebate to the property tax payers depositing it for the current financial year (2021-22) by May 31. PU can also use this opportunity,” said the official.The residential property taxpayers can avail a rebate of 20% and commercial property taxpayers 10%. After May 31, the MC will impose a penalty of 25% and 12% interest on the tax dues.Notably, the MC had earlier issued a notice of ₹27 crore for recovery of property tax dues from the UT administration.There are 1.06 lakh residential and commercial taxpayers in the city. In the current fiscal, the MC has so far collected ₹57 crore as property tax against the budget target of ₹48 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/property-tax-mc-slaps-7-5-crore-dues-notice-on-panjab-university-101619122983856.html

23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Western Command to set up Covid care facility in Chandigarh||The Western Command will assist with Covid-19 management efforts in Chandigarh and has agreed to the UT’s administration request to set up a Covid care facility in the city. Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “The administration will provide the space and Army authorities will arrange the required health infrastructure and staff.” Amid the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in the last month, the city is staring at a shortage of beds. All major health establishments in the city, particularly the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), are approaching full occupancy. Government hospitals in the city, including PGIMER, GMCH-32, GMCH-48 and GMSH-16 have 676 beds. Parida said, “At present, we don’t have shortage of beds in the city, but we are preparing for every eventuality as there has been a sharp increase in cases. So, the administration on the initiative of UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, had approached the Western Command to create a facility here. It agreed, and will be only requiring space from the administration. The rest of the arrangements will be made by them.” A meeting of senior officials from the Western Command and the UT officials, including Badnore, is scheduled for Friday. Details of the facility, including the number of beds and its location, are to be finalised. Notably, on April 19, Western Command had assured the civil authorities of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Chandigarh that any assistance required from the formations to combat the prevalent crisis will be provided. It has offered assistance like medical care, maintenance of law and order, setting up of quarantine facilities and distribution of essential items. Army Commander Lt General RP Singh had assured that all the formations under area of responsibility of Western Command were geared up to assist civil administration in the fight against Covid. Community centres could be converted to Covid facilities: ParidaThe administration has also received requests from different community organisations and city residents to create more beds for Covid patients in the city. “Representatives of the business community met me today and offered different bhawans like Gulati Bhawan to setup Covid facilities. Similarly, a health facility in Sector 18 has offered the same and I have directed MC officials to examine it and make a report. If need be, we can tap into these facilities also,” said Parida. The administration is also considering creation of such facilities at community centres in different parts of the city. Larger and recently constructed community centres with latest infrastructure will be used if the administration faces shortage of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/western-command-to-set-up-covid-care-facility-in-chandigarh-101619122852297.html

The fourth deceased was a 62-year-old man from Sector 26, who was suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome. 29 ITBP personnel test +ve in PanchkulaThose who died in Panchkula were a 45-year-old man from Pinjore, who also had hypertension and diabetes, and a 75-year old woman from Billa.The district’s fresh cases included 29 personnel from the ITBP and two from the CRPF. Panchkula’s total count has reached 18,032, of which 2,493 cases are active. A total of 15,362 patients (85.19%) have been cured and 177 have died.Remdesivir and tocilizumab scarce in ChandigarhStocks of remdesivir and tocilizumab, two drugs used to treat Covid-19, have exhausted in the city, even though doctors suggest that they do not reduce mortality.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said a few doses of remdesivir were left in government stocks, but those of tocilizumab had run out. “We have placed an order for more supplies,” he said.Meanwhile, PGIMER clarified that remdesivir was an antiviral drug, which did not help with reducing mortality. It is not effective in patients requiring high oxygen support or ventilation. Similarly, various studies have not shown any mortality benefit through tocilizumab as well, the institute said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-s-daily-covid-cases-soar-to-2-024-in-record-high-101619121532250.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Assessing student performance a challenge in the online mode: Experts||In early March this year, Sunita Kadam, a Class 8 teacher from a civic body school in Mumbai was busy drawing up a list of academically weak students. With her class being conducted online since March 2020, Kadam said that it was becoming a big challenge for the students. “Last year, all these students passed without proper assessments and this year too, the same will repeat. However, there are a few students who are lagging behind their other counterparts in terms of learning key concepts. We are now working on these students to bridge the learning gap that has been seen due to online learning,” said Kadam. As schools and colleges remain online for more than a year now, understanding and evaluating the academic performance of students and taking corrective action is becoming one of the biggest challenges for teachers and schools. In 2020, students from Classes 1 to 8 were promoted based on internal assessments conducted at the school level. Class 9 and 11 students underwent tests and exams online. Those who failed to clear these exams had to undergo another round of tests in the days to come. Students in colleges and universities had to undergo online multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to pass their semesters. This year, students of Class 1 to 12 barring Class 10 and 12 will be promoted to the next class without any exams. ‘Can have disastrous consequences’Experts said that not being able to conduct assessments of students can have disastrous consequences on their overall learning outcomes of students. Sudam Kumbhar, former principal of Shailendra High School in Dahisar said that the consequences are particularly alarming for students from low-income households. “In families with low economic means, the children have already suffered a lot due to the pandemic. There are anxieties about employment and overall existence. In online classes, nearly 50% of students are often absent because they are accompanying their parents to their workplaces or have no access to phones and gadgets. It thus becomes crucial to assess the learning levels of such students which will not happen systematically because there are no exams and assessments,” added Kumbhar. Over the last year, a large number of students from colleges and universities who were previously struggling to get their backlogs cleared have managed to pass, said colleges. This is particularly a cause of concern because there is no way to know whether these students have merely passed the exams or have understood the subject during this time.“Every year, some students in every class end up with ATKT (allowed to keep terms) which they carry forward to the next semester. In some cases, students carry forward their KTs for two years but all this changed with the MCQ format of exams. While students have passed the exam, we are doubting how much of the subject they’ve realistically understood,” said the principal of a suburban college. Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra said, “Even though most students in our institute have scored very well, teachers are worried that students have not understood basic concepts and this will affect their ability to understand larger concepts in the future courses/subjects.”Lack of learning continuityIn December 2020, Leadership for Equity, a Pune-based NGO that works closely with the state education department conducted a community survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on learning. The sample survey conducted across six districts in the state (Pune, Akola, Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik) revealed that one of the biggest repercussions of prolonged school closures was the lack of learning continuity among students. A large number of parents and teachers expressed concerns about learning losses as only about two of the 10 students surveyed, reported having access to a phone during their study time. In eight of the 10 households, more than one person was sharing a phone thus raising concerns about the reach of online learning. Standard guidelines are importantFrancis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network said that in the days to come, it is important to have consistency and universality in strategies used for bridging the learning gaps. “Right now, each school is working on addressing issues arising out of online learning at its level as per its understanding. We need to understand that school leaders are not necessarily experts in pedagogy and thus boards need to come up with a set of standard guidelines for this. We need to understand that under the current circumstance, the entire schooling system needs to slow down a bit and rework its entire structure to make it easier on students for the coming 2-3 years. The repercussions of the losses during the pandemic will have to be dealt with even in the years to come,” he added. Trial by error learningThe sudden change from regular classes to the virtual mode affected teaching as well as learning modules across higher education institutes. Several colleges started training teachers before starting regular lectures but for a large chunk of teachers, learning was trial by error. “Most colleges were waiting for the University of Mumbai to announce the course of action, and once the announcement to start classes in the virtual mode came through, colleges were unprepared. Many of us understood the virtual classroom on our own by making many mistakes and learning from them,” said a senior professor from a suburban college. While theory sessions were conducted smoothly by colleges, practical sessions were a challenge for many. “We used the best technology possible and recorded videos of practical sessions for students, which were shared regularly. In case some students did not understand the concept, we allowed them to physically report to the college and conducted practical sessions keeping social distancing in mind,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, Churchgate. She added that students preferred depending on virtual classes as compared to physical classes as many were back in their hometowns and travelling would’ve been a problem. Increase in learning inequalitiesEducationists said while assessing the performance of students is a tough task without conducting periodic tests and exams, governments need to understand that learning losses due to the pandemic is a very critical concern. “Like always, it is going to increase learning inequalities. Those who can afford the best tutors and help will sail through. For families where retaining children in schools is a challenge, these learning losses would pose challenges in future as students have to compete for various exams,” added Kumbhar.“For the poor, their marks are the only gateway to a good education and if learning is not equal, we cannot test students on the same levels for sure,” said a teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/assessing-student-performance-a-challenge-in-the-online-mode-experts-101619121171571.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Teachers urge education dept to declare summer break dates||Teachers in schools and junior colleges across the state have urged the education department to declare the dates for concluding the current semester and start of summer break this year.Many teachers have recently urged officials to give clarity about ending the current semester after the government announced that students from Classes 1 to 8 and 11 shall be promoted to the next class without exams. “Now that all students have been promoted, we are hoping that the end of semester is announced soon. We are seeing a very low attendance as it is. We hope here is some break in between before the new semester begins,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of Teachers Democratic Front.The Mumbai Regional Junior College Teachers’ Organization (MRJCTO) also wrote to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad requesting the declaration of summer break for teachers. “As you are aware that many states have declared summer vacation for teachers and students, but the government of Maharashtra has not declared it yet. We request you to ensure that summer vacation is declared for junior college teachers with immediate effect,” stated the letter.Officials from the education department did not respond to calls and messages.Usually, summer vacations begin for teachers from May 2 and schools under the state board reopen for the new academic year from the second week of June. With the cancellation of Class 10 exams and postponement of Class 12 exams, teachers might have to work in May and June this year. “We hope that at least we get a few days off before that,” said a teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-teachers-urge-education-dept-to-declare-summer-break-dates-101619121111492.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra varsities to conduct exams only in online mode: Higher education minister||All state public universities will conduct their exams, including final-year exams, in the online mode, said state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant, in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases across Maharashtra.“While most of the university exams were anyway being held online, there were a few places where offline options were also available. But considering the strict restrictions of lockdown from April 22, this will not be possible. Such universities had approached the department seeking permission to hold all exams completely online, following which the decision was taken. All universities and colleges have been instructed to ensure that no student misses the online examination,” said Samant adding that this decision was taken after discussing the options with the chancellor of all state universities, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Recently, several scheduled examinations had to be postponed due to the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country. School education boards including Maharashtra state, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as well as Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) decided to cancel their Class 10 board exams and postpone Class 12 exams this year. Similarly, the National Testing Agency (NTA) postponed all-India competitive exams indefinitely.University of Mumbai (MU) had released a circular in March clarifying that all university exams will be conducted in online mode in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format. “Not just theory exams, but affiliated colleges have also ensured that practical exams are conducted online. So, we have nothing to worry about,” said a senior official from MU. Similarly, most state universities have already announced that exams will be held in the online mode owing to the latest lockdown situation across the State.“Safety of staff and students is our focus, and we will make sure no student is at a loss due to the current situation. We have also been in talks with the authorities to get all teachers and other non-teaching staff to get vaccinations on priority so that the examination and results process is not hindered,” said Samant. He added that the education department also hopes to get all 3.7 million students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate courses in state universities vaccines on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-varsities-to-conduct-exams-only-in-online-mode-higher-education-minister-101619121112119.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Procurement woes: AAP demands Ashu’s resignation||Chandigarh The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday demanded Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s resignation for failing to stop the smuggling of wheat from other states, and shortage of gunny bags (bardana) in mandis. In a statement, AAP legislator and kisan wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan alleged that Ashu has failed in performing his responsibilities and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh should dismiss him. “It is the responsibility of the state government’s department of food and civil supplies to ensure timely and efficient procurement and payment of the crop arriving in the mandis,” he said. Sandhwan said since the commencement of procurement, only about 50% of the crop had reached the mandis, out of which about 60% was still lying in mandis due to shortage of gunny bags. “Due to this, there are stockpiles of wheat in the state mandis and the weighing work has come to a standstill,” he said. Farmers block CM adviser’s motorcadePatiala: Farmers under the banner of BKU (Krantikari) blocked the motorcade of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s adviser BIS Chahal for over three hours on the Patiala-Sirhind road on Thursday over shortage of gunny bags for wheat procurement. The protesters were also upset over slow lifting wheat.Chahal was on his way towards Sirhind when the farmers blocked his motorcade near Rurki village where they were already protesting. Heavy police force was deployed at the spot as the senior officials from Fatehgarh Sahib police reached to convince the farmers to clear the road. Even Chahal had to step out of his car to pacify the protestors, but to no avail. “I have talked to senior officials of district administration and those dealing with procurement agencies. The gunny bags will be provided at the earliest,” Chahal could be seen saying to the farmers in one of the videos before getting back in his car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/procurement-woes-aap-demands-ashu-s-resignation-101619121052786.html

23-04-2021||Mumbai||Postponed board and competitive exams leave class 12 students anxious||Eighteen-year-old Aarya Tendulkar used to spend at least 12 hours a day studying and preparing for her Class 12 exams as well as the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) until March this year. NEET is an exam that over a million students take every year for admission to undergraduate medical courses in medical institutions, including premier ones like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), among others. Last year alone, 1.6 million candidates registered for the exam; less than half qualified. Tendulkar and several like her are well aware of how competitive the entrance exam is. This has been her routine since 2019: “My day would start at 6am and I would study continuously till 9am. After a 30-minute break I would once again start at 10am and study till 2.30pm. My coaching institute lectures are scheduled in the afternoon till 7pm, following which I would have my dinner and then revise what was taught in class for an hour or two before calling it a day.” However, the Ghatkopar resident feels in a bit of a limbo right now. On April 18, the National Testing Agency announced that Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains is postponed until further notice while the status of NEET, scheduled for August first week, is yet unknown. “I feel this preparation time will never end and that is leaving me more anxious than ever,” she said.Rising Covid-19 cases across the country has forced state and national school boards to cancel Class 10 board exams and postpone exams for Class 12 students. Similarly, entrance exams to all undergraduate professional courses have been pushed forward. IIT-Joint Entrance Exams (JEE-Mains) are usually held in April, followed by JEE-Advanced in May. NEET-UG too is scheduled for May every year. However, due to the national lockdown imposed last year, the exams were conducted between September and October 2020. This year, of the four sessions of JEE-Mains, two were held in February and March while April session has been postponed. Last year, by the time the national lockdown was imposed, most Class 10 and 12 students had been able to finish most of their board exams: Maharashtra state board Class 12 exams had finished; only one paper remained for those in Class 10; Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 and 12 board exams were done; and Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board students were promoted based on the exams already held. As a result, students sitting for competitive exams this year worry that they may now have to take multiple exams in a stretch. “My daughter has not taken a vacation in over two years because her focus was to prepare herself best for Class 12 and NEET exams. But last year has been tough for her physically and mentally, and the fact that exams have once again been postponed is leaving her more anxious with every passing day,” said Dr Bharat Shah, father of Manashvi Shah, 18. Shah joined integrated coaching classes after clearing Class 10 and has dedicated much of the past two years preparing for the all-India medical entrance test in the hope of becoming a neurosurgeon in the future. “Children have spent the last one year in front of a computer, and the constant postponement of exam dates are adding to the stress levels of already tired teenagers. As parents, we feel helpless,” said Nisha Parmar, mother of Advait Parmar, 17. Parmar could not appear for the second session of JEE-Mains in March as he was in quarantine after his father tested positive. “I re-registered for the April session and wanted to tick-off at least one exam of my list but now, the April session has been postponed and I am unable to focus on studies anymore,” he said. “Many Class 12 students are living in fear of falling sick during exams or not faring well in exams as many have lost the concentration to focus on exams with so much happening around them,” said Mumbai-based psychologist Seema Hingorrany. “Postponement of exams has calmed the nerves of many. However, students are also worried about the seemingly never-ending wait,” said Vinay Kumar, MD and CEO of Rao Academy, a city-based coaching institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/postponed-board-and-competitive-exams-leave-class-12-students-anxious-101619120997059.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Five districts in Maharashtra report highest Covid CFR||As Maharashtra recorded 67,013 new cases on Thursday, taking the total cases to over 4 million, five districts have emerged as areas of concern with respect to the case fatality ratio (CFR; the percentage of deaths per 100 cases) and in at least three of the districts where data is available, test positivity rate (TPR; number of positive cases per 100 tests) as well.In the period from April 15 to April 21, as Maharashtra recorded its highest seven-day average in both cases as well as fatalities, the CFR of five districts posed the most concern. Of them, Ahmednagar recorded the highest at 1.4%, followed by Nagpur (0.95%), Mumbai (0.64%), Nashik (0.62%) and Pune (0.33%). The TPR, however, was the highest in Nagpur with 34%, while Pune district recorded 26.64% and Mumbai posted 17.21% in the same period. Nashik and Ahmednagar did not reveal their tests, and therefore the TPR could not be calculated. State-wide, the average daily cases touched 64,238, while daily deaths averaged 443 -- highest ever in the pandemic in the country – in the same time period. The state’s TPR averaged 24.81%. The CFR was 0.69% in the same period.To be sure, the CFR in Maharashtra has been consistently falling since January 31. On that day, the overall CFR stood at 2.52%. This fell to 1.54% on April 21. The main reason for this was that deaths have not increased in the same proportion as cases. On January 31, Maharashtra recorded 2630 cases and 42 deaths. On April 21, it recorded 67,468 cases and 568 deaths, its highest one-day death toll.Ahmednagar faces a huge shortage of oxygen cylinders, and all the hospitals are full. The local authorities on Tuesday sought oxygen from Chakan in Pune. When the tanker reached the border, it was stopped by the Pune based authorities and made to halt for two hours. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had to intervene to offer reprieve to the patients.The Maharashtra Government announced a total lockdown which will come to force on Thursday night to contain the virus.The high number of cases in these places has resulted in the burdening of the medical infrastructure which means the shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has requested for supply of medical grade oxygen for the hospitals, following which the Centre has made a road map on supplying oxygen to the state.The Centre has earmarked 1661 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to reach the state from various states, but it is as yet unclear when the oxygen is scheduled to reach.“We have taken various steps to ease the solution and would like the central government to cooperate with us to get out of this crisis. The Centre needs to increase its quota of oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir for Maharashtra,” Tope said.In Pune, the total deaths due to Covid-19 have now reached to 8890 ever since the outbreak of the virus. Many of the small hospitals have stopped admitting patients due to the lack of oxygen. On Wednesday, the district recorded the largest number of cases and there are now 121,284 active cases.In Nagpur, a shortage of Remdesivir, an anti-viral injection, and medical grade oxygen prompted the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court (HC) to take suo moto cognizance of the shortages. On Wednesday night, at a late hearing, it pulled up the Centre for lessening the supply of oxygen from a Bhilai-based supplier, from 110MT to 60MT in a communication dated April 18.At a time when the supply of oxygen should have been increased it was reduced instead, the HC noted and ordered that the supply be restored. The region, it noted, was facing a shortfall of at least 100MT.Earlier in the week, it had asked the Central Controller of Drugs in India to ensure that 10,000 vials of Remdesivir be given to Nagpur. Two days later, the Court rapped the Maharashtra Government for its failure to comply fully with its order.Nashik has become another hotspot for the virus as there are currently 46,253 active patients on Wednesday and has registered a total number of 2701 deaths. The city is facing huge shortage of oxygen and families of patient are frantically searching for Remdesivir injections. “We need at least 125 metric tonnes but are getting only 85 metric tonnes. Even that is very erratic as it sometimes gets caught in various problems,” said senior NCP Minister Chhagan Bhujbal.On Wednesday, one of the tankers supplying oxygen to patients receiving treatment for the coronavirus disease at Dr Zakir Naik Municipal Hospital malfunctioned, which led to the death of 24 persons.In Mumbai which has 84,450 active cases, the government is pulling all stops to beat the shortage. “We are making all efforts to save the lives of the people,” said Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the people in metros are getting the virus due to various reasons.“These election rallies were super spreaders and thousands of people are coming from there in flights and railways. This has played a major role in hike in numbers,” said Shaikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-districts-in-maharashtra-report-highest-covid-cfr-101619120991618.html
23-04-2021||Other||Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan: Maharashtra govt begins assessing local bodies’ performance||The Maharashtra environment and climate change department has begun the assessment of 395 urban local bodies (ULBs) and 304 panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) as part of its Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan, launched last October. Over the next five-six weeks, the ULBs and PRIs will be evaluated through a two-step process to check their compliance with the tasks mandated under the initiative.These include enhancement of green cover and biodiversity, building solid waste management infrastructure, taking steps for water conservation, improving energy efficiency, implementing awareness programmes and getting citizens to take the Majhi Vasundhara e-pledge to show their commitment towards protecting the environment. These tasks have been spread out over five broad indicators – vayu (air), bhumi (earth), jal (water), agni (energy) and akash (education and enhancement).“From last October to March 2021, the ULBs and PRIs were given six months to implement certain tasks, which overlap with the mandate of other state and central schemes, like Maharashtra’s Vanmahotsav plantation drive or the Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission. For a fairer assessment, we are also considering steps that ULBs have taken within the ambit of the indicators between January 2020 and March 2021,” said a spokesperson with the environment department.There are 22 specific (and weighted) tasks assigned to the various rural and urban local bodies. They include planting indigenous trees, implementing adequate waste segregation, treatment and composting facilities, promotion of non-motorised transport and rainwater harvesting, among several others.The first step of the evaluation process will be a clerical desktop assessment, which has been outsourced to a third-party agency and is already underway, officials confirmed. Compliance data submitted by ULBs and PRIs will be assessed, and the organisation will be ranked using a normalised score.The top 50% scorers will be subject to a second-level field inspection and citizen feedback survey, which will be outsourced to a second independent agency, and is expected to begin during the first week of May. “From those selected for field survey, there will be three winners under every vertical. The top three will be each picked out of 43 AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) cities, 226 municipalities, 126 nagar panchayats and 272 villages. Their claims will all be verified in person before scores are assigned,” said the spokesperson, adding that standardised feedback will be taken from between 250-500 citizens in each area, or 0.005% of the area’s population (whichever greater).“The assessment is already underway, and we will aim to complete it within the month so that the best-performing urban and rural local bodies can be felicitated on June 5, World Environment Day,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment and climate change department, adding that this exercise is proposed to be conducted annually, to encourage ULBs and PRIs to continue work launched under the Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/majhi-vasundhara-abhiyan-maharashtra-govt-begins-assessing-local-bodies-performance-101619120872433.html

It is expected to rise to around 150 MT in next two weeks as per projections of case load and this could increase further given the way the Covid upsurge is, the court was told, adding that daily availability of medical oxygen as of now was 115 MT and to meet the demand in view of surge has become a challenge as state does not have a plant of its own. There is disruption of supply of oxygen in few districts as Centre has not been able to supply promised 126 MT, it has told court, adding that government has written to Centre to ensure that it gets 120 MT supply.The information was given during resumed hearing of a plea in which the high court is monitoring the Covid-19 outbreak situation in both the states and Chandigarh.

However, as the SC was yet to issue an order staying the hearing in the high court or seeking transfer of petitions, the HC bench continued the hearing.The bench, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was taking urgent steps to combat the spread. Pointing to the shortage of oxygen and key drugs such as remdesivir, he submitted that the Centre had announced it would take care of it from May 1. On a query by the court on the availability till April 30, Kumbhakoni submitted that measures such as asking suppliers to hand over the medicines directly to the collector who, in turn, would distribute it to hospitals, were put in place. To this, the court said there has to be a portal on availability of essential Covid-19 drugs.Referring to a news report from last year, which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, “Had we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have been arisen.”“You should realise this is an emergency situation,” said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should be stopped. The state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing, and having a uniform rate for the medicines, would be considered.The state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.

Gor is suspected of having provided SIM cards to Vaze, one of which was purportedly used in commission of the trader’s murder. In his bail plea filed through law firm Diamondwala & Co, Gor has claimed that he has been made a scapegoat by the investigating agency on Vaze’s insistence. “The CDR (call data records) of the applicant [Gor] will disprove the case of the investigating agency. There is no shred of evidence to show that the applicant was aware of any conspiracy, much less any knowledge as to the purpose for which the purported SIM cards were going to be used by Vaze,” Gor claimed in his bail plea, adding that, there is no one to look after his wife and four-month-old child. Hiran was found dead in a creek near Mumbra on March 5. Gor was arrested by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on March 21 in connection with the murder of Hiran – linked to the explosives-laden SUV found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai home Antilia. The case was later handed over to NIA.

23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to get 21,000 doses of Remdesivir||The state health department will soon receive 21,400 doses of Remdesivir to meet the rising demand amid the second wave of the pandemic in Punjab, health experts said on Thursday.Remdesivir, an injectable anti-viral, aims to prevent replication of the virus in the infected people. It was manufactured in 2014 to treat Ebola, and has since been used to treat SARS and MERS. In 2020, the drug was repurposed for Covid treatment and clinical experience has shown that it works best in mildly ill to severe Covid-19 patients.In the Covid-19 hotbeds districts of the state, including Amritsar, Patiala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana, the patients are struggling to get Remdesivir injections from government and private hospitals as India is grappling to meet the rising demand of the anti-viral drug.Addressing shortages of Remdesivir in certain and most infected regions of the country, the Central government made interim allocation of the key anti-viral drug for 19 states and Union Territories, including Punjab, for the period up to 30 April. Under the allocation, the Government of India had decided to send 13,400 doses to Punjab.Also, the state health department has placed an order of additional 8,000 doses from private firms, which they are expecting to receive in coming 2-3 days, to ensure easy availability of the anti-viral drug in government and private hospitals.“Remdesivir is not available in Patiala hospitals, both government and private, while its demand is increasing with every positive patient. We have made requests to the state health department to ensure its availability in the market so as to avoid black marketing and hoarding,” said Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh, adding that due to shortage, some healthcare officials are demanding thousands of rupees for one Remdesivir dose.Till Thursday evening, there were around 40,584 active Covid-19 cases in Punjab, of which nearly 508 are on oxygen support. Health experts believe that even the 21,400 Remdesivir doses may fall short in the next ten days as the state is reporting a new spike of infection daily.“Remdesivir is basically an experimental drug for use, the efficacy of which has not been proven yet. But still, being the only anti viral drug available in the country, people are purchasing it from private chemist shops at high price. The injection is given to moderate and severely ill patients but it is not a life saving drug. Also, there is no confirmation that it will reduce hospitalisation hours or will decrease the chances of mortality. The people, who are spending thousands of rupees on a single dose or are black marketing the stock of Remdesivir, is completely illogical”, said state nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added: “At present, we have 750 doses of Remdesivir in state’s government and private hospitals and the daily usage of the anti-viral drug is 40 to 50 doses, across the state. However, as people are searching for the injection in the market, we will ensure its easy availability for which 21,400 doses are awaited. We will distribute its stock to each district, according to positive case load and active cases. The districts’ officials will then supply it to government and private hospitals. Also, the state has enough stock of other equipment and drugs needed for Covid-19 treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-get-21-000-doses-of-remdesivir-101619120692073.html

Therefore I would humbly request you to kindly accept my premises/home situated at Rakkar in Dharamshala area to be engaged and utilised as a COVID care or isolation centre,” the former Himachal Pradesh minister said.He indicated that around 50 patients can be accommodated at his residence, which can be readied for the purpose within 10 days.He also offered to bear the expanses of the patients admitted at the facility. He said the premise also has space for administrative offices, main control room and logistic area.Meanwhile, the deputy commissioner welcomed the offer but said a Covid Care Centre or isolation centre should have oxygen supply and other medical facilities. Prajapati said it is not possible to create a Covid-care facility at a private house.He also said district authorities have put together adequate arrangements in place to meet any exigency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-secy-sudhir-sharma-offers-dharamshala-home-as-covid-care-facility-101619120571961.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||In Ludhiana, patients’ kin scramble to source out-of-stock tocilizumab injections||Ludhiana district, which had already been reeling under shortage of Covid vaccines, is in for another challenge — unavailability of tocilizumab, a drug which according to studies might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe infection. To top it all, hospitals are expressing helplessness and asking the attendants of patients to arrange the medicine. The sudden dearth of drug has led to a mad rush among the patients’ relatives as those ‘not so resourceful’ are frantically calling their friends and looking for some ‘influential contact’ to source the medicine. Social media platforms are flooded with distress messages and requests for tocilizumab. Rishi Sood, a drug trader, said, “There already is an acute shortage of beds for Covid patients. If one becomes available, then the relatives have to run from pillar to post to arrange medicines such as tocilizumab. The drug is currently not available.” It is not the first time that the city hospitals are facing a tocilizumab crunch. In August last year too, when the Covid cases had begun to peak, the drug marketed by a Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company as Actemra was sold in the black market for nearly ₹40,000. GS Chawla, general secretary of the Chemist Association of Punjab, has claimed that there is an acute shortage of remdesivir, while tocilizumab is not available across the country as its salt is sourced from abroad while the medicine is being manufactured in India. “The government has taken the distribution of the medicine under its control and it is being allocated to the hospitals as per the requirement,” he added.‘In this war-like situation, we are on the frontline without ammunition’Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, director, gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital, Ludhiana, and technical adviser, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), blamed hoarding for the current crisis.“There is no stock available in the hospitals and we keep hearing stories of how a handful of people are putting lives at stake by hoarding the medicine. It is a war-like situation and unfortunately, we are on the frontline without ammunition. The crises have been created due to unnecessary hoarding, perhaps for petty monetary gains. People should act responsibly and help each other. It is the only way we can win over the virus,” said Dr Chhina.Dr Amit Gulrez, deputy medical superintendent, CMCH, also said the stocks of tocilizumab have dried up. “There are patients who need tocilizumab, but we have been told that it is not available anywhere. The injection is used to treat Covid patients when they fail to respond to any other treatment in a critical stage and are in respiratory distress.”However, senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is a member of the Covid taskforce of the state, said new findings and treatment protocols have suggested alternative treatments if tocilizumab is unavailable.“So we have to look for an alternative. But at the same time, concerted effort should be made to spread awareness among people to stop hoarding life-saving drugs,” he added.SMO Dr Hitinder Kaur said while there is adequate stock of remdesivir, tocilizumab is not available for long. She said the medicine was earlier used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, which is now being used for critically ill Covid patients.Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state government has floated tenders and within a few days, tocilizumab will be available. District receives 40,000 vaccines to replenish stockMeanwhile, the Ludhiana health department received 40,000 vaccines on Thursday to replenish its stocks. On running out of its vaccine stock, the Ludhiana health department had suspended the vaccine supply to private hospitals in the district till further orders on April 20.Sharing details, district immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said they have received 40,000 Covishield vaccines on Thursday from Chandigarh for the smooth conduct of vaccination process.He said that the current batch of vaccines will be used only at the government-run centres. After running out of both Covidshield and Covaxin vaccines, the supply to 85 private hospitals in the district, which were also inoculating people, was stopped.Manpower crises hit civil hospitalWith 80 patients admitted to the Ludhiana civil hospital’s Covid ward, 52 of them on oxygen and 14 on ventilator support on Thursday, the facility is staring at serious manpower crises.The issue of staff scarcity came to the fore after SDM (East) Dr Baljinder Singh Dhillon expressed concern over the shortage of nurses and attendants at the civil hospital and asked for urgent recruitment of 20 paramedical staffers.SMO and Covid unit in-charge of the hospital, Dr Hitinder Kaur, said, “We have adequate staff to run the health services in mother and child hospital and emergency services, but the sudden rise in the number of Covid patients has mounted extra pressure on us.”“Currently, the staffers are working in three shifts. We have arranged staff from other government hospitals and primary health centres, but that is not enough. For ICU duties, we need to have three times the existing staff strength,” she added.Bhupinder Kaur, nursing in-charge of the civil hospital, said besides the staff shortage, there were other challenges as well. “Sometimes, the nursing staffers get infected or their family members contract virus and then they cannot perform duty for the next 17 days. Like other hospitals, we are also battling with such issues,” she said.Lately, 50 paramedical staffers had been performing duties in three shifts in Covid emergency, triage, trauma, male isolation, female isolation, and ICU of the hospital. Out of them, five employees were found suffering from Covid.On Thursday, one paramedical staffer was available for four wards, while two nursing staff members were present in the ICU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-ludhiana-patients-kin-scramble-to-source-out-of-stock-tocilizumab-injections-101619120513116.html

Patients and their relatives are already struggling to get isolation beds, crucial lifesaving medicines and even oxygen supply in many city hospitals. On Wednesday, 879 infections were logged in the district, whose daily caseload has remained above 500 since April 16. A total of seven deaths were reported in the city, taking the total fatalities to 1,272. The corona case count of Ludhiana since the beginning of the pandemic stands at 46,358. There are 5,829 active cases in the district. The deceased included four men and three women, the youngest of whom was a 36-year-old male resident of Doraha. Two men from Urban Estate, Dugri, aged 71 and 76, succumbed to the virus. There has been a surge in coronavirus cases in Dugri, which is currently under lockdown. Among the other victims were a 79-year-old woman of Kitchlu Nagar, a 72-year-old woman of Harnampura village, a 50-year-old man from SBS Nagar, and an 80-year-old woman from Shivala Road area. As many as 80 beds are currently occupied in government hospitals, while 836 isolation beds in wards of private hospitals are filled. The number of patients in active home isolation is 7,337. The increasing shortage of beds prompted the Ludhiana deputy commissioner to make an emotive appeal to hospitals to double the number of beds on their premises. DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said that there was an immediate need to increase the bed capacity to deal with the second wave and ensuring quality treatment to the patients while reducing mortality. He said that the bed capacity must be enhanced immediately as it was important to ensure every patient got best possible care. Interacting with the representatives of all prominent private hospitals of the district via videoconference, the DC urged them to listen to their conscience while making any decision as people had high hopes from all of them. In his appeal to the hospitals, Sharma said every single life was precious and the hospitals should ensure no person entering their premises dies due to lack of treatment. O2 boost to cityThe administration launched oxygen helpline numbers — 7837018500 and 0161-2421091 — which will remain operational 24x7 and function from the police control room. Anyone who is facing any difficulty in availing medical oxygen supply in Ludhiana for Covid patients can dial these numbers and oxygen cylinders will be made available to them on payment basis. Even as many private hospitals reported shortage of oxygen cylinders with the relatives of Covid patients seeking help from outside, the DC assured the residents that there was no shortage of oxygen in the district, so there was no need to panic. He said that different teams have been formed that would visit industrial units as well as hospitals to check hoarding of oxygen cylinders. He warned that any violation in this regard will not be tolerated. DC Sharma said that elective surgeries have already been deferred beyond April 30 till further orders. “We will also provide green corridors to oxygen-carrying vehicles in Ludhiana so that they promptly reach to their destination,” police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/880-fresh-covid-cases-drive-ludhiana-to-another-grim-milestone-101619120512077.html

The jatha had gone to Pakistan on a 12-day pilgrimage to celebrate Baisakhi at Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal, and pay obeisance at other historical gurdwaras. However, the figure released by district administration late evening created confusion as it put the number of infected pilgrims at 99. After release of this figure, no official attended to the calls.

Women health workers deployed at the camp said the pilgrims misbehaved and manhandled them. “They did not have patience. After all, the testing takes time. They blamed us for positive report. We demand FIR against such people. In future, we need security for such work,” they said The civil surguen confirmed the development, adding one of the pilgrims even tore the record of test results and PPE kit of a doctor. “We have taken serious note of such behaviour and asked the officials concerned to take action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/200-of-818-sikh-pilgrims-test-ve-for-covid-on-return-from-pakistan-101619120394985.html

This year, Hindmata area might also get some relief from waterlogging as the civic body is constructing a holding tank to store rain water for around 90 minutes.“We are anticipating that this year will be comparatively better when it comes to waterlogging. We have attended the main problem at Hindmata. We are constructing an underground tank in a nearby open space that will store water for around 90 minutes during heavy rainfall. Our ultimate aim is to have a capacity of storing rainwater for four hours. We will augment the capacity in the coming days,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said. In a review meeting taken by Mumbai guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday with officials, BMC has maintained that all the road repair and rain-related drain works will be completed before the monsoon. The officials informed the minister that this year, 470 pumps will be installed in the city to pump out rain water at low-lying areas. It also claimed that 43% sludge has been removed from major nullahs, while 24% has been cleared from Mithi river so far. The deadline for completing desilting works end in the last week of May.According to BMC officials, all the chronic spots identified by it last year after heavy rainfall in south Mumbai have been attended to and it is expected that there will not be flooding this year. BMC also informed that the landslide-prone area near Malabar Hill will have a 103-metre retaining wall built around it and the road work on the parallel road will also be completed before monsoon.“In the coming months, we will also identify locations for tanks based on the experience at Hindmata. There have been suggestions for the locations in the western suburbs and Byculla, none have been finalised yet,” Velrasu added.Meanwhile, BMC officials will also prepare a master plan for the 2,000-km-long road network in the city. On a pilot basis, two wards will be chosen for planning the road repair and maintenance, instead of undertaking work based on demand. “We also discussed the two important projects, which includes the beautification of the Powai lake area and the construction of a board walkway between Bandra Fort and Mahim. The permissions are being worked out for the projects and they can be completed in a year,” Verasu added.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/43-desilting-done-hindmata-may-not-get-waterlogged-mumbai-civic-body-101619120211318.html

23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination for 18+: Punjab to ensure free jabs at govt facilities||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced that vaccination in age group of 18-45 years across Punjab would start from May 1. He said it would be ensured that the vaccine is supplied free of cost in all government healthcare facilities across the state. In view of the limited supplies of the vaccine expected initially, the chief minister constituted an expert group, comprising eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, Dr Jacob John, Professor of Community Health at CMC, Vellore, and Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head, school of public health, PGIMER, Chandigarh, to suggest prioritisation in the 18-45 age group. Chairing a meeting to review the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state, Amarinder tasked the expert group to chalk out a vaccination strategy and submit a detailed plan to the state government within a week to meet the challenge in the midst of the unprecedented Covid pandemic in the state. Virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, emphasised the need to have a proper strategy to combat the current second wave of Covid, with geographical saturation in high caseload cities such as Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mohali, and Patiala, besides prioritisation on the basis of medical need (serious comorbidity) and on the basis of professional groups such as teachers. The CM was informed that the state has received 4 lakh more doses of Covishield vaccine from the Centre on Thursday. He asked the health department to vigorously pursue with the Union government for ensuring supply of more Covishield and Covaxin vaccine. Referring to the reports of black marketing of anti-viral drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the country, the CM said the experts have given clear protocols on the use of such medicines, which must be duly publicised and followed in right earnest. The central government has allowed 13,400 Remdesivir injections for 10-day period, from April 21 to 30. Remdesivir is an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe versions of Covid-19. Health adviser Dr KK Talwar said World Health Organisation (WHO) studies have shown that Remdesivir may not have any impact on the mortality due to Covid. Further, there were alternatives for Tocilizumab and such information is being regularly shared in the expert group of doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-for-18-punjab-to-ensure-free-jabs-at-govt-facilities-101619120032611.html
23-04-2021||Other||1993 Mumbai blast accused’s murder: Chhota Rajan acquitted||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Thursday acquitted underworld don Chhota Rajan and his aide Jagannath Jaiswal in the Hanif Kadawala murder case. Rajan and Jaiswal were acquitted for want of cogent evidence. Kadawala, an accused in the March 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case, was shot dead by three men on February 7, 2001, in his office. As per the prosecution case, Kadawala was booked for helping actor Sanjay Dutt hide the AK-47 and the consignment of weapons that were used in the blasts, at the actor’s garage. The weapons were delivered to him by gangster Abu Salem, who was a part of the Dawood Ibrahim gang. Kadawala was arrested by the police under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) in April 1993 for transporting weapons from the Gujarat coast to Mumbai under gangster Tiger Memon directions. CBI had alleged that Rajan had ordered Kadawala’s killing, as part of a “nationalist” drive to kill those accused in the bombings. Prior to the assault on Kadawala, Rajan’s men had allegedly carried out attacks on some others accused in the bomb blasts case. CBI had claimed that after the series of blasts, Rajan parted ways with Dawood Ibrahim, a key conspirator behind the bombings. Rajan initiated killings of people involved in the blasts to gain the public sympathy,” the agency claimed. However, during the trial, Kadawala’s son had claimed that his father was killed over property dispute and the contract was given by his uncle. Rajan’s lawyer, advocate Tushar Khandare, said, “There was no evidence against Rajan. In fact, it has come on record that the contract of killing Kadawala was given by the Guru Satam and Ravi Pujari gangs. Rajan’s name was mentioned in this case only to misguide the investigating agency.” Jaiswal’s lawyer DS Manerkar said Kadawala’s employee had only seen his client going inside Kadawala’s office. “But there were lots of discrepancies in the statement of the witness as first he said only Jaiswal entered the office and later claimed there were three men. Also, he had not seen who fired at Kadawala,” said Manerkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1993-mumbai-blast-accused-s-murder-chhota-rajan-acquitted-101619120031425.html

Along with the video, Nakhua wrote, “This is beyond shocking. A LIVING man taken to cremation centre by BMC. I think there might be some #MahaVasuliTarget from cremation centres by #MahaVasuliAghadi (sic).”The video was viewed by over 115,000 people. After much criticism on social media, BMC health officials swung into action. “We asked Nakhua about the origin and location of the video. He did not furnish any details about the video,” stated BMC’s assistant health officer Dr Pranita Tipre stated in the FIR.A senior civic official said, “ BMC checked with officers at all cemeteries in the city and confirmed the incident was not from Mumbai. “Nakhua’s statement has been recorded,” said Vijay Patil, deputy commissioner of police (zone 4). “Nakhua is specially-abled and was allowed to go home after his statement was recorded. He couldn’t clarify the exact origin of the video. We would soon complete the probe and a file charge sheet in the case,” said senior inspector Vinod Kamble, Bhoiwada police. After the FIR was filed, Nakhua on Thursday tweeted an apology. “I was not aware of the location of the incident and could not verify it. This video was tweeted as it disturbed me immensely & to alert the authorities. There was no intention whatsoever to cause panic. I regret the inconvenience caused to authorities and general public, if any, due to my act and my sincere apologies for the same,” his tweets read.“The matter is subjudice. I will release a statement in due course of the time,” Nakhua told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-leader-booked-for-tweeting-fake-video-101619119911355.html
23-04-2021||Other||Essence of PM’s speech was that crisis is huge, but you find a way: Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana on Thursday criticised Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday evening and stated that the essence of the speech was that the states should see how to tackle the crisis. Sharply criticising Modi’s speech, the editorial published on Thursday said, “PM Modi says that the Covid-19 crisis is huge and is like a storm. But he did not give solutions to protect [the country] from this storm. People have lost their relatives. PM expressed his grief on it, but what is he doing to ensure that the toll does not increase further? The Covid-19 situation is critical across the nation and not just in Maharashtra. People expected to gain strength from PM’s address. But the essence of the speech was “the crisis is huge. You figure out your way, and take care”.” The Sena has been critical of the Centre over its response to the assistance sought by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to tackle the Covid-19 situation in the state. The Sena leaders have slammed the Centre for providing inadequate supply of vaccination doses, controlling distribution of Remdesivir and the supply of medical use oxygen. The editorial said that despite strict restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government, the Covid-19 cases are not coming under control. In an apparent response to Modi’s statement that lockdown should be the last resort, the editorial added that a complete lockdown has become “essential”. It further said that Modi cancelled his visit to Portugal in the view of Covid-19, but had he not conducted crowded election rallies in West Bengal in time, the virus could have been prevented. The editorial said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mobilised lakhs of people across the country to campaign in West Bengal, who returned to their respective states with the infection. “Haridwar’s Kumbh Mela and West Bengal’s political mela have only given coronavirus to the country. Rulers have to impose restrictions on themselves first. This gives them the moral right to give advice to the public,” it said. Highlighting the severe shortage of medical use oxygen, the editorial said the country expected that the PM would speak on the issue and provide solutions. “PM and his colleagues should try to provide oxygen where there is a shortage. Today that is the most necessary thing. Instead of that, everybody is making speeches and releasing carbon dioxide and spreading poison. This is the time to act and not make speeches.” Reacting to the criticism, Maharashtra BJP’s chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the Sena-led state government failed to tackle the crisis, but is blaming the Centre. “What Sanjay Raut has said [about PM’s address] — the crisis is huge and you have to figure a way out — is actually Maharashtra chief minister’s (CM) policy from the past one year. While the pandemic is raging in Maharashtra, the Centre has provided assistance. But what steps did the CM take, how many times did he step out, what planning was done for hospital beds, oxygen and Remdesivir last year. Had the focus not been on transfers of [police] officers but on managing the pandemic, the situation wouldn’t have worsened so much,” Upadhye said in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/essence-of-pm-s-speech-was-that-crisis-is-huge-but-you-find-a-way-shiv-sena-101619119851340.html
23-04-2021||Other||‘Marathi manoos’ agenda: Shiv Sena’s answer to BJP||The Shiv Sena, which is at the receiving end of an all-out attack by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is using its time-tested formula to get back at its bete noire.With around 10 months to go for the prestigious Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election, the Sena has reignited the ‘Marathi manoos’ plank to corner the Opposition party. The Sena has raked the issue around 480-km south of the Maximum City in Belgaum, Karnataka, while campaigning for the Lok Sabha bypoll. Political analysts opined that the agenda would have an influence in the city’s civic polls.Apart of the Belgaum issue, the Sena has subtly painted the ongoing tussle between the Centre and the state government led by the party, over oxygen supply and shortage of Remdesivir.Former Union minister and Sena parliamentarian Arvind Sawant said that while the Centre says that Maharashtra is the most-affected state due to Covid-19, they do not provide adequate and timely assistance even though all powers rest with them.“They claim [Covid-19] numbers are fewer in other states, but they are providing more [vaccinations, drugs, oxygen] to such states, but not to Maharashtra. Be it any issue related to Maharashtra, the Centre has always denied its legitimate right. For example, other border disputes of states, which cropped up later, were resolved but not the Belgaum border issue,” Sawant said.Party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut claimed that if Maharashtra is deprived of assistance, it will hurt the economy of the country. “PM and Union home minister Amit Shah should give equal attention to Maharashtra as they give to other states, because this is also a part of the country. The manner in which Maharashtra is being treated raises question whether this is an attempt to disrupt the state’s economy. If it is being done during coronavirus [pandemic], then it is vicious and unfortunate,” he told reporters earlier on Tuesday.Earlier this month, the Union ministers and those from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) were engaged in a war of words over the issue of vaccination. MVA ministers said that they had run out of vaccines, leading to the closure of several centres. The Union ministers hit back stating that adequate doses had been provided to the state. Subsequently, the state and Centre clashed over Remdesivir and oxygen supply.For the Shiv Sena, which was established in 1966 to take up the issues of the Marathi-speaking population in Mumbai and Maharashtra, the agenda remains at its core, even though the party had adopted the larger issue of Hindutva to reach out to a wider audience. The Hindutva thread of the party, however, has been questioned after it junked the alliance with BJP and joined hands with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – parties that are termed secular – in November 2019.Besides wooing the Gujarati, Jain and Marwari communities, Sena seems to be consolidating its traditional voter base of middle-class Marathi population, which could split to Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in BMC polls, thereby likely benefitting BJP.Earlier this month, Shiv Sena extended support to Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) candidate Shubham Shelke in the bypoll on the Belgaum seat. During the two-day campaign visit to the city, Raut took on Maharashtra’s BJP leaders for campaigning against Shelke, a candidate from an outfit that has been fighting for the regions’ unification with Maharashtra for five decades. As Union minister and senior BJP leader from Maharashtra Nitin Gadkari and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis campaigned in Belgaum last week, Sena said they have “cheated” the Marathi people of the state.Referring to Fadnavis, Raut said, “At least Marathi politicians from Maharashtra should not campaign against a Marathi candidate in Belgaum. “Fadnavis has been a former Maharashtra CM. During his tenure, MES leaders had met him and he had assured them that the Maharashtra government and BJP were firmly with MES on the merger of the Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka into Maharashtra. But he is taking a different stand now.”Echoing Raut’s views, Sawant said, “Look at BJP’s stand now. When he [Fadnavis] was CM, he had passed resolutions, but now campaigned against the people he vowed to support. Now everybody knows that they [BJP] are not for the Marathi people and the people of Belgaum.”He added that Uddhav Thackeray has spoken firmly on the integration of Belgaum. “This is not a political stand of the party but a thread we share with Marathi people. In 1969, we agitated [for integration of Marathi-speaking areas with Maharashtra] and lost around 69 people. [Late Shiv Sena supremo] Balasaheb [Thackeray] was behind bars for three months for the same issue. The issues of Marathi people will remain at the core of Shiv Sena,” he said.In his weekly column published on Sunday, Raut wrote that the entire Marathi community has united under the saffron flag after a long time, during the bypoll for 26-year-old Shelke. He added that the community has been fighting for their “rights and to preserve their culture” for decades but “neither the Centre nor the courts are giving them justice.”“The apathy of Maharashtra’s politicians is weakening the fight… Former CM Fadnavis, under whose leadership the resolution on the unification of Belgaum-Karwar region with Maharashtra was passed, went to Belgaum to campaign against Ekikaran Samiti’s Marathi candidate. This is the misfortune of entire Maharashtra. He could have avoided going to Belgaum,” Raut wrote in his column.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said Shiv Sena has remained consistent in its stand on the Belgaum issue. However, the timing is crucial. “Sena over the years has been vocal about the border issue. So, there are no surprises there. However, the political language at this juncture will have an influence in the future. They have showed that they have not forgotten its core ideology. The political messaging will be carried forward, with BMC elections around nine to 10 months away,” said Jondhale, a former professor of political science at the Mumbai University.Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that Sena has forgotten the cause of Marathi manoos for the sake of power.“ The Sena and its allies are blaming the Centre for its failure to handle the Covid-19 pandemic in Maharashtra. Last year, the Covid situation was new for everybody. Yet, the central government provide all assistance to the states. [But] In the past nine months, what planning did the MVA government do for beds, oxygen, Remdesivir? Nothing. Their focus was on reinstating [former cop] Sachin Vaze and raise ₹100 crore. Besides, the Sena had long-forgotten the cause of Marathi people for the sake of power. They are merely raking up the issue from Belgaum, but in reality what have they done?” asked Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-reignites-its-marathi-manoos-agenda-101619119671271.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra expects hiccups in its 18+ vaccination drive||With eight days to go for universal Covid-19 vaccination to start in the state, Maharashtra could witness hiccups in the inoculation drive from May 1 due to inadequate supply of vaccine shots. Three days after the Centre announced the decision to start vaccination for all adults in the country from May 1, the state government said it will start negotiations with foreign vaccine manufacturers as the two Indian companies have either not released prices or have their production booked by the Centre for a month. Meanwhile, the state government is also deliberating on the proposal to make the vaccine doses available for free for the poor in the 18 to 44 age group. The Centre on Monday announced vaccination for all adults in the country from May 1, but the states and Union territories have to procure the doses from manufacturers. The manufacturers would supply 50% of the ordered doses to the Government of India and 50% to the state governments and the open market. Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said a plan is being chalked out to procure vaccines. “A plan is being worked out… since foreign import is now allowed and there is Bharat Biotech, we will get in touch with them. The vaccination drive for [age] 18 to 44 will start on May 1, but the stock is expected to be limited. In that age group, there are roughly 55 or 57.5 million people. So, we will require about 120 million doses, including the wastage, over a span of four to five months, depending on how soon we get the stock,” said Kunte.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held an online meeting with Serum Institute of India’s Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday, where he was told that the company’s production has been booked till May 24. In light of that, the state will start negotiations with manufacturers of imported vaccines as it will not be able to purchase stock from Serum Institute of India, which makes Covidshield, till third week of May, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, as it has not released its prices.“Adar Poonawalla [during a meeting] told the chief minister that their entire production has been booked by the Centre till May 24. It is April 22 today, so, it is clear that for an entire month we will not be able to purchase [vaccine] for the 18-45 age group. Senior officials are in touch with Bharat Biotech, but so far, they have not released the price for state governments. If that happens in a day or two, we will be able to place order with them,” Tope said.However, the Centre refuted the claim and said that Serum Institute has not contracted all its production of vaccines to the Centre till May 25. A statement from the PIB said, “State governments are free to procure Covid-19 vaccine doses from the vaccine manufacturers as per the Liberalised Pricing and accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy.” It further added, “A key feature of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy is that the “Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to Govt. of India and would be free to supply remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the other than Govt. of India channel”. The state governments are free to purchase doses from the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, it is very clear that every month out of the total CDL cleared doses available with any vaccine manufacturer, 50% doses would be available for other than Government of India channels.”Earlier in the week, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had said that the state would use certain development funds, but not hamper the procuring of imported vaccines, if need be. Tope added that the state would negotiate with the companies including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Sputnik V to buy the “extremely expensive” imported vaccines. “Sputnik V, Moderna, American and the Chinese vaccines are extremely expensive compared to our vaccines. These vaccines are about seven to 10 times costlier than then Indian ones. But we can carry out a negotiation at the highest level with them. Chief minister and deputy chief minister have already made it clear that our government will consider [purchasing] it, if they reduce the prices since we are going to purchase in a huge volume,” he added. Kunte added that the state will also hold talks with Bharat Biotech soon. “There will be a wide range of choice,” he said.The health minister also said that the state government would consider providing free vaccines to “poor and extremely poor” section of the society in the age group of 18 to 44 years. He said such a proposal will be mooted by the health department and the State Cabinet will take a call on it soon. He however ruled out free vaccines for others who can afford the jab.“We will be taking up the matter of providing vaccines for free in the upcoming cabinet meeting. The government will definitely think of the poor and extremely poor sections of society. But who can afford the vaccines in the 18 to 44 age bracket must pay for the vaccine shot. The health department will put up a proposal to give vaccines for free to the poor, but the final decision will be taken by the Cabinet,” he said. Currently, the vaccination is free for all in those who are 45 and above. For those who want to pay for the vaccine, have an option to get vaccinated from selected private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-expects-hiccups-in-its-18-vaccination-drive-101619119312447.html

Senior police officials confirmed that they had orders to shut down stores in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. “There was no clarity on the guidelines issued on Tuesday, prompting an addendum being issued on Wednesday. But that also was not interpreted properly leading to the confusion on Thursday,” a senior police officer said. Praveen Sood, director general of police in Karnataka said that there would be better clarity available by Thursday evening.Police patrol jeeps and motorcycles were seen making announcements that all businesses that were not in the specific list of essential services will have to close down. “We got orders this afternoon and are just following them,” a police officer said. Several shopkeepers were caught off-guard with the announcement that comes two days after the government had clarified that business establishments will be allowed to remain open during the day. Several small business owners said that they were just starting to see some recovery from the impact of the last lockdown and another would just crush their businesses and livelihood.“Police arrived in the afternoon and asked us to shut the shops down,” said Peter Antony, a shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s SP Road. “We were told that lockdown will come to effect from Friday evening onwards, but the police came on Thursday evening. When we asked, they didn’t give us a proper answer,” he said. The action comes a day after the state government made some modifications to its earlier orders on restrictions. “All shops and establishments dealing with construction materials are permitted. All shops/commercial/private establishments except those mentioned above shall remain closed,” according to the order issued by P Ravi Kumar, Karnataka’s chief secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/confusion-grips-k-taka-over-partial-lockdown-101619119131188.html

He said he has given instructions to top health officials to talk to vaccine companies to buy enough doses. “We hope the Centre will continue to supply it free. But we can’t wait for it. So we have already started negotiations with vaccine manufacturers,” he told reporters in the state capital. Vijayan appealed to people to contribute generously to the CM relief fund. He said people who have vaccinated and others have contributed ₹22 lakh in a single day. “We need such help at the critical juncture. We will buy enough doses and vaccinate as many as we can. We can’t wait further,” said the CM. He said rapid response teams will be constituted to help health and civic officials, urging people not to crowd vaccination centres. As vaccine supplies dwindled, many areas in the state witnessed rush at vaccinations centres on Thursday too. “We have already made it clear that doses will be given to only those who registered online. There is no spot registration from now on. Hope people will realise this,” he said. Minor scuffle was reported in Kottayam and Alapzuha on Wednesday. The CM said there are 10.65 million people in the 18-45 age group and the state will have to stock enough doses. The CM had already announced that the government will distribute vaccines free of cost. “It is true the second wave is really hard. We need a joint fight to come out of trying times. The government has called an all-party meet on Monday. We will hear all parties and sections,” he said, adding special control rooms will be set up for guest workers. He said some vested interests were trying to create panic and mislead them. This is the first time the state crossed 25,000 single-day tally. In the last 24 hours, 1,37,177 samples were tested. The state also reported 28 deaths, taking the toll to 5028. Active caseload also crossed 150,000 (1,56,266) for the first time. Ernakulam remained worst- affected with 4396 cases followed by Kozhikode with 3372 cases, according to the data released by the health ministry Going by the pace of cases, experts said the state may report at least double the cases by next week. The health department said it has enough stock of oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators. It has activated some of the defunct first line treatment centres and stadia to meet the emergency situation. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-cm-calls-all-party-meet-after-record-26-995-cases-101619118771152.html

The policy received cabinet nod on Thursday.There are a large number of shops and houses, which at present are owned by the municipal bodies but are in the possession of some entities and individuals for over two decades.“The municipal bodies find managing such properties difficult as the ownership of such properties have in several cases changed hands on numerous occasions and the municipal bodies lack authentic documentation,” an official spokesperson said.The municipal bodies are unable to even recover rentals of such properties. The spokesperson said that it was decided to transfer the ownership of these properties to such persons who are currently in justified possession of these properties.“This policy will not only strengthen the financial position of the municipal bodies but also grant small shopkeepers and other pattedars ownership of the said properties under their possession,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-provide-jobs-to-abandoned-surrendered-children-under-harihar-scheme-101619118291892.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Existing liquor licensees in Haryana can renew their licence||Existing licensees of country liquor (CL) and Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) vends in Haryana have been given an option to get their licence renewed for 2021-22 under the new excise policy approved by the cabinet on Thursday.An official spokesperson said the licence of zones of CL and IMFL vends can be renewed at an increase rate of 10% over and above the base licence fee or proportionate licence fee as the case may be for 2020-21. For the remaining zones, bids will be invited.If sufficient number of applications for renewal of zones of CL and IMFL vends from the existing licensees of 2020-21 are not received, the competent authority will invite e-bids for all zones of vends, the spokesperson said.The excise policy for 2021-22 will come in effect from May 20 as the period of allotment of retail vends for 2020-21 will come to an end on May 19.The spokesperson said growth in excise revenue for 2020-21 is estimated to be at 15%. For the new policy, the state government has decided to abolish the Covid cess on sale of liquor. It was imposed in 2020-21 for generating additional revenue in view of the pandemic.The overall collection from excise in financial year 2020-21 are ₹6,792 crore against the collection of ₹6,361 crore in financial year 2019-20.Despite complete lockdown till first week of May 2020 and overall economic slowdown for a major part of the financial year, excise revenue during 2020-21 has witnessed a 6.69% growth, the spokesperson said.The quota of IMFS has been increased from 550 lakh proof litre to 625 lakh proof litre for 2021-22. The enhanced quota of IMFS will be added proportionately in the basic quota of all zones of liquor vends.The quota of country liquor has not been changed. Due to the pandemic, the sale hours of retail outlets of liquor have been re-fixed in rural areas from 8am to 11pm from April to October and from 8am to 10pm from November to March.In case of urban areas, the sale hours will be from 8am to 12 midnight throughout the year.To encourage blending of ethanol in petrol and proper utilisation of agriculture produce, a new licence (E-3/E-3A) has been introduced for setting up an ethanol-based distillation plant at a nominal fee.In case any vend or vends of any zone are closed or are subsequently closed on account of falling under Covid containment zone, its licence fee and quota will be proportionately waived-off in proportion of days of closure.For computation of proportionate licence fee and quota of a closed vend to be waived-off, the licence fee and quota of a zone will be equally divided among both vends of the zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/existing-liquor-licensees-in-haryana-can-renew-their-licence-101619118111761.html

I have uploaded all these documents on the portal along with my Aadhar card, but the requests keep getting rejected,” said Abbey.“We are providing supplies to the government. These are urgent requirements. The portal says that the documents are incomplete. It doesn’t even clearly specify what more is needed so that we can arrange additional documents accordingly,” said Abbey.Ranjeet Raghav, operations head at a food manufacturing company, said his requests for passes were rejected seven times. “I applied on the Delhi government and Delhi Police portal but to no avail. As a last resort, I reached out to the Delhi Traffic Police handle on Twitter which directed me to the Delhi government. I even called on the Covid helpline but got no help. I work in a grain manufacturing company, and our products cannot be stored for long,” said Raghav.In addition to those working in the chemical and food processing industries, restaurants are also facing problems. Manpreet Singh, treasurer of National Restaurants Association of India, who also owns Zen restaurant in Connaught Place, said he failed to secure passes for himself and other staff members. “I applied for the pass at least five times in my name and two to three times in the name of my staff but all requests were rejected within six to eight hours without any reason. We have tried various combinations like providing Aadhar, FSSAI license, visiting card, pan card, and other documents, to secure passes but nothing works,” said Singh.Singh has asked the staff to stay within the restaurant premises while the deliveries are being managed through food-delivery apps such as Zomato and Swiggy. Singh said the upside was that his staff was not getting exposed by being in one location.Abhi Kumar, a cashier at Sagar Ratna restaurant, GK-2, said the restaurant has been facing problems in securing passes for its staff. “We have been trying to secure passes for the past five days but to no avail. Either no valid reason is cited for rejection of the request or we are told that the documents are incomplete,” said Kumar.Saurabh Suman, manager of Pebble Street in New Friends Colony (NFC), said the restaurant applied for passes for 10 people, of which the request for six staff members got sanctioned. “The portal doesn’t give a reason behind the rejection of a request, so we can’t proceed. We are now managing with the staff who have been able to secure the passes,” said Suman.When approached about the issue of difficulties being faced by essential service providers to get passes, a Delhi government spokesperson declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-getting-e-passes-say-some-essential-service-providers-101619117871227.html

The decision was taken following a meeting with Haryana government officials, the farmers’ union said.In a statement released Thursday, Samyukta Kisan Morcha -- the umbrella group with 40 farmer unions running the agitation -- said it did not want to cause inconvenience to people.“Leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha had a detailed meeting with officials of the Haryana government this evening. In the meeting, it was decided that barricades on one side of the highway at Singhu border will be removed, to give free passage to oxygen tankers, ambulance and other such emergency services,” farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The comments came in the backdrop of several allegations on social media this week that the road blockades on account of farmer agitation were leading to a delay in the movement of oxygen tankers across the state borders. BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh tweeted on Tuesday night that due to the road blockade by protesters at the Ghazipur border, oxygen suppliers were facing difficulties in bringing the tankers to Delhi.“... It is the government that is to be squarely blamed for barricading the roads and obstructing free passage, whereas, at all protest sites, farmers have already left such passage for vehicular movement,” SKM said in a statement.The protesting farmers, however, on Thursday showed no signs of calling off the agitation. “A large convoy of protesters in tractor-trolleys will be leaving from Barwasni in Sonepat district of Haryana for the Singhu Border,” SKM said, adding that this was to ensure that government did not try to remove the farmers on the “pretext” of the Covid-19 surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/barricades-on-one-side-of-highway-at-singhu-border-will-be-removed-to-create-passage-for-services-say-farmers-101619117691663.html

The counsel also assured the court that its earlier order of May 2020, mandating reports to be issued within a maximum 48 hours will be implemented.The court was hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who sought ramping up of tests in the city. The petition, which was disposed of, was revived by the court on Monday, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and that “health care infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.On Thursday, the court also noted that the number of RT-PCR tests in the city is going down despite the fact that the cases are on a rise.To be sure, the proportion of RT-PCR tests among the overall samples collected over the past two weeks has been 66%, below the 70% number as recommended by the Centre. Overall testing, generally, too has dropped as labs struggle to clear backlogs and deliver test results to patients in time, amid a huge spike in demandOn Thursday, Delhi collected 48,346 samples using the RT-PCR method.In comparison, a week ago, Delhi collected 59,401 samples using the gold standard, and 70,403 samples using the technique two weeks ago.During the proceedings, both the Centre and the Delhi government sparred over the allocation of beds in the hospitals being run by the Union government. The petitioner informed the court that the Centre promised to allocate more beds in its the hospitals on April 20 but they were yet to be allocated.Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra said when the cases were comparatively fewer in November, the Centre allocated them 4,132 beds. He said, currently they have been given around 2,900 beds despite the infection spreading much faster than the last wave. He said that nearly 7,000 beds should be allotted to the Delhi government for the emergency period.Arti Ahuja, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, told the court that they have increased the number of beds. She said that the union government was exploring avenues for augmenting the number of beds with other facilities for mild and patients not requiring oxygen. She also said that the beds being sought by the Delhi government were already occupied.The court observed that the situation has become “precarious” in the city and people are not getting beds. Justice Sanghi said, “People are not getting beds. Please do increase the beds. People are dying on the streets. The cases are four fold, people need hospitalization and the immediate needs have to be met. Forget about the common man on the road, today if I go and stand and ask for a bed, I would not get it.”The bench asked the Delhi government to explore the possibilities of augmenting hotels with the hospitals and DMs and SDMs are in talks on this with the stakeholder.The high court also asked the Delhi government to explore the possibility of getting public sector undertakings (PSUs) to set up makeshift beds as was being done by some other states to enhance the availability of beds for citizens of the national capital.“We hope and expect that the Centre will look into the requirements of COVID beds and work to enhance availability,” the court said and asked the governments to file status reports on this.The matter would be now heard on April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-pressure-labs-to-give-covid-test-reports-within-24-or-36-hours-hc-tells-delhi-government-101619117636123.html

Police have been deployed at the main entrance of the refinery to monitor movement and double check gate passes of the trucks. The security officials said 13 trucks, of different capacities, have left from the refinery to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab since Thursday morning. Following a surge in demand, IOC has also increased its production and now it is supplying 140 MT oxygen to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana, and 20 MT to Punjab. Inspector Manjeet Singh, who is monitoring the truck movement, says, “We are examining the documents of every truck leaving with liquid oxygen and the oxygen is being supplied as per government orders.” However, some truck drivers from Delhi alleged discrimination in allocation of oxygen. Hira Lal, of Vaibhav Oxygen that supplies oxygen to many hospitals in Delhi, said that he had come on Wednesday but is yet to get the oxygen. Another driver, Karan Singh, says his truck was called inside after a wait of 28 hours. Mahender Singh, who is taking oxygen to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said that this is his second turn in the past 24 hours and he has been allowed to take 5.5 tonne oxygen on Thursday. Earlier, the joint director of Apollo Hospital, Dr Sangita Reddy, in a tweet had sought urgent help from PM Modi, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal, saying that an oxygen tanker is waiting outside the gate of Air Liquide Panipat at IOC and the driver of the truck is not being allowed to get in. “Haryana police are stopping the truck and not letting oxygen out of Haryana. Need urgent intervention!” Dr Reddy had tweeted. But a few minutes later, she tweeted, “Update: The driver has been allowed inside and hopefully oxygen will be sent out soon.” “Further to my earlier tweet an appeal once again to the govt to please tag oxygen tank as ambulances and enable quick green corridor movement,” she tweeted. However, officials of Air Liquide Panipat said that they are supplying oxygen as per government schedule and do not have any role in deciding where the oxygen supplies should go first. Earlier, officials the IOC, had said that they will be supplying 150 MT liquid oxygen (10 MT everyday) to Delhi, Haryana and Punjab free of cost. But now, officials, requesting anonymity, said that if required, production and supply will be increased. ‘NO CLUE ABOUT MISSING OXYGEN TRUCK’ A tanker carrying liquid oxygen was allegedly stolen by unidentified persons. As per FIR registered on complaint of district drug controller Vijay Raje against unknown accused, a truck had left Air Liquide, Panipat, to supply oxygen at Sirsa on Wednesday, but it did not reach till evening. It was allegedly stolen by an unidentified accused on the way, police said. Matlauda police station in-charge Manjeet Singh said, “A case has been registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unknown persons and investigation is on.” He said that security at Air Liquide has been increased and documents of all trucks are being examined before they leave. This is the second such incident reported in state in the past two days. On Wednesday, Anil Vij had accused the Delhi government of looting oxygen truck on its way to supply oxygen in Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/surge-in-oxygen-demand-trucks-from-delhi-make-beeline-for-panipat-refinery-101619117635608.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panipat unit supplies 171 MT oxygen to Delhi in 7hrs||The politics over supply of medical oxygen continued on Thursday with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accusing the Haryana government of hindering oxygen supply to Delhi.Belying Delhi claims, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that over 170 MT medical oxygen, of the 140 MT allocated to Delhi has been supplied from Panipat’s Air Liquide plant.Officials said there was a distribution shortfall in terms of previous allocations which has been made up by the Panipat unit.As per official statistics, 171.85 MT medical oxygen was supplied to Delhi between 10pm on April 21 and 6am on April 22 to 13 customers in Delhi.The Delhi destinations included Indian Oil Corporation (8.23 MT), Seth Air Products (15.02 MT), Inox (15.1 MT), Goyal Delhi (9.10 MT), Kapil Enterprises (11.7 MT), Jalan Gases (10.43 MT), Paramount (16.29 MT), Devansh (11.61 MT), Shree Aggarsain Hospital (15 MT), Aggarwal Gases (10.54 MT), Multan Air (8.83 MT).Khattar said a roster has been prepared for filling of oxygen cylinders and loading in trucks. “One truck will be loaded for Haryana and one truck each for Delhi and Punjab. The entire process at Panipat plant is being closely monitored by me,” he said.Khattar said some difficulty was reported in supply of oxygen to Haryana, Delhi and other states from Panipat but now the problem has been resolved. “I held detailed discussion with PM Modi on this issue,” Khattar said.The Haryana CM said that he spoke to his Delhi counterpart, Arvind Kejriwal, who expressed satisfaction over supply of oxygen.Khattar said the Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT oxygen per day, of which, 140 MT is supplied to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana and 20 MT to Punjab.Haryana health minister Anil Vij said Sisodia’s grouse that district officials have been deputed at these installations to hamper movement of medical oxygen shows his lack of understanding.“Even as per the orders issued by Union ministry of home affairs on Thursday, the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police of a district will be personally liable for ensuring unhindered inter-state movement of medical oxygen,” Vij said.The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) had set up a Naphtha Cracker Complex in Panipat comprising of multiple units to produce different grades of polymers and plastics at Panipat.The cryogenic oxygen and nitrogen plant which feed oxygen and nitrogen gases to the Naphtha Cracker Complex has been set up by Air Liquide Industries, Belgium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panipat-unit-supplies-171-mt-oxygen-to-delhi-in-7hrs-101619117574303.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Hospitals in Delhi scrape bottom of barrel as oxygen supplies run out||More hospitals continued to sound the alarm about their dwindling oxygen supply, with some having run out and switching to temporary cylinders while others moving patients to other facilities in other towns before their stocks ran out.At least 15 hospitals across the city had less than five hours of oxygen on Thursday, according to figures compiled by the Delhi government, which kept going back-and-forth with the Centre and neighbouring states to ensure supply.On Thursday morning, HT received an SOS from Saroj hospital in Rohini, which was to run out of its liquid medical oxygen by 10:30 am – which is did. For the next four and a half hours, the hospital plugged oxygen cylinders to their supply lines so that the 140 Covid-19 patients at the facility could be given the required respiratory support.“We have been managing patients with reserve oxygen cylinders, refilling them and using them again. We need liquid medical oxygen,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj Hospital. The hospital had to stop new admissions and discharge some stable patients. Oxygen replenishments reached the facility at around 3pm.After Max group, Saroj became the second to move court to ensure timely oxygen supply, following which the Delhi high court issued new orders to ensure supplies are made smoothly.The situation was similar at Karkardooma’s Shanti Mukund hospital, which put up a message stating, “we regret we are stopping admission in the hospital because oxygen supply is not coming.”With increased oxygen demand, the hospital had been simultaneously using liquid medical oxygen, oxygen cylinders, and a concentrator plant. This left the hospital with hardly any backup.The doctors in the hospital urged patients to leave and look for other hospitals that might take them in. However, with less than 20 ICU beds available and hardly any oxygen beds, they had nowhere to go.“We discharged seven patients; the others said we will die on the road anyway, it is better to wait here. This is a horrifying situation, I have never seen anything like this in 45 years of my career,” said Dr Sunil Sagar, CEO, Shanti Mukand Hospital.The hospital last received half its required supply of liquid medical oxygen at 02:30 am after a delay of three hours. “My staff was standing outside waiting for the oxygen tanker. Every time there was some movement on the road, they thought it was the tanker,” he said. The hospital turned down oxygen to its patients to conserve whatever it could till the oxygen arrived. The hospital received supply just in time after having dipped into reserves.Metro hospital in Preet Vihar, which had over 100 Covid-19 patients admitted, had to start moving them to its other centres in Shadipur, Noida and Faridabad after it completely ran out of oxygen. The hospital last received half its supply of medical oxygen on Wednesday night. It has been managing by refilling oxygen cylinders since Thursday afternoon.The crisis has been precipitated by obstruction of supply tankers from Haryana coming to Delhi on Wednesday, which resulted in a critical situation on Thursday, according to a doctor in know of the matter.“The oxygen reserves at most hospitals are running low because of the increased demand – hospitals are accommodating more patients than usual and almost all the patients need a lot of oxygen. Most hospitals had around 8 to 10 hours of back-up and would receive supply in time. The situation got worse on Wednesday because of several tankers being stopped by the Haryana government. It was a domino effect that delayed supply to all hospital. This resulted in hospitals having almost no reserves on Thursday,” the doctor said.He added, “It has become like a game of musical chair – the oxygen tankers are being diverted to whichever hospital is running out of oxygen. This means, the hospital that was to receive the oxygen also goes into a crisis,” the doctor said.The Delhi government estimated that the city would need around 700 MT of oxygen a day due to the increase in the number of patients with Covid-19. On Wednesday, the Centre increased Delhi’s quota of medical oxygen to 480 MT from 378 MT.Yet, tankers of oxygen that were meant for Delhi hospitals were stopped by administrations from neighbouring states, officials said. “Despite the quota being increased by the Centre, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments are stopping oxygen supply to Delhi. Yesterday, Delhi received 177 MT of oxygen against its quota of 378 MT. I urge the Centre to ensure oxygen reaches us even if paramilitary force needs to be deputed,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a tweet on Thursday evening.The Ministry of Home Affairs had to intervene and order all states to ensure allotted quota of oxygen be allowed to be supplied to states other than where the medical oxygen plants are located.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too said that he spoke to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Centre to facilitate the passage of oxygen. Of the extended quota of oxygen, majority is from Orissa that might take days to arrive, Kejriwal said, adding that he had a word with the state’s chief minister Naveen Patnaik to facilitate “lifting of Delhi’s quota of oxygen” from the state.Holy family hospital too received its supply of liquid medical oxygen minutes before its stock would have run out. “We already had all of our staff scrambling to gather oxygen cylinders and attaching it to the manifold in case the oxygen runs out. We have attached 35 cylinders and are waiting with bated breaths,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of the hospital. The hospital received its supply.Aakash hospital had just 1.5 hours of medical supply when it desperately reached out to authorities on Twitter. “We have 233 Covid-19 patients admitted with, of which 75 are dependent on oxygen. My whole team is running around but we have no assurance so far,” said Dr Kausar Shah, COO, Aakash group. The hospital managed to get 50 oxygen cylinders from neighbouring hospitals and half a tanker of oxygen just in the nick of time.Action Balaji hospital also raised an alarm when they had about three to four hours of supply. Again they received a tanker of oxygen only after dipping into their reserves, which is like going beyond the red line on a fuel tank.Even Delhi government hospitals weren’t spared of problems, with Rajiv Gandhi superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur receiving its supply of medical oxygen just 30 minutes before it was to run out. The hospital has nearly 500 Covid-19 patients.At night, Sir Ganga Ram hospital again raised an alarm that it had oxygen left for five hours of normal use, meaning lesser time if high flow oxygen is given to Covid-19 patients. The hospital currently has over 500 Covid-19 patients admitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-in-delhi-scrape-bottom-of-barrel-as-oxygen-supplies-run-out-101619117452301.html

A high proportion of patients are on supplemental oxygen and under ICU care and this has led to a quantum increase in medical oxygen requirement in various Covid related health establishments…. Consequently, in many cases, the existing contractual arrangements have either been disturbed or the health facility’s oxygen requirement has exceeded the contractual quantity, thereby leading to widespread disruption in the supply chain leading to a precarious situation. Furthermore, local supply side disruptions in the neighbouring states is leading to wide variation in day to day delivery of oxygen to Delhi,” the DDMA order read.From Friday, the Delhi government will issue a daily schedule specifying the oxygen allocation to every healthcare facility in the city, the order said.Stating that the allocation and supply of oxygen within the city will be “strictly regulated”, the rules stated: “The allocation order shall supersede any existing contractual arrangements entered into by any facility with any supplier until further orders.”The DDMA also appointed three IAS officers to oversee the demand-supply chain, the transportation and the grievance redressal mechanism of hospitals.Ashish Verma, OSD in Delhi government’s health department has been asked to ensure proper distribution of oxygen from the suppliers to the hospitals, once the tankers enter the city. Udit Prakash Rai, special secretary (health) has been asked to ensure smooth and seamless movement of tankers up to Delhi borders. He has also been asked to sort out all issues raised by suppliers.Vijay Bidhuri, MD, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), has been tasked with controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to all health establishments.“A 24x7 control room shall function under Bidhuri. The control room shall also operate a help desk manned by a SDM level officer and 8 other officers for redressing all the grievances and complaints received from all hospitals (Central govt, state govt and private) within half an hour of the receipt of the grievances and complaints. If the grievances/complaints received are not redressed within half an hour, then it shall be the responsibility of Bidhuri to look into the issues and resolve the same,” the order read.The DDMA also asked the Delhi Police to monitor and control seamless and safe movement of all the oxygen tankers, appointing special commissioner of police Muktesh Chander as the nodal officer provide all help, support and security logistics in respect of movements of all tankers from the manufacturers sites to the various hospitals as per the allocation orders.It also asked all hospitals to appoint an audit committee for supervising and rationalising the use of medical oxygen. These committees will have to collect data on usage and stock of oxygen and submit daily reports. Every hospital has been asked to also appoint a nodal officer who shall be available round the clock for any matter relating to coordination and redressal of grievances pertaining to medical oxygen.The DDMA stated that anyone found violating these rules will be preceded against as per the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and other applicable laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ddma-lays-down-rules-to-regulate-distribution-of-oxygen-in-delhi-appoints-nodal-officers-101619117391950.html

We had only one oxygen cylinder left at that time,” Sabharwal said. The police and the district administration helped the hospital get nine cylinders by 1pm. “Had there been a delay of five minutes, we would have lost two critical Covid patients who were on ventilator support. The lives of other nine patients were also at risk,” said Sabharwal.While the news of big hospitals in the city was being amplified on the social media, several hospitals with low bed capacity have also been struggling to get their regular oxygen supply. Big hospitals use liquid medical oxygen pumped through a gas pipeline in their wards but most hospitals with low bed strength depend on oxygen cylinders that can be attached to the supply line. Delhi’s oxygen requirement has soared to nearly three times of the normal as an unprecedented surge of Covid-19 infections has filled up city hospitals with critical cases. Many of the owners of these hospitals and nursing homes with a bed capacity between 15-100 said with the scarcity of medical oxygen and the week-long curfew has ensured that they have a little chance to get their oxygen stock replenished. Dr RP Singh, medical superintendent of Amarleela Hospital in Janakpuri, said they have stopped taking new patients from Thursday morning. “It has become difficult to arrange oxygen cylinders. We flagged the oxygen shortage on Wednesday evening but except the police, no other agency came to our rescue. The police could only arrange two cylinders last night. Our regular supplier is able to provide only 3-4 cylinders against our requirement of 40 cylinders,” said .Some other hospital owners said the local oxygen suppliers were either themselves affected by Covid or scared to step out. Dr Pawan Solanki, owner of the 50-bed Dharamveer Solanki Multispeciality Hospital in Rohini, said, “Our main oxygen vendor is in home isolation after testing Covid positive. But he is still managing to deliver us some cylinders. We have at least 10 Covid patients in ICU. Their lives are at risk as we are not getting the adequate supply of oxygen cylinders. We are also worried about legal problems that we may have to face in case of any untoward situation,” said Solanki. HT tried to contact at least four local oxygen vendors. While the cellphones of two of them were switched off, the other two disconnected or did not respond to calls.The management of at least two other hospitals, who did not want to come on record, said the government officials have taken hold of the oxygen refilling plants and are giving priority to government hospitals or bigger private hospitals.On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged the central government to intervene and stop Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments from “hoarding and monopolising oxygen supply designated for Delhi”. “There is a fight for oxygen supply and this is because, even after increasing the oxygen quote by Central government, there are some states that are stopping oxygen supply to reach hospitals in Delhi. Several hospitals in Delhi now see a dearth of oxygen supply. There is no oxygen left anymore. I have received many messages from hospitals – Saroj Hospital, Rathi Hospital, UK Hospital, Jeevan Hospital etc., have informed they don’t have oxygen supply left anymore. Delhi government has been arranging cylinders for these and many other hospitals. Internal arrangements are makeshift arrangements which are not long-term solutions. Government and private hospitals in Delhi have very limited supply of oxygen now,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smaller-hospitals-say-vendors-stretched-beyond-capacity-some-stop-admitting-patients-101619117391122.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Willing to touch Centre’s feet for oxygen supply, says Maharashtra health minister||With hospitals still turning away patients owing to shortage of oxygen supply, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said he was in touch with the Central government to solve the problem, and was even willing to “touch their feet”. “We want the Centre to facilitate a green corridor to provide a safe transport system for our oxygen supply. We are making a humble request to the Central government and are ready to even touch their feet. We urge the Centre to provide a maximum supply of oxygen to Maharashtra,” said Tope.Mumbai is currently receiving 235 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, although its daily requirement is 300 MT; Nagpur is getting 155 MT daily, despite its need of 180 MT; Pune needs 375 MT, but can garner just 300 MT daily; while Nashik, which needs 125 MT, gets just 85 MT daily. As of now, the state requires 1,500 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen daily, against its production capacity of 1,250 MT. The state is procuring 300 MT from other states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. The government has requested the Centre to increase the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) supply from other states to 500 MT daily. It is also expecting 105 MT oxygen by way of Oxygen Express train from Vishakhapatnam.There are reports that many Covid patients who are unable to get oxygen beds are now procuring oxygen cylinders at home as a temporary measure. To deal with the shortage, the state is considering using oxygen being produced at steel and thermal power plants. Tope said that Covid-19 centres can be built near the four thermal plants of Parli, Paras, Koradi and Khaparkheda and oxygen supply can be made by connecting a pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/willing-to-touch-centre-s-feet-for-oxygen-supply-says-maharashtra-health-minister-101619117332440.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Cop, 2 others cremate man after kin refuses to go near body||A policeman and ambulance staff cremated a 35-year-old man, after his mother, wife and other relatives refused to touch the body in north-east Delhi’s Gokalpuri, fearing that he’d died of Covid-19, police said on Thursday.The man, police said, repaired air-conditioners for a living. He stayed with his wife, son and mother.Sushil Singh, assistant sub-inspector, said the man fell ill around April 15.“He first visited a local doctor and took some medicines. When he got fever, he visited a private hospital for admission, but was told to approach a bigger hospital. He returned home without any further treatment,” said Singh.On Monday night, he died. “Everyone believed that he died of Covid-19, although he had not got tested for the disease. His family did not approach the body for fear of infection. Someone made a failed attempt at calling an ambulance before dialling the police,” said Singh.Singh reached the house and called several ambulance services, but none responded. He then went to GTB Hospital to request a private ambulance, said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east).The policeman then took the body to a hospital, and from there to the mortuary for autopsy, the DCP said. The family did not accompany him, police said. On Tuesday afternoon, the policeman and the two of the ambulance staff cremated the body. “I have received both doses of vaccine, but I would have done this duty even anyway,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-officer-ambulance-staff-cremate-man-after-family-refuses-to-go-near-body-101619117331840.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||With Delhi’s health-care system stretched thin, tele consultation services hit||With the health-care system in the national capital overwhelmed by the tsunami of Covid-19 cases, tele consultations services of most hospitals have also taken a hit.Many in home isolation complained of unavailability of slots and delayed response time from overburdened doctors, even as beds for Covid-19 patients remained in short supply.Mahant Ahuja, a resident of Alaknanda who was tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, said, “I had very mild symptoms -- slight fever, cough, and sore throat -- during the first two days. We cannot go to hospitals directly in the present situation and that’s why I tried to book an appointment for a virtual consultation. But it took me two days to reach a doctor. I was told that slots were few due to the unavailability of doctors. I am grateful that my condition did not deteriorate in the meantime but the situation is scary for those having moderate to severe symptoms.”Several other Covid-19 patients are facing similar issues. Anamika Kapur, a resident of Green Park, said she placed a request for online consultation with a private hospital for her Covid positive mother on Sunday and did not get a response even after three days. “My mother’s oxygen saturation dropped to 70 (from an optimum of 95%) in that time. Finally, we had to contact a general physician providing telemedicine services in my locality to start her treatment on Tuesday,” she said.Several hospitals and tele consultation services acknowledged that the facility has been hit by the raging pandemic. Dr Alexander Kuruvilla, chief health strategy officer on digital health app ‘Practo’, said the number of requests for tele consultation has increased by five times in the last 20 days.“The spike was mainly for general medicine . There are complaints of unavailability of slots as doctors on board with us are not available -- they are stretched by the existing situation. It was challenging for us to respond to the sudden surge and it takes time to get more doctors on board. The situation is getting better now and it will further improve in the coming days,” he said.Officials at a few private hospitals said they will have to step up measures to meet the increasing demand for over-the-phone consultations. Prashant Singh, Director IT, and CIO at Max Healthcare said the number of patients reaching out for tele consultations has surpassed the number of patients seeking in-person consultations. “Our doctors are fully occupied with Covid patients right now but we do not have any other option other than tele consultations in the present scenario. We have reduced the timing of each slot so that doctors can attend to more patients,” he said.An official at the tele consultation department at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Dwarka said they have prepared roasters for doctors to divide their time between in-person and tele consultations. “We are trying to connect patients with available doctors on the same day itself. But our doctors are occupied with Covid patients and a few even have Covid cases at home,” said the official.Meanwhile, independent practitioners are also flooded with tele consultation requests. Dr Rachna Kucheria, a general physician in South Delhi, said, “The number of calls I am getting are unprecedented and 98% of those who call have Covid symptoms. Besides Covid-related queries, I am also getting calls requesting beds and oxygen,” she said.Kucheria, founder of DocGenie Telemedicine, said it is important to strengthen tele consultation services to take the load off the health-care system. “It’s time to pool together general physicians at the community level to step up tele consultation services. It’s very challenging for doctors to manage hospital patients and telemedicine consults both,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-delhi-s-health-care-system-stretched-thin-tele-consultation-services-hit-101619117331143.html
23-04-2021||Other||Delhi’s night shelters told not to deny anybody free meals||The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (Dusib) on Thursday directed night shelters in the city to ensure no individual is denied meals that are being distributed for free as part of the Delhi government’s initiative to feed people, especially migrant workers, during the lockdown.Around 14,000 meals were served from the 205 shelters run by Dusib on Thursday – up from the 12,000 meals dished out on Wednesday when the initiative was launched. “Most beneficiaries are migrant workers who have been deprived of their daily wages following the lockdown,” said Bipin Rai, a member of Dusib.Rai further said, “Orders have been issued that no shelter should deny meals to anyone unless the food is over. If they are out of food, they should guide the person to the nearest shelter. We maintain records for the purpose of scaling up capacity, if needed.”The lockdown was imposed from Monday night in the light of the Covid-19 surge that has left the health care infrastructure in the city overburdened, forcing patients to run from pillar to post for hospital beds, oxygen, medicines, etc. “We urge people to maintain social distancing and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour when they come to the shelters to collect the meals,” said Vijay Kumar Bidhuri, CEO, Dusib.When the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24 last year, the city government made similar arrangements for the scores of migrants who were leaving for their native towns and villages, triggered by panic and anxiety about loss of livelihood.Last year, the Delhi government also turned its schools into shelters for the migrants who decided to stay back. The Delhi government also prepared 1 million meals per day during the stringent phase of the lockdown, that lasted for 68 days, which were distributed from the night shelters and ‘hunger centres’ set up in the 70 assembly constituencies in the city.“The relief measures undertaken during the lockdown last year was massive. This time, there are fewer people lining up for food. People are scared of Covid-19 now. They are scared of stepping out and queueing. They hear about the deaths and the burden of the disease,” said Rai.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday set up a six-member committee and entrusted it the responsibility of ensuring basic essentials such as food, water, sanitation, shelters and medicines to daily wagers and migrant labourers, including those at construction sites. It also directed the panel to tie up with midday meal contractors for preparing enough meals for thousands of workers and their families.Sunil Kumar Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development, an advocacy group that works with homeless and migrant workers in the city, said the government should increase its capacity of preparing meals at the earliest. “Groups of NGOs have set up meal distributing centres in Kashmere Gate, Ramleela Maidan, Sarai Kale Khan and Nizamuddin Basti. A large number of people are still availing food from these centres and complaining they are being denied food at the shelters run by Dusib. Such mismanagement is unacceptable.”When contacted, Dusib officials dismissed such claims and said they have not received any complaint of anyone being refused food at the nigh shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-night-shelters-told-not-to-deny-anybody-free-meals-101619117271787.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||CBSE to give more weightage to competency based questions in new academic session||In order to implement the competency based learning, as mentioned in the National Education Policy 2020, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday changed the composition of assessment tasks for students from classes 9 to 12 for the new academic session (2021-22).“While the overall marks and duration of examination shall remain the same, a change in the composition of assessment tasks would help us achieve the desired ends. Therefore, in the forthcoming sessions, a greater number of competency-based questions or questions that assess the application of concepts in real-life/ unfamiliar situations will be a part of the question paper,” director (academics) Joseph Emmanuel said in a circular to all heads of CBSE-affiliated schools.The board added that the decision was taken as the NEP 2020 “has affirmed the need to move from rote learning to competency-based learning, making it more focused on developing the creative and critical thinking capacities of students to meet the challenges of the 21st century.”For instance, the composition of the question paper for classes 9 and 10 was changed to accommodate fewer short or long answer questions (from 60% last year to 50% this year) and to introduce 30% competency-based questions -- in the form of multiple choice questions (MCQs), case-based questions, source-based integrated questions and other types -- instead of the 20% case and source-based questions last year.For classes 11 and 12, the short/long answer questions have been reduced from the earlier 70% to 60% this year and 20% weightage has been given to competency-based questions.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “There is a slight change in the composition of theory paper to enhance competency-based learning through various forms of questions. This can help students score better. The board has also specified that students can expect MCQs or source-based or case-based questions in this session.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-to-give-more-weightage-to-competency-based-questions-in-new-academic-session-101619117212317.html

23-04-2021||Mumbai||Deploy cops to impose complete lockdown: Maharashtra CM||The Maharashtra government’s complete lockdown came into effect on Thursday evening, with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directing the state police to impose restrictions strictly, even as the state continued to report over 60,000 cases for three days in a row. As part of the notification for strict restrictions on movement of people, generally called lockdown, people can’t step out unless they need medical attention or are working in an essential sector or want to buy essential commodities, that too for restricted timings — between 7am and 11am. While local train and metro train travel have been restricted to essential sectors and those in need of medical attention, other public transport modes such as buses have been allowed to ply, but at 50% of the seating capacity. Even those going for vaccination would be allowed to travel. The fresh restrictions will continue till 7am on May 1. The state government may extend the restrictions in case the daily cases don’t dip. The state will take a decision after reviewing the situation by the end of this month, the officials said. Thackeray held a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Dilip Walse Patil and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pande over strict implementation of the restrictions. “The DGP was directed to deploy the police force in substantial numbers at places to deter people from stepping out of their homes unnecessarily. They were asked to avoid using force and engaging in arguments and instead book offenders using provisions of the existing laws,” said a senior official, privy to the development.State health minister Rajesh Tope said they have decided to strictly restrict people’s movement. “Breaking the chain of infection is necessary to bring down the cases, hence it has been decided to impose a lockdown. We have decided to strictly curb movement that includes restrictions on inter-district movement and internal district movement as well. People will be allowed to step out if there is a death or a medical emergency, else they won’t be allowed to travel,” Tope said. “Free movement of people will not be allowed in this period.” Attendance in government and exempted category offices has also been reduced to 15%, while those coming under essential category have been allowed to work at maximum 50% capacity.Public transport buses, including BEST in Mumbai, will be allowed to ply for all, but at 50% of the sitting capacity. Besides, taxis and autorickshaws will remain operational at 50% capacity and strictly following Covid protocols. To reduce mobility between cities and districts, travelling in public buses has been reduced to 50% of their sitting capacity. Passengers travelling inter-city/district in public transport buses will have to mandatorily go in quarantine for 14 days, with mandatory stamping on their hands, while a rapid antigen test on them at alighting point can be considered by local authorities, stated the order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Thursday. The decision for complete lockdown was taken in a special cabinet meeting held on Tuesday. The state health department had expressed concern over the surge in daily cases as going by their projection the tally of active cases is likely to go up to 1.1 million cases, which will overwhelm the entire health infrastructure and situation may go out of control. More than 80% health infrastructure is already occupied. As the state is struggling with shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug such as Remdesivir, ministers insisted on a complete lockdown in the cabinet meeting. “All shops related to groceries, vegetables, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries and confectionaries, including those of chicken, mutton, poultry, fish and eggs, have been allowed to operate between 7am and 11am. Home delivery from the said shops; hotels, restaurants and bars and from e-commerce websites have also been allowed till 8pm,” said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management and relief and rehabilitation department said. “We have brought restrictions only on public transport, offices, marriage functions and private vehicles,” he added. The wedding ceremony, which has proved to be a super-spreader event in the past, has been allowed in the presence of only 25 attendees. The ceremony has to be completed in two hours, while flouting of the condition may attract a fine of ₹50,000 to the family and action against the operator by shutting down the facility till the end of the pandemic. Flouting of rules will attract a fine of ₹10,000, stated the order. “The offices from the exempted category, including banks, mediclaim, insurance sector, too, will have to reduce the attendance to 15% from the existing permission of 50%. However, offices dealing in essential services, including hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, posts, ports, petrol pumps, petroleum companies, e-commerce companies etc. can operate at 50% capacity,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deploy-cops-to-impose-complete-lockdown-maharashtra-cm-101619117152346.html
23-04-2021||Noida||Supply poor, private hospitals still face oxygen shortage in Ghaziabad and Noida||Ghaziabad/Noida: Many private hospitals in Ghaziabad and Noida continued to face shortage of oxygen on Thursday as supplies could not keep with demand in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the national capital region.Officials of several hospitals in both the cities said that they are trying to arrange for oxygen on hourly basis even as family members of the patients were running pillar to post to procure oxygen cylinders. In Ghaziabad, officials familiar with the development said that the city currently requires 59 tonnes of oxygen daily, but supply is only about 30-35 tonnes per day. Shailesh Kumar, father of an 18-year-old girl, was in tears outside Avantika Hospital in Indirapuram and desperately seeking any arrangement for oxygen. “The hospital told us that there is no oxygen supply, and we should try elsewhere. How will she get the treatment now? She was admitted here since April 17,” he said. Many hospitals in the city face similar situation. “We have never faced such conditions with oxygen left for few hours and we are trying to arrange each and every cylinder we can. We have asked patients to make arrangements elsewhere. We have 35 patients and one of them left while others are trying to arrange oxygen on their own,” said Dr Yuvraj Sharma, managing director of Avantika Hospital. “At present, we are depending on and arranging for hourly supplies. The district administration is also trying to arrange oxygen for us. Many hospitals face similar issues,” Sharma said, adding that a minimum of 30 cylinders are required each day for Covid treatment. Nearby Shanti Gopal Hospital in Ahimsa Khand II also faced similar issues. “We have intimated patients about the issue of oxygen and have discharged patients who didn’t require emergency services. There are 25 Covid beds, but we have oxygen supply only for six hours. The administration got arranged 15 cylinders and we also arranged similar numbers. So, we will be able to manage till Friday afternoon. Only nine of 22 patients are left now,” said Dr Sanjay Garg, one of the directors at Shanti Gopal Hospital. “Even empty cylinders are not available at present so that we can get them refilled on our own,” Dr Garg added. Despite repeated attempts, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and text messages. Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) and nodal officer for oxygen supplies, also did not respond to calls. However, officials of the district industries department said that 150 empty cylinders of seven cubic metres each were sent to Muzaffarnagar for refilling and once they reach Ghaziabad, they will be supplied to hospitals as per requirement. “We also have 60 empty cylinders of 60 cubic metres each and one empty tank with 20 tonne capacity. These can be refilled and can also be put to use for supply to hospitals,” said Virendra Kumar, general manager of district industries department.In Noida, the managements of Kailash Hospital in Sector 27 and Prakash Hospital in Sector 33 announced that it was difficult to function without adequate supply. Prakash Hospital said that its Noida facility has 55 Covid-19 patients and Greater Noida hospital has 85 positive patients. “For the last few days, the two hospitals have been facing serious difficulties in getting adequate and regular supply of oxygen. Our supplier is situated in Faridabad. On Thursday, the supplier said they could not give us oxygen as they have to supply the gas to Haryana hospitals,” said Ayush Chauhan, executive director, Prakash Hospital. In the afternoon, Prakash Hospital’s Noida facility had two and a half hours of oxygen supply, and Greater Noida facility hospital had three hours of oxygen supply, Chauhan said, adding that they were working on sourcing oxygen from other vendors. “We have shifted around 12 patients from Noida hospital and five patients from Greater Noida hospital to other hospitals,” said Chauhan. While the present requirement of oxygen in Gautam Budh Nagar is 60 metric tonnes (MT) a day, the supply is about 10 MT. Dr Shweta, in-charge of oxygen/medicine availability, GB Nagar, said Prakash Hospital had faced oxygen shortage since morning. “We provided them 80 oxygen cylinders and resumed supply. They shifted some patients to other hospitals for safety,” she said. Kailash Hospital at one point had only four to five hours of oxygen. “We’ve four hospitals in GB Nagar. All of them are suffering from the lack of oxygen. We have 450 patients and we’ve stopped new admissions due to the shortage. We are even ready to buy oxygen at inflated rates but the supply is restricted,” said Dr Ritu Bohra, Kailash Hospital’s group medical director.VB Joshi, Kailash Hospital spokesperson, said they had not shifted any patient on Thursday.Meanwhile, there were several patients who are doing rounds of hospitals but not getting beds. “My relatives have run from one hospital to the other with my mother-in-law (aged 70 and a resident of Rajendra Nagar) who is suffering fever and low oxygen levels, but they could not find any hospital. All hospitals said that oxygen supply is running out,” said Nitin Ashu, a resident of Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad. Under the present circumstances, families have arranged for oxygen cylinders on their own. “For the past four days my mother is not able to move out of bed. No hospital is admitting her citing lack of oxygen supply. So, I arranged for a cylinder at home and it lasts four hours. Once it gets finished, I rush to Navyug Market to get it refilled,” said Prateek Kaushik, a resident of Delhi Gate locality. On Thursday, GB Nagar recorded 11 deaths and 530 positive cases. There are 4,088 active cases in the district now.Swati Maliwal, chairperson Delhi Commission for Women, tweeted, “My nana died waiting for emergency support in front of Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida. I kept standing there for half an hour and pleading for admission and nothing happened. Shame! Pathetic!”Ajit Kumar, Sharda Hospital spokesperson, said that all the beds were occupied in the hospital. “The hospital management was trying to arrange a bed for the patient. The patient was in a critical condition and he died before admission,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supply-poor-private-hospitals-still-face-oxygen-shortage-in-ghaziabad-and-noida-101619117151658.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Relook at decision of not allowing door-to-door vaccination for elderly, kids, Bombay HC tells Centre||Expressing concerns over the lack of any policy by the Central government for vaccinating specially-abled and senior citizens with severe disabilities, the Bombay high court (HC) observed that such persons cannot be left to die and directed the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) to relook at its decision of not allowing door-to-door vaccination for elderly and find a solution and way to get them vaccinated. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai-based lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari seeking directions to the Centre, the state government and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination facility for people over 75 years of age, the disabled and the bedridden, was informed that the MoHFW had filed an affidavit in response to the court’s direction in the earlier hearing. The affidavit stated that there could not be a door-to-door vaccination policy as it would lead to “high vaccine wastage and contamination leading to a reduction in efficacy”, and that the protocols on physical distancing and infection prevention, including a 30-minute observation period, would not be followed.The MoHFW affidavit had also stated that in the case of adverse event following immunization (AEFI), there could be a delay in reaching the health facility and managing that case may not be as per requirement. The affidavit also stated it was not mandatory to administer the vaccine close to an intensive care unit ( ICU), “The occurrence of serious/severe AEFI is very rare, which may not necessarily require admission into ICU. Hence, there is no such requirement for an ICU for the administration of vaccines.”After perusing the affidavit the court questioned, “There are ICUs in ambulances, you cannot keep a refrigerator? Where is the study that shows there will be wastage due to the time taken to reach the beneficiary? We expected a better affidavit with more facts and figures from the Centre. There needs to be a solution. You need to have a relook at it.”When additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh for the Union of India submitted that in case of co-morbidities, there would be a risk in door-to-door vaccination to senior citizens. The court observed, “This is choosing between the devil and the deep sea. You do not want patients with comorbidities to be given vaccines without supervision, but because they cannot come to the vaccination centre, you want them to suffer?... In our country, old people and children should be taken care of on priority...We cannot leave old people to die...It is upon us that our near and dear ones get vaccinated.”Thereafter, Kapadia urged the HC to pass orders to waive off mandatory documents like Aadhaar or PAN card for vaccination, however, ASG opposed it and said that some document was required for it. The court then observed, “If some person is living under the bridge, then will not he/she carry the disease? Then what do we do? Unless you start a drive to get an Aadhar card for everyone.” The court directed the MoHFW to have a relook at its decision and said that it would give ‘prima facie’ opinions on the five reasons given by the Centre for not being able to have a door-to-door policy for vaccination and posted the hearing of the PIL to May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/relook-at-decision-of-not-allowing-door-to-door-vaccination-for-elderly-kids-bombay-hc-tells-centre-101619117031063.html

The attendants of many patients are being asked to shift their patients to another hospital due to a shortage in medical oxygen. This demand and supply gap of oxygen has left many in the lurch. Panna Lal (68), a resident of a colony near Varuna Bridge, took ill on April 12. His Covid test was done and the report came out negative, however, his condition deteriorated. Later, his son prof Anil Kumar Chaudhary admitted him to a Vivek Hospital in the Bhikharipur area of Varanasi on April 16. His condition was detected with pneumonia. On April 17, the hospital administration informed prof Chaudhary that there would be a shortage of oxygen, therefore, he should shift his father to another hospital. Chaudhary said, “I somehow managed to shift my father to Sahyog Hospital and Surgical Centre in Orderly Bazar area. My father is admitted to ICU and his condition is improving. However, on April 22 morning, the hospital administration asked me to shift my father to another hospital since the hospital as there would shortage of oxygen because the hospital was left with oxygen for next few hours only.” He said, “This information made me shocked because it is not easy to find a hospital under the current circumstances. I raised the issue before the authorities and urged them to ensure oxygen supply to the hospital because there are 12 patients, including my father in the ICU. By afternoon, the hospital received around eight cylinders of oxygen.” Thereafter he took a sigh of relief and thanked the authorities for paying attention to his request. Chaudhary appealed to the authorities to maintain supply to the hospital to avoid inconvenience to the patients in the ICU. Another 40-year-old patient has been admitted to the same hospital on April 18. He is on oxygen support. On Thursday morning, the patient’s kin, who does not wish to be named, said that the hospital authorities asked her to shift the patient to another hospital since the hospital was left with oxygen supply only till noon and there would be a shortage of oxygen. She took a sigh of relief after the hospital got a supply of cylinder in the noon. Not only these two persons but many others in Varanasi are being asked to shift their respective patient to another hospital due to the shortage of medical oxygen. Besides, many people are struggling to get beds with oxygen facility for their ailing kin. District Magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma said, “We are facing the biggest challenge to remove dearth of oxygen and meet its demand. This time, almost all the people who are getting infected by this deadly form of coronavirus require oxygen.” That is why, beds with oxygen facilities are being increased at the Trauma Centre, BHU. A total of 40 beds have been increased in the trauma centre on Thursday, besides, 15 ventilators have been provided to the BHU so that the general beds can be prepared for Covid patients, said Sharma. He said that all possible efforts are being made to meet the oxygen demand. ‘Now O2 reserve in hosps remain for 8-10 hrs’ VARANASI District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that nowadays, the hospitals in Varanasi have an oxygen reserve of 8-10 hours. Therefore, hospitals should admit the patients as per the availability of oxygen. DM said that a meeting was held with the in-charges of different hospitals on Tuesday. In the meeting, it was told to them that any hospital if facing problems in getting oxygen should reduce the number of beds and not admits new patients till the old patients get discharged. Every hospital should keep only as many patients as fits into its quota of oxygen, he said. The daily Oxygen supply is fixed and around 3400 oxygen cylinders are being supplied to various Covid hospitals. When the oxygen supply will get better, beds can be increased after a few days. We have reached the maximum capacity of beds according to oxygen availability, he added. BOXEmpty O2 cylinders reach Kashi from GujVARANASI Two hundred empty cylinders of oxygen reached Varanasi, said divisional commissioner of Varanasi, Deepak Agarwal, on Thursday. He said that these cylinders will be filled with oxygen and supplied to the hospitals. These cylinders have been brought from Gujarat. He added that 400 more empty cylinders will arrive in Varanasi within the next two days from Gujarat. These cylinders would be filled with oxygen and supplied to the hospitals. The order for these cylinders was placed a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/medical-o2-crisis-increases-in-varanasi-hosps-ask-attendants-to-shift-patients-101619116971099.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Long queues outside civic-run vaccination centres in Mumbai||Around 10 days before the Covid-19 vaccination opens up for all above the age of 18 years, long queues were witnessed outside government and civic-run vaccination centres. The burden on government vaccination centres has increased as there are frequent closures of vaccination centres and many private hospitals have discontinued vaccination owing to shortage of stock.On Thursday, 48 private vaccination centres were shut owing to shortage of vaccine doses. As a result, long queues were seen outside civic-run vaccination centres. The scene was the same on Wednesday when around 40 of the total 129 vaccination centres could not carry out vaccination. Several jumbo centres like Dahisar Jumbo Centre, NESCO and civic hospitals in the city are witnessing long queues for vaccination.The daily number of people being vaccinated has come down to 25,000 to 40,000 from 50,000 to 60,000 about two weeks ago.Ashish Mhatre, a Dahisar resident said, “I had gone to Dahisar Jumbo Centre for vaccination, but there was a long queue and no social distancing was followed. I will now register and go at a later stage after taking a prior appointment.”The BMC on the other hand aims to have 500 vaccination centres in the city in the coming months, as vaccination for everyone above 18 years of age starts from May 1, 2021. As of Wednesday morning, the BMC had around 180,000 vaccines in stock that may go down to around 100,000 by Friday morning. On Thursday, 48,152 citizens were vaccinated of which 21,762 were senior citizens above the age of 60, 22,104 were between the age group of 45 to 60, 1,491 were health care workers and 2,795 were front line workers. Overall, 2,128,095 of citizens have been vaccinated in the city, so far. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have been getting vaccine doses from the Centre, but they are not in bulk.” The BMC has a storage capacity of stocking around 12 million vaccine doses at the central vaccine storage facility in Kanjurmarg, and the same is expected to be utilised starting May 1. Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, “The crowding in the form of long queues outside civic vaccination centres will only prove dangerous considering the virus is mutating and its new variants are spreading faster. In all this, the long queues outside vaccination centres only add to the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/long-queues-outside-civic-run-vaccination-centres-in-mumbai-101619116911032.html

In a bid to regulate the charges of cremation at the ghats, the administration has fixed the fee of cremation to ₹4000 including that of wood. The steps have been taken after reports that people were being charged hefty amounts for the cremation of the bodies of their kin started floating on social media. A video had also gone viral in which the person responsible for giving woods at Phaphamau Ghat was asking a family to pay a hefty amount. The police reached the scene after the family created a ruckus when they were allegedly stopped from cremating the body themselves. After the incident, two more persons were given the responsibility to supply wood at the ghat.It is worth mentioning that due to the large number of bodies coming in for cremation the family of deceased persons were charged ₹7000 and even more in the name of giving wood. The extra fee was causing scuffles at the ghat after which cops were deployed there.ADM (nazul) Gangaram Gupta said charges for wood have been fixed at ₹4000. No wood supplier can charge more than this amount. If any person is asked to pay more than the fixed amount then a complaint can be made in this connection. Strict action will be taken on such complaints, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-admn-fixes-charges-for-wood-used-in-cremation-101619116851530.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Taking steps to give drugs, oxygen: Mumbai civic body tells HC||On a day when the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of the Covid-19 situation in the country and issued a notice to the Centre, the Bombay high court (HC), while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the mismanagement of the second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra, was assured by the state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that appropriate measures were being taken to ensure equitable distribution of life-saving drugs and oxygen. As the HC hearing was on, additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that a web portal had carried a report that the Chief Justice of India had taken suo motu cognisance of all Covid-related public interest litigations (PIL) being heard by high courts and had decided to hear all petitions together on Friday, with senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae. Singh informed the court that it could not continue hearing the case further and that the Supreme Court will deal with supply of oxygen, essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and powers of the state to declare a lockdown. However, as the SC was yet to issue an order staying the hearing in the HC or seeking transfer of petitions, the HC bench continued the hearing. The HC bench, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was taking urgent steps to combat the spread. Pointing to the shortage of oxygen and life-saving drugs like Remdesivir, he submitted the Centre had announced that it would take care of it from May 1. On a query by the court on the availability till April 30, Kumbhakoni submitted that measures such as asking suppliers to hand over the medicines directly to the collector who, in turn, would distribute it to hospitals were put in place. To this, the court said there has to be a portal on availability of essential Covid-19 drugs. Referring to a news report from last year which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, “Had we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have arisen.” “You should realise this is an emergency situation,” said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should also be stopped. With regards to availability of Covid-19 tests, the state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing and having a uniform rate for the medicines would be considered. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether the RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients. “The shortage is because the middle class and upper class are now affected and they want a bed in a hospital of their choice. When the same is not available, it is depicted as shortage, while closeby hospitals may have vacant beds,” said Kumbhakoni. The court accepted the suggestions of Purohit and advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for an intervener, on the use of print and electronic media to spread awareness on the measures and to curb panic.The court also sought to know from the state the effects of Covid-19 on smokers and said that till the virus was not eradicated completely, the state and Centre should consider banning smoking and consumption of tobacco products. Reacting to the Nashik oxygen leak that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday, the court said, “How can this happen in a civilised society? While the oxygen supply is less, there is leakage. It is of concern. This is not what we expect from a responsible government.” The HC said the Centre and state should set aside politicking and concentrate on tackling the problems. The court has scheduled the next hearing on May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/taking-steps-to-give-drugs-oxygen-mumbai-civic-body-tells-hc-101619116850965.html
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Decide on jail transfer pleas in 48 hours, Bombay HC directs magistrates||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed magistrates to decide applications by prison authorities seeking transfer of undertrial prisoners from crowded jails to lesser crowded ones amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation within 48 hours. The court issued the directions to ensure ‘equitable distribution’ and to decongest jails some of which were having more prisoners than their capacity thus making the inmates susceptible to contracting the infection. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish S Kulkarni issued the directions in the suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue of overcrowding in the state and district jails which had resulted in almost 200 prisoners and 76 prison staff testing positive for Covid in the past month. In the previous hearing on April 20, the court had asked the state government to respond to its concerns over the surge in Covid-19 cases across prisons and provide suggestions on measures to prevent the same. According to the data furnished by the state to the HC about 35,124 prisoners are lodged across 47 jails in Maharashtra, which can house around 23,217 inmates only. The court on Tuesday had directed the state to provide details about the crime rate and the number of persons arrested after the April 13 ‘break the chain’ circular of the state government and inform whether there was any drop in the crime rate compared to the first 12 days of April 2021. On Thursday, after perusing the crime data submitted which it had sought from the state, the bench noted that offences of dacoity, robbery, kidnapping and theft were on the decline in 2020. However, it expressed its dissatisfaction with the data and said, “What has been placed before us does not serve the query of the court. The chart provided by the government is showing the crime rate in 2019 and 2020.” The court granted time to the state government to furnish a relevant response to its query during the next hearing. Thereafter, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the procedure for decongesting jails and transferring prisoners required a judicial order, which the concerned magistrates could decide after hearing the prisoner and prison authority, and pass a reasoned order on the transfer. After senior advocate, Mihir Desai who had represented the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), an NGO which had sought various reliefs for prisoners during the outbreak of coronavirus in jails last year informed the court that transferring prisoners to other prisons could be a good option the bench said, “We do not doubt in our mind that having regard to the critical situation prevailing now, the state government may to ensure equitable distribution of undertrial prisoners, have to decide upon shifting some of them from overcrowded correctional homes. We have expressed hope and trust that the magistrate decides application as earliest possible, preferably within 48 hours of making such application.” HC will hear the PIL next on Tuesday, April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-decide-on-jail-transfer-pleas-in-48-hours-bombay-hc-directs-magistrates-101619116670980.html

A division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and S M Modak referred to the Centre’s communication of April 18, which cut down the oxygen supply from Bhilai-based oxygen supplier, Prax Air-Linde, from 110 MT to 60 MT, saying that it “hit the state of Maharshtra as a bolt from the blue”. “In this situation of emergency poignantly enveloping a region which accounts for almost 40% Covid patients of the entire nation, the communication from the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs should have been to the effect of increasing the supply of liquid oxygen to the State of Maharashtra from the present practice of 110 metric tons per day to somewhere between 200 to 300 metric tons per day.” “Unfortunately, the things have been turned in a reverse manner and it has affected very severely Covid patients in the State of Maharashtra and in particular the Vidarbha Region,” the bench said. The court noted that Nagpur requires 166.5MT of oxygen, while other districts of Vidarbha region, which encapsulates Nagpur, need 100MT. The fall in supply from Bhilai caused a shortfall of around 100MT. Nagpur has oxygen generating units with 146MT capacity. “We have also been told that PRAX AIR, HYPHEN LINDE had been, till recently, supplying 110 metric tons of liquid oxygen every day. But, now this supply has been reduced to 60 metric tons as per the communication dated 18.4.2020 issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs, New Delhi. The figures noted down just now would show that there is a shortfall of about 100 metric tons between the demand and supply of oxygen and on the backdrop of this shortfall, the communication dated 18.4.2020 has hit the State of Maharashtra as a bolt from the blue,” the bench said. The court sought appropriate instructions from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and directed the joint commissioner, Food and Drugs Administration, Nagpur to see to it that there is no breakdown in the supply of oxygen to all the hospitals in Nagpur. The bench directed the Central Controller of Drugs to be present on Friday for a hearing at 2.30 pm, with “all necessary information, and facts and figures”. This hearing was in continuation of Monday’s suo moto cognizance of the insufficient quantity of Remdesivir in Nagpur compared to other districts, following which the HC had ordered an immediate supply of the anti-viral drug to Nagpur. Stung into action, the authorities led by the divisional commissioner Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the district collector Ravindra Thakare and the municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B obtained assurances from seven drug manufacturing companies for the supply of 6,752 additional vials of Remdesivir latest by Thursday evening. Condemning the negligent conduct of the authorities in complying with its directions to supply 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur, the HC blasted the authorities on Wednesday night, in a hearing which lasted till 11pm, as it refused to adjourn the hearing unless the order of April 19 directing the state to supply 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injection was complied with. The bench made its displeasure clear over tone and tenor of the affidavits filed by the FDA and district administration, which it said appeared to be passing the buck on to pharmaceutical companies. “You are violating fundamental rights of the people,” the High Court observed and asked them whose business it was to procure Remdesivir. “We feel ashamed of being a part of this nasty and evil society. We cannot do anything for the unfortunate patients of Maharashtra. This is how we are shirking our responsibilities. You are neglecting and ignoring our patients. We give you solution, you don’t follow it. You do not give us solution,” the bench said. Senior Counsel MG Bhangde, appearing for the State, candidly and quite forthrightly informed about difficulty in compiling information and collating the facts, and put forth the real picture before the court in presence of officials. In the second hearing held earlier this week, the HC directed the Nagpur Covid-19 Task Force, distributors, C&F agents and stockists of life-saving drugs to convene and initiate stern action against black-marketers. It noted the alleged malpractice of a Gujarat-based company where it was reported that the company was planning to export 60,000 vials of Remdesivir outside India despite a ban on export. The High Court noted that such incident would only indicate the possibility of indulgence in malpractices by some unscrupulous dealers, suppliers and manufacturers. It is always advisable for the authorities to take precautions and periodical checks, the court remarked. The HC pointed out that the Drug Controller of India had immense powers under Drug Control Act and several other statutes to direct pharmaceutical companies to increase production, ensure proper supply and also take stringent action in case of non-supply or deliberate under-supply. T It asked the central body to explain in detail steps taken to ensure fair and equitable supply of life-saving drugs before the court on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/restore-110mt-oxygen-supply-to-nagpur-ensure-distribution-of-remdesivir-bombay-hc-101619116611112.html
23-04-2021||Pune||Covid test results see five-day delay; labs work overtime in Pune||Pune: Though Pune city is carrying out more than 24,000 tests every day, there has been delay in getting the results. As many residents are reporting at the medical centres for tests, results are taking over four to five days. On Thursday, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) collected 22,277 samples for testing for Covid-19. Speaking about the delay, Nishi Parkhe, a resident of Kothrud, said that she had to visit several hospitals and laboratories to get the test done. She had to wait for five days before getting her reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results. “I visited several hospitals last Thursday and Friday to get the test done. My husband has tested positive. But on weekends, no lab was taking the sample. At last I found a lab who took swab sample on Friday evening. But the sample was registered on Monday. And the test came negative late on Wednesday night. My husband was in home isolation. And I wanted to get the test done to ensure that I was negative,” said Parkhe. Dr Awanti Golwilkar-Mehendale, chief of laboratory at AG Diagnostics, said that laboratories are overloaded with samples due to rising positive patients of Covid. “When we started last year, we were testing around 80 to 100 tests a day. We had increased testing to around 1,000 tests a day during the last wave. And in the last few weeks, we have ramped up to more than 2,000 tests a day. There is a huge inflow of patients coming for testing. We have redirected our staff to address this process,” said Dr Mehendale. She said that labs across the city are working overtime to provide results as soon as possible to patients. “Test reports that show markers of a critical patient, we alert the patient. Many labs in the city have ramped up their services and are trying to conduct more tests,” said Dr Mehendale. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief, PMC health department, said that as the three government labs were full, there was delay in getting results, but the condition has improved. “The lab kits at many private labs were over. Now, the condition has improved and reports are being issued without delay,” said Dr Wavare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-test-results-see-4-5-day-delay-labs-work-overtime-in-pune-101619108630387.html
23-04-2021||Pune||New curbs on pvt bus transport put brakes on operators’ business in Pune||Pune: The state government’s stringent new rules on inter-district travel as part of its efforts to break the Covid-19 pandemic has left private bus operators looking at a bleak future. They have termed the new rules and SOPs (standard operating procedures) non-viable and many have opted to stop plying buses on certain routes till the new restrictions are in place. According to the new curbs issued on Wednesday, private buses can ply with 50% seating capacity. Bus operators claimed that it is not affordable to ferry buses with 50% passenger as diesel rates have soared and ticket fare cannot be increased. “Nobody will travel in today’s condition by paying double fare to cover the empty seats. We have stopped plying buses on all routes from Thursday. The new rules will hit our business. Bus operators should decide if it is feasible to operate in this condition,” said Prasanna Patwardhan, chairman and managing director, Prasanna Purple, and president, Bus & Car Operators Confederation of India (Boci). According to the new rules for private bus operators declared on Wednesday by the state, bus service must restrict stoppages to maximum two in a city and at the stoppages alighting passengers must be stamped on the hand for 14-day home quarantine. “We are discussing the plan of operations. We have stopped the Gujarat route for Friday till the plan is finalised. We have closed the Nagpur route till May 1 from Wednesday. Till last week 3-4 buses plied on the Nagpur route daily. But the number had reduced to one now. Currently there are very few bookings on the Mumbai route as well. People are not even willing to travel as it will involve home quarantine. Many people have cancelled bookings after the mandatory RT-PCR test by Gujarat and Maharashtra governments,” said Akshay Nagras, business development manager, Neeta Tours & Travels. According to bus operators, March-June is a prime business season but, like last year, they are facing a lean period. “We closed our Nagpur route and only Marathwada has been operational since last year. With the new regulations, I don’t think it will be possible to function. Last year, when we got the permission to operate with full capacity diesel prices soared and our profit margin reduced. Now, when the situation was stabilising, business has been hit again,” said Pavan Patil, operator, Khurana Travels. As the administration slowly started to impose the curbs, anticipating lockdown many have already returned to their hometown. Now that the private bus services have been halted, passengers are contemplating other options. “My hometown is Akola and I have to travel home for an unavoidable reason. I was planning to travel in the next 2-3 days, but I heard that bus services could be disrupted. Now train is the only option available. I will try and book a ticket. I hope I will get it, as not many people are willing to travel now,” said a resident of Sangvi area on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/new-curbs-on-pvt-bus-transport-put-brakes-on-operators-business-in-pune-101619108030396.html

The management of such firms have termed the handling of oxygen supply as a “war-like situation”. Sadashiv Survase, additional director, commissionerate of industries that monitors oxygen producing industries in Pune district, said, “It’s really a war- like situation and all plants are working in full capacity. They are facing issues related to extra load and production, but steps are taken to overcome it. This industry requires highly skilled manpower and the biggest challenge they face is to avoid and protect the staff from being infected by the coronavirus.” Surwase said, “We, as part of the government, ensure that the industry does not face any power failure and provide police protection to the plants besides addressing other needs.” A top official of an oxygen producing industry said, “As per the company policy, we cannot speak to the media. We are working hard on the work floor. At this stage, our priority is that the plant runs at full capacity and employees working at the ground should not get Covid-19 positive.” Another officer, on condition of anonymity, said, “There is a panic situation. We are getting calls from VIPs with request to divert oxygen to specific hospitals because of shortage. It’s becoming a challenge to monitor the supply chain.” Another officer on anonymity said that people are directly approaching plants with requests to refill cylinders. A district administration officer said, “Our priority is that all the four major plants in the district that produces oxygen should run full capacity and does not affect the oxygen supply and create a crisis.” Major medical oxygen producers Inox Air products (Chakan) Air Liquide India Holding Pvt Ltd (Chakan) Taiya Nippon Sanso India (Chakan) Linde India Ltd (Chakan) Oxygen cylinder refill units in the district Raigad Gas India (Chakan) Sudesh Gas India (Chakan) GVS Air Service (Baramati) United Gas Company (Shindewadi-Bhor) Kay Chandra Iron Engineering Works Pvt Ltd (Jejuri)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/o2-manufacture-industry-in-pune-into-overdrive-to-fill-demand-supply-gap-101619103109993.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi not receiving oxygen due to ‘jungle raj’ in UP, Haryana: Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said there is a “jungle raj” situation regarding oxygen supply in the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, because of which supplies in Delhi continue to be severely affected, and urged the Central government to deploy paramilitary forces for safe passage of tankers carrying medical oxygen for the national Capital.Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said Delhi on Wednesday did not even get 50% of the old quota of 378MT allocated for the national Capital. “Even if we go by the old quota of 378MT which Delhi was allotted by the Centre, we did not receive even that. Of the 378MT, Delhi received only 177MT yesterday. This is solely because of the dadagiri of Haryana and UP officials. The dire situation that Delhi is in today is only because there is absolute jungle raj in UP and Haryana over oxygen,” he said.Also Read | Top central govt official steps in to ensure smoother interstate oxygen movement“Our officials and even the Central government officials have tried to talk to officials in these states, but the situation on the ground has not changed. Our tankers are still waiting outside the plants. In the plants located in Haryana, only tankers from that state are being allowed to go in for refilling,” said Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 in Delhi.The Delhi government requested the Centre to intervene and ensure trucks from UP and Haryana safely reach Delhi without any obstructions or delay.“Since the police in these respective states are being used to stop our trucks, I request the Central government to provide security to the tankers, even if it means deploying paramilitary forces to ensure seamless passage of trucks. Otherwise the horror that has unfolded over oxygen in Delhi over the past three days will turn more dangerous in the coming days,” he said.The Union government on Wednesday increased Delhi’s quota of medical oxygen from 378MT to 480MT per day. The move to increase Delhi’s quota came after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government sought at least 700MT per day in order to meet demand in hospitals that has surged due to a flood of Covid-19 patients.Sisodia said there is chaos regarding oxygen supply in several states across India because despite the Central government increasing Delhi’s quota, several states are trying to have control the supply.At present, several hospitals in Delhi are facing severe shortage, while in some, there is no oxygen at all. Some hospitals are releasing patients and closing new admissions. Saroj Hospital, Shanti Mukund Hospital, Rathi Hospital, Tirathram Hospital, UK Hospital, Jeevan Hospital sent SOS messages to the Delhi government on Thursday saying their oxygen stocks are over.“We are trying to arrange oxygen for them at war-footing by diverting it from hospitals that currently have oxygen in excess compared to the demand. But such internal and makeshift arrangements last only for about 2-3 hours. Delhi’s government and private hospitals have oxygen supplies for the next 4 to 12 hours only. The question is when the Central government has clearly allocated oxygen quota to all states, why are states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana acting as if there is a fight between them and Delhi,” Sisodia said.Day before yesterday a truck from Uttar Pradesh’s Modi Nagar was not allowed to leave the oxygen plant after district authorities and local police stopped the truck.“When that matter was resolved and oxygen supply resumed from Uttar Pradesh, then officials from the Haryana administration went and sat at the plant in Panipat and obstructed timely supply to Delhi. District officials of Haryana sat at the plant in Panipat and did not allow Delhi-bound trucks to leave. It was only at midnight that the truck was allowed to leave the facility,” the minister said.According to the updated allocation schedule, oxygen will be supplied to Delhi by at least five vendors from plants in Kalinga Nagar, Panipat, Rourkela, Roorkee, West Bengal, Bhiwadi, Barotiwala, Ghaziabad, Surajpur, Kashipur, Modinagar and Selakui.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-not-receiving-oxygen-due-to-jungle-raj-in-up-haryana-sisodia-101619089430007.html
23-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi may transport oxygen via air to save time: CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the Delhi government is considering bringing oxygen from far flung states such as Odisha and West Bengal by air instead of road in order to save time and meet the increasing demand in hospitals across the city.Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal thanked the Delhi high court and the Central government for intervening and increasing the city’s quota of oxygen from 378 metric tonne (MT) to 480MT, even though he reiterated that the Capital needs 700MT. He, however, said it is the Centre which decides not just the quota but also the companies and places from where the oxygen is to be sourced.“Delhi does not produce oxygen, it sources it from plants in other states. The Centre decides the companies from which we get oxygen. The revised quota that the Centre has allotted to us, a substantial part of it is to come form Odisha. But, it will take several days to bring oxygen from Odisha to Delhi by road. We are exploring if bringing oxygen from there by air is possible. We are trying for that,” he said.Also Watch | ‘Very grateful’: Kejriwal as govt increases Delhi’s oxygen quota amid crisisSenior officials in the health department said despite the increase of 102MT per day, Delhi would be better placed if it received about 700MT every day. “There will be still a shortfall of 220MT per day which we will have to make up for by ensuring proper demand-side management and plugging oxygen consumption wastage. Also, in times of utmost crisis, oxygen is diverted from low-demand hospitals to high-demand ones, but that is supposed to be the last resort,” the official said.According to the updated allocation schedule, oxygen will be supplied by at least five vendors from plants in Kalinga Nagar, Panipat, Rourkela, Roorkee, West Bengal, Bhiwadi, Barotiwala, Ghaziabad, Surajpur, Kashipur, Modi Nagar and Selakui.“What remains a matter of grave concern is that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 metric tonne oxygen from Odisha (70 metric tonne) and West Bengal (30 metric tonne) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. Our citizens, our hospitals, our city is running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140 metric tonne which Haryana has to supply is yet to leave for Delhi,” said the government spokesperson.Kejriwal said Delhi faced a severe oxygen crisis over the past few days with some state government’s stopping tankers meant for Delhi to use in their states. “Night before last, a truck was supposed to leave from a neighbouring state to provide oxygen to Delhi government’s GTB hospital. But, that truck was not allowed to start from there. We contacted a Union minister at night for help and got the truck released. We thank the Central government and the Delhi high court for all their help and interventions,” said Kejriwal.With states clamouring for oxygen supplies, Kejriwal appealed to all states to put up a united front against Covid-19. He urged all states to help each other and assured if Delhi has oxygen in excess, the government would give it to other needy states.“Going by the number of Covid-19 cases, India is now the worst-hit country across the world. This is a very big catastrophe. In such as situation, if now we act in a divided way and think about our own states, then India will not survive. Right now, we should help each other. We have to be an Indian first and be humane. This is the time to help each other as only then India will survive. This disease does not spread on the basis of borders,” he said.Kejriwal reiterated that the Delhi government is preparing for more beds, oxygen and other medical supplies during this ongoing lockdown which is scheduled to be lifted at 5am on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-transport-oxygen-via-air-to-save-timecmkejriwal-101619077369889.html
23-04-2021||Chandigarh||1,710 doses of Covid vaccine stolen from Jind civil hospital||Hours after a thief stole 1,710 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, comprising 440 doses of Covaxin and 1,270 doses of Covishield, from the PPE centre of civil hospital in Jind at 12.44am on Thursday, he left the doses at a tea stall outside Jind Civil Lines police station.Jind deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Jitender Katkar said that the thief had handed over a sealed packet to an old man who was sitting at the tea stall outside the police station.“The thief told the old man to hand over the packet to a police personnel and said that there is food inside the packet. When the man brought the packet to the cops, they found vaccine doses inside it,” the DSP said.“We called the doctors and they checked the vials. No vaccine was found missing. The thief had also written a note saying ‘Sorry, I did not know it was corona vaccine’. We are checking the CCTV footage near the tea stall to identify the thief,” the DSP added.Police have registered a case under Sections 380 and 457 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unknown person.Earlier in the day, Police said two men were caught on CCTV, breaking into the hospital’s store past midnight. “We have studied the footage in which the two men are seeing breaking into three locks to reach the vaccine stock,” the spokesman said. Civil surgeon Dr Manjeet Singh said, “It seems the thief came to steal remdesivir, the medicine to treat Covid-19, but took away Covaxin and Covishield.” The civil surgeon said that despite the theft, there is no shortage of vaccine.“We have over 6,000 doses of vaccine and there is no shortage,” he added.Sheela Devi, store in-charge, said that a sanitation worker called her up on Thursday morning to report that the lock of the store was broken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/1710-doses-of-covid-vaccine-stolen-from-jind-civil-hospital-101619072808995.html
