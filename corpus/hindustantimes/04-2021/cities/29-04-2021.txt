But if the demand of a particular state is ‘x’, then why did you give it ‘x+y’? Why don’t you give ‘y’ to Delhi?” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked the Centre, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The Centre has allocated 490 MT medical oxygen to Delhi, which has been demanding 700 MT.With cases in the Capital rising, and most hospitals not adding beds or intensive car units because they do not have access to adequate oxygen, the Delhi government , separately, on Thursday urged the Central government to raise the national capital’s daily quota of medical oxygen from 490 MT to 976 MT and provide logistics support for the enhanced allocation.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19, wrote to Union minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday stating that the national capital will require more medical oxygen as the government plans to add around 15,000 beds in the next 10 days.“The people and the Government of NCT of Delhi will be extremely grateful to the Government of India if it can kindly increase the allocation from the present 490 MT per day to 976 MT per day, preferably from nearby oxygen plants, reducing the turnaround time,” Sisodia wrote to Goyal, who is also the minister of commerce and industry and the minister of consumer affairs. He is also the railway minister On Thursday, the high court rejected the submission of Mehta that the present oxygen supply to Delhi was sufficient, and asked the Centre to respond on why other states were getting more oxygen or almost as much as they demanded.The bench clarified that it was by no means interested in securing more oxygen for Delhi than required, and that too at the cost of any state or Union territory.“We make it clear that by no means are we interested in securing for Delhi more than what’s required, and that too at a cost of any other state or Union territory. However, if submissions of Delhi or amicus were to be accepted, it would appear the central government needs to explain this, for which we are granting time. It goes without saying the aforesaid reflect arguments advanced by amicus and (lawyer Rahul Mehra) Delhi,” the court noted in its order.The question was posed after senior advocates Rajshekhar Rao, amicus curiae in the matter, and Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that as per the national allocation plan, Maharashtra demanded 1500 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen per day and was allocated 1661 MT; similarly, Madhya Pradesh demanded 445 MT and it was allocated 543 MT, and that the situation was similar for several other states.The discussion on the national allocation plan came about after Mehra told the court that Delhi’s demand of 700 MT is not being granted . He told the bench that the city was working to augment its bed capacity and would add 15,000 more beds to meet the surge in the cases in mid May predicted by experts; however, they do not have sufficient oxygen. “I will place it now and my instructions are from the top of the bureaucracy. They (Centre) are skirting the oxygen supply (issue). As a state government we are being put in the dock but the Centre has miserably failed the people of the country... Some responsibility should be fixed. Only paper orders have been passed. This is not oxygen in air, it’s oxygen in cylinders. Except giving sermons, the Centre has not done anything. There is complete apathy for the people of Delhi. We cannot be mute spectators just because they are the Centre,” Mehra argued. Solicitor General Mehta, justifying the allocation plan, said the Centre is making all possible efforts to augment the supply and claimed the current supply is sufficient to meet current needs. He said that oxygen has not reached Delhi because the Union territory has been facing difficulty in picking the allocated amount to them. He said that the national allocation plan should not be touched by the court because several factors have been taken into consideration while deciding. He also justified that Maharashtra has been given more oxygen because of the raging pandemic, while Madhya Pradesh’s population is three times that of the Capital..Maharashtra had 675,451 active cases as on Wednesday night, but Madhya Pradesh only 92,773, and Delhi over 100,000.“Suppose there is a huge, unprecedented surge tomorrow, which nobody can anticipate… I do not want to create panic… then the situation would be different. The Delhi government did demand 700 MT. For me, a Delhi citizen is as dear and important as a Kerala citizen. They did demand 700. Allocation is 480-490, the actual quantity coming to Delhi 335-340 which according to our assessment is sufficient,” Mehta submitted before the court.“Delhi is facing difficulty because it has not been able to pick up the allocated amount.. 90% of our time is going out firefighting for Delhi. There are transport and logistical issues,” he said. “No resources are unlimited and we are augmenting. There can be lapses but those could be rectified.” During the hearing, an agitated Mehta told a senior officer of the Centre, “You cut from MP and give it to Delhi. It would be at the cost of some lives in MP but let us do it for Delhi.”However, the bench objected to this and said, “Don’t give an impression as if we are asking something extra for Delhi. We don’t appreciate this. We are asking this on the basis of facts and figures. You can’t be emotional about it. You have to take this head on, you can’t duck it.”SG Mehta said that the Centre will file an affidavit on the court’s query and will give the reasons for giving more oxygen to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. “There are states which received less than what they had asked for. We have been rationalizing,” he said adding that hysteria should not be created and the situation is dynamic”. Earlier this week, Mehta said in court that Delhi was behaving like a “crybaby”. To this, the bench said the panic is because of lack of resources.“It’s not because of what judges or lawyers say; panic is on the ground. People are suffering but hospitals are not taking patients. We already had loss of lives in Delhi due to shortage of oxygen. It has fallen on you to resolve this. How you resolve is your problem,” the court said.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city. In his letter to Goyal, Sisodia said Delhi has been witnessing around 25,000 fresh COVID cases a day and about 10% of the patients require some form of hospitalisation, including oxygen support. Sisodia said that merely increasing oxygen allocation to Delhi will not do and that the Central government will also have to arrange transportation to bring the same to the national Capital. “It is also our humble request to provide transport infrastructure, including railways and tankers, for the additional allocation since Delhi is a non-industrial state and accordingly, does not have its own infrastructure,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/why-are-some-states-getting-more-o2-than-they-need-while-delhi-gets-less-delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-respond-101619720983391.html

While two prisoners died of the viral infection on Tuesday, two more succumbed to the disease on Thursday. HT had reported that with over 20,000 inmates currently lodged there, Tihar is at its most congested ever. It is almost double the official capacity of the prison, which has made social distancing and isolation a major problem.  Delhi government officers, who wished not to be named, said they have received the jail’s proposal and were looking at different solutions to decongest the prison complex. Until April 6, the jail had only 19 infected prisoners. At that time, not a single jail staff had the disease. Currently, there are at least 261 Covid-19 positive inmates and 115 infected jail officers, underlining how fast the infection has spread throughout the jail in just 23 days. The Delhi high court also heard a petition on the issue on Wednesday and sought the response of the Centre, the Delhi government and the prison authorities. The petitioner demanded parole for prisoners involved in non-heinous crimes from three jails in the city in view of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh issued a notice to the ministries of law and health, the Delhi government, police, office of the Lieutenant Governor and the director general of prisons, seeking their stand on the petition by May 4.The two prisoners, who died on Thursday, were admitted at the GTB hospital. One of them Kamaljeet, 75, an inmate of jail 3 was admitted to GTB on April 21. The second, Kehkashan, 41, was admitted to the hospital on April 22.On Tuesday night, prisoner Mukesh Talwar, 61, had succumbed to the disease. Talwar, who was arrested in a rape case last month, was lodged in jail 7 and had tested positive on April 22. Hours before Talwar’s death, a 43-year-old prisoner Mohammed Anis, who was lodged in jail number 4, too had died of the disease at the DDU hospital. Last year, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole and bail to decongest the jail when the pandemic spread in March. They were directed to later on dates decided by a high-powered committee of the high court, which included members of the state government, courts and prison.With cases declining after the third wave of the infection in October-November, the Delhi high court in December ordered the prisoners to surrender in a phased manner between February and March.Until February, the prison population was less than 13,000. However, with over 6,000 inmates back in jail, the total number of inmates went beyond 20500, twice the jail’s capacity of 10026. Officials said it is the highest population of inmates in the jail till date. A mid-level prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “ The government should act fast and decide. During the first, second and third wave, the cases were under control in our jails. Two persons died in June and July, last year. In February, there was a time, when there was not a single case. It is scary today. Even prisoners, like Rajan(Chhota Rajan) who were in isolation have tested positive. Four inmates have died in three days.” Among the famous prisoners who are currently Covid-19 positive are underworld gangster Chhota Rajan and former politician turned gangster Mohammed Shahabuddin. While Rajan has been admitted to AIIMS, Shahabuddin is under treatment at the DDU hospital. Student activist Umar Khalid, arrested for his alleged role in the Delhi riots, too, is in isolation after testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-4-die-of-covid-tihar-asks-govt-to-allow-release-of-inmates-on-parole-101619720983985.html

We are ready to hold talks with the government and the same are expected to be held by November and December. Farmers in Gujarat are worst affected and if the farmers’ issue won’t be resolved, the BJP government will implement this Gujarat model across nation,” Tikait added.“Instead of giving donations for Ram Mandir, donation drive should be started to build new AIIMS. The Haryana government has failed to build a medical college in Bhiwani even after remaining in power for the last six years,” he said.Farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said over 400 farmers have sacrificed their lives but none of them has died of Covid.“If patients don’t get bed, medicines and oxygen at hospitals, their kin should visit houses of their respective areas MPs and MLAs and ask them to make proper arrangements. Also, FIRs should be registered against the BJP government as it failed to provide adequate medicines, ICU beds and oxygen to people suffering from the virus. We will continue our protest even if the government imposes Section 144 of CrPC across country,” Charuni added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-will-not-clear-protest-sites-amid-rise-in-covid-cases-tikait-101619720926795.html

29-04-2021||Delhi||DU students want online classes suspended for at least two weeks||After losing his aunt to Covid-19 this week, Sashwat Pandey, 17, a first-year undergraduate student of history at Delhi University, is now worried about his 20-year-old cousin who is also battling the infection. Along with dealing with the grief and anxiety at his home in Varanasi, Pandey is also having to take time out for assignments and academic activities.“There is so much mental pressure. It is not humane to continue with classes at this point in time. Several teachers, who have Covid-positive family members, are having to take classes. Sometimes, the classes are cancelled at the last minute. Students too are struggling with Covid as well as the pressure of exams and assignments,” said Pandey, who studies at St Stephen’s College.Pandey along with several other first-year students are now petitioning St Stephen’s College and others such as Ramjas College, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Gargi College, Indraprastha College For Women, Rajdhani College, and Miranda House, among others, to suspend academic activities and online classes for two weeks amid the continuous rise in Covid-19 among university staff and students. LSR students also held a meeting on Thursday to discuss the boycotting of online classes for a week.In their application, students said “the pressure of the rushed academic calendar is forcing students as well as teachers to continue classes and academics work but in reality, the stress of not being able to attend classes and keep up with academic rigour has made the environment highly unconducive for academic activities.”Due to several Covid-19 cases within the university, students said online classes are frequently suspended or rescheduled. Falit Sijariya, another first-year student, said, “In the middle of our class today [Thursday], our teacher received his mother’s Covid test report which was positive. He was visibly disturbed and had to suspend the classes midway. ”Delhi university Teachers’ Association said this week, roughly 600 teachers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.DU dean of colleges Balaram Pani said college principals can take a decision on these temporary suspensions of online classes in their respective colleges. “Principals can analyse the situation and take a call on online classes as per the availability of teachers and taking into consideration other factors. Teachers can also push the deadline for submission of assignments as per the student requirements. The university has notified principals to act as the situation demands,” said Pani.Rajdhani College teacher Pankaj Kumar Garg said at least 18 teachers of their college are currently battling Covid-19. “The infection leaves people so weak that they are not able to speak. Taking classes in such a scenario will be difficult for them. The university must take steps to follow last year’s pattern and evaluate these [first-year] students on the basis of assessments already conducted,” said Garg, who has also tested positive for the coronavirus.Garg has also written to the university administration requesting them to reschedule the exam for final-year students, which is scheduled to begin from May 15. “Several teachers have confided that they are not in a position to set question papers. For students without access to devices, it will not be safe to come to the ICT centres to take the exam in the present circumstances,” the former academic council member wrote to the university administration.On Thursday, dean (exams) DS Rawat said the university was monitoring the situation with regard to the final year examination and would decide on the matter at the earliest.Meanwhile, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University have also asked for the cancellation of exams and urged the administration to consider alternative modes of evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-students-want-online-classes-suspended-for-at-least-two-weeks-101619720803427.html

In one of the cheating cases, the patient for whom the equipment was procured died of Covid-19, read the complaint lodged by the victim’s acquaintance. Police could not immediately ascertain if the alleged cheating, or a possible delay in providing relief to the patient, had any direct bearing on the death. However, a relative of Narender, the 32-year-old patient who died, alleged that the delay in getting an oxygen cylinder led to his demise. “Had we not been cheated, my brother-in-law could have survived,” said the relative. Police said suspects Ashutosh Chauhan and Ayush were rendered jobless during the pandemic and passed off fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders to make a quick buck. “They sold one such empty cylinder for ₹10,000,” said Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka).Geeta Arora, a resident of Bindapur in West Delhi, was looking for an oxygen cylinder for her friend’s relative, who lived in Noida. “The relative, a patient of Covid-19, had breathing issues and low oxygen levels. Her family was unable to find her a hospital bed,” said Meena.After reaching out to many people for a cylinder, Arora finally got in touch with Chauhan and Ayush, who asked her to visit near Uttam Nagar metro station to collect the cylinder on Monday night.A red coloured cylinder was handed over to Arora in lieu of a payment of ₹10,000. The same night, Arora handed over the cylinder to the patient’s family in Noida. The cheating came to the fore when the patient’s family went to get the cylinder filled on Tuesday morning and realized that it was a fire extinguisher. When Arora asked the suspects to return the money, they refused. On Wednesday, Arora learnt that the patient, for whom the cylinder was purchased passed away, read her statement to the police. She again pursued the suspects. They allegedly called her near the metro station, but didn’t meet her, despite making her run around for two hours. She finally decided to lodge a complaint, based on which a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy was registered at Uttam Nagar police station.The DCP said technical surveillance and local enquiry facilitated the arrest of the suspects, from whom they recovered four fire extinguishers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-in-delhi-arrested-for-selling-fire-extinguishers-as-oxygen-cylinders-101619720745039.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Police to create dedicated lane for emergency vehicles, hearse vans||To facilitate the speedier movement of oxygen tankers and emergency vehicles such as ambulances, hearse vans and those carrying oxygen cylinders within the city, as well as those coming from neighbouring states, the Delhi Police on Thursday asked all police stations to create dedicated lanes on roads, near police checkpoints.The directions were issued by the city police chief SN Shrivastava who also used his official Twitter handle to post the update and explain why the step was taken. These dedicated lanes are being created only near major vehicle checkpoints set up by police to verify motorists and prosecute those found violating the ongoing curfew (lockdown) orders.“All police stations in Delhi have been directed to dedicate a lane, on the extreme left of the road, for ambulances and other emergency vehicles, including oxygen tankers and those carrying cylinders (in emergency). This is being done to facilitate their smooth movement, even as lockdown violators are prosecuted on the (remaining) regular lanes,” Shrivastava, who also tweeted about the step along with an image of the dedicated lane around 2.30pm on Thursday.According to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) curfew guidelines, only exempted vehicles or those having valid movement e-passes are allowed to ply on Delhi roads. The new arrangement is in addition to the green corridor that the police are providing to oxygen tankers coming from other states or via airports.A senior police officer privy to the development said, on condition of anonymity, that the police chief’s direction came after he made a field visit on Wednesday, during which he saw firsthand the jams at several police checkpoints as motorists were stopped by police personnel to check their movement passes. Shrivastava and other officers observed that such jams may also be delaying the movement of emergency vehicles and oxygen tankers.“The chief later issued directions to all police stations in Delhi for creating a separate lane on the left side of the road near each checkpoint for such emergency vehicles and those that carry oxygen,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said the personnel deployed at checkpoints have been asked to put up large visible signage, demarking the dedicated lane, so that drivers of emergency vehicles and oxygen carrying vehicles can see them from a distance and accordingly move their vehicles into the dedicated lane.“The personnel present there will also signal the drivers to use the dedicated lanes to avoid any congestion at the picket,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-to-create-dedicated-lane-for-emergency-vehicles-hearse-vans-101619720743957.html

The decision was approved by the IIT-D’s senate, the institute’s highest decision-making body, during a meeting on Wednesday. To be sure, not all the students tested positive for Covid-19 on campus. Most students who took the survey were at home. The campus has been closed for physical classes since March.Students were allowed to resume research and laboratory work with Covid-19 guidelines as laid down by a University Grants Commission (UGC) directive last November. Earlier this month, the administration advised all students who had returned to the campus to leave after a sharp rise in Delhi’s Covid trajectory.On April 18, the IIT-D administration said at least 30 students on campus tested positive in the previous 30 days.The survey revealed that 11% of the students were considering withdrawing from the ongoing semester. About 43%, or 1,688 students, said they wanted the current semester to be put on hold for a few weeks. Though the administration did not halt the semester, it has decided to extend deadlines for any student adversely affected by the pandemic. Students ill for more than four weeks will also be considered for these relaxations, officials said. Shantanu Roy, the institute’s dean of academics, said, “The senate did not think halting the semester was a solution, since we are towards its very end. It decided to give relaxation to students directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic. They can take the exams whenever it will be possible for them.”Several students continued to demand that the semester be halted by a few weeks for everyone. “It looks like the administration doesn’t trust students even after conducting a survey. They think all the stories of students suffering are cooked up,” said an undergraduate student, who wished not to be named. The institute also decided to give students a week off, from May 1-7, before the online exams begin on May 9. “Normally in the regular time, we ask for documents like medical reports and test reports in case students decide to not take an exam due to a medical reason. However, during the current situation, IIT-D has decided not to ask for any such document immediately. They can also decide to take exams later, whenever it is possible for them,” Roy added.The senate also recommended a six-month extension for PhD scholars to finish their research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitd-removes-attendance-clause-extend-deadlines-after-22-respondents-of-survey-test-positive-for-covid-101619720743354.html

A standard operating procedure (SOP) has also been chalked out that mandates that all hospitals immediately intimate the cell’s nodal officer about a Covid patient’s death at 98154-77868. The body must then be kept at the hospital’s mortuary until the medical officer allots a van to transport the body to the crematoriums/cemetery, which is expected to be done within an hour.The health facilities have been warned against releasing any Covid victim’s body in the absence of adequate arrangements to move it.

In some cases, even cancer patients have requested doctors to postpone their chemo-therapy cycles and suggest alternate medicines for the next one or two months till the pandemic subsides. Amar Singh, 55, a native of Ayodhya district, suffers from oral cancer. He is undergoing treatment at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, KGMU. After he successfully underwent three chemo-therapy cycles, the second wave of Covid-19 struck, with Lucknow reporting the maximum number of cases. Family members and friends advised Singh against visiting KGMU till the pandemic subsides. This was not an easy decision for him. Stopping chemo-therapy cycles in between was a high-risk decision that could harm recovery prospects. But travelling to Lucknow was a bigger risk in this pandemic. “After the surge in cases, I was afraid to move out of the house, forget about travelling to Lucknow. As chemo-therapy cycles are going on, my immunity level is down making me susceptible to all kinds of infection, including Coronavirus,” Singh said, adding, “My family consultant also suggested against going to Lucknow for chemo-therapy cycles, if possible.” Singh’s family contacted Prof Hari Ram of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, KGMU, who is treating him. “After consulting several doctors we decided not to visit Lucknow and requested Prof Hari Ram to suggest alternate medicines for the time being,” said Vikas, his son. “We forwarded the papers of the last chemo-therapy cycle to the doctor on WhatsApp. On its basis, he recommended medicines till the chemo-therapy cycle resumes,” he said. The family is also planning on consulting oncologists online through apps and seek their advice. But, Singh’s family members are praying for the pandemic to subside so that treatment is resumed. Even in private hospitals, the turnout of non-Covid patients has dropped. Only in extreme emergency cases where a visit to the doctor cannot be avoided, do patients visit hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemic-compelling-non-covid-patients-to-keep-away-from-hospitals-101619720563351.html

Some of them have arrived recently while others have been staying for over 10 days to look after their dear ones admitted here, hoping that their dear ones recover and get discharged soon. The attendants living under the shelter of foldable, mosquito nets give a scene of small tents in the garden. At least two attendants are accompanying each patient but as no one is allowed inside the Covid-19 wards, they usually stay in the small park or under a shade on the SRN Hospital premises. Some make do by seeking shelter under trees, braving all difficulties One among hundreds of such attendants is Sudhir Kumar, a resident of Kaushambi, whose relative is admitted to the Covid-19 ward, said he has been here for the last 10 days. He is allowed to send eatables and juice to the patient although he has been not allowed to enter and meet his relative. Enduring all difficulties which include those of food and water for themselves, attendants of patients are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that their patients are taken good care of and return home healthy. Sajjan, another attendant, who has been living here for a week, said that his father is admitted in the Covid-19 ward. Each day, Sajjan makes several rounds to the ward to see his father from outside. He even asks about the well-being of his father from the hospital staff. While Sudhir and Sajjan have hope and continue to do all in their power for their sick relatives, weeping and panic-stricken relatives of dead patients have also become a regular scene on SRN Hospital premises. Soon after the death of a patient, attendants arrange for an ambulance to take the body to the ghat for cremation while making calls to inform of the demise to their relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hope-resides-in-tents-on-srn-campus-ready-to-lend-a-hand-101619720387428.html

Policemen are exposed to greater risk due to the nature of work. That is why we will be extending the facility to everyone, including the PRD jawans, village chowlidaars, homeguards and their families,” a senior police official explained.The SPs of the districts will set up special Coronavirus control centres to keep a track of the health of policemen and even village chowkidaars and their families. Four districts have set up these hospitals —the biggest being in Jhansi with 70 beds and oxygen support. Etawah, Kannauj, Farrukhabad have set up similar hospitals, while other districts were in the process of doing so. “We can accommodate policemen from other districts too. The facility has round-the-clock presence of doctors and nurses, and even has a mess,” said Rohan P Kanay, SSP, Jhansi. ADG Kanpur zone Bhanu Bhaskar has asked hospitals to map critical care resources at range and district levels for personnel and their families. The health status of police personnel affected will be monitored on a six-hour basis and updated in real time. Similarly, the district police chiefs will coordinate with policemen to donate blood and plasma in case of need. While immunity boosting dosages will be given to police personnel, digital consultation of policemen and their families from pulmonologists and general physicians will also be arranged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/l1-l2-hospitals-for-cops-in-11-districts-of-kanpur-zone-101619720206375.html

Patients from Delhi are also coming to Haryana for treatment.Over supply of oxygen in state, the CM said the Centre has also increased Haryana’s oxygen quota from 162 MT to 232 MT but the state requires around 300 MT oxygen every day and this has already been conveyed to the Centre.He said that supply of an increased quota of 70 MT will be made from Odisha and efforts are being made to ensure speedy arrival of oxygen from there via trains and by air.Khattar said that due to failure in oxygen plant at Roorkee, Uttarakhand, which supplies 20 MT oxygen everyday to Haryana, the supply of oxygen was hit but it will be restored soon.Earlier, the CM had held a meeting with officials of the district administration. He inaugurated a 30-bed ICU in the Covid ward of KCGMCH.He added that patients from Delhi are coming to Haryana for treatment as there is shortage of remdesivir injection and oxygen in some states.Over the protests by attendants of patients in hospitals across state, the CM said that there was problem with small private hospitals that were not on board but they are now admitting Covid patients.He said that strict action will be taken against people involved in black-marketing of oxygen and remdesivir.On allegations by the Opposition that spread of Covid is government’s failure, he said Opposition leaders should not politicise this issue and support the government in its fight against the virus.The CM inspected oxygen storage plant and said another tack of 10,000 kg liquid oxygen will be set up in the hospital. During a meeting, Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav told Khattar that of 444 oxygen beds only four are empty and of total 228 ICU beds, 19 are empty, but there is no shortage of oxygen.Khattar, while reviewing the Covid situation in Ambala, said he has instructed the officials concerned to take action against private hospitals for admitting infected patients without authorisation.“It has come to our notice that small private hospitals treating general illness have started taking Covid infected patients,” Khattar said at a civil hospital in city.Khattar met some patients at the trauma centre and OPD of the civil hospital and inspected the upcoming oxygen plant here.The CM said, “There is difficulty in meeting demands of essential drugs and injections at some places as these are coming in less quantity, hence a board of doctors has been constituted to allocate these only to those who genuinely need them.”In Yamunanagar, the CM chaired a meeting and inspected arrangements at ESI Hospital, Jagadhari. He said the administration and police are keeping an eye on those hoarding essential or non-essential commodities in state.Khattar also visited Jind civil hospital to check preparations made for Covid patients.FARMERS OPPOSE CM’S VISITAfter getting information of the CM’s visit to Jind, farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws reached near the PWD rest house but till then, the CM’s helicopter had taken off.The farmers alleged that the district administration had arranged the CM’s visit after declaring that area as a containment zone so that they cannot oppose the visit.Farmers thereafter moved towards local BJP MLA Krishan Midda’s residence and held a protest for over two hours. Farmers tried to break the barricading outside the MLA’s residence to stop farmers but police somehow pacified them.“We have called a sarv khap mahapanchayat on May 3 at Khatkar toll plaza where we will take further decisions against BJP-JJP leaders,” the farmers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-shortage-of-oxygen-icu-beds-ventilators-in-haryana-khattar-101619720205946.html

29-04-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination suspended for healthcare staff training||The vaccination process for the public has been put on hold for two days, starting Thursday, to train healthcare staff on new technicalities in the process, officials of the health department said. With a rapid surge in cases, as Gurugram reported 5,042 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, officials said that the staff strength has also dwindled with over a 100 workers testing positive last week and an increase in workload for contact tracing in large outbreak regions.The staff are being trained to upload details of vaccinations, including the vaccine name and dose wastage, on the CoWIN portal, said officials.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “For stage three of vaccination that is scheduled to start from May 1, there are certain technical changes in the CoWIN portal, which need to be conveyed to doctors, vaccinators, and other healthcare workers, due to which we have halted the vaccination process for two days. For the next stage, hospitals will have to update details, such as the number of vaccines, wastage, name of the vaccine, on the portals on their own. In these two days (Thursday and Friday), healthcare staff from both private and government hospitals are being trained on the technicalities of handling the data on the portal.”Officials said that the district, at present, has a stock of around 10,000 doses of vaccines for use at government vaccination sites, ahead of the next phase, for which private hospitals have been directed to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers. Officials said that the health department will not be supplying it to them.Private hospitals have also been given time till 5pm on Friday, to inform the health department about the number of vaccine doses left with them and return the same to the health department.“All vaccinations that will be done from May 1 in private hospitals will be done based on vaccines that they are able to procure directly from the manufacturers. We have given them time till Friday evening to inform us about stock left with them, which they will have to return. Vaccination will continue at government centres, but for private centres, slots will be visible on CoWIN application, based on their stock availability,” said Singh.According to Singh, the vaccination will continue to be free of cost for beneficiaries above the age of 45 years, while government directives are awaited on the charges for beneficiaries aged 18 to 44.Officials also said that another reason for suspending vaccinations for two days is the lack of healthcare staff availability, as testing has been increased in large outbreak areas along with contact tracing.“With the increase in cases, our healthcare staff is also testing positive, which demoralises them. With limited healthcare workers, it is difficult to manage vaccination, contact tracing and training process. So, with staff who are still working, we are focusing on training for the next stage of vaccination and contact tracing with rapid testing,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The portal has certain changes with respect to the price of the vaccines and allotment of slots that need to be updated by private hospitals based on the stock of vaccine that they are able to procure. These two days, those updates are being done, after which vaccination will start in the district again.”However, the vaccination process was only stopped for the public, with 50 healthcare workers and frontline workers receiving the jabs at government session sites, while 1,458 were vaccinated at private facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-suspended-for-healthcare-staff-training-101619718823800.html
29-04-2021||Gurugram||Over 700 beds likely to be set up by private companies||The district has received a timely boost in health infrastructure, with several automobile companies and real estate developers submitting proposals to set up temporary hospitals, provide medical equipment and create the infrastructure needed to treat the rising number of Covid-19 cases, even as Gurugram recorded 5,042 new infections on Thursday, its highest spike since the outbreak. Officials of the district administration said that over 700 beds, including those with oxygen support and ventilators, are likely to be set up.The deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, said these facilities are likely to come up in the city in the next two weeks and will be set up under the corporate social responsibility programme. “If all the proposals received by the district administration are realised, then the city is likely to add 700 to 800 temporary beds in the next 15 days,” he said.The hospitals would be run in partnership with private hospitals, said Garg.“The process to set up these hospital facilities has already been started and hospitals are being identified to partner with these companies so that patients with mild to moderate symptoms can be treated in these facilities. M3M and Medanta are setting up such a facility, while other companies have also given us proposals. We are also identifying health workers, retired doctors and paramedical staff to be deployed at these facilities,” he said.Officials privy to the matter said that motorcycle manufacturer Hero MotoCorp has already set up a 100-bed facility in Haridwar and a facility on similar lines, with oxygen and other facilities for Covid-19 patients, is likely to be set up in Gurugram. “They are looking for a centralised location with basic facilities so that a plug and play hospital can be set up at the earliest. We have also proposed to them a Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) banquet hall in Sector 43,” said an official who is familiar with the matter, requesting anonymity.An official of Hero MotoCorp confirmed the development but declined to comment.A spokesperson for real estate developer M3M Group said that they will set up a facility in phases, with 200 beds to be set up initially, with oxygen support and other equipment. “We have already started the work and service apartments which are already complete are fitted with health equipment,” the spokesperson said.Garg, meanwhile, said that they have received a proposal from a city-based developer for setting up a temporary hospital of 150 beds, which will be operated through a tie-up between the developer and a private hospital. “Non-serious patients can be hosted there, while serious patients will be treated at the main hospitals,” he said.A Manesar-based auto parts company has proposed to set up a hospital and install an oxygen plant, he said. “Land has been identified at Civil Lines where a facility for 100 beds will be created. These will include oxygen beds and ventilators,” he said.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical official, Gurugram, said that 100 additional beds will be added to Civil Hospital in the next seven to ten days, with the help of a private company. “We have identified the land and will receive a proposal from the company in a day or two. The addition of these beds across the city will certainly increase the number of beds and help the patients,” said Yadav.Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, said that the authority will provide companies that plan to set hospitals in their community centres or buildings with all possible assistance. “We will provide help and support for these facilities where Covid-19 patients will be treated,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-700-beds-likely-to-be-set-up-by-private-companies-101619718823191.html
29-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals with fewer than 15 beds barred from treating Covid-19 cases||Hospitals having fewer than 15 beds will not be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients in Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula, Karnal, Hisar and Sonepat districts to ensure continuous oxygen supply, according to an order issued by the additional chief secretary (health) on Thursday. District administrations were directed to ensure that this does not lead to a reduction in the number of beds, with officials asked to increase the number of beds in larger hospitals.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer for Gurugram, said that hospitals that are not registered on the state Covid-19 website would also not be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients. “It has been decided that smaller hospital with bed capacity less than 15 beds won’t be allowed to admit Covid-19 patients as they are facing a lot of issues with regard to oxygen supply. This measure will ensure that hospitals which don’t have adequate facilities won’t be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients,” said Yadav.According to the order, hospitals in other districts having a minimum bed capacity of 10 were allowed to treat Covid-19 patients. Officials familiar with the development said that the directions would ensure rationalisation of hospital beds and optimum use of oxygen for critical Covid-19 patients, as smaller hospitals don’t have the capacity to store oxygen for longer durations, with some needing a refill every three hours.To meet the challenge of oxygen supply in Gurugram, the district administration also launched an oxygen helpline, 0124-2971110, for hospitals to reach out to the district administration for help in case of an emergency.According to the order, the district administration has to ensure that number of hospital beds is not reduced by this order. A committee under the deputy commissioner was also constituted to ensure these directions are followed, as per the order, said officials.The government order also said that every district will have a vehicle loaded with three to four oxygen cylinders, which shall be kept on standby to meet any emergency. Additional hospitals beds can also be created only if the district has adequate health Infrastructure, manpower, facilities and oxygen supply, the order stated.In a related development, the district administration also decided to implement a token system for hospitals that are sending their staff to refill oxygen cylinders at the three facilities in the district. “The modalities for distribution of gas through a token system is being worked out and it will be introduced in a day or two,” Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, Manesar, who is also a member of the MCG team constituted for the supply of oxygen in the district.According to Yadav, around 30 to 40 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, depending upon the supply, is distributed daily. “Real-time information is shared by the nodal groups and we escort trucks from Bhiwadi and Panipat from KMP Expressway. These trucks are sent to filling stations and hospitals as per the schedule developed by nodal officers of these two plants,” said Yadav.To ensure that the vehicles transporting oxygen do not face hindrances in the passage, dedicated corridors were created and police personnel posted at key points, including the Kherki Daula toll plaza, said Yadav.Police personnel were also deployed at the two filling stations in Manesar and the one in Gurugram to ensure cylinders are filled in an orderly manner. “Documents and papers of those coming to the filling stations are checked and oxygen is given only after that. All efforts are being made to ensure oxygen is distributed properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-with-fewer-than-15-beds-barred-from-treating-covid-19-cases-101619718703180.html
29-04-2021||Lucknow||UP govt orders restrictions on several activities for 14 days||Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari on Thursday issued a government order for Covid containment asking the districts’ administration to ban social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural and religious activities at least for the next 14 days. Tiwari said weddings should be permitted with not more than 50 guests and the last rites must not have more than 20 people. All shopping complexes, cinema halls, restaurant and bars, sports complexes, gyms, spas, swimming pools and religious places should also be closed, the order added.Although the government has not used the term lockdown, the instructions issued by Tiwari are similar to many of those in force last year.In a statement, Tiwari said all essential services such as health, police, fire services, banks, power, water and irrigation will continue. Public transport such as buses, metro trains and cabs should run at not more than 50% of their seating capacity, the chief secretary’s order said.There will be no restriction on the movement of inter-state transport and intra-state transport. All offices —government or private — must work with not more than 50% employees on the premises. All industrial and scientific institutes, government or private, will follow social distancing.Tiwari sought the state administration to take effective steps to prevent the Covid spread. Because the virus spread from human-to human contact, there was a need to effectively control it by restricting human contact, he added.He asked the administration to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour to be implemented.“So, all must wear masks, maintain six feet distance, do hand sanitization and prevent crowding,” he said. Any person suspected to be a Covid-19 case should immediately be tested and quarantined if they were found positive, he added.He said if there was a cluster of Covid positive cases, it must immediately be declared a containment zone and all SOPs should be followed there.

The emphasis has also been that survey work should be carried as per targets.“Though the department has asked us to attend review meetings through online mode, the survey work is continuing and we have make field visits to get updates Field officers are also working with great risk.At this point, when Covid cares are surging, is it feasible to interact with people at village level for different aspects of survey work to complete pending works in a targeted manner?” asked a settlement officer, seeking anonymity. He said the department should have suspended the survey work for the time being in light of Covid cases.“In many districts, the survey work has progressed while in some districts in central and north Bihar, it is still in initial stages where camp officials are required to interact with villagers for map verification and boundaries. This will only expose people to the risk of Covid infections since cases are rising in rural areas too,” said another revenue officer, posted in Begusarai.Reports said that in Munger, around 25% of officials engaged in survey work have been infected. “Even villagers are now refusing to co-operate in the survey work and asking us not to come to their villages.

Manoj Kumar, executive director of Bihar State Health Society said on Thursday that Serum Institute of India had refused to supply one crore vials of the vaccine demanded by the Bihar government. Instead, the Institute wanted the state government to place its monthly requirement. According to Kumar, the SII has informed the central government that it was difficult to meet the demand as several states had placed their orders simultaneously. “The central government has, therefore, decided to make a population-based quota for vaccine supply for states. As a result, the vaccination would not start from May 1. However, the registration for the vaccination will continue,” he said. The state government had earlier decided to start registration for vaccinating people above 18 years of age. Nearly 5.47 crore people in this category are to be vaccinated free of cost at government hospitals. Meanwhile, BJP MP and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has suggested that the Bihar government keep its options open for importing foreign-made vaccines. “The SII, following an appeal from prime minister Narendra Modi, has reduced the price of Covishield from ₹400 to ₹300, which will reduce pressure on state governments. The Bihar government, given the necessity to vaccinate those aged 18 and above, should keep its options open for a global tender of foreign-made vaccines as well.

In our opinion, any discontinuity shall lead to virtual collapse of the health care system. From the material available on record, shortage of medical oxygen in the state is acute and it is obligatory for the Centre and the state government to ensure that the state’s quota of 194 MTs of liquid medical oxygen, as allocated by the Central government, reaches its destination physically,” the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah observed Wednesday evening. The bench also rejected Bihar government’s stand that “the supply of 90 MTs of oxygen from the Central quota on April 26 coupled with the availability of oxygen generated in the State through various sources was adequate to meet the requirement for treating patients in the state”. “Certain disturbing facts have emerged during hearing of the present matter under public interest litigation relating to deficient health care infrastructure in Bihar to meet the challenges posed by exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in its second wave. Acute shortage of medical oxygen in the state, particularly in the hospitals treating Covid patients, is an admitted fact,” the bench observed. The bench said it has formed an opinion that “Bihar is not in a position to increase the number of Covid-19 beds in government and private hospitals because of shortage of oxygen and is unfortunately determining the requirement of oxygen merely on the basis of minuscule number of beds which have been made available compared to the actual need”. The court also underlined the report of the central team, which pointed at inadequate infrastructure even in the state’s big government hospitals like the IGIMS and PMCH. Huge vacancies The court was also surprised by the huge number of vacancies at various levels in the health sector. “It is noteworthy that 4,149 posts of specialist doctors and 3,206 of general doctors are vacant. As against total sanctioned posts of 91,921 at various levels, 46,256 posts are vacant. It is high time the state government looked into this aspect and took remedial measures. We will be taking up this aspect of the matter in future proceedings,” the court observed. The court also wanted to know from the state government the basis for determination of number of Covid deaths in the state and what are the sources which feed data in relation to such deaths. The query is significant as there have been several allegations of underreporting due to growing rush at the crematoriums. Lack of storage tanks In course of the hearing , it came to light that except three hospitals, none of the government and private hospitals in Patna has cryogenic storage tank, a basic requirement for big hospitals. As a result, full utilization of hospital beds is not happening due to lack of oxygen supply. The Central team’s report said All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Patna), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital at Bihta and private hospitals Paras in Patna have cryogenic storage tank for oxygen. Even old and big hospitals like Patna Medical College and Hospital, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and state’s first dedicated Covid hospital, Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) don’t have the facility. The government’s announcement to convert Medanta-Jai Prabha Hospital, which has come up on the government land, into a Covid hospital has also remained a non-starter. The court directed the health department to ensure that Medanta, which did not have oxygen supply facility at present, could provide a 50-bed facility. It also directed that facility created for Covid patients at the Pataliputra Sports Complex be put to use. The report of the central team said the PMCH has 1,750 beds, but nearly 1,000 remained unused for want of oxygen. The ailing systemDemand and supplyBihar’s quota for medical oxygen per day,as fixed by Centre, is 194 MTs. It received only 90 MTs on April 26. State says the supply, coupled with oxygen generated in the state, is adequate to for treating patients, a claim trashed by the HC. Storage problemsOnly three hospitals in Pana — AIIMS, ESIC Hospital at Bihta and private Paras Hospital, have cryogenic storage tanks for oxygen, a basic requirement for big hospitals. Even premier hospitals like PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS don’t have the facility.Manpower gapAs against the total number of sanctioned posts of 91,921 at various levels, 46,256 having been lying vacant at various state-run hospitals.

This is following recent incidents of fire in hospitals. The audit is to inspect electrical installations in government, as well as in private Covid hospitals. A major area of the audit will be AC systems and lifts.State energy minister Nitin Raut has asked the chief electrical inspector to conduct the audit.Dinesh Khonde, chief electrical inspector, issued an order for inspections on April 28. The order consists of a check-list and SOPs for the inspections, to follow Covid 19 lockdown protocols and observe safety measures to prevent infection.“Fire incidents in some ICU wards have happened due to a short circuit in the AC system in some hospitals. Hence, the AC systems will be inspected carefully. The task is now to bring to the notice lacunae, if any, to hospital authorities in time to prevent mishaps. It is mandatory that all Covid hospitals or centres must have a standby for electricity supply in case of any power break down. If any Covid centre doesn’t have this we will not give permission to operate,” said Thorat, electrical inspector, energy department, Pune. “Faulty electric installations will be rectified. If height of the building is above 15 metre, then they should have all necessary clearances,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/acs-lifts-in-all-pune-hospitals-covid-centres-to-go-under-audit-by-energy-dept-101619710962694.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha minister’s district has 7,800 cases, got 30,000 Remdesivir vials, HC told||The Bombay high court ordered a top Maharashtra official to report the district-wise allocation of anti-viral drug Remdesivir and the basis on which this allocation had been made.The directions by the Nagpur bench of the high court came after being told that public health minister Rajesh Tope’s home district Jalna, which has just 7,800 active Covid-19 cases, received 30,000 vials for 7,600 active cases on Wednesday while Nagpur didn’t get a single vial though it has over 78,000 Covid positive patients.“In case he (state’s Nodal Officer) finds that more number of vials than what should have been sent to a particular district has been sent, the Nodal Officer shall withdraw the same from that district proportionately and send them to the districts which have been unjustly and unequally deprived of these vials, and this would include Nagpur as well,” the high court bench comprising Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said.The officer has been told to report compliance to the court order by Friday afternoon. The bench was hearing a suo-motu public interest litigation that blames the state government for mismanagement of the resources.Indian Medical Association (IMA) lawyer Shreerang Bhandarkar, who was appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court), told the high court that the Centre had initially allotted 2.69 lakh Remdesivir vials for Maharashtra for April 21-30. This allocation was enhanced to 4.35 lakh on April 24.Considering the number of active cases, Nagpur district should have received 49,177 vials during the nine days, but only received a fraction of this figure. In contrast, Jalna district received 30,000 vials of Remdesivir vials on Wednesday from one or two pharmaceutical companies, he said.Bhandarkar said according to their calculations based on the number of active patients, the per day quota of these vials for Jalna district is 598 vials which would translate into 5,980 vials over a 10-day period. But it received 30,000 vials yesterday.Lawyer Tushar Mandelkar said Nagpur hadn’t received a single vial on some days during this 10-day period leading to a precarious situation.Ketaki Joshi, the government pleader in-charge, however, told the court that the nodal officer had not passed an allocation order for the districts and blamed the central government and pharma companies for the shortage of the drug.In response, the high court asked the state government to come up with the details of the allocation of the antiviral drug among districts, the backlog of vials from pharmaceutical companies and the steps taken to procure the drug from the seven pharmaceutical companies by Friday.The judges also reiterated its previous order of finalising district-wise allotment in a just and equitable manner and asked the nodal officer to also report if pharma companies were deliberately dragging their feet on supplying Remdesivir to the state or particular districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-minister-s-district-has-7-800-cases-got-30-000-remdesivir-vials-hc-told-101619710184147.html

The main reason, residents say, is a lack of coordination between the PMC and the Maharashtra state Electrical Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL).Under the Mundhwa sub-division, MSEDCL supplies electricity to Keshavnagar, Mundhwa gaon, Magarpatta, Loknagar vasti, Koregaon park road, and the Sade Satra Nali areas. There are a total 33,000 residents who get power supply from 30 different low-tension and high-tension underground cables.Over the last few days, people have been facing power failure problems frequently. Given it is summer, residents are facing very annoying conditions staying at home.As per MSEDCL statistics, 85 underground electrical cables have been damaged over the last one yearSheetal Kanoje, a resident of Plenum Park society, Keshavnagar, said, “It is a very difficult situation to stay at home without electricity. We have had power cuts more than thrice a week, of almost one-to-two hours, either in the afternoon or late evening.”Vishal Bhosale, an IT professional from Magarpatta city said, “Our online work is hampered due to the power cuts. Lot of IT professionals are living in Magarpatta. MSEDCL should know that due to lockdown, all IT professionals are working from home. We cannot tell our clients or bosses that there is a problem with electricity. We consider Pune a smart city, but have to struggle to get uninterrupted power supply.”Nishikant Raut, public relations officer, of MSEDCL said, “We are trying to supply uninterrupted power supply to citizens, but, sometimes, it becomes difficult due to the damage to underground electricity cables. We are insisting PMC officials depute officers who can coordinate with MSEDCL before digging for any development work. Our officials would have to rush to spots at night to restore electricity. It takes some time to identify the spot.”He added, “If PMC officials tell in advance about development work, we will take measures to use another source to supply power to local residents.”The PMC has started road and drainage work. Besides that, PMC allows private mobile companies to lay down underground cables. The corporation is utilising the lockdown period to complete development works by May. VG Kulkarni, chief superintendent Engineer of PMC, said, “We have started development work in different areas. Therefore, there may be some incidents of damaging electrical cables. However, we have given strict instructions to contractor and road officials to monitor work and report to MSEDCL officials to avoid interruption of power supply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/damage-to-underground-cables-blamed-for-regular-power-cuts-in-mundhwa-kharadi-101619709882830.html
29-04-2021||Pune||Pune faces severe shortage of ventilator beds||PUNE The district faced a severe shortage of ventilator beds on Wednesday as it had only three vacant ventilator beds and the city zero, as per the Covid dashboard.These three beds were available one in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and two in rural areas, however, when contacted both the numbers were switched off.A 30-year-old woman had to travel along with her family from Uruli Kanchan, which is about 30 kilometres from the city, to get admitted to Sassoon general hospital.A relative from the city who helped the woman get a bed said, “We got her through an ambulance after they could not get a bed in their area. The patient was made to sit on a chair and get oxygen supply through the night (on Tuesday).”“On Tuesday night when she arrived at the hospital, there were already 40 people waiting for an oxygen bed so they made her sit on a chair and supplied her oxygen. Finally, on Wednesday morning she got an oxygen bed,” she said.Another patient from a rural area is trying to get a ventilator bed since April 26, but could not get it anywhere in the rural areas, even in the interiors of Bhor. Relative requesting anonymity said, “Since the past two days we were searching for a ventilator for a 57-year-old male who was admitted in a small hospital that did not have a ventilator.”“The patient was on a ventilator with oxygen saturation levels between 80-85 with oxygen 10 litres a minute. The High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score was about 22 to 25. Finally, after much waiting we got one at Navale hospital,” he said.The situation in Pune seems to have spiralled out of control of the officials too who constantly get calls to either find a bed or get drugs. Even if one is lucky enough to find a bed, getting Tocilizumab has become another problem.A senior Pune Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) official said, “We have heard that the state has been allocated around 800 injections of Tocilizumab. However, we are yet to get any. We are hoping to get at least 300 injections for Pune considering the high demand and because the district has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-faces-severe-shortage-of-ventilator-beds-101619707483547.html

More said, “After getting complaints of extortion I personally went to the station as a commoner and investigated the allegations. We submitted photos to the police as proof and appreciate the action.”Patil added: “If the Railway Police staff does not put an end to this menace more will be transferred.

The Vishwa Bharati institute of foreign language will be contracted to conduct the classes.The ₹20 lakh aims to include teacher’s salaries, preparation of course module, books, internet and online examinations, and audio-visual material. Vishwa Bharati will charge the PMC ₹1,300 per student, as per the proposal.The civic body has decided to offer foreign languages to secondary school students under the “Global Punekar” initiative in online mode.The standing committee passed the proposal last week to teach German, Japanese, Spanish and French to secondary school students (Classes 8 and 9), for the academic year 2021-22. PMC has six Vidya Niketan schools with 400 students studying in Classes 8 and 9. Hemant Rasane, standing Committee chairman said, “The course will not start right now. When the academic year starts, it will precede it. The aim is to provide professional and career-orientated course to PMC school students under the Global Punekar initiative.” A senior official of the PMC school board, requesting anonymity, said, “We don’t have the budget to run foreign languages courses. Schools have not opened. There is a prediction of a third wave of Covid-19. Therefore, no one knows when the new academic year is going to start.

This is our way to reduce load on the state machinery and also make sure everyone is safe,” said Narvekar, who is also one of the secretaries of Shiv Sena.He added: “I spoke to Vijay Patil and he supported my decision which is a right one looking at the current circumstances.” Later, MCA issued a statement regarding deferring the third edition of the tournament. “In the view of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation in the country and keeping in mind the safety and interest of all the stakeholders involved, the Mumbai Cricket Association has decided to defer the conduct of third edition of the T20 Mumbai League till further notice,” read the statement which was signed by Narvekar and Patil.On Wednesday, BCCI had bent its own rule to allow four associations to organise their respective T20 leagues straight after the IPL finishes. According to the BCCI rules, local T20 tournaments can’t be held 15 days before or 15 days after the IPL and also between September 15 and end of February as BCCI domestic tournaments are held during this period. In an email to the state associations, BCCI interim CEO Hemang Amin stated: “Your request for organising the tournament falls within the 15-day period after the IPL 2021. The issue was discussed at the Apex Council meeting of the BCCI and after some deliberations it was decided that owing to the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, the BCCI is giving permission to organise the tournament within the 15-day period after the completion of IPL 2021.” The mail added: “The BCCI is pleased to grant you approval to organise the tournament for the year 2021. You are instructed to adhere to the advisory and guidelines issued by BCCI in this regard. We reiterate that this is a one-time permission provided due to the pandemic situation and is not the norm,” the BCCI official wrote. Besides MCA, the other associations who have been given permission are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Saurashtra.

We have requested for procurement of vaccines from the respective companies. Despite all preparations being made, vaccines should be available for inoculation to begin. As soon as these things are made clear and we receive the vaccines, we will let you know in a couple of days or so. We haven’t received the schedule from companies yet, which includes how many vials will reach on which dates,” the minister said at a press briefing. Delhi has placed an order for 13.4 million doses of the vaccine, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday. Adding to the confusion, private hospitals also have no clarity on how to procure vaccine doses on their own. “So far, there is no clarity on whether we will receive any more doses from the state government or if we will have to depend on the doses that we purchase ourselves. If it is the latter, we are likely to not have any doses on May 1 to vaccinate even those above 45 who need their second dose,” said an official from one of the major private hospitals in Delhi, asking not to be named. Government hospitals and district officials too are unsure about where the doses will come from and how they are to be distributed. “We haven’t received any communication about what to do with the vaccine doses or whether we will get any additional doses on May 1.

29-04-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan High Court seeks Centre’s response on Covid-19 vaccine pricing||The Rajasthan High Court has sought responses from the Centre, state and vaccine manufacturers on a petition challenging the liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy which offers differential pricing for the central and state governments to purchase vaccines from the manufacturers, HT has learnt. The court has set May 12 as the next date of hearing.The division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice MK Vyas passed the order while hearing a PIL filed by the petitioner Mukesh Sharma.“After the new strategy was introduced, the vaccine manufacturers announced their new rates. Serum said in its statement that the vaccine will be given to the central government at the prevailing rate but the vaccine will be given to the state government for ₹400 and private hospitals for ₹600. Bharat Biotech announced the rate to be ₹600 for the state and ₹1200 for private institutions, which is against the spirit of Article 14 and 21 of the constitution, Sharma said.The petition stated that the emergency approval to the vaccine manufactured and supplied by Serum Institute of India under the name of Covishield was granted on January 3 by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). It was reported that the vaccine would be sold to the central government at the rate of Rs. 150/- per dose. The vaccine indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech International Limited was also approved for emergency use. It was stated that the vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech shall also be sold for Rs. 150/- per dose to the central government.Initially, the process of vaccination was opened to healthcare workers of the country from January 16 as part of the national Covid-19 vaccination strategy. Subsequently, the vaccination drive was extended to those above the age of 60 years and also for those above the age of 45 years with comorbidities.The vaccination coverage was extended to all persons above the age of 45 years from April 1. Recently, the central government has announced liberalized pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccine strategy, whereby, it was stated that from May 1, vaccine manufacturer would be bound to supply 50% of their monthly doses to the Government of India and the remaining 50% can be supplied to the different state governments and other private channels.The petition pointed out that the prices quoted by manufacturers are not just higher but extremely discriminatory and arbitrary. The rate quoted by Serum Institute is the highest it has quoted in the world. Under the new strategy, which is coming into effect on May 1, people ageing 18 years and above will be eligible for vaccination but not under the Government of India vaccination programme.If a person above the age of 18 years is to be vaccinated, they have to pay hefty amounts for vaccination or remain at the mercy of the state government for providing free vaccination, the petition stated. The state government, in turn, has to pay exorbitantly higher rates for every dosage of vaccination, it added.Recently Rajasthan’s chief minister announced that the state government shall bear the cost of vaccination of all those above the age of 18 years. Contrary to the cost borne by the Government of India at ₹150 per dose, the state has been thrown in the turmoil to vaccinate more than 75% of the population at ₹400 and ₹600 per dose.The Mumbai High Court had earlier in the day declined to hear a similar petition, pointing that this issue should be placed before the Supreme Court since vaccine pricing impacts all states and not just one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-high-court-seeks-centre-s-response-on-covid-19-vaccine-pricing-101619695002549.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Create provision for oxygen tanks on campus’: National Medical Commission to medical colleges||Amid oxygen shortage and rising Covid-19 cases across the country, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has made draft amendments to their existing rules, henceforth making it compulsory for medical college hospitals to set up Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen units in their campuses. As per the latest circular released by the NMC, the arrangements have to be made within the next six months.Addressed to all affiliated medical institutions in the country, the NMC statement revealed that this move is being introduced through a draft amendment made to the Minimum Requirements for Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations.“Central oxygen and suction points shall include the provision of piped oxygen supply to all patients in critical care from liquid oxygen tanks installed at an appropriate place in the hospital complex,” said the circular released on April 28. The circular further stated that all medical college hospitals should have a “dedicated PSA technology produced oxygen supply in addition to the supply from liquid oxygen tanks, which is installed and made operational within six months”.This move comes days after the central government recently asked respective state governments to make captive oxygen a norm in medical colleges in the future. At present, Maharashtra has more than 60 medical colleges offering undergraduate medical programs.“Most medical colleges in the state already have an oxygen generation unit on campus and we are now going to make sure that all colleges install the PSA technology for future needs,” said TP Lahane, director of the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/create-provision-for-oxygen-tanks-on-campus-national-medical-commission-to-medical-colleges-101619694522886.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police seize 170 oxygen concentrators; arrest 4 for hoarding;||A total of 170 oxygen concentrators, two luxury cars – Audi and Mercedes – were seized from four persons, including two brothers, who have been arrested for their alleged involvement in hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators, important life-saving equipment in huge demand in Delhi because of their use in saving lives of Covid patients, and hence the shortage, police said. The arrested persons were selling each oxygen concentrator on prices ranging between ₹90,000 and Rs1.1 lakh, nearly double its retail price. Two of the arrested persons are said to be distributors of such equipment. The total worth of the seized concentrators as per the average market price is between ₹85 lakh and ₹90 lakh. The alleged racketeers would have earned between Rs1.53 crore and ₹1.87 crore, more than double their investment, had they managed to sell the machines in black market, the police said.Also Read | MHA issues clarification on Act making L-G effective in-charge of DelhiDeputy commissioner of police (north district) Anto Alphonse said that in view of the prevailing Covid-19 emergency situation in the city, apart from facilitating hospitals with their oxygen supply, the district police have also been keeping a vigil on black marketeers. The police have also been monitoring SOS messages for such items on social media.The police received a complaint on Twitter that oxygen concentrators are being sold for ₹95,000 each at Mittal’s Store in Shastri Nagar, Delhi. The complaint also had the mobile number of the supplier, said DCP Alphonse. “In view of the gravity of the allegations and sensitivity of the matter, several teams of the district were assigned the task,” he said.The teams put the mobile number on electronic surveillance and it was found to be registered in a woman’s name in Shastri Nagar. The person using the mobile number constantly changed his location and did not respond to calls, the police said.“Our teams continued conducting raids for two days and eventually arrested Pawan Mittal,34, with two oxygen concentrators and two adapters on Wednesday,” said the DCP.After interrogation, he accepted that he tried to sell each concentrator between ₹90,000 and ₹1.1 lakh, depending upon the desperation of the customer, senior police officers associated with the operation said.DCP Alphonse said Mittal revealed that he purchased the oxygen concentrators from Himanshu Khurana, who runs a shop in Sadar Bazar. Khurana,26, was arrested and he disclosed that the distributors and suppliers of the equipment were two brothers – Himanshu Handa, 34, and Ayush Handa, 28, -- from Delhi’s Model Town Part-3.“Our special staff team conducted a raid at the two brothers’ under construction building in Model Town and seized 168 oxygen concentrators along with the same number of adapters from its basement, where they had hoarded them. We also seized their two luxury cars – Audi and Mercedes – as some machines were kept in them and they were using the vehicles to transport and deliver the equipment to Mittal and Khurana,” said DCP Alphonse.The police said they were interrogating the two brothers to ascertain the source through which they procured the oxygen concentrators in bulk.On Tuesday, the Delhi Police asked its personnel to activate their human intelligence network, keep a close watch on social media posts, visit scrap godowns, and use decoy customers to trap hoarders fleecing Covid patients and their kin by demanding hefty sums for a single cylinder, oxygen concentrator or medicine vial. It came on the day the Delhi high court pulled up the AAP-led Delhi government, and said the government’s entire system has failed as black marketing of oxygen cylinders and crucial medicines is rampant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-seize-170-oxygen-concentrators-arrest-4-for-hoarding-101619693623503.html

29-04-2021||Pune||“Chill Baba! Do we have to do all these assignments?”||The post-Covid world is different. But, that’s not why I cook. I cook because I love cooking. Because I like listening to the ingredients talking to each other, watching the chemical reactions, anticipating the transformation of energy, predicting the tastes that will emerge from the combination of ingredients … and the uncertainty of the outcome. Our children love the spectacle, sometimes joining in to help with the washing, sorting and cutting of ingredients, sometimes stirring the pot, or taking one component of the meal right through by themselves. Now this does not happen all the time, because they are children: they love cooking, but not necessarily enough to stop playing Minecraft or abandoning Troll Hunters in the middle of an episode.The last 12 months has forced educators to innovate and one exciting new discovery is that food is a good way to keep children occupied. One can indeed teach a lot of physics, chemistry, design, and art through cooking. But, should one? Apparently yes, and so I find schools incorporating cooking into curriculum. I think someone should ask children what they think of new activities before they introduce them. Our children don’t wait to be asked, they are quite good with dishing out opinions. After the third food assignment in a month, mine decided to have a conversation with me. “Baba, do we have to do all these assignments?”“Why don’t you want to do it?”“It’s stupid stuff. Cutting food photos. Colouring exercises. It’s for babies,” said the youngest who’s in Grade 1 and cooks fish curry from scratch. “Writing a recipe for Szchewan stir-fry noodles is a waste of my time. If they want to know if I can cook, they should ask me to make it,” piped our fourth grader.“I am supposed to create a ‘healthy’ menu and they have told us what is healthy and what isn’t. You cannot construct a menu with stereotypes,” said our eldest who’s in Grade 8.“I thought you guys liked cooking.”“We enjoy cooking because we cook with you guys. We learn how to use a knife, how to cut quarters and cubes, to stir, to watch for how food changes during cooking, how to wash ingredients properly, the feel … it’s exciting. Writing random recipes for a task, or giving my opinion on a food topic, or using food items for science experiments - that doesn’t teach me anything, except wasting food and how to keep my mouth shut and getting it done to get a grade,” the eldest stated his case.Makes perfect sense to me. Learning is an intuitive, individual, internal journey. Forcing an external context is what takes the learning out of the learning experience. And what kind of example would I set as a parent by asking them to do things for the sake of doing it? Yep, the post-Covid world is a different world, but the rules of engagement with children are still the same. It starts exactly where it always has: talking with and listening to them. Now all this wisdom didn’t just come to me. I had to work for it. And since all my work wasn’t amounting to much, my kids told me: “You have to listen to us, don’t just pretend to pay attention and nod your head, and then tell us we have to do the assignments anyway!”I think often times I tend to forget that they are children. And yes children are resilient, but do I have to test that resilience every hour, every day? To be honest, I had initially thought it was great that the school was introducing some food … till I saw the assignments. I get it. It’s difficult for everyone. But, children are children and it’s much more difficult for them. The last thing they need is for us to pass on our difficulties, or lack of ideas on to them and make it impossible for them to be children. In the end, it was what our fourth grader said to me: “I am a kid. I am going to play. Why do you want me to work hard at everything like you do? Chill a little Baba.”I am going to print that.

29-04-2021||Other||Thane hospital fire: Local youths save 9 patients||A group of 10-12 men, up early on Wednesday for Ramzan Sehri, helped rescue patients from Prime Criticare Hospital, where a fire broke out, killing four patients. The toll would have been higher if not for these good Samaritans, all in their 20s, breaking open the grilles and glass of the windows at the back of the hospital to rescue at least nine patients. They also carried 30 unused oxygen cylinders away from the site, so as to avert any explosion.The men live in three chawls — Dongre, Parkar and Jahur —surrounding the hospital in Rashid Compound. Farhan Ansari, 29, an advocate, said, “I was up for Sehri, when around 3.45am I heard few women shouting. I opened the window and saw flames rising from the building. I thought some house is on fire and alerted few others in my chawl and we rushed to the spot without a second thought. When we reached, the entire hospital was engulfed in fire, the entrance was in flames and the patients could not escape.” The group decided to go to the back of the hospital. He added, “There was a window with grilles at the back of the hospital. We saw patients crying for help from this window. We decided to try and break open the window, which was difficult as we tried different tools, but managed it after several attempts. We asked for a digging bar from one of our neighbours and using the iron rod, pulled the grille out. We also broke the glass using the same rod. We saw a nurse and asked her how many patients are there inside. She told us the hospital was almost full.” Some of them climbed inside. Mohsin Shaikh, 27, another resident, said, “There were patients from all age groups, some of them were in ICU and critical. The smoke from the fire was suffocating them. We started shifting them on stretchers and took them to the ambulance to be shifted to different hospitals.” Shaikh added that while rescuing, they saw over 30 oxygen cylinders, which they decided to move away from the hospital. “We carried them on our back and outside the hospital to safety.” Ansari added that the fire brigade, too, had reached the spot by the time they rescued a few of the patients from the window side. Insurance advisor, Sayyed Rehan, 50, a patient who was rescued from the window, said, “I was admitted in the general ward on April 22 for pneumonia. On Wednesday morning, my son had gone for Sehri, while I was sleeping. I woke up due to the commotion and saw smoke in the entire room. I tried to run, but the door was jammed, when I saw few people at the window. For almost 10-15 minutes, they were trying to break the window. They managed to raise the grille and those of us who could walk, crawled from the space. If not for these men, I would have not survived.” He was shifted to Bilal Hospital in Mumbra.(Inputs by Faisal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-hospital-fire-local-youths-save-9-patients-101619692721837.html
29-04-2021||Other||High Court quashes 8 allotments of JMC flats in Jammu’s posh Gandhi Nagar||Acting upon a PIL, a division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court comprising Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Rajnesh Oswal on Wednesday quashed eight allotments as well as consequential rent deeds made by the Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) in respect of municipal flats situated at posh Gandhi Nagar locality in Jammu city. The bench observed, “We have reached an un-escapable conclusion that impugned allotments are illegal and contrary to the principle of equality as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India.” The division bench directed the allottees to vacate the premises under their occupation within a period of six months from the date of this order. The division bench also directed that so far as 587 municipal shops, 191 flats and 30 garages are concerned, the UT government and Municipal Corporation Jammu are directed to examine the individual cases and proceed in accordance with the law laid down by the apex court in numerous decisions mentioned in this judgment and take appropriate action within a period of six months, extendable by another period of six months only. The beneficiaries of the JMC flats include Jeet Lal Gupta (IAS), former commissioner secretary, housing and urban development department; RS Jamwal (KAS) former joint commissioner of Jammu Municipal Corporation, Madan Mohan Khajuria, former PA to commissioner JMC; Narender Sharma president of an NGO ‘PEACE’; Surinder Kumar, PSO to former commissioner secretary housing and urban development department; two drivers Balbir Singh and Bharat Bhushan besides two others Chain Singh and Khairati Lal. The PIL was filed by a practising lawyer Irtiza Mushtaq Salaria, who had challenged eight allotments of prime municipal flats situated at posh Gandhi Nagar area. After hearing advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed for the petitioner and senior AAG SS Nanda for the housing and urban development department, the division bench referred to several judgments of the apex court. Advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed vehemently argued that in absence of any policy, the Municipal Corporation has adopted a pick and choose a policy in allotting the flats and quarters to the blue-eyed persons and the Municipal assets being a public property could not have been distributed in a manner as has been done by the JMC. “Rather the allotments were required to be made via auction only, so as to enable the wider participation of the common public in so far as allotments to private persons are concerned,” he argued. He also vociferously argued that in the posh area of Gandhi Nagar, the JMC has allotted a flat to former commissioner secretary, Jeet Lal Gupta at a nominal rent of ₹990/- per month for a period of 40 years and similarly a cattle pond at Gandhi Nagar in Jammu was converted into flat after making a renovation and repair to the tune of ₹35 lakhs and thereafter it was allotted to former joint commissioner of JMC RS Jamwal at a modest rent. The attention of the bench was also drawn towards 587 shops, 191 flats and 30 garages which have also been allotted in a fishy manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-quashes-8-allotments-of-jmc-flats-in-jammu-s-posh-gandhi-nagar-101619692302310.html

Even if the decision is regarding health, education, agriculture, forest and transport, all state subjects, the city would need to take into consideration the L-G's take on it, before passing it.Also Read: Law giving more power to Delhi L-G now in force"The objective of the Amendment is to make it more relevant to the needs of the Capital; further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lt.

29-04-2021||Patna||Bihar oxygen crisis: Hospitals lack cryogenic tanks, not enough tankers to lift Central allotment||Bihar’s capital city, Patna, is among the few towns in the country with four medical college hospitals, besides hundreds of private nursing homes and other hospitals. However, amid the surge in Covid-19 patients, only three of such health facilities have cryogenic storage tank – a basic requirement for big hospitals, a central government report has found. As a result, full utilisation of hospital beds is not happening due to lack of oxygen supply, the report submitted to the Patna High Court. According to the report, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Patna), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital, and a private Paras Hospital in Patna have a cryogenic storage tank each for oxygen. Even old and big hospitals like PMCH, IGIMS and the state’s first dedicated Covid-19 hospital NMCH don’t have the facility. Creating new facilities will take time, the report added. The government’s announcement to convert Medanta-Jai Prabha Hospital, which has come up on the government land, into a Covid hospital has also remained a non-starter. The bench of Justice Charadhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was informed that Medianta did not have an oxygen supply facility at present, and it could at best ensure a 50-bed-facility. The facility created for Covid-19 patients at the Pataliputra Sports Complex also remains unused. The report stated that the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) has 1750 beds but nearly 1,000 remained unused for want of oxygen, while Bihar was unable to lift its full quota of 194 mt of oxygen allocated by the Centre. In fact, Bihar has hardly lifted around 100 mt of oxygen allocated under the central quota, as it does not have tankers. At PMCH, just 450 beds out of 1750 are used for Covid-19 patients, while 50 are reserved for staff who may get infected and 250 for other ailments.With most of the hospitals dependent on oxygen cylinders for the supply, the issue of hoarding and black-marketing also came up before the bench. Some of the voluntary organisations also said they need oxygen as they have cylinders to supply to the needy. The three-member technical team had been constituted by the Centre on the directive of the Patna HC to examine the facilities available at the hospitals in Patna. The team was headed by Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS, Patna. Two days ago, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) wrote to chief minister Nitish Kumar about the selective supply of oxygen to some big private hospitals and said that lack of oxygen supply could force closure of around 90 private hospitals in the city, causing risk to the lives of admitted Covid and non-Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-oxygen-crisis-hospitals-lack-cryogenic-tanks-not-enough-tankers-to-lift-central-allotment-101619691762740.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi child rights body reaches out to kids who lost parents to Covid||Children in Delhi who lost their entire families, or even their caregivers, to Covid have help at hand. The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) is now taking steps to assist children who lost their parents to the disease or are left with no caregivers in the wake of hospitalisation of either one or both of their parents.Commission chairperson, Anurag Kundu, has reached out on social media, appealing to people to call on their helpline number and report cases where children need essential supplies, have lost their parent/s, or are struggling to support themselves due to the illness.“If you know of any child who is in need of essential supplies, has lost the parent/struggling to support because of illness Report @ +91-9311551393. Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights shall intervene in [less than] <24 hours,” Kundu tweeted Thursday.Officials at DCPCR said that the commission is working with several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to care for these children in terms of food, medical benefits, and other needs along with providing counselling for them. For instance, NGO Protsahan, which works for children, has offered grief and trauma counselling for frontline workers and their children.Also Read | Delhi doesn’t have sufficient vaccine doses for 18-44 age group: Health ministerThe commission got an SOS call about three children in Rohini, all aged below 10, living with their grandmother after their father died of Covid and mother was hospitalised to treat the infection. Volunteer groups provided essential supplies in response to SOS call on social media. However, they pointed out that their grandmother was “very old to feed and manage them.” Kundu instructed his team to “make sure the children have all medical help, food and make sure to daily check-in on them for at least the next 15 days. Also, see if the children can talk to their mother over the phone.”In most cases, the commission is making efforts to keep the child with the family instead of opting for institutional care – which is often chosen as the last resort. DCPCR chairperson responds to various SOS messages on childcare on social media ensuring help reaches the children.Sonal Kapoor, founder of Protsahan, said the most important thing is to work on closure for these children. “We aren’t taught how to deal with emotions involving grief, trauma, and death. A lot of adults, including caregivers and NGOs, are also in denial and children too struggle to process these emotions. The challenge is to establish a routine in the child’s life. While government agencies can put children in shelter homes and provide essentials, focus should also be on psycho-social needs on grief and trauma healing,” she said.Retired IPS officer Amod Kanth, founder of NGO Prayas, said, “We have such children in our shelter homes and have been providing them with all modes of assistance. We are also offering space to those children who may not have isolation facilities at their homes and need space. Anyone can get in touch with us through the child helpline number 1098.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-child-rights-body-reaches-out-to-kids-who-lost-parents-to-covid-101619688162398.html
29-04-2021||Bhopal||'Criminal negligence': Kamal Nath accuses MP govt of mismanaging Covid crisis||Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday accused the BJP government in the state of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis and termed it as "criminal negligence" on part of the administration.Talking to reporters here, the senior Congress leader also alleged under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths in MP.The state government has denied such allegations.Nath claimed hospitals in the state have no beds, injections, oxygen, medicines and ambulances."I want to know from Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan about a single hospital where all these facilities are available. It is total criminal negligence," Nath said.The state government should have taken note of the second wave of Covid-19 in advance, but it failed to gauge the situation, he said.He also claimed the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in the state was being hidden and that the figures were much higher than the official statistics.MP Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday denied that there was underreporting of Covid-19 deaths in the state.Kamal Nath said during his interaction with Congress district presidents, he was told the coronavirus had entered villages and no testing facilities were available there."The tests are not being conducted and even if they are done, then the reports are not being declared even in three days. By that time, there is a chance of such people spreading the infection among others," he said.Nath also alleged that Remdesivir injections (key anti-viral drug) were being given by BJP leaders "to their own people", instead of members of the general public suffering from Covid-19.Even vaccines are not available in the state and people are facing lot of problems in getting the jabs despite the state government making "tall claims" about it, he said.Government officials should be sent to oxygen plants and drug manufacturers to get these essential medical supplies for the people, but "principal secretaries were sitting in Bhopal and doing nothing", he said."The mismanagement has been criticised in the international media across the world...the government should focus on managing the crisis instead of managing headlines in the media," Nath said.On Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh reported 12,758 fresh cases of coronavirus, taking the infection count to 5,38,165, while 105 deaths pushed the state's fatality count to 5,424, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/criminal-negligence-kamal-nath-accuses-mp-govt-of-mismanaging-covid-crisis-101619686709059.html

We have requested the companies to provide it,” Jain told reporters when asked if there were enough vaccines available for the 18-44 age group."We will tell you in a day or two,” he replied to another query about starting the inoculation drive for this category on May 1.He also said that the manufactures are yet to provide a schedule of vaccine supply to the Delhi government.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday had said that everybody aged above 18 would be administered anti-coronavirus vaccines free of cost in Delhi.He had said his government had approved the procurement of 1.34 crore vaccine doses from various manufacturers.Jain ascribed the dip in the number of testing over the few days to the restricted movement of people due to the lockdown.Health authorities in the capital have been conducting around 75,000 tests a day over the last few days. Before that, the average number of tests was around 1 lakh.Also Watch| 'Delhi doesn't have sufficient doses for phase 3 vaccination': Health ministerOn the opposition's claim about a big difference in data related to deaths compiled at crematoriums and that released by the Delhi government, Jain, said, “This is not the time to play politics.

Everything is being done in a transparent manner in Delhi,” he added.The minister said there were a few discrepancies in the health bulletin issued on Wednesday night and these have been rectified.Delhi recorded 368 more Covid-19 deaths and 25,986 cases with a positivity rate of 31.76 per cent, according to the latest bulletin issued by the city health department.This was the seventh day on the trot that Delhi had recorded over 300 deaths due to coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-doesn-t-have-sufficient-vaccine-doses-for-18-44-age-group-health-minister-101619686090026.html
29-04-2021||Other||Good Samaritans come to the rescue of Covid-19 patients in Odisha||One in every two calls that young Sikh businessman Satbir Singh receives these days pertains to oxygen cylinders. For Bhubaneswar-based Singh, who started Sikh Aid, a non-profit organisation last year, the day starts with people calling up for oxygen and ends with lugging filled oxygen cylinders till late evening.“While I feel happy taking cylinders to people who need it most, I don’t like when we have to say no to people as there not enough cylinders available. We have very few cylinders and I am unable to get any new ones due to restrictions imposed by the government. My team and I are trying my best,” said Singh. With Covid-19 cases escalating in Bhubaneswar, the demand for oxygen cylinders has gone up in the last fortnight.“We have provided at least 60 cylinders in last fortnight,” said Singh, whose fellow volunteers have pooled in money to buy cylinders, fill them and provide them at the doorsteps of Covid-19 patients who need them. Sikh Aid members are also sending cooked meals to many patients who are living alone.Like Singh, several good samaritans in Odisha are trying their best to provide help to Covid-19 patients, particularly a large number of patients who are in home isolation. Of the 55,000-odd positive patients, more than 40,000 are in home isolation who would need lunch and dinner at their homes. As Covid-19 cases surge in Odisha, several organisations, like Sikh Aid, are providing free lunch, dinner to Covid-19 patients while others are donating oxygen cylinders, masks and medicines to the patients.In Rourkela, journalist Sanjiv Mohapatra and his family have been sending cooked lunch and dinners to families for the last three days. Rourkela municipal area has been the worst-hit in Sundargarh district that currently has a TPR of 43. With close to 700 positive patients in Rourkela, Mohapatra said he has been getting several calls from many Covid-19 positive patients for dinner and lunch.“Many of the patients are senior citizens whose children live abroad. After they tested positive, they are unable to go to the kitchen. There are also many single parents who also require meals and we are sending them food. On average, we are sending 170 meals every day,” said Mohapatra, who wants to carry on the free meal scheme for at least a month.In Bhubaneswar, where there are around 6,500 active Covid-19 cases, the So Am I (SAI) Foundation Trust and FICCI FLO have jointly started free lunch and dinner services for Covid-19 patients under home isolation and attendants of patients admitted in government-sponsored hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. For the past two days, Vandana Gupta from the SAI Foundation Trust has been sending 200 vegetarian lunch and dinner packets to senior citizens, small families as well as single parents who have tested positive.“We have tied up with Pick Up Ninja to deliver hot lunch parcels at their doorsteps by 1.30 pm and dinner packets by 9.30 pm in the BMC area. Our volunteers will deliver in Cuttack and distribute food to the attendants of the patients across different hospitals. We are planning to provide food as long as the cases surge,” said Gupta.The Narula family in Bhubaneswar runs vegetarian restaurants and is known for its special kulfis. The family has started a similar home delivery service of free lunch and dinner for Covid-19 patients. Nitesh Narula, who is looking after the home delivery, said as of now they are providing vegetarian meals to 200 people in Bhubaneswar. “Delivery is still an issue. We are in talks with delivery agencies like Rapido and then we can scale up. We are prepared to provide food to as many people as we can for the next few months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/good-samaritans-come-to-the-rescue-of-covid-19-patients-in-odisha-101619686482335.html

We are not entertaining it (PIL) as the apex court has fairly covered it," the court said.The HC also said the pricing of Covid-19 vaccines is a universal issue that concerns the whole nation and hence, the petitioners should approach the Supreme Court.Advocate Shukla agreed and said the petition would be withdrawn.The PIL, filed on April 24, said the Covid-19 vaccine is presumed to be an essential commodity and hence, its management and distribution cannot be left in the hands of private companies."These pharma giants are milking the fear psychosis of the increased death rates due to COVID-19," it said.Under the third phase of the national vaccination drive commencing next month, the vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the central government and would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open market, the government had said."In a situation where the entire country is gripped with the Covid-19 pandemic, price control by the government is a must and such kind of loot and blackmail should not be permitted," the PIL said.The petition further said the Serum Institute of India (SII) was selling its 'Covishield' vaccine at ₹150 (plus GST) per dose to the Centre, ₹400 to state governments and ₹600 to private hospitals.On Wednesday, the SII announced that it would reduce the price of its vaccine from ₹400 to ₹300 per dose to the state governments.The Bharat Biotech has fixed the rate of its vaccine, 'Covaxin', at ₹600 for state governments and ₹1,200 for private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-hear-plea-seeking-uniform-price-of-covid-19-vaccines-101619681930562.html
29-04-2021||Chandigarh||Move to make Bathinda cancer hospital Covid centre opposed||With the Punjab government deciding to convert the Bathinda-based Advanced Cancer Institute (ACI) into a 75-bedded Covid care facility, the line of treatment for scores of cancer patients is likely to be hit. ACI medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora said on Thursday that the institute has started making arrangements to house level 2 Covid patients or those who need oxygen support. Also read: Govt allows import of medical equipment like oxygen devices, O2 concentratorsHe agreed that the ACI should not be used to treat both cancer and Covid patients in the same building due to the highly infectious coronavirus. “Cancer surgeries are already suspended for the past two days and now we may have to shelve other treatments as well. At present, we do not have any alternative venue to treat cancer patients. ACI offers affordable treatment to cancer patients,” Arora said. Institute caters to 500 cancer patients daily Health activists and families of those suffering from cancer have objected to suspending all operations for fear of Covid infection. According to sources, ACI caters to 500 cancer patients daily. Unlike, other illnesses, any delay may cost life or quality of life to those battling the disease. “On an average 100 patients undergo chemotherapy and almost a similar number need radiotherapy treatment every day. The daily footfall at the outdoor patient department (OPD) is 300. The institute performs about 3-5 surgeries per day,” says a hospital staff member, requesting anonymity. ACI is a constituent of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, and caters to cancer patients from Bathinda and adjoining districts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Low immunity of cancer patients a concern Medical experts say cancer patients maintain low immunity due to the disease and treatments. Association of Physicians of India (Malwa chapter) president Dr Vitull K Gupta said the cancer patients should not be exposed to the virus that is highly contagious. “The state authorities should take over any public complex in Bathinda, including schools, colleges or the Maharaja Ranjit Singh University Technical University, to treat Covid patients. Covid-19 protocol demands oxygen support to such patients and additional beds can be made available even in stationary railway compartments,” said Gupta. A local resident said treatment in the private sector is beyond the reach of most of the patients enrolled at ACI. “In April last year, the state authorities had to withdraw a similar decision after hospital staff, including doctors and attendants of cancer patients, had protested against moving Covid-19 patients to ACI. State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who represents Bathinda, should intervene and ensure ACI is not used as a Covid care centre,” said a cancer patient’s husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/move-to-make-bathinda-cancer-hospital-covid-centre-opposed-101619681621897.html
29-04-2021||Other||Odisha planning 7-day lockdown in Bhubaneswar, western districts amid high TPR||Odisha government is planning to impose a lockdown for at least a week in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and several western districts later this week as the state reported a single-day surge of 8,386 cases and a high test positivity rate of nearly 20 per cent, officials said.Director of health services, Bijay Mohapatra, said community transmission is one of the reasons behind the spike. “The number of cases in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack is increasing as many people are coming to the city from different places. One person can infect many others. As there are many returnees in the Bhubaneswar and Cuttack from outside the state, the number of cases is increasing in the two places. One positive person is infecting multiple persons. Hence the cases are increasing,” he said.Mohapatra said the state government is monitoring the situation daily and accordingly increasing the number of beds when and wherever it is required.Senior state government officials said lockdown in the state capital, as well as nearby Cuttack and western districts like Kalahandi, Nuapara, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Sundargarh and Nabarangpur, seemed to be the only way out as weekend shutdown since last week has not helped in bringing down the TPR. While the rise of TPR of 1.5 on April 1 to 19.7 on April 27 has been swift, in western districts it has been staggering.Kalahandi on Wednesday reported 55.7 TPR while Sundargarh reported a TPR of 42.64. Sambalpur had a TPR close to 40 while Bhubaneswar’s was around 20.Noted neurosurgeon and former director of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Dr Ashok Mohapatra, said gatherings at vegetable, fish markets and liquor shops are the main reason behind the exponential rise in cases. “New strategies are need of the hour,” he said. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation on Wednesday sealed the city’s busy market building for 48 hours as people were not following Covid appropriate behaviours.“Social distancing is being blatantly violated here. Many people are roaming freely without masks and there are no systematic arrangements at shops here to avoid crowding. We are amid a pandemic, we can never beat the virus if the safety protocols are flouted in such a manner. Therefore, we were forced to seal the market area for 48 hours,” said BMC Additional Commissioner, Laxmikant Sethi.As Covid-19 cases continued to surge in Odisha there has been a mad rush for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, injections and medicines with the health infrastructure in the state almost stretched to its limit.Though health officials said Odisha has now over 31,471 beds in Covid care centres, as well as dedicated Covid hospitals with oxygen facilities available in 17495 beds, in Bhubaneswar, Covid patients were running from pillar to post in getting themselves admitted in various hospitals. Covid hospitals run by SUM, AMRI, Apollo, CARE as well as other hospitals reported full occupancy. Many were seen posting messages on Twitter, seeking beds and oxygen cylinders for their kith and kin.Bhubaneswar Municipal Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary said steps are being taken to augment the capacity at Covid hospitals by 3,000 more beds in the next 10 days. “Of the present capacity of around 3,000 beds at the Covid hospitals, 50% beds are occupied. However, in view of the relentless surge, the city’s bed capacity will be increased to 6,000 in the next 10 days to meet the demand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-planning-7-day-lockdown-in-bhubaneswar-western-districts-amid-high-tpr-101619680841772.html

This comes a day after Thackeray announced that the state has decided to vaccinate citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 against the coronavirus disease free of cost in government-run hospitals.Interacting with reporters, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the state will cover 5.71 crore citizens from this age group and it would cost ₹6,500 crore to the government.Tope, however, said the vaccination drive beginning May 1 cannot be launched in the state due to unavailability of sufficient number of vaccine doses. But the state government plans to vaccinate the citizens in the next six months in a planned manner, he added.Tope stated that people in the age group of 18 to 44 years will receive free vaccines at state-run centres, but they will have to pay for the jabs at private facilities."We are all eager to know whether the vaccination will start from May 1.

29-04-2021||Patna||In Bihar, one vice-chancellor holds charge of four universities||One vice-chancellor (VC) holding charge of four universities may not appear feasible to many but is a reality in Bihar. On Wednesday, Lalit Narayan Mishra University’s (Darbhanga) VC Professor Surendra Pratap Singh was given charge of one more university – Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), Patna - to take the total number of universities under his charge to four, HT has learnt.“I am a performer. At Pataliputra University, I did what was not done in the last two-and-half years. As long as the additional charge is there, I will discharge my duties with full devotion,” he said after taking charge at AKU. The post at AKU fell vacant after pro-VC SM Karim, who was officiating as the acting VC by the Raj Bhawan, was reportedly asked to resign over the controversy surrounding the continuance Rajiv Ranjan as the registrar. Karim tendered his resignation after accepting Ranjan’s resignation. The Raj Bhawan issued the notification Wednesday, accepting Karim’s resignation as acting VC and handed over additional charge to SP Singh. The registrar at AKU is also under additional charge from another university. AKU was set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella. It has been without a regular VC since September 20, 2020, when the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Since then, Karim had been holding the additional charge of VC. Earlier, Bihar Raj Bhawan had also given SP Singh the additional charge of Pataliputra University and Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University in Patna in addition to LNMU to make it four. Besides Singh, TM Bhagalpur University VC Neelima Gupta is also holding the additional charge of Munger University, while BRA Bihar University VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey holds the additional charge of Nalanda Open University (NOU). This is not the first time when any VC has been given charge of up to four universities in Bihar. It also happened during the time of former Bihar Governor late Devanand Konwar when the government and the Raj Bhawan were at loggerheads over the appointment of VCs and the matter landed up in the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, in view of the pandemic, the vice-chancellors of LNMU and TMBU have moved a proposal to the Raj Bhawan for advancing the summer vacation in universities to May. Earlier, Patna University teachers association and employees association had also approached the VC for it.

Surface winds are moderate and southwesterly. Satellite fire data indicate effective fire counts have increased and are touching around 1100 which are mainly wheat crop burning in the Northern part of India. Model trajectory and transport-level wind direction are favourable for fire-related intrusion leading to the deterioration of air quality in Delhi. SAFAR Model forecast that dust emissions from the dry arid region of Rajasthan are likely on 29th and 30th April. Hence, AQI is likely to stay in the very poor to poor category for the next three days where external transport would be the dominating factor from the two fronts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/partly-cloudy-sky-today-delhi-aqi-improves-slightly-to-be-in-poor-category-101619665661372.html

29-04-2021||Mumbai||CBI records statement of IPS officer in Anil Deskhmukh graft case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has recorded senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla’s statement in connection with the probe into the corruption allegation by former police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.Confirming the development, a senior officer in the central agency said Shukla’s statement was recorded in Hyderabad by a CBI team related to the case on April 21.Earlier, the CBI had recorded the statement of Deshmukh and his two personal assistants (PAs), Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde. The agency also recorded the statement of suspended cop Sachin Vaze and two of his drivers among several others in connection with the case.Meanwhile, Shukla failed to turn up at the cyber department of Mumbai Police on Wednesday for questioning in connection with the alleged illegal phone tapping case.The IPS officer, who is presently posted in Hyderabad on Central Reserve Police force (CRPF) deputation, was asked to appear before assistant commissioner of police (Cyber) Nitin Jadhav.Citing the Covid-19 pandemic and her present responsibility in CRPF, Shukla, in an email, told cyber police that she will not be able to appear for the probe and requested that a list of questions be instead sent to her to avoid any delay.An FIR was registered under the Official Secrets Act at the BKC cyber police station against unidentified persons for allegedly tapping phones illegally and leaking certain confidential documents on the complaint filed by the State Intelligence Department.The FIR also invoked section 30 of the Indian Telegraph Act and section 43(B) of the Information Technology Act.The alleged tapping of phones had taken place when Shukla headed the Maharashtra intelligence department.BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had cited a letter purportedly written by Shukla to the then Director General of Police about alleged corruption in police transfers. The letter also had details of intercepted calls, leading to an uproar with leaders of the Shiv Sena-led ruling coalition alleging that Shukla tapped phones without permission.Before registration of the FIR, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte had alleged in a report submitted to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that it appears that Shukla herself had leaked the confidential report (to Fadnavis).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-records-statement-of-ips-officer-in-anil-deskhmukh-graft-case-101619656324749.html

Her son, also under quarantine, tried to get help from his neighbours but to no avail. His wife earlier tested positive for Covid and was in hospital for the last two weeks. At 1am on Tuesday, the man lost his father too.At around 9am, a call to the police control room was made. After several hours, a hearse was arranged to ferry the bodies to the crematorium at Nigam Bodh Ghat. The bodies were cremated observing all Covid protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-in-home-isolation-cops-cremate-parents-101619655616979.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||'100 bodies per day': Long wait for last rites as fatalities rise in Delhi||Around 8am on Wednesday, Munna, a worker at the Ghazipur crematorium, had already helped facilitate 18 cremations while 30 more bodies were awaiting at the entrance for their turn. Some of the bodies had been queued up since Tuesday night.“The bodies either lie outside or in the ambulances for many hours. Nowadays, with the soaring heat, it’s very hard working in PPE kits with two layers of masks,” Munna said.On Wednesday, HT contacted at least six big crematoriums dedicated to Covid-19 victims in the national capital. The waiting time was between 18-26 hours in each of these facilities. The soaring mercury levels in the city are making matters worse. On Wednesday, Delhi’s maximum temperature touched 42.2 degrees Celsius.Since April 20, Delhi has recorded 2,648 deaths till Tuesday evening. Crematoriums and burial sites, which received 20-30 bodies, are now getting over 100 bodies per day.Senior officials of the three municipal corporations in Delhi said they are aware of the problems, but said it was difficult to find an immediate solution.“This time, many patients died because of lung infections and infected bodies anyway tend to decompose faster even if you keep them under ideal conditions. We cannot help much here. We can cremate a body after the ones on the pyres are fully burnt and the pyre is sufficiently cool,” said Krishna Prasad, a manager at the Nigambodh Ghat crematorium.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash agreed that while arrangements are being made for the relatives accompanying the dead bodies, there was no provision to prevent the bodies from starting to decompose. “These facilities cannot be arranged overnight. While we are trying our best to keep up with the rising Covid deaths, we are not receiving any help from the Delhi government,” said Prakash.Crematorium staff also said the shortage of space was a major factor behind the wait at these facilities, and limited manpower also slowed the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/100-bodies-per-day-long-wait-for-last-rites-as-fatalities-rise-in-delhi-101619655397401.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||As Covid-19 claims teachers’ lives, Delhi’s classrooms altered forever||\Several educational institutions in the national capital have lost staff members to Covid-19 during the fourth wave, which has left over 2,731 dead in the past seven days alone, forcing many schools to inform students about the deaths of their teachers, while leaving institutions to contend with a vital question — how much will classrooms change in the aftermath of the pandemic?A Delhi government school body said at least 15 teachers died of the viral infection last week alone. Among them was VK Arora (54), who taught commerce at Sarvodaya Co-ed in Mansarovar Garden. Colleagues termed his demise as a “huge loss” for the school, which has endlessly received calls from his students.“He was the staff secretary and was very close to all his colleagues. He was such a lively person. None of us could believe it when we heard about his demise on Monday morning. All of us are in shock. We have received calls from several of his students, and it was extremely difficult to console them. I don’t know how we will face each other without crying when we return to campus once this storm is over,” said his colleague and friend Meenakshi Khantwal.A government school in Rajouri Garden lost 35-year-old Sanskrit guest teacher Anil Kumar to the disease last week.Anmol Kumar (15), one of his students at the school, said: “It’s so difficult to believe that he is gone. I am even more scared about the safety of my parents and other teachers now. I don’t know how many more people will die in this pandemic.”Similarly, several teachers who work at municipal corporation-run schools in Delhi have died during the fourth wave. According to the civic body teachers’ association, at least nine teachers lost their lives last week.Shiv Nath Prasad, the principal of a north civic body-run school in Nithari, died on Wednesday.Suraj Dabas, a teacher at school, said: “Everything will change when we go back to school. There is so much fear and grief among the staff right now.”The infection has claimed several lives in colleges as well.The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) said at least 13 teachers have succumbed to the infection over the past few days.Ravi Bhushan, a psychology teacher at DU’s Aryabhatta College who was in his early 30s, died at a hospital on Monday.Manoj Sinha, the principal of the college, said: “Our college is in shock right now. We organised a virtual condolence meet in his memory on Tuesday, and even non-teaching staff members were inconsolable.”Suraj Kumar, a final-year student at DU’s College of Vocational Studies, said he will never forget his teacher Richa Malhotra’s ever-smiling face. Malhotra, who taught history, passed away on Monday.“She was a mother figure to me. When I came to Delhi, I was very conscious about my rural background. But she made me feel so comfortable. I was not very comfortable with English language, and she helped me a lot. I worked with her on a book club as well. It feels absolutely devastating that she has left us forever,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-covid-19-claims-teachers-lives-delhi-s-classrooms-altered-forever-101619655010230.html
29-04-2021||Noida||Noida Authority to set up 50-bed makeshift Covid hospital by May 8||Amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Noida Authority on Wednesday said it is setting up a makeshift hospital that will have 50 beds with oxygen support for patients and the facility is likely to go functional by May 8.The facility is coming up in the shooting range compound of the stadium in Sector 21A of the city, the Authority said, adding that NGOs and private companies like the Adani Group are chipping in with resources for the initiative.Noida in western Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddh Nagar district is one of the worst-hit places in the state during the Covid-19 pandemic. The district has a death toll of 192 and over 7,000 active cases, official figures showed on Wednesday.“Witnessing the rising crisis of coronavirus, the Noida Authority is setting up a makeshift hospital at the Noida Stadium in Sector 21A. There will be a PSA-based oxygen manufacturing plant with availability of 50 oxygen beds, cylinders and ventilators,” the Authority said in a statement.“There will be trained medical staff for taking care of the patients. This staff will be provided by the support of Delhi-based NGO DFY (Doctors For You). The oxygen manufacturing plant is being set up with support from private companies under their CSR head in which the Adani Group is making key contributions besides others,” it added.According to the Noida Authority, the facility is likely to go functional for public by May 8.The Adani Group is also helping with supplying oxygen to hospitals through the Noida Authority and as part of the effort, the private company would provide 300 D-type cylinders to it, according to the statement.“Of these, 100 oxygen-filled cylinders will be provided to the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration on Thursday morning while 200 empty cylinders would be provided by it to the Noida Authority over the next two-three days for oxygen transportation,” it added.The Authority said oxygen supply to hospitals is being managed by the district administration and as part of its help to in future it will have coordinated efforts with the administration to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply.Over the last few days, some hospitals have allegedly claimed shortage of oxygen supply in the district, resulting in panic among patients and their attendants.Several other people who are not hospitalised have also been claiming difficulties in finding oxygen cylinders and cans for Covid-19 patients whose saturated oxygen levels drop during the deadly infection.The district administration, however, has maintained that it was making efforts to ensure oxygen supply to all hospitals in Noida and Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-to-set-up-50-bed-makeshift-covid-hospital-by-may-8-101619654711599.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Widened vaccinations lead to blood bank shortage fears||With Covid-19 vaccinations for people aged 18-44 set to begin from May 1, blood banks and patients with blood-related disorders said they are concerned about the availability of blood due to rules that disallow an inoculated person from donating blood for 28 days after their jab. As a result, blood banks and non-governmental bodies are asking people to donate blood before getting vaccinated, with lower turnouts — due to the alarming spike and subsequent lockdown — causing reserves to deplete fast.The National Blood Transfusion Council mandates that a person can donate blood 28 days after their last Covid vaccine jab.“There are no blood donation camps, and the number of voluntary donations has also dropped significantly,” said Vanshree Singh, blood bank director, Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS).While the current shortage had made arranging blood difficult for patients of thalassemia and other blood-related illnesses, they worry that the shortages may get more severe once the Covid-19 vaccination programme opens up on Saturday.“Thalassemia patients need fresh blood (donated within a 7 to 10-day period) for transfusion. People aged between 18 and 45 donate blood most frequently. But few people come in for donations, and we worry this number will decrease in the coming days,” said Shobha Tuli, secretary of Thalassemics India.Tuli has written to the Union health ministry, asking it to review the 28-day deferral period. “The rule will result in a shortage of blood and create problems for thalassemia patients. The government should either revise it or give us a plan to maintain the supply of fresh blood for patients who need transfusion regularly,” Tuli said.The Union health ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.Blood banks in Delhi say that though there is no shortage of blood right now, their stocks are rapidly running out.Dr Dinesh Deepak Joshi, president of the Lions Blood Bank, said: “Currently, we are facing a huge problem providing blood to our thalassemia patients from our two banks. We used to get more than 2,000 donations in a month, which has now come down to just 100.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/widened-vaccinations-lead-to-blood-bank-shortage-fears-101619654779494.html

29-04-2021||Delhi||Districts prepare plans to expand shots for all||The Delhi government plans to increase the number of Covid-19 vaccination centres once inoculation opens for the 18-44 age group next month, said senior government officials.A delay in vaccine supply may push the start of the next phase of vaccination from its May 1 schedule, officials aware of the matter said.Although the state government is yet to share details of the plan, the 11 district administrations in Delhi are drawing up strategies to augment the number of vaccination sites and provide adequate staff to run the centres smoothly.Staffing of these centres is the major issue, official said, as many health care and frontline workers are currently down with Covid-19.The chief minister’s office earlier stated that free vaccines will be available in all government-run Covid-19 vaccination centres in Delhi while those who opt for private centres will have to pay for the jabs.Delhi has around 500 vaccination centres in 192 hospitals and dispensaries. A majority of the sites are in government hospitals and while some districts are planning to increase the number of sites in hospitals and dispensaries, others are looking at schools as possible sites.A senior official with the New Delhi district said, “We are in the process of working out the number of new sites that will be needed to ensure a hassle-free vaccination process. We are planning to have dedicated vaccination sites for this group.”The municipal bodies have also made requests to increase the number of their vaccination sites.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said, “We have sent the list of 20 additional centres to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority for approval.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/districts-prepare-plans-to-expand-shots-for-all-101619654636936.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Expedite supply of oxygen and help to those in home isolation: CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday directed officials to expedite the process of scaling up oxygen beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds across the city – the national capital had run out of both on Tuesday – and asked for the home isolation surveillance system to be strengthened.As of Wednesday night, Delhi had 21,014 Covid-19 beds, of which 19,379 are occupied. Also, out of the 4,809 ICU beds in the city, 4,791 are occupied, said the government’s real-time application on hospital beds.Kejriwal issued the directions in a review meeting on Wednesday evening which was also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain and several senior officials. It comes at a time when an acute shortage of oxygen is becoming the major obstruction to the government’s plan to augment beds across hospitals.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal convened a meeting today (Wednesday) with the health officials on the Covid-19 situation in Delhi. In the meeting, the CM deliberated on the plan to increase the number of oxygen beds in the coming days, along with strengthening the home isolation system,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Kejriwal said in a statement, “We have to further strengthen our home isolation system. Every patient who is recovering from Covid in home isolation should receive regular calls from Delhi government doctors and they should be supplied with an oximeter. We have to monitor the daily condition of every patient recovering at home,” he said.On Tuesday, Kejriwal had said by May 10, Delhi will have at least 1,200 more ICU beds --- 500 being prepared at a facility attached to GTB hospital, another 500 at a facility being set up at the Ramlila Maidan in central Delhi which will be attached to Lok Nayak hospital, and 200 ICU beds at the Covid care centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas campus in Chhatarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/expedite-supply-of-oxygen-and-help-to-those-in-home-isolation-cm-kejriwal-101619654415398.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||‘Do you want people to die?’: High Court on medicine rules||The Delhi high court on Wednesday said that it appeared the Union government wanted people to die, pointing out that the new protocol on use of remdesivir said that the drug was to be given only to those on oxygen support. “This is wrong. This is a complete non-application of mind. Now people who do not have oxygen will not get remdesivir either. It appears you want people to die,” justice Prathiba M Singh said after the central government submitted that under the protocol being followed now only patients on oxygen support were being given remdesivir as Covid-19 treatment.The court also said it will consider later whether a medical committee should review if the protocols or guidelines for administering remdesivir need any modification.The court’s observation came during a hearing on a plea by a lawyer who is suffering from Covid-19 and was able to get only three out of the six doses of remdesivir prescribed to him.Give data on testsHearing a separate plea, a Delhi high court bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked the Delhi government to give the number of RT-PCR tests conducted in the last seven days while also asking them to specify why fewer tests were being conducted.The bench took note of a submission made by a lawyer for one of the petitioners, who said that the testing in the city has gone down. The petitioner said the time taken for certification and testing has to be brought down where the reasons cited by the labs are either “backlog” or “push down from the government”. The court asked the Delhi government to provide the details while noting that the testing staffs of various labs are infected with Covid-19.The bench was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.Black marketing of medicinesThe court also took note of the black marketing of essential medicines and remdesvir injections, and directed the Delhi government to come up with an online portal displaying live information on the supply chain of such drugs.The bench also asked senior advocate Rahul Mehra, who represented Delhi government, to look into the suggestion if the mohalla clinics could also serve people while also examining the use of old DTC buses for the ferrying of dead bodies so that the ambulances could be used for the sick persons.Ensuring oxygen supplyMehra, during the hearing, informed the court that the government passed an order on Wednesday that each hospital has been linked with a refiller and also a link refiller, so that if the primary one is not available, the SOS calls of oxygen are met.The court said that order should be widely communicated and necessary instructions should be followed by all the stakeholders.Approve insurance claims soonerDuring the proceedings, the court directed the insurance companies and third-party administrators (TPA) to ensure that time taken to grant approvals to bills was reduced to a reasonable amount as there were long queues of people outside hospitals waiting for beds during the massive surge in Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/do-you-want-people-to-die-high-court-on-medicine-rules-101619654208383.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Law giving more power to Delhi L-G now in force||A month after Parliament passed a controversial bill giving sweeping powers to Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor (LG), the Centre on Wednesday notified a law that makes his prior opinion a must before every executive action by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, and every legislative action by the state assembly.An order by the LG’s office on Wednesday evening -- hours after the amended Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 was notified -- said that matters on which his opinion will have to be obtained include those falling under any law with respect to any matter in the state or concurrent lists. It also mentioned “subordinate legislations i.e. rules, regulations, schemes, bylaws”, and establishment, constitution or reconstitution of statutory bodies such as authorities, boards, committees, commissions, etc, under laws made by the legislative assembly.“Matters relating to recommendations of the Delhi finance commission” and “grant of parole under the Delhi Prisons Act” were also part of the order. Matters specified under Rule 23 of the Transaction of Business of the Government of NCT were also mentioned.Experts said all files on governance, decisions taken by the cabinet, proposed projects, welfare schemes, etc, will have to be sent to the LG first for his opinion before implementation. Whether the amendment shall mean a concurrence of the LG or will act as a tool to enable the Delhi government take an informed decision is a crucial question that remains unanswered in the text of the amended Act. It will also need a clarification whether the “opinion” rendered by the LG shall be binding or will only have persuasive value.According to the new law, passed by Parliament on March 24, “government” in Delhi now means the LG.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and other opposition parties have criticised the new law, saying it obstructs the functioning of an elected government.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has termed the passage of the bill an “insult” to the people of the national capital. His deputy Manish Sisodia has also attacked the Centre, alleging that it was feeling insecure as Kejriwal was “emerging as an alternative” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Centre has said that the Act promotes “harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court”.Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said in Parliament last month that Delhi is not a full-fledged state and does not have full powers.“Bringing this law was necessary to remove ambiguities because Delhi is a UT (Union Territory) and the powers of L-G are different from state governors,” another official said, asking not to be named.On July 4, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the L-G cannot interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and must act on aid and advice of the council of ministers.The Centre has, however, said the new act seeks to clarify the expression of government in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court.Its amendment has not been challenged in court yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/law-giving-more-power-to-delhi-l-g-now-in-force-101619653101867.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Uncertainty over supply dogs roll-out of jab drive||Even as the government on Wednesday opened up Covid-19 vaccination registrations for those aged between 18 and 44, and jabs scheduled to begin on Saturday, hospitals said they still have no clarity on who will supply the doses for the expanded inoculation drive, while just a few private hospitals in the city said they have been assured of supplies from either of the two vaccine manufacturers in India.Adult beneficiaries in Delhi who were able to register on the CoWIN portal despite the glitches on Day 1 were, however, not able to find any available slots at any of sites.Further, adding to the uncertainty, private hospitals and state officials said the Centre has asked them to return the current stock of vaccines on April 30.“So far, there is no clarity on whether we will receive any more doses from the state government or if we will have to depend on the doses that we purchase ourselves. If it is the latter, we are likely to not have any doses on May 1 to vaccinate even those above 45 who need their second dose,” said an official from one of the major private hospitals in Delhi, asking not to be named.Dr Suneela Garg member of the Lancet Commission Covid India Task force said, “Everything will not happen on Day 1. Delhi has placed an order of 13.4 million, but all the doses will not come together.”Delhi on Monday announced that it will vaccinate its entire adult population for free once the immunisation drive is widened from May 1. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said a purchase of 13.4 million doses has been approved and that his government will make efforts to speed up the process.An official from Fortis hospital said, “We might get some doses from the government at revised rates – whatever the state pays the vaccine manufacturers – after returning the old stock that came from the central government to immunise those above 45.”The hospital in a statement said, “We are in discussions with vaccine manufacturers to understand the availability and are making all necessary preparations to launch vaccinations for 18+ age groups, as soon as vaccines are made available.”Vibhu Talwar, managing director of Moolchand hospital said, “As of now, we do not have any procurement orders. Suppliers haven’t given us any clarity on pricing or when stock will be available. Hopefully, this will be clarified in the next 48 hours.” The hospital just has vaccine stocks for the next two days, officials said.Government hospitals and district officials too are unsure about where the doses will come from and how they are to be distributed. “We haven’t received any communication about what to do with the vaccine doses or whether we will get any additional doses on May 1. We have vaccination centres ready at the hospital. We will immunise people whenever we get the doses,” said a senior administrator from Lok Nayak hospital.A senior district official who asked not to be named said, “We will vaccinate people whenever we get the vaccine doses. But I’m unsure where the doses will come from.”“Only 50% of the production will be picked up by the central government, and the rest is open for sale to states and private players. Nothing is going outside the country, so how can anyone say there will no supplies for states or anyone else,” said a central government official aware of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uncertainty-over-supply-dogs-roll-out-of-jab-drive-101619652197642.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Centre pulled up for oxygen supply deficit||Noting that Delhi has not received its allocated quota of 490 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen even for a single day, the Delhi high court on Wednesday slammed the Centre for not supplying the promised quota, and asked it to work out an allocation plan.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli noted that Delhi has not received the allocated amount of 490 MT oxygen even on a single day --- five days since the court passed an order. The bench observed that the principal reason behind he lag in supply appeared to be the distance between Delhi and the sources of supply in West Bengal and Odisha.“What is the point of allocating 490 MT (oxygen), when they (Delhi) have not got it? Now there are also tankers. We do not have a bureaucratic answer….It is not an efficient way of working out. The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. Things have not improved despite the lapse of five days. We are still hovering around 400 or even less and that amount of 490 MT has still not achieved…This has to be done on an SOS basis. It pains my heart. It should not take five days. Your allocation is bad..We have again and again asked you to work out your allocation plan,” the bench remarked.The court told the Centre that it might look at sources of supply closer to the Capital. “It does not make sense to get something from 1,600km. Maybe you could increase the supply from UP and it could be made as it reduces travel time... This is simple common sense,” the court said, directing the newly appointed amicus curiae advocate Rajshekhar Rao to look into the state wise allocation plan of the Centre and give suggestions to the Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta on this.During the hearing, senior advocate Rahul Mehra who was representing the Delhi government, said one of the major reasons for the shortage of oxygen in Delhi hospitals is the delay supplies from West Bengal and Odisha. He told the court that as on April 27 midnight, the city received a supply of 402MT, whereas there demand was 700 MT.He urged the court that allocation to Delhi may be made from some nearby states. He also cited an instance where his industrialist friends in Rajasthan and Ludhiana were ready to refill 200 oxygen cylinders but the state administration was not allowing this.Reacting sharply to this, justice Palli told the Centre, “People will keep dying and you will not do anything even if you might show on paper. If you have an extra cylinder in some other state, then make it available. No other state is in such a condition now as Delhi is.”Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, told the court that everything possible is being done from their side. He said that all the factors have been taken into account while deciding the allocation plan.During the proceedings, the bench also appealed to the people to not hoard oxygen cylinders and medicines required Covid-19 patients, to avoid creating “artificial scarcity” remarking that “we get what we deserve”.“The nation is facing an unprecedented crisis. It is we the people who need to stand up and showcase our qualities and virtues which all of us….We therefore appeal to the good sense of people to not resort to black marketing or hoarding of either oxygen cylinders or medicines and to make them available to the needy people.“Hoarding of medicines or oxygen cylinders leads to artificial scarcity to an extent which may not be there,” it noted in the order.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who, along with several hospitals, sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-pulled-up-for-oxygen-supply-deficit-101619651876175.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Fewer SOS calls from hospitals, but new Covid patients facing oxygen crisis||SOS calls for medical oxygen have reduced from Delhi’s hospitals over the past two days, with most of them now able to maintain stocks till replenishments arrive, but this has also come at the cost of not being able to offer critical emergency support even if they have beds available for fear of not being able to get the oxygen required to care to a larger pool of patients.With the procurement of more cryogenic tankers to transport liquid oxygen from the central pool, and the creation of more plants in the city to create medical oxygen from ambient air, the situation is likely to stabilise slightly over the week, according to government officials and calculations by HT. Dozens of new oxygen generators are expected to start functioning the Capital, and more tankers are expected to be pressed into service to bring in stocks from large plants in neighbouring states.“The oxygen supplies are still reaching hospitals just a couple of hours before they run out of their stock. However, the coordination has improved. Still, some smaller hospitals in need of filling cylinders are facing challenges,” said a government official who asked not to be named.The situation is an improvement from last week, when hospitals – crushed by an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases – began running out of their medical oxygen supply. The crisis came to light when GTB Hospital, with 500 Covid-19 patients, received its replenishments with minutes to spare in the early hours of April 21.The crisis deepened over the next few days, with the worst of it hitting the Jaipur Golden hospital, where 20 Covid-19 patients died after their oxygen support stopped.The matter reached the courts on multiple occasions, after hospitals exercised all options they had, including by raising alarm on social media. The Union as well as Delhi government were pulled up on several occasions, and have since announced several steps to ease the crisis.“We are working extensively on procuring cylinders, which a lot of the smaller hospitals are facing a shortage of. We are also now working on regulating a lot of the refilling stations. Just like we managed to stabilise the oxygen flow in the main hospitals, we will be able to stabilise them as well in the next few days itself. We are working on fixing this to help smaller hospitals resume oxygen supply as well,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.But while patients already admitted to hospitals may be getting oxygen now, a major problem still persists for new patients who are in need of urgent care.Officials in several hospitals said that new admissions have been halted for now. “The situation is still the same; hospitals are anxious about their oxygen supply. We have had to stop new admissions now because we are not sure when and how much oxygen we will receive,” said an official at one of the biggest private hospitals in Delhi.“The situation is much the same even though a lot has happened on paper. The problem is that the government has directed the oxygen companies to fulfil the quota of oxygen, but the companies refuse to comply. I had received a refill day before and then again today, which was half the promised supply. We have been told that we will get another supply by tonight, but I do not know,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical director of Batra hospital, while adding: ”Of course hospitals will have to restrict admissions if there is no surety of oxygen supply.”An official at another hospital said there was some improvement. “I think the situation is improving slowly, quotas have been fixed and suppliers have been fixed for each hospital by the government. There is still some anxiety and uncertainty; we have experienced this for a week, it will take time for the nerves to settle down. Earlier the distribution was completely haphazard,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director, Saroj hospital and secretary of Delhi Voluntary Hospital’s Forum.Officials and Delhi Police personnel have also launched crackdowns after receiving reports of black marketing and pilfering of oxygen supplies.The Delhi government on Tuesday received five cryogenic tankers from the Centre, which were being fitted on to trucks and pressed into service.The state expects to receive 18 more such tankers from Bangkok, which were scheduled to arrive on Wednesday but got held up due to formalities, according to another government official.A second significant difference is likely to be when 48 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants begin functioning in tranches over the next month. These devices work by drawing oxygen from ambient air and concentrating them to medical grade.According to an official, the generators being installed by the Union government at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (main), Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, Lady Hardinge medical college hospital, AIIMS Jhajjar, Safdarjung Hospital, GTB Hospital and Lok Nayak Hospital are expected to be in place between April 30 and May 10.According to official documents, the eight plants being set up by the Union government have a cumulative capacity of 4,700 litre per minute day, which translates roughly to 10MT of liquid oxygen per day.Among the generators being installed by the Delhi government, two are set to be in place by the first week of May and roughly 19 others by the middle of the month. By the end of April, officials may be better poised to increase critical care capacity, although this will depend on the evolution of the outbreak and if more turn critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fewer-sos-calls-from-hospitals-but-new-covid-patients-facing-oxygen-crisis-101619651640592.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi plans to increase vaccination centres, but supply delays may hit vaccination of 18-44 age group||The Delhi government plans to increase the number of Covid-19 vaccination centres as inoculation opens for the 18-44 age group on May 1, said senior government officials. But a delay in vaccine supply may delay the start of vaccination for this age group, which is a sizeable chunk of Delhi’s 20 crore population, officials in the know of the matter said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said his government had approved the procurement of 1.34 crore [13.4 million] vaccine doses from various manufacturers to boost a massive vaccination drive.Although the state government is yet to share the plan details, the 11 district administrations in Delhi are drawing up strategies to augment the number of vaccination sites and provide adequate staff to run the centres smoothly. Staffing of these centres is the major issue, official said, as many health-care and front-line workers are currently down with Covid-19.The chief minister’s office had earlier stated that free vaccines will be available in all government-run Covid-19 vaccination centres in Delhi while those who opt for private centres will have to pay for the jabs.At present, Delhi has around 500 vaccination centres spread across 192 hospitals and dispensaries. A majority of the vaccination sites are in government hospitals and while some districts are planning to increase the number of sites in hospitals and dispensaries, other districts are looking at school buildings as possible vaccination sites.A senior official with the New Delhi district said on condition of anonymity, “We are in the process of working out the number of new sites that would be needed to ensure a hassle-free vaccination process for the 18-44 age group. We are planning to have dedicated vaccination sites for this group.”Another official said new centres are also needed to ensure that there is not much crowding at the vaccination site.The New Delhi district, which has 80 vaccination sites, is also planning to set up a mega vaccination centre to cater to the rush, as the number of people in this age group will be more, said a senior official there.Senior district officials involved in the identification of the new vaccination sites said a number of new centres are being planned as per the availability of manpower, which is the crucial aspect, as districts are facing a manpower crunch as a lot of health-care and essential service providers are currently down with Covid-19.A north-west Delhi district official said, asking not to be named, “We have identified 16 new sites in government schools. We will scale up the number of vaccination sites later, once we get more manpower, especially vaccinators.”A vaccination site must has five staff members, including a vaccinator. A district magistrate, who did not wish to be named, said, “We will be roping in teachers and civil defence volunteers for data entry and management of observation rooms. But we still need more vaccinators and accordingly, we will increase the number of sites.”The municipal corporations have also sent their request to increase the number of sites to the Delhi government. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “We have sent the list of 20 additional centres to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for approval.”District authorities have to share their plan for new vaccination sites with the health department and the DDMA. A Delhi government official said no decision has been taken so far on whether to open dedicated sites for the 18-44 age group or not.A third senior district official said, also on condition of anonymity, “We are just working out the plan. A final decision regarding new centres has to be taken by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-plans-to-increase-vaccination-centres-but-supply-delays-may-hit-vaccination-of-18-44-age-group-101619647253045.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Two held for fleecing Covid patients desperate for oxygen cylinders||Two businessmen were arrested for allegedly hoarding oxygen cylinders and selling them at exorbitant rates in Delhi to desperate Covid-19 patients and their families, said police on Wednesday.The suspects -- Abhishek Nanda (32) from Shalimar Bagh and Shrey Oberoi (30) from Vikaspuri -- allegedly sold cylinders for ₹50,000 each when their market price was only around ₹6,000 for a 10 litre cylinder, said police.The high profit margin encouraged them to approach people posting SOS messages on social media for oxygen, said police. When informed of the scam, west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh police said they deployed decoy customers to trap the suspects.Four small oxygen cylinders each of 10 litres capacity and one large cylinder of capacity 67litres were seized from the suspects along with a Hyundai Verna car that they allegedly used to transport and deliver cylinders, said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam.DCP (crime) Monika Bhardwaj, also holding the additional charge of DCP (West), said Nanda and Oberoi were originally into the business of electrical equipment and toys, respectively.“Their businesses were hit by the Covid pandemic and the curfew in Delhi that had been imposed for more than a week,” said Monika Bhardwaj. “For quick and easy money, Nanda sold the unused oxygen cylinders that he had arranged for Covid patients in his family.”Soon Nanda saw an opportunity in the scarcity of oxygen cylinders in Delhi-NCR and involved Oberoi in a plan to make a profit, said another police officer associated with the probe but who did not wish to be named.“Nanda’s job was to arrange oxygen cylinders, while Oberoi delivered them to people who he contacted over social media. At least two cylinders that they sold are currently being used to treat Covid patients at different places in Delhi,” said the officer.The officer said the Punjabi Bagh police received information from a credible source about the duo’s operation. Their decoy customer convinced Oberoi to deliver two small cylinders to northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh and agreed to pay ₹1 lakh for both, said the officer. Oberoi was arrested with the cylinders from Shalimar Bagh and his questioning led police to Nanda and recovered of three more oxygen cylinders from him, said the officer.“We are now questioning them for the source of the cylinders. Efforts are on to recover more oxygen cylinders,” added DCP Bhardwaj.On Tuesday, the Delhi Police asked its personnel to activate their intelligence network, keep a close watch on social media posts, visit scrap godowns, and use decoy customers to trap hoarders fleecing Covid patients and their kin. It came on a day when the Delhi high court said the government’s entire system has failed as black marketing of oxygen cylinders and crucial medicines was rampant.“High demand for oxygen, injection, medicine etc; miscreants indulge in hoarding, black marketing, faking to deceive needy buyers. Seven cases registered with arrest of 21 persons and remdesivir, oxygen seized. Delhi Police is checking those cheating on social media to protect public interest,” the Delhi Police tweeted on Tuesday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-for-fleecing-covid-patients-desperate-for-oxygen-cylinders-101619647257009.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||In new pecking order, Delhi L-G to retain law, land||After the Union home ministry notified the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) (Amendment) Act, 2021 on Wednesday, the office of Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) issued an order asking the Delhi government to seek opinion of the L-G before the Cabinet or any of its minister takes any executive action with regard to matters related to land, police, law and order, subordinate legislations, granting of parole, Delhi finance commission, establishment or re-constitution of statutory bodies and matters specified under Rule 23 of the ‘Transaction of Business of the GNCTD Rules, 1993’.The new law passed on by Parliament on March 24 gives sweeping powers to Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor for running day-to-day business of the Capital and almost takes away administrative control from the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led government.Senior officials also said that the notification is going to set new protocols for the Delhi Cabinet and all bureaucrats as the ‘Transaction of Business of the GNCTD Rules, 1993’ are going to be amended for the first time in nearly 20 years.The order issued by the L-G office specified in three points as to which areas the Delhi Cabinet and individual ministers will have to seek prior opinion of L-G Anil Baijal. None of the subjects, however, seemed to be excessively out of the areas over which the L-G already has control.“.... the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, hereby specifies the following matters for obtaining opinion of the L-G....before taking any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the Council of ministers or a minister..” read the order.“The matters falling under any law, made by the Parliament or extended to the national Capital by the Central government, with respect to any matter enumerated in the state list or concurrent list of the seventh schedule of the Constitution,” it stated.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter, but the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said it “really hoped” that the Central government would have waited at least till the current wave of Covid-19 abated to enforce the Act.In a statement, the AAP said, “Delhi is in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis and by notifying this right in the middle of the second wave, it can lead to a lot of chaos. This could definitely adversely affect Covid management in the national Capital.”“Under the leadership of CM Kejriwal, we are working on every possible aspect to tackle the second wave of Covid. The Central government and the Delhi government are working together. But such a notification will bring a lot of confusion and when the work is going on war footing the last thing people can expect is chaos and confusion in the administration,” the AAP said.On Wednesday, even as the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) notified the amended GNCTD Act, Delhi government officials said they were too busy in Covid-19 management to find out about the intricacies of the new law.“Now is not the time for all this. From the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) to the chief minister, everyone is closely monitoring aspects such as oxygen supply to hospitals, Covid-19 deaths, augmentation of beds and so on. Bureaucrats cannot afford to be caught up in politics during such a crisis, everyone knows that. So, what the government is doing to contain Covid is a collective effort and that is what Delhi needs right now,” said one of the top officials of the Delhi government, wishing not to be named.NO IMMEDIATE CHANGESWhile L-G Anil Baijal’s office did not comment on the matter, a senior official in his office said nothing can change on the ground until a fresh set of transaction of business rules (TBR) is issued by the MHA.“For a start, the L-G has scheduled a Covid-19 review meeting tomorrow (Thursday). But, it is not because of this GNCTD Act. He has been holding such meetings from time to time. With regard to the GNCTD Act and what administrative changes it could bring, there is not much that can happen at the moment because there is lack of clarity on certain procedures and subjects where the L-G can have direct control. The MHA is likely to issue amended TBR in a few days after which things would be clearer,” the official said.The key issues which the L-G wants to look into are the low testing numbers, reducing the waiting time at crematoriums and decreasing case fatalities, the official added.However, a section of officers in the Delhi government said the law has already created doubt among several officials with regard to various orders being issued every day to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the city and manage patients better. But they added that an immediate change in the plans was unlikely.“The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) anyway has the L-G as its chairperson, so a major policy or strategy shift in terms of Delhi’s Covid response system is unlikely to happen as the Central government, to whom the L-G reports, is already providing help. More importantly, the Delhi high court is directly monitoring the situation and issuing orders from day to day in this regard,” said a second government official.The current Covid wave has overwhelmed Delhi’s heath care infrastructure with hospitals sending out SOS messages while running out of medical oxygen and almost all beds taken up across hospitals. According to government’s Corona app data, only 18 ICU beds were available in the city at 9pm on Wednesday.A few district officials wondered whether the new law would mean DMs and SDMs now have to send all their orders such as setting up new Covid care facilities by attaching hotels or increasing vaccination.“It is not like that. Only major decisions such as those taken by the Delhi Cabinet led by Kejriwal or individually by the ministers will have to be sent to the L-G, in all likelihood. Otherwise, the L-G’s office, which does not have so much staff, will be inundated with files and getting them back to get the schemes or project moving could take time,” the second official explained.He said the impact of the law on the day to day administration can be gauged only in about a week or two. “There could be increased friction between the legislature, the executive, and the Union government. Delhi has seven ministers, including Kejriwal, and each of them issue dozens of orders/directives daily. The back-and-forth of files will only delay a lot of projects,” the official said.Constitution expert and former secretary of the Lok Sabha and the Delhi assembly SK Sharma said the biggest casualty of the Act is going to be the assembly. “It may well be disbanded in that case as the law now even raises questions over the validity and necessity of having the Question hour in the House. The law will impact the assembly in more way than just taking away the rights of the committees set up by the House,” he said.PDT Achary, former secretary-general of Lok Sabha said Under Art.239AA of the constitution and as per the interpretation given by the Supreme Court the government means the L-G aided and advised by the Council of ministers.“It simply means the executive power is vested in the Council of ministers. This being so the definition contained in the new Act, namely, government means the L-G has no special significance. The Act cannot override the constitution and also the interpretation of law made by the Supreme Court. The executive power is vested in the elected government and therefore, the definition of government given in the Amendment Act has no special significance. The same shall remain in terms of accountability as well,” said Achary.A senior Delhi government official, on condition of anonymity, said the law effectively implies that most of the House panels will become void, and the assembly rules from which these committees have been formed, will also be void. “The public accounts committee, which looks into the accounts of the government and the budgetary allocations, might also go in such a case,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-new-pecking-order-delhi-l-g-to-retain-law-land-101619647268035.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal directs officials to speed up process to add new beds||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday directed officials to expedite the process of scaling up oxygen beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds across the city – the national capital had run out of both on Tuesday – and asked for the home isolation surveillance system to be strengthened.As of Wednesday night, Delhi had 21,014 Covid-19 beds, of which 19,379 are occupied. Also, out of the 4,809 ICU beds in the city, 4,791 are occupied, said the government’s real-time application on hospital beds.Kejriwal issued the directions in a review meeting on Wednesday evening which was also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain and several senior officials. It comes at a time when an acute shortage of oxygen is becoming the major obstruction to the government’s plan to augment beds across hospitals.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal convened a meeting today (Wednesday) with the health officials on the Covid-19 situation in Delhi. In the meeting, the CM deliberated on the plan to increase the number of oxygen beds in the coming days, along with strengthening the home isolation system,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.Kejriwal said in a statement, “We are noticing that this new strain of coronavirus is quite dangerous and often leads to respiratory and breathing issues. It has become very important to provide beds to every patient who needs oxygen. We have to expedite the process to add more ICU and oxygen beds in the coming weeks.”“We have to further strengthen our home isolation system. Every patient who is recovering from Covid in home isolation should receive regular calls from Delhi government doctors and they should be supplied with an oximeter. We have to monitor the daily condition of every patient recovering at home,” he said.On Tuesday, Kejriwal had said by May 10, Delhi will have at least 1,200 more ICU beds --- 500 being prepared at a facility attached to GTB hospital, another 500 at a facility being set up at the Ramlila Maidan in central Delhi which will be attached to Lok Nayak hospital, and 200 ICU beds at the Covid care centre at Radha Soami Satsang campus in Chhatarpur.The number of ward beds and ICU beds across hospitals in the city have increased by a little more than half against the Delhi government’s targets of 4,625 and 1,126, respectively, so far during the ongoing lockdown that was introduced to scale up medical infrastructure in the wake of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi, shows government data tracked by the Hindustan Times.As of Wednesday night, Delhi had 21,014 Covid-19 beds, of which 19,379 are occupied. Also, out of the 4,809 ICU beds in the city, 4,791 are occupied, said the government’s real-time application on hospital beds.Of the 18 vacant ICU beds, five are in a hospital which is reserved for children and women in advanced stages of pregnancy, and nine are in a hospital that is low on oxygen at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-directs-officials-to-speed-up-process-to-add-new-beds-101619647274076.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi High Court seeks response on plea seeking parole of prisoners||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the response of the Centre, the Delhi government and the prison authorities on a plea seeking parole of prisoners involved in non-heinous crimes from three jails in the city in view of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued a notice to the ministries of law and health, the Delhi government, police, office of the Lieutenant Governor and the director general of prisons, seeking their stand on the petition by May 4.Advocate Ajay Verma, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that recently, 190 inmates and 304 prison staff of Tihar jail tested positive for Covid-19 and the infection has spread across the prison.The petitioners-- three lawyers and a law student --have contended that at a time when there is a surge in Covid -19 infection, decongestion of the prisons is necessary as they are filled much beyond their capacity.“That the present total number of inmates as on April 7 is 17,285 as against a total capacity of 10,026 of the three jails -- Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini,” states the petition.Meanwhile, another single bench of the Delhi HC, directed the Delhi government and the prison authority to ensure proper medical supervision of former RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin, who is suffering from Covid-19 and is currently admitted in Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Hospital.Justice Prathiba M Singh said the doctor on duty looking after Covid-19 patients shall monitor Shahabuddin’s health and if required, also consult senior doctors of the hospital.The court also directed that the former RJD MP, serving life sentence for murder, be permitted to speak to a family member twice a day and disposed of his plea seeking protection of his life and monitoring of the treatment being administered to him at DDU Hospital.In his plea, Shahabuddin said he apprehended that he will not get proper treatment as there is a scarcity of oxygen and other medicines in Delhi. He also alleged that he is “apprehending the mismanagement of his health situation at the hands of the doctors at the behest of the opposite political leaders” in Delhi.According to the petition, he was lodged in a cell, in the high risk ward of Tihar Jail, which he was sharing with another inmate.Despite the other inmate testing positive for Covid-19 early April, Shahabuddin was kept in the same cell with the infected inmate and “no separate arrangement was made by the jail authorities,” read the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-seeks-response-on-plea-seeking-parole-of-prisoners-101619647278123.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Fraudsters con people as pleas for help pour in on social media||Rashmi Mehra, a public health professional, came across a phone number in a WhatsApp group on April 24. She had received the number from another acquaintance who had spotted the message on Twitter. The tweet read: “Oxygen cylinders available for all. Contact number- (mentioned number) (Dheeraj) Location: Delhi (Rohini). ‘Available, Just Spoke on call’ (sic)”Mehra passed on the number to her friend, whose father, along with other family members, are down with Covid-19. With the oxygen saturation levels of her friend’s grandmother dipping, oxygen was the need of the hour.“My friend needed an oxygen cylinder for her grandmother. On her behalf, I found a lead. Even though he was charging a lot, we settled for him. In a state of distress, my friend made an advance payment of ₹10,000 as sought by the vendor. He was not reachable after she made the payment in the noon. By evening, even our messages were not getting delivered,” said Mehra.She said the family is still battling Covid. “My friend’s family members are battling for life right now. In such a situation, filing a complaint is the last thing on her mind,” said Mehra.Mehra’s friend is among the scores of people who are getting scammed as they desperately seek help amid the ongoing crisis. The second wave of Covid-19 across the county – and the fourth in Delhi— has spelt doom with a record number of people testing positive for the virus daily and at least 300 people dying of the infection in the Capital everyday over the past few days.Amid this unprecedented surge in cases, social media platforms are flooded with desperate pleas for help to find vacant hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and medicines such as remdesivir. While there are many citizens who have stepped up to help, some fraudsters are exploiting the situation and cashing in on people’s misery in these trying times.Outlining the gravity of the situation, Mehra said her friend was a doctor but had failed to secure a bed for her own family members. Driven by the helplessness of the situation, she was compelled to make the transaction. “I know someone who lost ₹30,000 she had paid for a vial of remdesivir. The vendor blocked the number soon after receiving the payment. In a normal situation, one would think before making any payment. But the crisis is so bad that one is left with no choice but to take decisions fraught with great risk,” she said.Harish Arunachalam, who works with a multi-national technology company in Dublin, paid an advance of ₹10,000 for an oxygen cylinder for a family member whose oxygen levels had started dropping. Sitting miles away from home, Arunachalam made desperate calls to friends in Delhi who were able to find a lead on Twitter. Soon after the payment, the calls on the vendor’s number went unanswered and the promised oxygen cylinder never came.“Since I am not in the country, my friends were coordinating on my behalf. They found a lead on Twitter and called the number. The vendor seemed genuine to us. He sought our Aadhar number and other details. We made a calculated risk but the delivery never happened,” said Arunachalam.He said with so many verified leads floating on social media and other users vouching for the authenticity of these leads, people fall for such vendors. “The word verified has lost its meaning. When friends tell you that a lead is verified, it just becomes more believable. We didn’t realize that there are others trying to use the crisis to their advantage,” said Arunachalam.The cases are one too many.When 25-year-old Feroze’s father’s oxygen levels started dipping below 90 this week, the banking professional started hunting for an oxygen cylinder. A lead, originally shared on a social media platform, came his way. He called on the number and was asked to make an advance payment of ₹5000, which he promptly complied with. “Since the situation was critical, I immediately made the payment only to realize that the vendor was a fraud. In these terrible times, along with the loss of life, we are also witnessing loss of money,” said Feroze.Another citizen, who declined to give his name, lost ₹12,000 for Remdesivir vials that he ordered for his aunt, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19. The vendor seemed genuine and even shared a picture of the medicine, which prompted the journalist to go ahead with the payment. However, the number was switched off soon after and there has been no response since then.“My friend had arranged the number from another acquaintance, who had procured the vials from the vendor. It didn’t work for us,” said the journalist, who is yet to arrange the required medicines. “I am desperately trying to arrange the medicine but have had no luck so far. I am not in the space to go after the vendor,” he added.Delhi police officers said they would take action against fraudsters misusing pleas for help on social media. Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson for Delhi Police, said, “If people who have been duped file complaints, we will conduct investigation and take strict action against the fraudsters if the allegations are found to be true. We are already keeping a vigil on hoarding and black marketing of life-saving medicines, injections and oxygen. More than 20 people have been arrested for such offences in the last one week or so.”Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said given the current situation, people are desperate and as a result, verification--that they would have done in normal circumstances, have taken a back seat. Roy said while there are some people who have not delivered since they had exhausted their capacity, there were instances of frauds too.“If you are asked to pay in advance, you should meet the vendor once. Insist on getting the physical location. This is a basic precaution. People should go through proper channels, such as hospitals, instead of informal means,” said Roy. He said that now medicines were being available through the formal channels which meant that anyone still claiming to sell these medicines is likely to be a fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fraudsters-con-people-as-pleas-for-help-pour-in-on-social-media-101619647289188.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra likely to extend lockdown till May 15||The Maharashtra government has decided to extend the full lockdown, likely to be another 15 days — till May 15. A decision to extend the lockdown was taken in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday but the duration is yet to be decided. The state government is expected to issue an order to this effect in next two days.“The issue of extending lockdown was discussed in the state cabinet meeting and all the ministers were of the view that it should be extended to break the transmission chain. It is likely to be extended by 15 days, but the decision on the number of days will be taken by April 30,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.He was talking to reporters after a state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. The ongoing lockdown is ending on May 1 at 7am.Tope also said the lockdown has helped in stabilisation of daily Covid-19 cases. “Lockdown has brought stability in cases to some extent as there were concerns that daily figures will cross the 70,000 mark, which is not happening as of now. The daily cases are hovering around the 60,000 mark. We are hoping that this was the peak of the second wave in the state and daily cases will start declining from here,” the health minister.On April 22, the state government decided to impose full lockdown across Maharashtra. The decision was taken considering no decline in daily Covid-19 cases despite a partial lockdown that was imposed in the state on April 14.Currently, people can’t step out, unless they need medical attention or are working in an essential sector or want to buy essential commodities that, too, under restricted timings — between 7am and 11am. While local train and metro train travel have been restricted to essential sectors, other public transport modes such as buses have been allowed to ply but at 50% of the sitting capacity. Stricter curbs have been imposed on inter-district or inter-city travel, including 14-day quarantine. Attendance in government and exempted-category offices have also been reduced to 15%, while those coming under essential category have been allowed to work at maximum 50% capacity.“Daily cases are not going up, but they are also not coming down, which is a cause for concern for all of us. The same was discussed in the cabinet meeting and it was decided that the lockdown will have to be extended else things may go out of control,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.The health minister also said the situation will come under control in less time if people will start following Covid protocols strictly. “Besides, the state government has also decided to bring herd immunity in the people by undertaking a large-scale vaccination drive in the state,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-likely-to-extend-lockdown-till-may-15-101619644645952.html

J&K admn: Have sufficient oxygen to meet any exigency The J&K government on Wednesday said they have sufficient oxygen to meet any exigency.“The factual position of oxygen supply in the UT of J&K is as follows: The present consumption of oxygen in the UT of J&K is approximately 25,000 cubic metres daily, as of April 28. The present generation capacity of oxygen in the UT of J&K is 54,500 cubic metres (Hospitals: 24,500 cubic metres and Industrial: 30,000 cubic metres) daily. The UT of J&K has ample supply of oxygen. The UT of J&K also has substantial number of filled oxygen cylinders,” tweeted the J&K government’s official spokesman.However, like other places, many people have been flagging the issues about shortage of oxygen in hospitals or could be seen seeking help regarding oxygen and medicines on Twitter and other social media platforms.“Right now, we are able to provide oxygen to every admitted patient in the hospital, but if the cases start rising things can get difficult. We hope the things don’t go out of hand and more and more facilities are setup in J&K,” said a senior doctor posted at GMC Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/11-j-k-districts-to-go-under-84-hour-lockdown-from-april-29-101619642562979.html

29-04-2021||Chandigarh||First conviction: Woodcutter found guilty in Kotkhai rape-murder case||The district and sessions court in Shimla on Wednesday convicted a 27-year-old woodcutter in connection with the rape and murder of a 16-year-old schoolgirl in Kotkhai town four years ago. Special judge Rajeev Bhardwaj held Anil Kumar alias Neelu guilty and reserved the pronouncement of punishment for May 11. CBI had on April 13, 2018 arrested Anil, who was identified by DNA testing. This is the first conviction in the case that saw dramatic twists, including the custodial death of a man earlier suspected of having committed the crime and the arrest of a senior police officer in that connection. The judge said 12 of the 14 crucial points of evidence presented by the CBI went against the convict. The most important of them was the matching of his DNA with samples found at the crime spot, he said. The judge ruled that the crime was committed on the spur of the moment when Anil Kumar came across the girl as she walked home through the forested area.Anil Kumar, who attended the hearing from a prison in Shimla, pleaded innocence.The Class-10 girl was found dead in the Halaila forest in Kotkhai on July 6, 2017, two days after she was reported missing.Days later, the state police set up a special investigation team headed by Inspector General Z Zahur Zaidi.Police arrested six men on July 13. One of them, Suraj, died in police custody on July 19.Amid public outrage, the Himachal Pradesh High Court handed over the case to the CBI, which arrested nine policemen including the IGP for the custodial death. The custodial death case against the police officers was later transferred to Chandigarh, where it is currently being heard.A 40-member CBI team had camped in Kotkhai for weeks and collected blood samples of 250 people living in areas nearby. The investigators subjected the five suspects, arrested by state police, to various types of forensic examinations including the DNA, narco and lie-detector tests, but their DNA samples didn’t match with those lifted from the crime scene.

29-04-2021||Mumbai||25K kids out of school or have not gone to school ever in Maha: Survey||More than 25,000 students in Maharashtra have either not gone to school ever or have been out of school due to their inability to attend classes, data compiled by a state-organised survey has revealed. This includes 10,820 (43%) students from Mumbai city and suburbs. Responding to concerns around dropouts during the last few months due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, the state education department had launched a drive between March 1 and 10 to identify out-of-school students across the state. Officials in the education department and staff members and teachers of schools in the state undertook a survey of students in their localities to collate this data. Of the 36 districts, data could be collected in 33 districts. Districts such as Amravati, Aurangabad and Buldhana could not be surveyed due to rising Covid-19 infections during the time. As per the data, only 288 students were found engaged in child labour, while 1,212 students could not attend, as they were children with special needs. The education department now plans to come up with guidelines to ensure all these students are re-enrolled into schools. Students who have never gone to school and those who have not attended regularly are considered to be out-of-school students as per the survey. As per data shared by the education department, more than 14,000 students have migrated from the state to other states, of which majority students – 8,801 are from Mumbai city and suburbs. In all, over 10,000 students have migrated from Mumbai to other districts or states as per the data. During the lockdown, data shows an in-migration of 7784 students in the state. Experts said numbers that have come out of the survey cannot be taken seriously, as they are underreported. “The number seems to be severely underreported. We need to understand that the survey was conducted in a situation where it was not safe to conduct door-to-door surveys. Hence, we do not know if the teachers and staff members have been able to reach each student,” said Ghanshyam Sonar, convenor of the All-India RTE forum. Sonar said in the coming days, the government should devise a mechanism wherein students and parents themselves will be able to register the fact they are not able to attend schools. “A phone number can be created where students or parents can give a missed call and then details of such students can be checked and reported. The drive however should be widely popularised to get a more realistic figure,” he added. Heramb Kulkarni, a Pune-based educationist, said, “It is unbelievable that the number of out-of-school students and those engaged in child labour can be this low. Year after year, these surveys happen and realistic numbers never come forward. The government should engage NGOs and other organisations working on the grassroots if it really wishes to get a real picture of out of school students and act towards bringing them back into schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/25k-kids-out-of-school-or-have-not-gone-to-school-ever-in-maha-survey-101619641479112.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Videos emerge of verbal abuse: IIT KGP professor apologises; SC commission initiates an investigation||Three days after a video emerged of a professor of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) verbally abusing a preparatory class for students belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes categories and those with physical disabilities, she has now apologised to the students. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiated an inquiry. On Wednesday morning, Seema Singh, an associate professor from the department of humanities and social sciences at IIT KGP, wrote an email to the students apologising for her behaviour. The recordings, which are under review of the institute, were posted on Sunday afternoon anonymously on the confessions page of IIT KGP, an informal group of students on social media. The recordings are reportedly of the online preparatory classes taught by Seema, professor of English, which were attended by over 100 students and parents. In it, she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at them. “I am writing this to express my sincerest apology for what happened last week. It was not my intention to hurt anyone… It was never the slightest intention to be discriminatory towards any segment of the student community,” said Seema in her email, which has been reviewed by HT. Despite repeated attempts, she was unavailable for comment.In her email to the students, Singh said she ‘went overboard’ as she was under stress, which attributed to her testing positive for Covid-19. “I feel like this (the incident) may have been due to extreme stress of being Covid positive, suffering from poor health, social isolation, lack of any kind of support, and other incriminating personal factors which I cannot share,” she wrote.Institute director Tamal Nath said, “We want to reiterate that we do not support such behaviour. We have received a complaint from the students’ representatives and are reviewing the complaint. Once we verify the claims in the complaint, we will decide on the next course of action.” Nath confirmed that an official complaint has been made by Shivam Singh, officiating vice president of IIT KGP’s Students’ Gymkhana —an officially recognised student body—, however, Shivam did not respond to calls or messages. Science Education Group (SEG), a students’ forum at IIT KGP, stated on Wednesday: “There have also been previous unverified reports that state her (Seema’s) brazen and abusive behaviour with students. She has an alleged history of doing these things. One thing that can be concluded from all this is that primarily this is systematic power abuse, which often goes under the carpet and secondarily, underlines the casteist behaviour of the system…” The forum has demanded that Seema face disciplinary action and be terminated from her post. It has also demanded the creation of an autonomous body across all IITs which acts as a check towards the behaviour of professors towards students. “Our statement is addressed to students of the institute as well as the administration,” said a member of SEG, on the condition of anonymity. “Create SC/ST/OBC cells in all IITs which must be an autonomous body tied up with the NCSC, so that people from oppressed communities can go and express their grievances and concerns about caste-based harassment in confidence without having to worry about the repercussions because they tried to speak up,” said SEG. The demand for the creation of autonomous SC/ST/OBC cells resonated across campuses as the incident and Seema’s response has sparked outrage among the student community across various campuses of IIT as well as other institutes. At least five online petitions have been started by students and alumni of various institutes such as IIT Delhi, KGP, Bombay and Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. They seek action against Seema and the creation of safe spaces for students to speak about caste-based discrimination.“The initial shock and disbelief aside, what’s crucial to note is that this is not an isolated incident by any means. A narrative that is reiterated by the administrative authorities of these Institutes is that such incidences of caste atrocities are rare and that they don’t deserve too much attention… This incident compels us to look at the larger issue of reservations and the savarna concept of merit in higher education. The very nature of the prep course is based on the merit-based education system, wherein it is assumed that SC, ST, OBC students are not eligible to study in IITs as they are less “meritorious”, that they need a preparatory English course to enter this institution,” said the IIT-Bombay chapter of the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, a student group with chapters across various IITs.At least five online petitions have been started by students and alumni of various institutes such as IIT Delhi, KGP, Bombay and Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. They seek action against Seema and the creation of safe spaces for students to speak about caste-based discrimination.Close to 850 alumni members of IIT KGP, ranging from batches in 1970s to 2020, have signed a petition demanding an unconditional apology from Seema as well as her termination. “IITs are already notoriously hostile to Dalit, Adivasi and backward caste students. It is evident from the videos that Professor Singh is a habitual offender and believes her casteism and abuse will go uncensured. We cannot allow this,” read the petition by alumni members addressed to the institute’s administration.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the NCSC issued letters to the institute, union ministry of education, West Bengal government, and director-general of police, WB, informing them that the commission will now investigate the matter. “The commission has taken a suo-motu cognisance of use of unparliamentary language and casteist remarks made by professor Seema Singh… while taking a class of SC/ ST students… Her remarks have hurt the sentiments of many Indians, specifically the SC community,” the commission wrote. “The commission has taken note of the incident at IIT KGP. We have issued letters to the authorities and given them 15 days to respond to us with what action they have taken. Based on their responses we will take action,” said Ajit Kumar Sahu, director, NCSC. If the authorities fail to respond within the stipulated time, the commission may summon representatives for a hearing, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/videos-emerge-of-verbal-abuse-iit-kgp-professor-apologises-sc-commission-initiates-an-investigation-101619641419149.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Virar hospital fire was due to presence of alcohol from sanitiser, O2’||The blaze at Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar spread rapidly owing to the presence of alcohol in the air from excess use of sanitisers over months and oxygen in the intensive care unit (ICU), according to Nilesh Ukunde, fire engineer and private forensic expert from Nagpur, deputed by the divisional commissioner of Nagpur Municipal Corporation to study the fire in Virar. Meanwhile, the Vasai court on Wednesday remanded chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Dilip Bastimal Shah, 56, and director Dr Shailesh Dharamdev Pathak, 47, in judicial custody till April 30. Fifteen Covid-19 patients were charred to death in the fire, last Friday. Ukunde was deputed to study the incident as it was similar to the fire that broke out at ICU at Wadi, Nagpur hospital, claiming four lives, on April 9. “The fire could have been avoided had the management used suction pumps to pump out the alcohol every eight hours. The process hardly takes two minutes. There was no cross-ventilation and the curtains were not fire-retardant. There was only one entry and exit point in the ICU, when there should have been a rear emergency door too,” said Ukunde. “The hospital did not have a water sprinkler system and how the fire audit was done is questionable. The local Vasai civic body and fire brigade, too, are to blame for giving the hospital fire clearance. The fire brigade personnel are trained only in firefighting and rescue of victims, but are not capable of conducting a fire audit, which involves detailed study of structural, electrical and even the paints, type of electrical switches to be used. The management follows what the architect, contractors and interior designers’ plan. Even if a small amount of alcohol settles inside the switchboard, it is enough to cause a huge fire,” said Ukunde. “The heat from the sparks in the air-conditioning unit led to the fire as it came in contact with alcohol and only two nurses in the nursing station were present and they called the management and wasted precious time and did not call the fire brigade,” he said, adding that the findings have been submitted to the Nagpur and Vasai civic bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/virar-hospital-fire-was-due-to-presence-of-alcohol-from-sanitiser-o2-101619641359125.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Mumbra hospital fire exit was blocked’||The fire in Prime Criticare hospital in Mumbra on Wednesday morning, which killed four patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), was a wake-up call for the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), which had claimed several times in the past few weeks that nearly all hospitals in their jurisdiction are “fire-compliant”. Prime Criticare Hospital is a 16-year-old structure, which was earlier known as Life Care Hospital and later Saboo Siddique. While the corporation claimed two notices were served to the said hospital, the last notice was served in February, after which there was no follow-up. Locals claimed there was only one exit and the fire exit, too, was blocked. “Although there was a fire exit on the premises, it was getting difficult to rescue, as the pathway was closed with storage material. We have served two notices to the hospital, however, there was no response,” said TM Mishra, fire chief, Mumbra. An officer from TMC said, “Over 70 per cent of the hospitals are in illegal buildings. We can’t seal all these hospitals, as patients need them. Moreover major structural changes for fire safety, too, are not possible owing to lack of space.” Despite repeated attempts, the hospital was unavailable for a comment. A local resident said, “The hospital is congested and fire exit was obstructed with storage material. There is one exit for patients. So we had to break open the grille of a window at the back of the hospital. Moreover there was only one staircase, the other was a ramp.” TMC officials on Tuesday held a meeting with all private hospitals, after which the fire department started sending notices to hospitals that were not fire-compliant. However, Prime Criticare was yet to receive a notice. Girish Zalke, chief fire officer, said, “We often give enough opportunities to hospitals to submit their fire compliance. Owing to the current medical situation, we could not take drastic measures. The incident happened due to panel overheating. It is an accident that occurred due to electric faults on the premises.” As the fire audit was not conducted, the mandatory report from the electrical inspection was also not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbra-hospital-fire-exit-was-blocked-101619641299751.html

All of 3,141 local train services were suspended from midnight of March 22, 2020; resulting in losses to Central and Western Railway.“The suburban local trains are always under losses particularly due to the low fares. The complete suspension of local train services has increased the loss for the suburban railway network. Loss of ₹600 crore on Central Railway and ₹674 crore on Western Railway was incurred in the entire year (2020-2021),” said a senior railway official on conditions of anonymity.Local train services for the general public were resumed by the Maharashtra government on February 1, 2021. Passengers were allowed to travel in stipulated timing from the first local train service till 7am; then between 12pm and 4pm; and from 9pm till the last local train service.Further, train services resumed partially for employees working in essential care services on June 15, 2020. However, with a limited number of train services, both the zonal railways continued to incur losses.“When a limited number of train services are operated, the manpower required to operate and maintenance of trains and tracks are required in its complete capacity. The operational loss was also incurred after services resumed partially.” said a senior Central Railway official.Local train services were suspended again on April 15 for the general public as a part of the Maharashtra government initiated Break The Chain lockdown measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-suffer-revenue-loss-of-1-274-crore-due-to-lockdown-101619641299161.html

Ghadge had recently written to the chief minister and home minister, levelling serious corruption allegations against Singh and sought an FIR. Singh did not respond to calls and messages, at the time of going to press.Ghadge, who is posted at the Akola city police control room, is from the Mahar community that comes under the scheduled caste category. He alleged in the FIR, a copy of which is with HT, that as he had not followed Singh’s illegal orders to benefit some accused in a 2013 Kalyan civic body criminal case, he [Singh] conspired with others and registered a criminal case against him in order to harass him as he was from a scheduled caste. Fifteen other officers who were posted in Thane police when Singh was commissioner there have also been named. Twenty-seven sections have been invoked, including those of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Indian Penal Code, Maharashtra Police Act and Civil Rights Protection Act.

29-04-2021||Other||Week on, no headway in PAU museum burglary case||Over a week has passed since burglars broke into the museum of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and fled with rare artifacts depicting the heritage and culture of Punjab but police are still groping in the dark for leads. The theft had taken place when the varsity was closed for outsiders and entry was allowed only from one point, Gate Number 4. PAU officials had found out about the theft on April 19 when the varsity reopened. They, however, waited for two days before filing a complaint on April 21. On April 26, police had apprehended a youth, who was said to be the son of a Class 4 employee working at the varsity. They had recovered two brass plates from him but the university authorities said the recovered articles did not belong to the museum.Police are now keeping tabs on the internet as there is a possibility that the thieves may try to sell the stolen artifacts online for a huge amount. According to university officials, the stolen items were antique and some of these were centuries-old artwork depicting life in rural Punjab. These included bells, brass utensils, traditional jewellery, such as Rani haar (necklace), earrings, anklets and phulkari. “These items were rare and priceless. The collection process of the museum began in 1971,” said Sandeep Bains, dean, College of Community Science, who is the custodian of the museum. PAU security in-charge Shiv Kumar said there was no closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera in and around the museum. When asked how the thieves could have entered the university when there was security cover to bar the entry of outsiders, Shiv Kumar said the matter is being probed. “The thieves may have scaled the wall of the university. Right now, we can only speculate. Also, we only keep tabs on the registration number of vehicles entering the campus and ask the driver about the purpose of visit. No vehicle is searched before entry or exit,” he said. Ashok Kumar, the university’s estate officer, said police are probing the matter and hopefully, the accused will be behind bars soon.Sarabha Nagar assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Gurpreet Singh said there have been lapses on the part of the varsity. “They should have informed the police immediately after they found out about the theft. Since, the museum was of historical importance, CCTVs should have been installed around the premises for safety. However, we are working on many theories. A man was rounded up with two brass plates but the PAU authorities said that these plates did not belong to the university,” said the ACP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/week-on-no-headway-in-pau-museum-burglary-case-101619641240549.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Under pressure, hospitals expand infra, neglect fire safety||The recent spate of blazes in hospitals, which are under tremendous strain owing to the pandemic, have brought the focus on how fire safety is neglected on the premises. A fire in a Mumbra hospital on Wednesday morning killed four patients from the intensive care unit (ICU). Fire brigade officials have claimed short-circuit in the meter room to be the cause of the fire. M V Deshmukh, director, Fire Safe India Foundation and former director and fire advisor to the state government, said most of the hospitals have strained their electrical load capacity, especially in the pandemic. “Hospitals have been adding ventilators, air-conditioning units and electrical equipment indiscriminately without enhancing their load. The electrical infrastructure has not been refurnished to meet this enhanced load and all these factors are bound to backfire. More patients mean more use of power and this is playing havoc,” he said.Last week, 15 people lost their lives in a fire at a private hospital in Virar. The fire brigade was called 43 minutes after the first spark was noticed, wasting precious time. A massive fire broke out on the first floor of the Dreams Mall at Bhandup late on March 25 which spread to the third floor, which housed a Covid hospital, claiming nine lives. A Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) inspection carried out last October pointed that the building’s manual fire alarm and automatic smoke detector system were not functioning. There were 23 observations that signalled flouting of fire safety norms in the building, including the absence of alternative electrical supply and rusty pipes in the firefighting system. Namdeo Sable, proprietor, Sai Industries, which have been conducting fire and electrical audits for 19 years, said, “Fires are mainly due to the glitches in electricity and this aspect is neglected by the hospital administration. They appoint unlicensed electricians who hardly have any technical knowledge and cut corners. Audit reports should be used to rectify the errors, but here it is more of an eyewash.” Deshmukh said lack of evacuation plans is another issue. “In Virar, they could have saved at least 10 of the 15 patients had there been a plan in place,” said Deshmukh. Deshmukh warns that jumbo Covid-19 centres are also at a risk.“Most big hospitals have regular fire mock drills and an evacuation plan,” said the senior administrator of a hospital in south Mumbai. Most others refused to comment. State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said hospitals have been told to conduct both fire and oxygen audits and rectify the errors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/under-pressure-hospitals-expand-infra-neglect-fire-safety-101619641239131.html

Between April 15 and April 21, the state recorded 387,972 cases, which came down to 378,554 between April 22 and April 28. Deaths, however, increased in the period. In the past seven days, Maharashtra saw 4,735 deaths, a 71.29% increase from the previous week — 2,758 deaths. A senior health official said it would be early to gauge the impact of lockdown. “The state had imposed a curfew from April 13, which got a mild response from people. This slight dip could because of that. We will know the impact of lockdown in the next week,” he said.Meanwhile, the state cabinet on Wednesday has decided to extend the lockdown by 15 days from May 1. A formal order is expected to be issued by April 30, senior officials said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director-general of health services and advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said some decline is seen, but it is not a trend. “Mumbai, Pune and a few places are showing a decline, but it has to sustain for a couple of weeks. Every wave has a fluctuation. So, whether this is a trend or minor low we cannot say,” he said. On Wednesday, Mumbai showed higher case-count with 4,926 new infections. The city recorded under 4,000-cases on April 26 and 27. However, the positivity rate was much lower compared last week at 12.58%. Mumbai also recorded 78 deaths to take its death toll to 12,954. Mumbai has 67,984 active cases. Pune district topped the districts with 169 fatalities, of which 117 came from Pune city. Thane district reported 91 deaths, Nagpur saw 83 deaths, and Aurangabad 81 fatalities. Nashik and Nandurbar reported 41 and 43 deaths, respectively. Satara reported 38, Yavatmal and Ahmednagar districts saw 32 deaths each, while Latur reported 31 deaths. Of the 985 deaths reported on Wednesday, 392 occurred in the past 48 hours and 251 in the last week. The remaining 342 deaths are from the period before last week, the health department said. As the state has been clocking over 800 deaths for the past three days, high death rate noted in some rural areas, according to a presentation given to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday on the Covid situation. Sindhudurg district’s weekly case fatality rate (CFR) has risen from 1.1% between April 12 and 18 to 3.66% between April 19 and 25. Nanded district has seen as similar rise in CFR from 1.46% to 3.46% during the same period. Osmanabad, Solapur and Amravati districts too have seen a spike in fatality rate in the last two weeks. Dr Salunkhe added the administration and health department are trying their best to contain the deaths. “We are fighting shortage of oxygen and drugs. Unlike last year when the growth of cases was steady, this year we have seen cases mount in matter of a few weeks. Due to the sheer accelerated growth in cases, the death has increased,” he said. According to the data presented, the state’s weekly average increase in cases was 1.52%, which is down from 1.72% the previous week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-sharpest-one-day-toll-of-985-covid-19-deaths-101619640999108.html

The Neelkanth Hospital management had blamed the district administration for the incident, saying they had intimated the officials about the shortage of oxygen a day before the incident. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had directed the Amritsar deputy commissioner to constitute an inquiry panel with instructions to submit a report within 48 hours. Deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira had set up a committee comprising deputy director (local bodies) Rajat Oberoi, who is also incharge of the death analysis committee in the district, and Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh to look into the matter.“Two of the victims were from Gurdaspur, one from Tarn Taran and three from Amritsar district.

29-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet approves hike in Ashirwad Scheme aid from ₹21,000 to ₹51,000||The Punjab cabinet on Wednesday approved an increase in financial assistance under the Ashirwad Scheme, earlier known as Shagun Scheme, from ₹21,000 to ₹51,000 per beneficiary for the marriage of women belonging to low-income families and directed to clear all pending dues. The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh through video conferencing. The cabinet was informed that payments under the scheme till December 2020 were already cleared, a government spokesperson said. The increase will come into effect from July 1. This is the second hike in the scheme amount by the present government which enhanced the aid from ₹15,000 to ₹21,000 after it took over in 2017. At that time, the cabinet had also decided to make payment directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. The chief minister clarified that the scheme was also applicable to Muslims girls aged 18 or above along with scheduled caste, Christian, backward class/caste, economically weaker section families, and daughters of widows of any caste. The Dalit widows/divorcees are also entitled to the benefit at the time of their re-marriage. The latest increase will benefit 60,000 girls or women, putting an addition burden of ₹180 crore on the state exchequer, the spokesperson said. Ensure prompt lifting of grain: CM Reviewing the wheat procurement, the CM directed all procurement agencies to ensure prompt lifting of the grain and timely payment to farmers through the newly introduced direct benefit transfer (DBT) system. Principal secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs) KAP Sinha informed the CM that the issue of shortage of gunny bags had been sorted out. Few instances of shortage were reported in some mandis earlier as the Union government had allocated fewer bales, he said. But there was no shortage of bags after the permission for use of good quality used bags arranged by arthiyas was obtained from the Centre on April 18, , the cabinet was informed. The CM expressed satisfaction at smooth procurement amid the challenges faced by the state due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s agriculture laws, the initial opposition of arthiyas to DBT, scarcity of labour and shortage of gunny bags amid the pandemic. Unauthorised telecom towers regularised The cabinet also decided to regularise all unauthorised telecom towers installed between December 5, 2013 and December 7, 2020. It decided to extend the scope of provisions in section 2.0 (I) (a) of the Telecom Guidelines issued on December 7, 2020 for the purpose.

Of these, eight are men while seven are women, the youngest being a 33-year-old woman from Khanna. The district’s cumulative death count has now gone up to 1, 377. Among the women who died are an 81-year-old resident of Golf link, a 63-year-old of Ajit Nagar, a 62-year-old of Shimlapuri, a 57-year-old from Dugri, a 50-year-old from Meharban, a 47-year-old from Sukhdev Avenue, besides the 33-year-old Khanna resident. The men who succumbed to the virus include a 79-year-old resident of Rara Sahib, two 77-year-old residents of Shivaji Nagar and Nehru Nagar, a 76-year-old of Sunder Nagar, a 71-year-old resident of Hiran village, a 69-year-old resident of Tajpur road, a 64-year-old resident of Subhash Nagar and a 49-year-old resident of Vikas Nagar. The rising deaths are putting pressure on cremation grounds and mortuaries, prompting the Ludhiana administration to issue orders that bodies of Covid victims can be cremated in any cremation ground in the city. As many as 952 residents also tested positive, taking the cumulative count of cases to 52,444, of which 7, 853 are active cases. Currently, 1, 313 beds in private hospitals are occupied while 113 beds are occupied in government hospitals. As many as 30 Covid patients are on ventilator-support. Healthcare system overstretched, need residents support: DC Reiterating that the current healthcare system has already been stretched a lot due to unprecedented rise in Covid cases, especially Level-III patients, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma urged residents to “hibernate” for 14-days to help flatten the second Covid wave which is more ferocious than the previous one. He said due to the sudden surge in Level-III patients, who require ventilator support, and inflow of patients from other states including NCR, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and other parts of Punjab, the district administration was supplying 3,600 oxygen cylinders daily to Ludhiana hospitals. He said that every system has its own limitation and if people continue to be negligent towards Covid protocols, this will create conditions similar to Delhi and Mumbai. Administration to hires specialised doctors To combat the second wave of Covid-19 more efficaciously, the district administration on Wednesday announced to hire medical specialists on daily honorarium basis in the district. Sub-divisional magistrate (east) Baljinder Singh Dhillon said qualified medical specialists must come forward to help the administration in the battle against the contagion. He said interested candidates could contact the senior medical officer of the Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. Dhillon said the decision has been taken to enhance the manpower resources for ensuring quality treatment for infected patients. He said the state government has decided to give daily honorarium for the medical specialists being hired for Covid duty. The SDM added that walk-in interviews will be organised for applicants applying for these posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15-more-lose-battle-to-contagion-in-ludhiana-101619640641139.html

To keep their morale up during the fight, these Good Samaritans are also pasting motivational messages, wishing them speedy recovery, on these food packets. Maneet Makkar, the owner of Club Sixty Nine, who is one of the persons running the free food delivery service, said, “We came to know that a lot of families are unable to cook food as they are not even able to get up from their beds. So we decided to start a Covid kitchen to provide meals free of cost to the patients.”“We are just a phone call away and want to help everyone going through these tough times. Our chefs prepare simple and healthy meals that include yellow dal, mix vegetable, rice and chapatti for delivery,” she said. “This morning, we got a call from a family on Dhandara road and we delivered the meal to them through a private delivery platform.

The BMC had on Tuesday announced that vaccination for beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group will only be done at private vaccination centres. State health minister Rajesh Tope said vaccination for the 18-44 age group was unlikely to start from May 1, but the civic body did not clarify its stand on Wednesday. To prevent crowding at vaccination centres, the BMC had on Wednesday announced that the beneficiaries would be vaccinated only at 73 private hospitals, while 63 BMC and government-run centres would cater to those above 45 years of age. Currently, there are 136 vaccination centres in Mumbai of which 73 are private, 46 are municipal, and 17 are state-run.Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday announced, “The existing 63 BMC and government centres will vaccinate beneficiaries above 45 years of age; 227 new BMC centres will be opened for all beneficiaries above age 18 years; presently 73 private vaccination centres will be increased to over 100 centres and will cater to vaccination of all beneficiaries above age 18 years.” Each of the 227 electoral wards in the city would have one vaccination centre in addition to 63 that are already being run by the BMC and state government. All these would be free vaccination centres. The opening of 227 new centres would take about a month, said civic officials. Paid vaccination is being done at 73 private hospitals which will continue and those in 18-44 age group can also get vaccinated there. However, the civic body had not officially announced the beginning of vaccination for the 18-44 age group till late on Wednesday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department, said, “Infrastructure-wise, the BMC is ready to start administering vaccines to beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group from May 1, provided we get sufficient vaccine doses.”Meanwhile, vaccination will be affected on Thursday due to shortage of stock. The civic body’s vaccination centres will take in beneficiaries only after noon, while private hospital centres will remain closed. The BMC is expecting to receive more vaccine doses by Wednesday midnight. Forty of the 73 private vaccine centres will be closed due to shortage of stock. The remaining 33 private vaccination centres will be open only till stocks last. Owing to the shortage in vaccine doses, a BMC statement on Wednesday evening urged only those beneficiaries receiving their second dose to turn up at vaccination centres on Thursday. Kakani said, “We are expecting Mumbai to receive some doses of vaccine on Wednesday late night. These will then be distributed to municipal and government centres in the morning on Thursday, so normal vaccination can resume by noon on Thursday at municipal and government facilities.” Mumbai received 2,458,600 vaccine doses till April 25, of which 2,410,860 vaccine doses were utilised. Hence, 47,750 vaccine doses are available at respective centres at the end of Wednesday’s vaccination drive. On Wednesday, the BMC vaccinated 44,629 beneficiaries, of which 20,271 received the first dose of their vaccine, and 24,358 received the second dose of their vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-19-vaccine-for-18-44-age-group-at-227-new-centres-101619639078995.html

It will therefore relieve the load of hospital beds particularly,” he said, adding that pricing will be decided by the market.The move comes as Tamil Nadu reported 16,665 new Covid-19 cases and 98 deaths on Wednesday, with Chennai recording 4,764 cases and 32 deaths. The state has, so far, recorded 1,130,167 infections and 13,826 fatalities due to viral disease.Chennai accounts for 23% of the 100,000 tests conducted across the state daily. As beds in the city’s top private hospitals are occupied, the civic body has turned educational institutions in the city into Covid Care Centres where more than 11,500 beds are available free of cost. Over the past one week, the bed occupancy has increased from 1,487 to more than 2,700. As per government protocol, those who test positive for the viral disease are brought to the corporation’s screening and triage centres from where they are allotted home quarantine, Covid care centres and hospitalisation, depending on the severity of the symptoms. The care centres are for those with mild or moderate symptoms and those who do not have the facilities to isolate at home.“Patients who require admissions but can wait for a day or two are reserving their beds to avail them when they become available after discharges,” said a doctor working with a private hospital. More than 12,000 oxygen supported beds are scheduled to be made operational across Tamil Nadu, of which 2,000 will be ready by the end of the week, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said.Officials, meanwhile, said that the Sunday lockdown and stricter restrictions have helped curb the steady rise in infections and, if the trend continues, the state could even see a plateau.On Tuesday, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said: “In Tamil Nadu, we do not have a high number of infections like other states but we should keep our guard. 30% of those diagnosed require hospitalisation.”“With cases falling over the last two days, we can plateau or reduce if we continue to wear masks and do not go out unnecessarily,” he added. Gearing up to vaccinate the above 18 population from May 1, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) on Wednesday placed orders for 1.50 crore vaccines. The state has vaccinated 5,551,744 people so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-care-centres-can-open-sans-nod-chennai-civic-body-101619638959067.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccine makers must sell doses at uniform rate: PIL||Three law students and a lawyer have moved a petition in the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday seeking directions to Covid vaccine makers to sell the doses at a uniform rate. The petition was prompted after a vaccine manufacturer disclosed the differential pricing in vaccines for Centre, state and private hospitals. The petition alleges that Pharma giants are milking the fear psychosis of increased death rates due to COVID-19 disease and hence sought directions to the Central government to acquire the entire manufactured stock of vaccines and apply a uniform price. The petition filed by lawyer Fayzan Khan and others through advocate Vivek Shukla has alleged that the pharmaceutical companies are engaged in organised loot and the high court should intervene to protect the fundamental right to equality and life under the Constitution are not left to the mercy of pharmaceutical companies and to safeguard national public health. The plea while referring to prices declared by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for central, state government and private hospitals say that they are aggrieved as charges of ‘Covishield’ vaccine quoted and published by SII as ₹150 per dose for Central government, ₹400 per dose for states and ₹600 for private hospitals. The PIL also states that the Covaxin price by Bharat Biotech, of ₹600 vaccine price for state governments and ₹1,200 for private hospitals was unreasonable and discriminatory. The plea also challenges the permission granted by the centre to these vaccine manufacturers to commercially exploit the same by having a huge price difference. “This is unreasonable, illogical, amounts to blackmailing the citizens who badly need this vaccine,” the petition states. The petitioner further state that they are aggrieved over the “unreasonable and discriminatory” charges levied on vaccines meant to be sold for states and private hospitals. The advocates have contended that 100% vaccination of the citizens is the only ray of hope to combat the present pandemic and as the National Disaster Management Act empowers the Central government to fix the costs of vaccines, it should act accordingly rather than leaving it in the hands of greedy management of SII and black-marketers. The PIL alleged that the cost difference will create discrimination in terms of BJP-led state governments being supplied the vaccine by the Central government and the non-BJP ruling states will be forced to purchase vaccine at a higher rate from the SII.“This cannot be permitted in a pandemic-like situation of Corona pandemic. This is jeopardizing the national security, safety and integrity with which no private entity can be permitted to play,” the plea read. The PIL also stated that leaving state governments at the mercy of vaccine producing companies would amount to leaving the health of citizens to the “vagaries of the open market” competition during a pandemic. “Such kind of inter-state competition would only yield disaster. This would amount to playing with the health of the citizen to benefit the private players.” It added that asking the state Governments to compete in the “open market” for vaccine procurement with the Central Government and private hospitals is unreasonable. “The Central Government is keeping an assured quota for itself. This conduct is arbitrary, discriminatory and does not fit into the definition of the welfare state’s policy. The PIL is likely to be mentioned before HC this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccine-makers-must-sell-doses-at-uniform-rate-pil-101619638538954.html
29-04-2021||Mumbai||Slum areas the focus even as sero survey says spread going down, says Mumbai civic body||While the third serological survey in the city indicated that seropositivity was on the decline in slum areas, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained that slum areas remain its focus when it comes to detection of cases and vaccination.According to BMC officials, focusing on slum areas becomes important considering the new variant of the current virus spreads fast, and keeping in mind the density in slum areas, one has to keep the focus intact when it comes to both - detection of cases and vaccination.Experts also opine that another solution to control spread in densely populated slums is also to ensure that vaccination is done on a priority basis.A serological survey indicates a population-level prevalence of antibodies against Sar-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic. It indicates that a person has been exposed to the virus and has recovered from it, but it does not detect the level of antibodies in the person.The findings of BMC’s third serological survey released on Saturday stated that among the 10,197 samples collected in March 2021, the survey found that 41.6% of the residents of slums had been exposed to the virus, while 28.5% of people living in non-slum areas like high rises, chawls and other residential areas, had been exposed to the coronavirus.However, in the first two surveys conducted in 2020, 57% of samples collected from the population residing in slums were seropositive in the first survey, while in the second survey, 45% were seropositive when it comes to slum areas. In contrast, 16% of samples collected from residents of non-slum areas showed seropositivity in the first survey, which increased to 18% in the second survey. This indicates that the spread in non-slum areas has increased and declined in slum areas.In terms of areas that have maximum containment, zones are Kandivli, Andheri East, Kurla, Byculla, Chembur and Govandi. There are a total of 120 containment zones in which 165,000 households are covered having a 768,000 population.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC said, “The third ser survey does indicate declining antibodies level in slums areas, and we are focusing on slum areas where cases are increasing. We are making localised strategies, accordingly.”Kakani added, “But this does not mean we are not concentrating on non-slum areas considering maximum cases are being reported from non-slum areas currently. Along with detection of cases, we are also coming up with strategies for vaccinating both in slum and non-slum areas.”For example, the BMC has opened up dedicated vaccination centres for Dharavi and Worli Koliwada that were the two most hit areas last year during the first wave. For non-slum areas, the BMC has appealed to housing societies to tie up with private hospitals to get vaccinated.On Wednesday, the city reported 4,926 cases followed by 78 deaths. This takes the total case tally to 640,409 and the toll to 12,954. The city’s recovery rate is 87% with 557,948 recoveries and a mortality rate is 2.02%. There are 67,984 active cases in the city.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician said, “The BMC should not only focus on the detection of cases from a slum or non-slum areas due to declining or increase of antibodies but mainly focus on vaccination now. This considering we need to understand that the long-term ultimate aim is vaccinating maximum citizens to fight with the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/slum-areas-the-focus-even-as-sero-survey-says-spread-going-down-says-mumbai-civic-body-101619638478929.html

Meanwhile, another single bench of the Delhi HC, directed the Delhi government and the prison authority to ensure proper medical supervision of former RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin, who is suffering from Covid-19 and is currently admitted in Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Hospital.Justice Prathiba M Singh said the doctor on duty looking after Covid-19 patients shall monitor Shahabuddin’s health and if required, also consult senior doctors of the hospital.The court also directed that the former RJD MP, serving life sentence for murder, be permitted to speak to a family member twice a day and disposed of his plea seeking protection of his life and monitoring of the treatment being administered to him at DDU Hospital.In his plea, Shahabuddin said he apprehended that he will not get proper treatment as there is a scarcity of oxygen and other medicines in Delhi. He also alleged that he is “apprehending the mismanagement of his health situation at the hands of the doctors at the behest of the opposite political leaders” in Delhi.According to the petition, he was lodged in a cell, in the high risk ward of Tihar Jail, which he was sharing with another inmate.Despite the other inmate testing positive for Covid-19 early April, Shahabuddin was kept in the same cell with the infected inmate and “no separate arrangement was made by the jail authorities,” read the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-seeks-response-on-plea-seeking-parole-of-prisoners-101619638301700.html

The man was unwell for the past few days and instead of taking him to a doctor, his wife Sandhya had allegedly forced him to isolate himself in the balcony of their house. Patil was upset with her and on Saturday following a dispute, he hit her with a sickle on her head and killed her. “We arrested him on the same day and also conducted his Covid test. After he was found Covid positive, he was admitted to a Covid care centre at Indiabulls building in Kon village,” said an officer. “On Wednesday, as he was going to the 15 floor, a security officer spotted him and informed us about it. We along with the fire brigade officers reached the spot in no time. Even as Patil was repeatedly heading towards an open window, we convinced him not to do so and finally took him out of the premises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-killing-wife-man-tries-to-jump-off-covid-centre-building-101619638239532.html

The injured persons are undergoing treatment at Safdarjung hospital and their condition is critical. They have between 30% and 80% burns, the police said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam said on Wednesday, two calls were made to the police control room regarding the fire in a LPG (cooking gas) cylinder in a flat on the third floor of a building. A police team immediately reached the building and found that four members of a family had suffered burns and were rescued from the flat by locals.The injured persons were identified by their first names as Shalender,45, his wife Koshlender,30, and their two children Rani,15, and Shubham,9. While Shalender and Rani suffered 80% burns, Koshlender received 30% and Shubham 40% burns. All of them were rushed to a nearby hospital, from where they were referred to Safdarjung Hospital as their condition was serious, the police said.During the initial inquiry, the additional DCP said it was learnt that the husband and wife were replacing the empty gas cylinder with a filled one when the leak happened from the new cylinder and the gas spread quickly through the entire house.“Someone may have tried to light the gas stove and the fire broke out and quickly engulfed the house. The exact reason will be known only when statements of the injured persons are recorded. They are currently not fit enough to give their statements,” said a police officer, asking not to be named.Additional DCP Gautam said a case of negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible substance and causing hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others was registered under the Indian Penal Code sections 285 and 337 was registered and investigation has been initiated.A forensic team also visited the spot and collected evidence that would help the police ascertain the exact cause of the fire, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-members-of-a-family-suffer-severe-burns-after-lpg-leak-triggers-fire-101619638178897.html
29-04-2021||Delhi||Two die of Covid-19 at Tihar jail; prison reports 261 active cases||Two prisoners housed in Tihar jail died of Covid-19 on Tuesday night, even as the infection is spreading rapidly through the country’s most populated prison complex, prison officials said Wednesday. Since April, Tihar has reported 284 cases of Covid-19 among prisoners and 115 among jailers, raising fears of a mass infection spread inside the jail. At over 20,500 prisoners currently, the inmate count at Tihar jail is the highest ever in its history. Prison officials said on Tuesday night, the officials of GTB hospital informed them that prisoner Mukesh Talwar, 61, had succumbed to the coronavirus infection. Talwar, who was arrested in connection with a rape case last month, was lodged in jail number 7 and had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 22. As his condition worsened, he was admitted to GTB hospital the same day. Hours before Talwar’s death, 43-year-old prisoner Mohammed Anis, who was lodged in jail number 4, too, died of the disease at the DDU hospital. Anis was in prison since December 17, 2019, in a drug-related case.Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel also confirmed the two deaths without offering more details. Currently, there are 261 active Covid-19 cases among prisoners. Experts such as former law officer Sunil Gupta and Ajay Verma have suggested that the government either set up temporary jails outside the prion complex -- such as school buildings -- or release some of the prisoners who are not a threat to society.Last year, when the pandemic broke out, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole/bail to ensure social distancing within the jail. However, between February 6 and March 18, 2021, almost all these prisoners surrendered and returned to jail, after spending nearly 10-11 months outside. Their return meant that the prison was once again crowded, leaving little space for isolation of suspected Covid-19 patients and new inmates. Among the many prisoners, who are currently Covid-19 positive are underworld gangster Chhota Rajan and former politician turned gangster Mohammed Shahabuddin. While Rajan has been admitted to AIIMS, Shahabuddin is being treated at DDU hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-die-of-covid-19-at-tihar-jail-prison-reports-261-active-cases-101619638120748.html

It has also decided to fund the project by granting ₹94 crore.The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting The funds for the project will be given from the state contingency fund, officials said.The Central government too has approved ₹65 crore for the project under Covid Suraksha Yojana.“With the help of the ministry of science and technology, a project is going to be set up by Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited at Parel in Mumbai for manufacturing Covaxin in collaboration with Bharat Biotech that has developed the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in the country. The state government will provide ₹94 crore for setting up the plant from the state contingency fund,” said a release issued by the chief minister office on Wednesday.“With all the permissions in place, we will now start construction activity, get validations and take further steps according to our plans,” said Dr Sandeep Rathod, managing director Haffkine Institute.Haffkine Corporation sought permission for the transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech in January, which was approved by the department of biotechnology of the Union ministry of science and technology on April 15.Haffkine will be producing (228 million ( 22.8 crore) doses of the Covaxin vaccine in a year. The stock will be in addition to what other private firms will be producing in the country. It will take at least a year for setting up the project as is now required to develop a Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory that is going to be developed at its Parel premises.HT was the first to report on March 18 that the Haffkine Corporation has sought permission for the transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech for developing Covaxin.Haffkine Corporation is a subsidiary of Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing, owned by the state government.“The manufacturing of the vaccine will be done in two phases — manufacturing of raw material which we called as drug substance and then fill and finish of the product. With the technology in place, we will be manufacturing the drug substance at our BSL -3 laboratory and as part of the next step the vaccine will be filled in bottles and the product will be finished,” Dr Rathod has said.Saurabh Vijay, secretary, medical education department said that the state has also allowed the Haffkine Corporation to hold talks with other firms for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine. “The state government has allowed the corporation to sign a privacy agreement with Bharat Biotech for manufacturing vaccine doses. It has also been allowed to hold talks with other firms manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine for expanding its production,” Vijay said.He informed that the plant will be used for producing other vaccines once the need for producing Covid-19 vaccine is over.Haffkine Institute is one of the oldest biomedical research institutes in the country. It was established in 1899 and is named after the scientist — Dr Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine — who invented the plague vaccine. Since then, Haffkine Institute has emerged as a multi-disciplinary Institute engaged in training, research and testing of various aspects of infectious diseases. It has developed an anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc.To expand the production activities and to meet the growing demands for medicines and life-saving drugs, the state government bifurcated the Haffkine Institute in 1975 and the production activities were entrusted to Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited, a firm fully owned by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/haffkine-gets-maharashtra-govt-nod-94-crore-grant-for-covaxin-101619638059512.html

Effective from Thursday, the curfew will be imposed from 6pm to 5am daily and will remain in force till further orders. The decision comes on the day the city recorded 11 deaths related to Covid-19, which is the highest since the outbreak last March. Positivity rate in the city is consistently being recorded around 20%, which means of every five people sampled, one is found infected daily.The administration has also decided to close all cinema halls and multiplexes, impose a blanket ban on social, political, religious or cultural gatherings, and further limit the attendance at marriages and funerals. While these decisions will remain in force till further orders, the closure of educational institutes has been extended till May 15.The decisions were taken during the Covid review meeting chaired by the UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. During the second wave, the administration had first imposed the night curfew on April 6, from 10pm to 5 am. The timings were revised to 9pm-5am on April 23, which have now been further revised. According to the orders, all shops and malls are to close by 5pm, though home delivery is allowed till 9pm. All non-essential activities will remain banned during the curfew hours. Any breach of this order will invite action under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code along with other applicable laws. No decision on weekend lockdownUT adviser Manoj Parida said the decision was taken to ensure uniform curfew timings in the tricity. On the prospects of a weekend lockdown, he said: “It is under consideration. We will wait for Haryana’s decision, before taking a call on weekend lockdown and longer lockdown in the city.” Notably, the Punjab government had announced fresh restrictions on movement on Monday, extending the night curfew by two hours, from 6pm to 5am, and ordering a strict weekend lockdown. Earlier, Haryana had also directed the closure of non-essential shops from 6pm. In the meeting, Badnore also expressed serious concern over the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. He directed the hospital authorities to enhance ICU beds, and suggested that non-critical patients or mild and moderate cases can be shifted to Covid Care Centres or home isolation. “All beds should be kept in reserve for severe and critical cases only,” he said, while also directing the health department to set up a control room to track oxygen availability and other needs of various hospitals and take remedial steps quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-night-curfew-in-chandigarh-from-6pm-101619638001811.html

This was after photographs emerged on social media, showing an elderly woman’s body lying at a cremation ground. The body was not wrapped in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kit and did not have even have a bedsheet as cover. “Not only is the infection being spread, but the dead are being brought in the most undignified manner to the cremation ground. This is unacceptable. I have spoken to the authorities of the Aastha Hospital. Strict action will also be taken against employees for negligence. I have asked the civil surgeon to complete the inquiry in 24 hours,” the DC said. The DC’s action comes just two days after bodies of two Covid-19 victims were taken to the cremation ground in a cart and autorickshaw. “This is the second day that we have had to face this. Blood is oozing out of the mouth of the body. It was not even covered, leave alone having a PPE kit,” said a worker at the cremation ground. Dr Sanjeev Gupta of Aastha Hospital said, “One of our junior staffers might have made this mistake. We are trying to fix responsibility and to ensure this is not repeated. We have separate wards for covid and non-covid patients and are discharging six-seven patients everyday from our hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-ordered-as-covid-norms-flouted-while-taking-covid-victims-bodies-for-cremation-in-ludhiana-101619638000184.html

But for several months now, after opposition from workers and a section of councillors, the GPS-enabled wrist watches are not being worn by most employees, particularly sanitary workers. Consequently, the MC has restarted calculating salaries on the basis of physical marking of attendance.A committee comprising councillors and officials was constituted to look into the matter. But after six months of deliberations, the committee was split in the middle over whether the civic body would continue to provide GPS-enabled wrist watches. The committee’s report was tabled in the MC General House meet on Wednesday.During the heated debate on the issue, MC commissioner KK Yadav stated that the watches had helped in detecting 250 ghost employees, adding that except for a few glitches, they had helped in improving the efficiency of the employees.BJP city chief and councillor Arun Sood questioned the officials on the cost of the watches. While the officials claimed that the price of one watch was around ₹8,000, Sood contended that the watches could be bought at a price range of ₹1,200 to ₹1,500. The MC is paying around ₹2 crore as rent for the watches.Sood also asked the commissioner to submit the list of 250 ghost employees reportedly detected through the watches. He demanded that a penalty should be imposed on MC officials who allowed such ghost employees to be paid, and an FIR should be registered against the ghost employees.Increased cost of 24/7 water supply project approvedThe MC House approved the revised cost of the 24/7 pan-city water supply project. The ambitious project, which in 2019 was pegged to cost ₹440 crore, will now cost ₹591 crore, ₹151 crore more. The MC would have to pay an additional ₹22 crore, while most of the increased cost will come from European Union grant of ₹98 crore.While treasury benches and most of the opposition councillors supported the move, Congress councillor Saitsh Kainth objected to the project: “When city residents without getting any improved water supply are already burdened with higher water tariff, this would increase the financial burden on them. It is awful that MC is now being pushed to run on borrowed money.”In response, Yadav listed several benefits of the project and said, “It is time the MC stops running to the UT administration or Centre for funds. MC can generate its own funds.”Covid surge didn’t stop meeting||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-link-staff-s-attendance-on-smart-watches-with-salaries-101619637880436.html

Pargat, who met the CM along with other MLAs from Doaba region as part of the two-day consultation exercise held by the latter on the emotive issue, said that Capt Amarinder should take responsibility being the home minister of the state. “I told the CM about the perception among the people that he (Amarinder) and the Badal family are hand in glove with each other. We have to work to remove this perception. The new SIT should get cracking and produce results in a time-bound manner by taking action against culprits in these cases,” he said, after attending the meeting. The Jalandhar Cantonment MLA said the party won the 2017 assembly elections under Capt’s leadership and in his name, but he should now get a survey done to see where his popularity stands today. “It is due to the attempts to cover-up on just about everything…they do not want anyone to speak up,” he said in blistering remarks. Considered close to Sidhu, Pargat is the second Congress MLA to directly target the CM for failing to deliver justice in the politically sensitive cases in four years. In 2019 also, he had, in a letter to the CM, asked him about the doubts people had about the steps taken by the government to put the culprits in the dock. On the CM’s challenge to Sidhu to fight the election against him from Patiala, Pargat said such a statement did not befit a leader of his (Amarinder’s) stature. “He should not have talked in this manner. We should not digress from the real issue (justice in sacrilege cases),” he said. On day two of the CM’s meetings, a number of other party MLAs from Majha and Malwa also spoke about the public mood, which, in their words, varied from trust deficit to anger in different parts of the state. “The MLAs spoke about the loss of face they have suffered. Majha MLAs said this was the only issue in their region. I hope these meetings are not just a formality,” said one of the participants who did not want to be named. Congress MLAs from Malwa, who met the CM on Tuesday, had conveyed to him their apprehensions about the adverse political fallout of the state government’s handling of this issue, if justice is not delivered quickly. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, advocate general Atul Nanda, director general of police Dinkar Gupta and Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retired) were also present on both the days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-public-perception-capt-and-badals-hand-in-glove-pargat-101619637519414.html

The action against Langah was taken after a video clip showing him in an objectionable position with a woman had gone viral in October 2017. Langah’s father Tara Singh, 89, and mother Pritam Kaur, 88, have submitted an application in the Akal Takht secretariat. They said the family had suffered mentally and socially as the acting Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpeeet Singh has been rejecting Langah’s repeated pleas of clemency. Langah had been spotted outside the Akal Takht for a few days last week. On April 21, Sikh bodies had submitted a memorandum to the jathedar requesting him not to entertain Langah’s clemency plea. Langah and his family have been trying to secure pardon ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. Langah’s son Sukhjinder Singh Sonu Langah may contest the election.“We are old and in the final stages of life. We have faith in Gurmat (teachings of the Sikh religion). Our son has been seeking pardon for his mistakes by visiting the Akal Takht time and again. He has also assured that he would comply with the orders of the Akal Takht in future. We request that he should be brought back into the panth,” Langah’s parents say in their application to the Takht, while also citing their infirmity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/excommunicated-langah-s-parents-move-akal-takht-for-his-pardon-101619636919418.html

Police have also arrested his aide, Chunni Lal, of Pinjore, Panchkula.A Ford Endeavour, bearing “Government of India” and “Chairman, Delhi Board” plates, uniforms of RPF personnel of various ranks, a dummy revolver, six fake cartridges and a computer have been recovered from them.“Following a tip-off, Kumar was arrested from Kharar with his Ford Endeavour (CH-01-AZ 6402) and his accomplice from his computer centre in Pinjore, Haryana,” said Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh.Previously worked as stenographer for railwaysDuring interrogation, the police discovered that Kumar had previously worked as a contractual stenographer with the divisional railway manager, Ambala, which gave him an insight into RPF recruitments. Through Lal’s computer centre in Pinjore, Kumar would prepare fake RPF joining letters and ID cards, complete with the RPF logo and fake signatures, to convince gullible youths about RPF jobs in exchange for money.Through this modus operandi, they duped Mohali resident Harinder Singh and an Uttar Pradesh native, Hari Om, of ₹4.5 lakh each by offering them jobs of ASI and SI, respectively.Similarly, they conned Gurdev Kumar, Lachhman and Pardeep of Agra and Amritsar resident Manish of ₹25,000 each for labour jobs.The SSP said all victims were provided fake five-year agreement and joining letters, IDs and uniforms. A case under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record, 170 (personating a public servant) and 171 (wearing garb or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intent) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused at Kharar City police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-rpf-chairman-who-duped-youths-of-lakhs-arrested-in-punjab-s-kharar-101619636379620.html
29-04-2021||Chandigarh||In Mohali, long and painful wait for Covid victims’ families to say final goodbye||Running helter-skelter for oxygen and beds, and still losing their loves ones to Covid-19 is not where the trauma ends for families in Mohali.Thereon looms large the uncertainty over when they can bid the final farewell, for the body will not be moved to the cremation/burial ground until the civil surgeon’s office is informed and an ambulance is sent. The wait can last over 24 hours, during which the mourning family is given a new task – arranging 1 litre sanitiser and four PPE kits for the crematorium staff and the one family member, who will be allowed to go in to light the pyre.“We went through hell and still couldn’t save my 70-year-old father. Despite appeals, we were turned away by three private hospitals in Zirakpur and my father finally breathed his last at a hospital in Sector 69 on Monday,” said Ankur Singh of Zirakpur. “But it didn’t end there. They refused to hand over my father’s body, stating that only an ambulance from the civil surgeon’s office will transport the remains to the crematorium. When we did finally reach there, preparing ourselves for the last rites, we were told to bring four PPE kits and 1 litre sanitiser,” he said.A Phase 10 resident, who lost her 65-year-old mother at a Sohana hospital on Tuesday, underwent the same ordeal. “The hospital insisted that the body will be handed over only to the Covid nodal officer, who arrived the next day. It’s tragic that a grieving family doesn’t even get to say the final goodbye peacefully,” she complained.Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said as per Covid safety protocols, the bodies cannot be given to the family members and were transported only by government ambulances to limit the risk of infection.Separate enclosure at crematoriumMeanwhile, with the number of cremations going up in April, the city’s only crematorium in Sector 73 has created a separate enclosure for the last rites of Covid victims.“Till last month, we were cremating only three to four bodies of Covid victims in the electric crematorium. But, now nearly 10 bodies arrive every day. So, we have set up a dedicated area for these cremations, as the electric crematorium has a daily capacity of only four cremations,” said Narinder Pandey, the head priest at the crematorium.The civil surgeon said more bodies were also coming in, as even suspected cases were cremated in line with Covid protocols. “These include critical patients, who succumb at the hospitals before they are tested, and people who are declared brought dead without confirmation of presence of Covid,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-mohali-long-and-painful-wait-for-covid-victims-families-to-say-final-goodbye-101619635959399.html

Many states and UTs have already said that free doses will be given. However, we have yet to receive the centre’s approval,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said initially, they were aiming to inoculate around 1,500 people in this age group and gradually ramp up the drive.Unable to book time slots, residents took to Twitter to express their disappointment. “The site doesn’t go beyond registration. The link for an appointment does not open,” said R Verma, a city resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccine-for-18-time-slots-inaccessible-for-now-in-chandigarh-101619635239401.html

Over the last four days, only around 1,000 people were covered, while the vaccination sites have been reduced from 35 on April 1 to 22 on April 28.On Thursday, the drive will be held at all primary health centres and community health centres. However, the civil surgeon urged only those eligible for the second dose to reach the sites. “Those who got their first shot at a private centre can also visit the government facilities for the second dose, which will be free,” she said.There is no shortage, says MLAAfter receiving the first shot on Wednesday, Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta said there was enough stock of Covaxin in the state. “The number of vaccination centres will also be increased from April 30 onwards,” he said, while urging people to get the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-reserves-depleting-vax-stock-for-second-dose-shots-101619634999337.html
29-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir holds political event at his residence in violation of Covid norms||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday held a large political gathering of youth activists at his residence in Muktsar district in violation of pandemic protocols. Arshdeep Singh Robin Brar, the newly appointed president of the Students Organisation of India (SOI), SAD’s student wing, reached Sukhbir’s residence at Badal village with his supporters. Even as the Punjab government has imposed a ban on all social, political and cultural events, more than 100 activists of SOI and SAD were present when Sukhbir addressed the gathering. The violation was leaked on social media. In a video, a leader is heard asking the attendees not to take pictures or film those present. Among those present were Sukhbir’s political aides, including Muktsar MLA Kanwarjit Singh Rozy Barkandi, senior SAD leader Tejinder Singh Midhukhera, and the party’s public relations team. Sukhbir asked the activists to start working for the next assembly elections. He asked Brar to start mass enrollment of students at the district level. Sukhbir’s media coordinator Rajya Deep declined to comment, saying the SAD chief was not available. Brar admitted that a large gathering at Sukhbir’s residence should have been avoided.“After my appointment as SOI president two days ago, I had a programme to meet the SAD president in a small group. Since SOI activists were aware of today’s event, they reached in large numbers. I urged them to maintain social distancing and wear masks but my repeated requests went unheard,” said Brar.Muktsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) D Sudarvizhi said she has asked for details about the Covid-rules violations for further legal action in the matter. On April 22, Sukhbir visited six wheat purchase centres in Bathinda and Moga districts with a large number of party workers and close aides. No social distancing was maintained at his meetings with farmers and party workers. Muktsar district on Wednesday reported 269 new cases and now has 1,925 active cases. Three Covid-related deaths were reported in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-holds-political-event-at-his-residence-in-violation-of-covid-norms-101619633499370.html

The state government is expected to issue an order to this effect in the next two days.“I am at home for over a month now and getting half of the salary from the company. We are already suffering financially due to the pandemic. Keeping offices, shops and others closed is not the solution. Lockdown affects lives of common people,” said Parag Kenjale, an accountant working in a private tax consultant firm.Archana Soni, a housewife, said, “We lost our father-in-law due to Covid last year, my husband is working in a manufacturing company which is closed due to lockdown. Extending restrictions till May 15 will make our situation worse, we have already borrowed around ₹1 lakh from our friends and relatives till now.”“Day to day management of finances has become an issue for middle-class people like us. The government should our situation as well,” she said.Fatechand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said, “We strongly oppose this extension of lockdown and it seems to be a wrong decision taken by the state government.”“When partial restrictions are been imposed its purpose doesn’t seem to be fulfilled and now when the cases are dropping some restrictions needs to be relaxed. Shop owners and traders should be allowed to open their business in some given time slot,” he said.Umesh Chavan, a stationery shop owner from Karvenagar area, said, “From last one month I have closed my shop due to lockdown, but I daily get calls from our regular customers for taking a photocopy of hospital, government documents and for other necessary material. But I cannot help them as the restrictions are there and cannot open the shop, this lockdown extension is not right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punekars-traders-unhappy-as-lockdown-likely-to-be-extended-101619626238422.html

The positivity rate in the district has remained the same, around 26%, in this time period of 19 days. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) has gone north, more than double, during the same period. The number of deaths increased from 70 as of April 8, to 151, as of April 27. Although Pune has been witnessing a fall in the number of new Covid-19 cases being reported, the positivity rate is still at 26%. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) conducted 16,650 tests on Wednesday, April 28, and reported 3,871 new cases. This puts the day’s positivity rate at 23.24%. On April 8, PMC conducted 23,595 tests and reported 7,010 new cases which put the positivity rate at 29.7%. Dr Sanjiv Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC, said, “We are following the ICMR protocols which states that 20 high-risk and low-risk contacts must be traced for every index case. However, due to the lockdown most people are staying at home and so there are only four-five contacts who come in close connection with the patient, mostly family members. Last year, after the first wave we were asked to do eight thousand tests, but we are doing minimum 16,000 now.” The central government in its letter to all state chief secretaries dated April 28, stated that large containment zones could be framed in areas where the testing rate is above 10%. The letter issued by home secretary Ajay Bhalla dated April 26, to all chief secretaries stated: “The decision on where and when to go for large containment zones (CZ) has to be evidence-based and done at the State/UT level after proper analysis of the situation, such as; population affected, geographical spread, hospital infrastructure, manpower, ease of enforcing boundaries, etc. However, in order to facilitate objective, transparent, and epidemiologically sound decision making, the following broad-based framework is provided to aid States UTs in selection of districts/areas which includes test positivity of 10% or more in the last one week OR bed occupancy of more than 60% on either oxygen supported or ICU beds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-tests-in-pune-drop-to-33000-101619622458126.html

29-04-2021||Mumbai||Indian archaeologist elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences||Indian archaeologist and Padma Shree awardee Sharada Srinivasan is among the 250-odd global artistes, researchers and scientists to be elected as an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AMACAD), one of the oldest societies for scholars in the United States of America.On April 22, AMACAD announced the list, which includes at least half a dozen resident Indian Americans. However, 55-year-old Srinivasan, a professor at the School of Humanities of National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru, is the only resident Indian to have been elected to the society this year.Probability theorist Kavita Ramanan, who is the Roland George Dwight Richardson University Professor in the division of Applied Mathematics at the Brown University in Rhode Island, has also been elected as a member. Others on the list include Indian-American neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta, literary theorist and feminist critic Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and theoretical physicist Ashvin Vishwanath.Founded in 1780, AMACAD honours excellence and convenes leaders from around the world every year to examine new ideas, address issues of importance to the nation and the world, and work together “to cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the interest, honour, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous people.”With their election to the society, members such as Srinivasan and Ramanan now join an elite group of scholars that have included the likes of Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, Akira Kurosawa and Nelson Mandela.“The Academy’s mission is to advance the public good. The diversity of newly elected members helps us achieve that goal by creating greater awareness of the range of extraordinary individuals around the world who are excelling in their fields. It’s wonderful when election to the Academy raises the visibility of members and helps younger people see their own potential and new possibilities,” said David Oxtoby, president of AMACAD, in an email response.“As an Indian woman, and as a woman representative of the Global South, it is thrilling to be counted amongst its international luminaries ranging from Einsten to Mandela and Nobel Laureates and past presidents. In these globally and nationally challenging times, when the Academy has sought to illuminate how knowledge, art, ideas and leadership could contribute to a better world through its election of new members, this confers not only recognition, but also a sense of responsibility,” said Srinivasan, who is also a Bharatanatyam dancer.Ramanan, in an email interaction, said she views her election to the academy as an acknowledgement of her family, friends, mentors, collaborators and students, all of whom have not only supported her research journey, but also made it enjoyable.“I feel fortunate to be in a profession that I really enjoy, and so this recognition comes as a wonderful bonus. I am particularly attracted by the multidisciplinary nature of the academy, and look forward to meeting and working with people from diverse disciplines, including the Arts, as a member of the academy. Having recently initiated a seminar series on “Social Equity and Applied Math” at Brown University, I am interested in the Academy’s programmes on Democracy and Justice, in addition to STEM and Education issues,” said Ramanan.Both Srinivasan and Ramanan have been advocates of multidisciplinary research and hope that their election to the academy increases the visibility of women in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).Srinivasan’s research areas include archaeometallurgy, archaeological sciences and archaeometric studies, where she has tried to explore how scientific techniques of materials and metals characterisation can better help understand the history of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent.“The election to the AMACAD gives a unique opportunity to further project such activities to an international platform and to take it to an international standard and to engage and learn from the top international scholarship to both expand the frontiers of knowledge and to learn about the best practices for heritage conservation and management, since in many ways in India we still lag behind to a fair extent in terms of scientific studies in the areas of cultural heritage,” said Srinivasan, who resides in Bengaluru with her husband and 20-year-old daughter.Incidentally, both women are alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-Bombay)—Srinivasan graduating a year before Ramanan joined in 1988—and have lived in the same hostel building at different times. Last year’s selectees, Shobhana Narasimhan, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, and Sarita Adve from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, too, have shared the same hostel during their time at IIT-Bombay.IIT-Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “IIT-Bombay has always believed in providing equal opportunities to women students and we are delighted to see that it is paying rich dividends. We are happy that many of our women students use IIT-B opportunities to springboard into successful careers. Membership to the academy is very prestigious and the fact that all recent Indian women inductees are IITB alumni attests to the importance of the role of the institute in shaping the career of bright minds. We hope that such a stellar performance of the women batches of the 80s will further motivate the younger batches.”Srinivasan said that young women shouldn’t be afraid to think out of the box. “I would say to the young women of today… to take the road less travelled if that is where the instincts are, since passion and commitment will find its rewards,” she said.“Surround yourself with people who support and believe in you, aim high but keep expectations low, and do not limit your role models to people who look or talk like you, but take inspiration from different qualities in a variety of people,” Ramanan advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-archaeologist-sharada-srinivasan-elected-to-american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences-101619540672015.html
