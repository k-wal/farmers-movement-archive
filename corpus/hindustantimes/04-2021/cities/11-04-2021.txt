The recovery rate on April 1 was 94.09% in Lucknow, according to the data from the health department. Keeping in view the rise in Covid cases, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Lucknow has re-started the Covid helpline in which 11 doctors will attend calls from patients. “In all, 11 doctors will attend calls between 10 am and 2 pm.

11-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools shut, but no word yet on teachers’ attendance||Teachers in several Delhi government schools have expressed concerns about reporting to their institutions two days after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the closure of all schools following a surge in Covid-19 cases.While the government made it clear that students will not be allowed to come to school for any academic or examination-related work, it did not mention teachers and other staffers.On Saturday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Saturday said, “I have been getting queries on whether it is compulsory for teachers to go to schools or not. School principals and the staff can decide among themselves on how many teachers will come to school and how many will give lessons online. We are not putting any restrictions on this from our side.”Teachers, however, said this may give rise to uncertainties and create room for confusion. Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of the Government School Teachers’ Association (GSTA), said, “It is not a wise decision to let schools take a call on whether teachers should come or not as it may leave room for bias and also for the education department officials to run things in an arbitrary manner. Teachers must be asked to help students prepare for their exams online.”Sant Ram, who is the district secretary of the teachers’ association in west Delhi-A, said there have been several cases of teachers testing positive for Covid-19 after coming in contact with others during academic work. He said teachers must not be asked to come to school at least till the current surge is not brought under control. “Apart from teaching, hundreds of teachers are still doing Covid-related work in airports, religious places, banquet halls, and working with the district administration. They are on night patrolling duty and also have been given election duty for the upcoming gurdwara elections. When the positivity rate in the city has hit 10%, calling teachers to school may prove to be a risk to everyone’s health,” he said.The head of a government school in Rajouri Garden Extension, Sanjeev Gaur said that despite the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) directives, his school is waiting for an order from the education department. “We have to see what percentage of staff will be allowed to come to school for administrative work. Based on that, we will prepare a roster and exclude those who are on Covid-duty. Since tomorrow [Monday] is a working day, all teachers will come,” he said.A senior education department official said, “Schools will be informed on what percentage of staff have to come in due course of time. Till then, all of them have to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-shut-but-no-word-yet-on-teachers-attendance-101618163668594.html

Governor Anandiben Patel chaired the meeting. While the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress attended the meeting, main opposition Samajwadi Party and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal stayed away. RLD claimed it wasn’t invited. Addressing the meeting, the chief minister said that corona virus had now become air borne ‘to an extent’ and advised high risk groups, including elderly above 60 years of age and children below 10 years to cut all non-emergency outings. “We have appealed to the high-risk category, people above 60 years of age and children below 10 years, to not go out unless essential, as it is being noticed that the infection to an extent has become airborne,” Yogi told the meeting. Blaming complacency for the surge of infections after Covid cases came down post September 2020 and post vaccination, the chief minister said his government was seeking public cooperation in ensuring that Covid protocols were compulsorily followed. The CM also shared his government’s plan to decongest places like vegetable markets which he said would be organised in large open spaces. Rapid and random rapid antigen test, focused contact tracing of each positive person and increasing the number of RTPCR tests as well Covid beds and ICU facility in hospitals were some of the other measures of his government that Adityanath shared with the opposition. The official machinery, he shared, was also being galvanised to mount a massive awareness campaign aimed at sensitising the people against taking the Covid surge lightly. The opposition assured the government of cooperation to help contain the spread of the disease. “The chief minister did say that the infection was airborne and stressed on the need for precautions at all levels,” BSP legislative party leader Lalji Verma told HT after the meeting, in which he also shared suggestions by his party. The BSP’s suggestions largely focused on improving contact tracing, allowing government OPDs in districts to function and ensuring that non-Covid patients weren’t denied treatment amid the focus on checking corona cases. The Congress was represented by party leader Suhail Ansari at the meeting in which the CM sought and got opposition cooperation in his government’s efforts to ensure that people wore gloves and masks while going out and used sanitisers or washed hands with soap each time they touched anything outside. “If we do that we will be able to break the transmission,” Adityanath said, adding cleanliness and sanitisation had begun on a mass scale. The CM later held a video conferencing with officers in each district( especially those reporting maximum cases like Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur ) to talk about the new guidelines that allow only a limited gathering even during panchayat polls set to begin from April 15. “We have already decided that only five people would be allowed for campaign and the mass campaign or gathering that earlier allowed up to 200 people has now been halved. If it’s a cramped room where the political campaign is on, then only people half the strength of that room would be allowed entry,” Adityanath said. Yogi will discuss measures to help control Covid-19 with his ministers at Monday’s cabinet meeting in which the suggestions received from the opposition would also be taken up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/virus-airborne-high-risk-groups-must-stay-indoors-cm-tells-all-party-meeting-101618165473718.html

PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur has terminated the services of a health manager, who was supposed to identify the body with the relatives before handing it over to them. “I have issued a show-cause notice to the nodal officer and ordered an inquiry into the episode to find out those responsible for the lapse. I will take stern action against doctors or any other healthcare worker responsible for this act,” said Dr Thakur. The PMCH had issued the death certificate of Chunnu Kumar, 40, a resident of Barh, who is recuperating from a fracture and has contracted coronavirus. Kumar, who was in the IJ ward, an ICU for Covid-19 patients, was shifted to the adjacent AB ward to make way for a critical Covid-19 patient, Raj Kumar Bhagat, 45, from Purnia, admitted to the hospital in the wee hours of Sunday. Bhagat did not survive long. Though the patients were swapped at midnight, the authorities, however, forgot to make the necessary changes in their medical records. So, when Bhagat died this morning, the hospital authorities took him for Kumar and called his relatives and handed over Bhagat’s body to them. Such is the scare of Covid-19 that the relatives did not identify the body before receiving it at the hospital, but detected it only at the crematorium. Soon thereafter, they disowned the body and reported the matter to the hospital authorities, much to their embarrassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-a-case-of-mistaken-identity-pmch-issues-death-certificate-to-living-covid-19-patient-101618165473183.html

Police said the complainant, Avinash Sharma, 45, is a superintendent at Municipal Corporation’s Zone-D office.She told the police that a Nepalese man, Mohan Kumar, was working for her for the past three months ago. However, as he had to visit his native village, he sent over Rajesh Kumar Dhami, also from Nepal, to fill in for him.On Saturday, Sharma said she, along with her husband, Pawan Sharma, and son Deepakar Sharma were home, while Dhami was in the kitchen.Suddenly, three Nepalese men, armed with sharpened screw drivers, barged into their house and restrained them.While two of the masked men started turning the house upside down for valuables, another kept an eye on them.She said Dhami never entered the scene, while the robbers fled with ₹6 lakh in cash, 100gm gold jewellery, two diamond bracelets and two diamond sets.“It was after they left that Dhami came over and pretended that the robbers had assaulted him and tied him up with ropes. Finding his claims suspicious, I confronted him, when he also fled from the house,” Avinash told the police.She said as per the CCTV footage, the robbers stayed inside the house for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, her gardener also turned up and rang the door bell. But the robbers did not allow her to answer the door and waited to escape till the gardener left.A team from the Model Town police station reached the house and initiated investigation.Assistant sub-inspector Pardeep Singh said they had registered a case under Sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 381 (theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. He said the accused were captured in the CCTV cameras installed in the house, and they were working to track them down.Easy escapeNotably, the police have no set protocol to verify the criminal record of Nepalese workers even if their employers approach them for police verification. Verification entails writing to the Nepal government through the Union home ministry, which is a tedious process.Besides, the Indian police simply cannot go to Nepal to arrest the accused in case they flee back by crossing the border, which often allows criminals to go scot free.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal had previously said domestic help from Nepal should be hired only with a strong reference.

We spotted a person in the footage who is shown picking up the bag (stuffed with cash) and meeting another person in the doorway. However, we still haven’t been able to find out how they escaped the club,” KK Rao, the commissioner of police.The complainant, Manoj Kumar Gupta, a resident of Palam Vihar, said that the intruders took advantage of the situation as all family members were busy with ceremonies. “My mother was sitting on a chair and the bag was kept near her chair. When we called her to bless the couple, she left the bag below her chair and went to the stage. She was shocked to find the bag missing when she returned,” he said.The incident took place around 10 pm, following which the family asked for the CCTV footage and reported it to the police around 10.30 pm. “We zeroed in on a man wearing a red T-shirt, who was seen walking out with the bag,” Gupta said.He said that they tried calling a phone that was kept in the bag, but calls went unanswered. “As the phone has the option of tracking, we followed it and found it near a farmhouse in Bijwasan, but the suspects had fled. The suspects could have been caught if we had not dialled the mobile phone that was kept in that bag,” he said.A CCTV footage of the road shows the suspect handing over the bag to another person who was in an Eeco van, said police.A case was registered at the Palam Vihar police station under Section 380 (theft in dwelling house) of the Indian Penal Code on Sunday morning.The family said that it was not clear how the police failed to ascertain the registration number of the car, as it had crossed the Delhi municipality’s Bijwasan toll that is equipped with high-density cameras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/trio-booked-for-stealing-bag-containing-rs-10-lakh-from-palam-vihar-club-101618162354211.html

The suspect, identified as Sagar, had demanded ₹50 lakh from the shop owner — Anil Chillar — as protection money.The suspect is “the brother of gangster Akku” from Sardana village.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that Chillar, who lives in Dwarka, received the extortion calls around 4.30 pm on April 4. “The suspect called Chillar and asked him to share his WhatsApp number. When Chillar did not show any interest, Sagar gave him life threats. He also threatened that he would harm Chillar’s family members if he approached the police... The suspect had generated an international phone number through the Internet to make WhatsApp calls to Chillar... We are suspecting that gangster Kaushal, who has been lodged in Hisar jail for the past few months, is also involved in this case. He was booked in similar cases in the past,” Rao said, adding that police are trying to track the location of the phone number that was used to make the calls.During preliminary investigation, it was found that the number was not issued in India, Rao added.Police said that they received a complaint from Chillar on Saturday. Chillar alleged that he received two WhatsApp calls from an unknown caller, who introduced himself as the brother of gangster Akku, on Saturday. The first phone call was for 28 seconds. Chillar said that he was busy when he received the first call, and he thought someone was pulling a trick on him. But Sagar kept calling him. “The caller said that I’m making good money as my shop has been running well, and he would call me again to let me know where to deliver the ‘protection money’,” Chillar told the police.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 294 (obscene acts), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), and 506 (criminal intimidation) at the Rajendra Park police station. Police are also looking into the involvement of insiders and have questioned the staff of the sweet shop.Members affiliated with notorious gangster Kaushal had been involved in several past cases of extortion involving traders and businessmen, according to the police. Police had arrested the live-in partner and close aides of Kaushal in 2020, for their alleged involvement in extortion cases in Gurugram and Delhi-NCR. They received several complaints from traders and businessmen, who complained that Kaushal had been threatening them, and demanding protection money.According to the police, Kaushal used to receive the money collected by his gang members through hawala transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-makes-extortion-calls-seeking-50-l-from-sweet-shop-owner-booked-101618162352408.html
11-04-2021||Gurugram||Staff training for statewide wildlife census to start Monday||Officials of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, will start training field staff in four forest circles on Monday, marking the start of Haryana’s first statewide wildlife census. The census will be conducted by the state forest department in collaboration with experts from WII.As per current plans, 59 beats in the Shivalik forests and 38 beats in the Aravalli forests will be surveyed.ML Rajvanshi, the chief conservator of forests for wildlife in the state, said, “We will start training forest staff in four forests circles; Panchkula, Hisar, Rohtak and Gurugram, for sign surveys, distance sampling and using of an online mobile application that will be used for the census. This is the first time that a statewide wildlife census survey is being conducted both inside and outside the protected areas, the results of which will help us in forming better strategies to manage man-animal conflict in the state.”The forest department officials are aiming to assess the abundance and distribution of major mammalian carnivore population and prey population inside the protected areas. The census will also focus on assessing the abundance and distribution of nilgai and rhesus macaque in a human-dominated landscape outside the protected areas, which will help the forest department in making better strategies to manage man-animal conflict.The wildlife census will be conducted in three phases, starting with training, followed by sign and line transect surveys and finally, camera trapping. As part of the sign survey, forest staff look for signs like scat samples or pug marks to identify areas where a particular species is found. For line transect survey, forest staff visit particular areas and observe the presence and movement of different animals over a given period of time.Rajvanshi said that based on a line transect survey, a range of the number of animals (particularly simians and ungulates) found in the area is noted, which helps in estimating the population of the species.Bilal Habib, a senior scientist with the department of animal ecology and conservation biology, WII, said, “We will first be training the forest staff after which a beat level survey by the staff will be conducted, followed by a camera trapping exercise by the WII team. We have estimated to place around 100 camera traps across forest areas in Gurugram, Kalesar and Morni hills, as we already know that leopards are found in these areas, but if signs are found in other places based on the beat level survey, then those areas will also be camera trapped.”The census will also cover the status of the population of major avian species like peafowl, red junglefowl, and sarus crane in the state. Habib said that the presence of these three species indicate that the forests are in good and healthy condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/staff-training-for-statewide-wildlife-census-to-start-monday-101618162294269.html

No injuries were reported in the incident. Officials of the fire department said they were notified about the incident at 11.51 am, following which it took 11 fire tenders 90 minutes to douse the blaze. The fire broke out when a resident was cooking food on a gas stove and it quickly spread due to lack of boundaries between structures, said officials.IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO) said that by the time the first batch of fire tenders reached the spot, all the shanties were gutted. “The shanties are located in a field, next to agriculture lands, with no buildings in close proximity. As it was an open space, the wind speed was relatively strong and along with sporadic bursting of LPG cylinders stored inside shanties, the blaze was aggravated further. Three fire tenders, two from IMT Manesar and one from Honda, had reached the location within 15 minutes after the call was received. However, by then, all 100-110 shanties were gutted,” said Kashyap.The IMT Manesar fire station, the closest fire station, is located seven kilometres from the spot, while the Kherki Daula toll is around nine kilometres from the spot. Kashyap said that the main occupation of the habitants of the shanties was primarily storing and selling scrap and plastic waste. He said that just before the arrival of the first batch of fire tenders, a team from Kherki Daula police station reached the spot and evacuated the locals.“The fire broke out when one shanty habitant was cooking lunch on a gas stove and it quickly spread to shanties nearby. Besides the fire tenders from IMT Manesar and one from Honda, two fire tenders each were sent from Sector 29 and Sector 37 fire stations, while one fire tender each was sent from the Udyog Vihar and Bhim Nagar fire stations as well,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said that it took the fire department officials around 90 minutes to douse the blaze and by 1.30 pm, all fire tenders left the spot. A similar fire also broke out in shanties located in Nathupur village on April 3. Over 180 structures were gutted and no injuries were reported in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/100-shanties-gutted-in-fire-at-manesar-101618162293559.html

11-04-2021||Chandigarh||After shawls, Kullu’s woollen sarees steal the limelight||Around 78 years after Hindi film actress Devika Rani commissioned the first Kullu shawls and catapulted them to fame, designer woollen sarees from the Himalayan valley have stolen the limelight and given the artisans another means to eke out a living amid the pandemic. Kullu shawls play a significant role in shoring the economy of the valley. It is estimated that around 30,000 people work part-time and about 15,000 people earn their livelihood by working full-time on weaving the distinctive shawls. Almost every household in Kullu has a handloomIn 1942, when Devika Rani, the daughter-in-law of celebrated Russian painter Nicholas Roerich, came to Kullu, she took an active interest in the looms and it was at her request that Sheru Ram of Banontar village fashioned the earliest urban-sized shawl. Inspired by Sheru Ram, Urvi Dhar started manufacturing the shawls commercially.Providing a fillip to the economyHowever, now hoping to give a fillip to the economy, a young Dehradhun-based textile designer Deshna Mamgain, 27, has collaborated with local weavers of Bodh Shawls to produce a unique range of woollen designer sarees.“I came across Kullu’s beautiful craft and cultural heritage when I was assigned a project on the Kullu shawl. I initiated a market survey in January and got a first-hand account of the difficulties being faced craftsmen. They were facing a stiff competition from cheap imitation woollen shawls being produced in Panipat, which were also being branded as Kullu shawls,” she said.This year, the ministry of textiles had sanctioned a project for training and skill development of the local artisans in Kullu’s Shamshi village, as a part of which Deshna had worked on new designs and the manufacturing of sarees. Around 30 women were trained in weaving shawls. Designs capture essence of Himachal“I realised that a lot of work has already been done on the Kullu shawls, which are famous all over the world for their designs. Therefore, I came up with the idea of the saree that has been a part of the Indian wardrobe for ages. These sarees are unlikely to go out of vogue. I have used auspicious colours and patterns for the saree. My designs have the essence of Himachal. The patterns are inspired from the local fauna and flora, including pine trees, bodhi flower, sheep, deer and rhododendron flowers,” says Deshna, adding that the iconic Kullu patti can be seen on the saree border. The exquisite pieces that span 5.5m and come with a blouse piece start at ₹4,000. “The weaving is so fine and soft that they can easily be worn by any age group. A wide variety of designs and patterns are available,” says Chime Angmo, general manager, industries department, Kullu.“ There is high demand for woolen sarees in winter across India and the new designs will boost the local economy,” she said.The government is likely to encourage the other shawl weavers to manufacture Kullu sarees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-shawls-kullu-s-woollen-sarees-steal-the-limelight-101618160793883.html

After a final approval from the state government, the Pune Metro will start work on the 800 meters stretch between All Saints high school junction to Kadhki Railway Gate No.20. On the stretch of the highway in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limit from the Khadki railway gate to All Saints high school junction of Pune Metro, the work had hit a roadblock due to the lack of road width. PMC highlighted serious traffic problems if Pune Metro construct pillars at the centre of the highway. The Maha-Metro was trying to resolve the issue at a higher level. Pune divisional commissioner, Pune district collector were discussing with the department of defence and the estate department to find a solution. Finally, the Pune district collectorate proposed to offer an equal value of land that was accepted by the department. Dr. Jayashree Katare, resident Pune district collector said, “The defence has shown a positive response to hand over the land to the MahaMetro and PMC near Khadki area for road widening. A piece of land will be handed over to defence in return which they have already possessed for their work. There are few lands which defence has already used for their purposes, but they will choose one of them which will be handed over.” Hemant Sonawane, general manager of Maha-Metro said, “Defence has demanded equivalent land located in Yerawada area in exchange of land required for Metro work and road widening along the old Pune-Mumbai highway near Khadki railway station. Pune Divisional Commissioner has sent a proposal to give equal value land to defence.” He further said, “Defence has a piece of state government land on lease in Yerawada which they want. If the state approves, MahaMetro will get the land near Khadki area.” Deal to save PMC’s ₹127 crore According to PMC road department officials, “The PMC was pursuing defence land for road widening of old Mumbai-Pune highway to complete the stretch of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) from Harris bridge to the Patil Estate area. The PCMC has already completed BRTs roué in their jurisdiction up to Harris bridge, due to the lack of road widening, it is in an incomplete stage.” “Now, the Pune divisional commissioner has agreed to give an equal value of land of 10.76 acre to the d3efence which the PMC and Metro will use for their project work. It costs ₹127 crore as per government valuation, it means there is no need to give ₹127 crore to defence,” he added.

RMC chief executive officer Mukesh Kumar said, “Our technical team is working on its rectification. The machines, that were earlier running uninterrupted, developed snag due to pressure.”The crematorium was being used to dispose of infected bodies while following Covid-19 protocol. According to officials, the crematorium was overburdened due to increasing Covid casualties.RMC was also arranging an alternative to dispose of the bodies through a conventional method. “A team has been deputed to clean and make arrangements of lightning at alternative cremation ground to clear the pendency. Since pressure is rising, we cannot rely on the machines only,” he said. Ranchi recorded 36 deaths due to Covid-19 between April 1 and 10, while 5,841 cases were detected during this period. The district saw five deaths on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, the Ranchi administration, in association with Railway authorities, set up a special Covid-19 testing camp for passengers coming from Mumbai in Lokmanya Tilak-Ranchi superfast special train, which arrived at Ranchi railway station on Sunday afternoon. However, to officials’ surprise, only 32 passengers alighted from the train against the 180 passengers, mostly migrant workers, who were scheduled to arrive.On the other hand, the passengers claimed that all seats in the train were occupied when it started from Mumbai. Majority of the passengers alighted at Gomoh and Bokaro stations to avoid Covid test at Ranchi station, they claimed.Chief public relation officer (CPRO), Ranchi rail division, Neeraj Kumar said, “As many 32 passengers arrived at Ranchi station from the train. Covid testing centre has been set up on the platform and all the passengers underwent the test.”When contacted, officials in Ranchi rail division said the train did not stop anywhere after it departed from Bokaro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchi-cremation-machines-develop-snag-due-to-overburden-101618157852180.html

11-04-2021||Patna||Bihar awaits new action plan on climate change||The state government may have allocated huge amount for ‘Jal Jivan Haryali’ scheme, however, it is going too slow to frame a comprehensive action plan to deal with the issues of climate change and its devastating impact on natural resources. Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, during the conclave of eastern zone states on climate change, had in 2018 termed the issue crucial for Bihar particularly in view of continued decline in rains and asked the department of forest and environment to get a climate action plan in place so that emission of greenhouse gases could be curtailed significantly. He had also favoured setting up of a fully equipped climate change cell in the department. Although a separate cell to deal with climate change issues was set up within the forest and environment department in 2019, its technical wing (a unit of the cell that comprises technical staff, analysts and researchers) is yet to be constituted for want of recruitment of suitable candidates. Climate cell wing head Santosh Tiwari said that recruitment process was hampered due to outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. Moved by the CM’s resolve, the department of forest and environment, which got added with climate change mandate on the Centre’s direction in the light of Paris declaration at the United Nations conference of climate change in 2015, teamed up with the United Kingdom government agency, Department for International Development (DFID), and prepared the five-year action plan for climate change (2020-25). The DFID had submitted the draft action plan by 2019-end to the state government, suggesting various strategies, including plans to strengthen agricultural value chain to ensure handsome return to farmers of their produce, de-siltation strategy of Kosi to enhance water retention capacity, development of agriculture-based industries, productive use of rivers’ silt, promotion of bamboo farming, etc, to help people tide over the climate challenges. But the same was not approved by the government and was later withdrawn. Principal secretary of the department of forest, environment and climate change Dipak Kumar Singh said the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had been tasked to prepare the action plan on climate change. “We hope to get the action plan by the year-end,” said Singh. The proposed plan aims to make Bihar carbon neutral state by 2040,” said an official. Climate expert Abhishek Pratap said the state government lacked institutional framework to implement the action plan and empower its machinery to act diligently. “Framing of policies or plans will not help until followed up with action.” “The state might not be grappling with climate crisis had it been woken to the issues of conservation of environment earlier,” said Pratap.BOXProgress so farDFID submitted draft action plan on climate change to state government in 2019State forest and climate change department set up special wing on climate change in 2019Bihar govt signed pact with UNEP for climate resilience and carbon check strategy in 2021Proposed action plan, being framed by UNEP, will aim to make Bihar carbon neutral by 2040.Kosi de-silting, strengthening of agri value chain, proposed by earlier plan, remain non-starter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-awaits-new-action-plan-on-climate-change-101618157672226.html

PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur has terminated the services of a health manager, who was supposed to identify the body with the relatives before handing it over to them. “I have issued a show-cause notice to the nodal officer and ordered an inquiry into the episode to find out those responsible for the lapse. I will take stern action against doctors and any other health care worker found responsible for the act,” said Dr Thakur. The PMCH had issued death certificate of Chunnu Kumar, 40, a resident of Barh, who is recuperating from a fracture and has contracted coronavirus. Kumar, who was in the IJ ward, an ICU for Covid-19 patients, was shifted to the adjacent AB ward to make way for a critical Covid-19 patient, Raj Kumar Bhagat, 45, from Purnia, admitted to the hospital in the wee hours of Sunday. Bhagat did not survive long. Though the patients were swapped in the midnight, the authorities, however, forgot to make the necessary changes in their medical records. So, when Bhagat died Sunday morning, the hospital authorities took him for Kumar and called his relatives and handed over Bhagat’s body to them. Such is the scare of Covid-19 that the relatives did not identify the body before receiving it at the hospital, but detected it only at the crematorium. Soon thereafter, they disowned the body and reported the matter to the hospital authorities, much to their embarrassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pmch-issues-death-certificate-to-alive-covid-patient-101618157492134.html

The operation was carried out on Sunday jointly with the help of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Earlier on Saturday, four people were arrested by Pimpri-Chinchwad police after they were found to be selling the much sought-after drug for Covid-19 treatment at an exorbitant rate.The two actions – one by Pimpri-Chinchwad and another by Pune police – comes on the backdrop of an acute shortage of the drug as relatives of Covid-19 patients who are admitted to hospitals are running pillar to post to get the vials of the drug.“We received information that a person is involved in the black marketing of Remdesivir drug and selling the medicine at an exorbitant price. As per the information, we sent a decoy customer and held a 22-year-old man in Trimurti Chowk in the Datta Nagar area,” said Srinivas Ghadge, deputy commissioner of police (crime). He added that the person has been arrested under relevant sections of the essential commodities and drug and cosmetics act.“We have formed 10 teams of the crime branch and a drive against black marketing of the drug has been initiated in the city,” he added.Ghadge said that some more people are likely to be arrested in the present case. Following the shortage of the antiviral drug, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh issued an order stating hospitals to provide the injection to the patients and not ask family or relatives to buy the drug. The order has been issued to prohibit the black marketing and stocking of Remdesivir. “To ensure the smooth supply for sale, purchase and distribution, this order has been given to the concerned establishments,” the order issued on Saturday stated.

However, villagers have expressed inability to attend an in-person hearing in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Pune divisional office has received a total of 491 suggestions and objections from the 23 areas that are to be merged in the PMC limits. Around 400 people raised objections while opposing the proposed merger stating that PMC failed to provide basic facilities to previously merged villages. As per the state government notification, the process to invite suggestion and objections began on December 22, 2020 and ended on January 22, 2021. The state gave a month’s period for raising suggestions and objections. In the last one week, more than 400 people registered their objections in the Pune divisional office at the revenue department. After almost four months, the state government scheduled a hearing on April 19 and 20. Pradeep Thengal, deputy commissioner, municipal administration, Pune division has issued an order on Friday. He has mentioned in the order to conduct a final hearing based on the application received. Sus, Kopre, Narhe, Vadachiwadi, Nadoshi, Kirkirwadi, Holkarwadi, Manjari Budruk, Kolewadi, Wagholi, Nanded village hearing will be conducted on April 19 April and Pisoli village will have to register their opinion on April 20. Sanjeev Kumar Patil, chairman Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) said, “It is a very difficult situation to attend physically. We have not received the venue and timing till date. If it is a physical one, we will not attend it. We will request the administration to conduct an online hearing. If it is not possible, then the administration will have to make a decision of merger on the background of Covid-19.” Pradeep Thengal, deputy commissioner, municipal administration, Pune division said, “Most of the villagers are not technically sound enough to conduct online hearings. The numbers are less, so, we will arrange a temporary pandal on open ground at Pune divisional office premises. We will follow social distancing and other norms.” “On the background of the Covid-19 situation and lockdown, it is not possible to attend a hearing which has been scheduled on April 19 and 20. It is very risky,” said Shrirang Chavan, president who had filed a PIL for merger of villages in the Bombay High court. -------------------------------------------------------- Name of the villages and applications- Sus (1), Kopre (1), Narhe (1), Vadachiwadi, (1) Nadoshi,(1) Kirkirwadi (1), Holkarwadi (2), Manjari Budruk (5), Kolewadi, (5),Wagholi (5), Nanded (68) Pisoli ( 389)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/villagers-unwilling-to-attend-in-person-hearing-on-pmc-merger-due-to-covid-risk-101618153891915.html
11-04-2021||Pune||Lockdown fear looms on Gudhi Padwa, low-key celebrations expected||The Gudhi Padwa celebrations will be cut short this year in Pune with rising Covid-19 cases, a weekend lockdown in place and restrictions on movement throughout the week. Gudhi Padwa is an auspicious day for Maharashtrians marking the start of the New Year, it will be celebrated on April 13, 2021. “The sombre mood was set by the lockdown announcement over the weekend and the increasing number of Covid patients is alarming enough for us to not invite relatives home this year,” said Vaishali Patkar, resident of Aundh. “On Gudhi Padwa, we prepare juice of neem leaves and every family member drinks it. Likewise, I will prepare neem juice and puranpoli. If the nursery is open, we will purchase neem and tulsi saplings,” she added. Usually, Gudhi Padwa is a day of auspicious beginnings and people buy new vehicles, clothes or gold and silver, but this year due to the pandemic, this is the second year that the sales have been affected. Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer, said, “This year there are zero new vehicles for registration at the Regional Transport Office (RTO), the only vehicles which are on bank loans and have not been cleared are for registrations, otherwise there have been no sales of new vehicles, four or two-wheelers.” In terms of gold and silver, the jewellers have given up on this month and are targeting Akshaya Tritya which is on May 14, 2021. “The status of the lockdown is very unclear, and sales have been affected by about ₹20- 30 crore a day. Gudhi Padwa and this month are usually most auspicious for weddings and other functions but with unclear status, we are at a standstill as there is no clarity about a lockdown. We have mentally prepared to forget this month and look at May for better responses,” said Saurabh Gadgil, PN Gadgil jewellers. Sweets play a major role on festive occasions, but the lockdown has dropped the sales figures for sweets as well. “Gudhi Padwa is a complete failure. A consecutive second year where sales won’t be more than 25 per cent of the conventional number, people can’t step out. Shrikhand is the biggest mover across Maharashtra for us. Normally we would sell through our own stores, express stores and distribution channel and supermarkets. Last year, we had projected about 12-13% growth on total volumes but fell short by 50% due to the lockdown. Similarly, this year too all channels are closed, and volumes are again down. Fearing lockdown, dealer sentiment has also been conservative in stocking. Unfortunately, unlike other products that can be sold online, Shrikhand needs a frozen chain and it’s difficult to maintain it on the last mile, so deliveries also have limitations,” said Indranil Chitale of the Chitale group. Atharva Gadve, of Kaka Halwai also had similar sentiments with the response to sweets. “Usually, pedas or barfis are our fast-selling products on Gudhi Padwa, people buy new vehicles and usually celebrate with sweets, but this year we have suffered a 90 % loss,” he said. Flowers play a major role during this festival with the demand for marigold flowers, but according to the president of the Akhil Pune Phool Bazaar Adate Association, this year could affect the flower business. “We are waiting for the chief minister to give clarity about lockdown, for the business to begin. There are ample flowers in the market but if lockdown is announced it will be a major loss and waste of flowers,” said Arun Haribhau Veer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-fear-looms-on-gudhi-padwa-low-key-celebrations-expected-101618153831923.html
11-04-2021||Patna||INTACH writes to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to save 130-year-old Khuda Bakhsh library||INTACH has appealed to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to spare the demolition of the front portion of the 130-year-old Khuda Bakhsh Library, saying razing of any part of the celebrated institution will be a "monumental loss of heritage" for not just Patna but the entire world.In a letter to the chief minister on Saturday, the Patna Chapter of the Delhi-based NGO, has also fervently appealed to not demolish fully or partially any other heritage buildings that may fall on the route of a proposed elevated corridor on the historic Ashok Rajpath, from Kargil Chowk to NIT More."The razing of any portion of Khuda Baksh Library will be a monumental loss of heritage for not just Patna, but the entire world, and it will eclipse the glory of this institution forever," reads the letter.According to the proposed elevated flyover project, to be built from Kargil Chowk to NIT More, spanning a little over 2 km only, a large number of heritage buildings and their front yards are set to face the axe, including the iconic Curzon Reading Room of the Khuda Bakhsh Library and its front garden, said J K Lall, Convener of INTACH Patna Chapter."In our letter, we have requested the chief minister to reconsider the decision, as it is the iconic legacy of Patna and rest of the country. It is an institution of national importance, a bibliographic delight and an architectural jewel of our city. We have also proposed alternative to the government to divert the traffic," he said.The library, started in 1891 by eminent personality Khuda Bakhsh Khan, a bibliophile from Bihar who had painstakingly built the collection, is a jewel of art, culture and academia.The historic library was built and dedicated to the city by its founder as a "gift to Patna". Thousands of rare books and priceless bejewelled manuscripts, including Tarikh-e-Khandan-e-Timuriyah, Shahnama and Baburnama, are housed in this veritable treasure trove which attracts scholars and admirers alike from around the world.Tarikh-e-Khandan-e-Timuriyah is a rare manuscript and bears the handwriting of Mughal emperor Shah Jehan, which was also sent for inclusion in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. Diwan-e-Hafiz had handwriting of Mughal rulers Jahangir and Humayun, according to Shayesta Bedar, the current director of the library."Khuda Bakhsh Library is a national heritage, it is our priceless legacy. Besides, the entire facade will be disturbed and defaced. Development is important, but not at the cost of our heritage. We hope the government will listen to our appeal and of general people too, who are asking to not cause any harm to the heritage," she said."The historic Curzon Reading Room and the whole front garden of the library are to be dismantled according to the plan of the corridor. We cannot allow this," she said.The 116-year-old reading room built in 1905 is a celebrated icon of the library and has served the peope of Patna and rest of Bihar for over a century. Its facade also bears the name of the library -- Khuda Baksh Oriental Public Library 1891-- telling the story of the creation of this iconic institution."And, Curzon Reading Room is a pride possession of the library too. It was built in memory of the visit of Viceroy Lord Curzon in 1903. Demolishing it will practically mean erasing a legacy," Bedar said.Ever since the matter has surfaced, the proposal has faced widespread protests from various quarters, including many scholars, historians, litterateurs, retired professors and bureaucrats. Bihar Legislative Assembly Library Committee chairman and MLA Sudama Prasad visited the library on Saturday, Bedar said."An NOC (no objection certificate) was sought from us for the elevated corridor construction. We wrote back to the Patna DM early this month, appealing to spare the heritage and suggested alternative routes," she said.Located in the heart of the Ashok Rajpath, the library is situated in old Bankipore area of Patna and has many famed visitors in its history of 130 years.Eminent personalities from Mahatma Gandhi to Jawaharlal Nehru, presidents and prime ministers and other heads of state of many countries, viceroys and governors, have visited this illustrious institution over these eventful years.Ashok Rajpath is studded with celebrated educational institutions, from Patna College (1863) to Patna Science College (1927), Patna University (1917) and its iconic Wheeler Senate House (1926), Bihar Urdu Academy, Patna Medical College and Hospital (1925), Bihar Young Men's Institute (1911), B N College (1889), St Joseph's Convent (1853) and its old chapel and graveyard, all on the northern side facing the historic road, named after the great King Ashoka, who ruled from the beautiful city of Pataliputra, Lall said."Demolishing Khuda Baksh Library even partially, will be a grave mistake, and the heritage front of other iconic buildings, and hence of this historic face of Patna, would also be sullied forever, if this project is allowed to go through," the INTACH said."As a solution, we humbly suggest that since the Ganga Drive is already under construction, and links roads are proposed at various intervals, and as reported, at a site neighbouring AN Sinha Institute campus and Krishna Ghat, so traffic can be diverted trough these link ways," the letter reads.The Indian National Trust for Art and Culture (INTACH) had earlier opposed the demolition of the Dutch-era Patna Collectorate, which the Bihar government had proposed to demolish in 2016. The Supreme Court had given a stay on its razing last September after the NGO went to the court.All old heritage buildings of the PMCH, including those facing Ashok Rajpath, have already been proposed to be demolished for a new modern hospital complex, triggering protest from many quarters.

11-04-2021||Pune||Students appearing for board exams stressed over uncertainty||Class 10 and 12 students are undergoing tremendous stress as they await a decision by the state government on holding the board examination amidst rising Covid cases and a possibility of a total lockdown. If no changes are made, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Certificate (MSBSHSE), is scheduled to conduct the board exam for Classes 10, 12 beginning from April-end. Due to the rise in Covid cases, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad issued an order promoting all students from Classes 1 to 9 and 11 to the next academic year without conducting an examination. However, the decision is pending for Classes 10, 12. Sampada Waghmare, a student of Class 12 appearing for the board exam said that she is preparing for the exam but is anxious about the rising Covid cases. “I want to pursue law after Class 12. My Common Law Aptitude Test (CLAT) examination is scheduled in the month of June. If the board exams are conducted now there will be a high risk of Covid and if they are conducted later, I will have to give more time for the Class 12 exam and my preparation for the competitive exams will take a back seat. This situation is causing a lot of stress to me right now. I have not applied for the Maharashtra state Common Entrance Test (CET) but my other friends have. They are in a similar situation,” said Waghmare. Sakshi Patil, a Class 12 student who is appearing for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for engineering said two papers have been done so far. “I have been preparing for both exams, JEE and the boards simultaneously. It is very stressful to know that the board exam may get postponed. At the same time, if it is conducted now, there is a threat of Covid-19. If the exam is postponed, it may clash with the JEE papers. There is a lot of stress around his issue and I am not able to focus on the studies because of this,” said Patil. Prabhat Kelkar, father of a Class 12 student whose son is appearing for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) said students are stressed due to the uncertainty. “My son, Ashwin has worked very hard the whole year. The students had to adjust to online education from school and also from coaching classes. This past year has been a challenge but now with the uncertainty of the examination students are stressed and their morale is down. The board should take the decision soon so that students can focus on competitive exams with more clarity,” said Kelkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-appearing-for-board-exams-stressed-over-uncertainty-101618153711891.html
11-04-2021||Pune||Back to square one: Lockdown fear brings back memories of struggle||The 2020 lockdown announced in March last year forced many people to take up alternative career options, and now a second lockdown takes them back to square one. Sayali Shinde, who was working as a physical education teacher in a private school in Aundh has not received salary since June 2020. The school sent a letter to Shinde saying she has been put on non-essential position which meant Shinde’s service was not required by the school. Shinde decided to wait a few months to let things normalise but with school not restarting in full strength, she has preferred to move ahead to explore other options. From January 2021, Shinde gave a serious thought to starting a business and after doing research she decided to sell herbal products from her home. “I have a six-year-old son, although my husband is earning but living in a city like Pune you need to provide financial support to the family, so I decided to start a business of selling herbal products online and offline (homecare and personal care products),” said Shinde. Using social media in a proper way helped Shinde to get her first client. “Whatsapp status has a big craze so I used that space for marketing my products. I did not have money to run an advertisement campaign, so this is a very good option as people keep on following status updates,” added Shinde. New restrictions and threat of new lockdown have puzzled Shinde again as things remain uncertain with the old profession and also it puts hurdles on expansion of her new business. “The situation is again wait and watch, another blanket lockdown will take us back to square one. I hope a middle ground is found out so that we do not have to deal with issues like last year,” Shinde said. From PT teacher to trainer Renuka Gaopande – was happy taking physical training classes for children until the 2020 lockdown forced her to change the profession. With a degree of Master’s in Physical Education under her belt, Gaopande decided to offer physical training classes to women online and offline. “Since the school does not want my service currently, I cannot continue waiting for them as we don’t know when the school will restart again. I decided to start taking fitness classes for women instead,” said Gaopande who started classes with only one client but now has eight clients for offline classes and many others for her online classes. Gaopande currently gives a high intensity interval training (HIIT) program to ladies but now has plans to add varieties of training to her class. HIIT is especially for those who have less time to train and now I have started getting clients who want advance courses, so the plan is to focus on expansion. With cases rising, Gaopande has again stopped physical classes but online classes will continue. “Charges are more for offline classes and we cannot earn the same in online classes. I hope cases are reduced so we don’t have to face another lockdown,” added Gaopande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/back-to-square-one-lockdown-fear-brings-back-memories-of-struggle-101618153651947.html

There is a fear among labourers working in different development projects, as well as in construction, that a lockdown is imminent. Pune MetroThere are 2,800 labourers working on the Pune metro project. Most are from Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.Due to the lockdown last year, the Metro work was hampered. The deadline was rescheduled. Last year, the Pune metro rail administration tried hard to stop these workers from going home, but as the government had started special trains for them, they registered their names and returned to their native places.Hemant Sonwane, general manager of Maha-Metro said, “At present, we are talking to labourers and counselling them. We are taking care of labourers by providing medicine to them. We have also started to vaccinate those above the age of 45.” He said, “Last time, work was hampered as labourers returned home. Right now, there is no such restriction on Metro work.”24x7 water supply projectPMC contractors are also facing a problem due to labourers returning home. The 24x7 water project work is going on in the city. The project has already been delayed due to last year’s lockdown.Nandkumar Jagtap, superintendent engineer of the water supply department and person handling the 24x7 water project, said, “Due to lockdown fear, some labourers are returning to their native places. The situation is tricky. We cannot predict what happens next. However, we experienced last time that if one or two labourers decide to go, it create panic in the entire unit. We are trying to convince them and take necessary care to retain them.” PMC initiated the 24x7 water supply project at the cost of ₹2,550 crore to solve the water problem of the city. It raised ₹200 crore through bonds and also levied water charges. It has set a deadline of five years to complete the project. It was approved in February 2018 and work started in December 2018. PMC allotted the work to L&T and Jain Irrigation.Construction There are 80,000 construction workers in the city. Some of them have already gone to their hometowns. Most are from Bihar, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (Credai) has written to the state government to allow construction workers to work on all nearby sites. The letter sent on the basis of state government’s new guidelines on continuation of construction activity had said they should be restricted to one site only.Credai has confirmed that labourers are returning home.Shantilal Kataria, national vice-president, Credai and managing director of Aditya Builders, said, “Labourers are returning to their native places. We are requesting labourers to stay at work but peer and family pressure force workers to return their native places.”He added, “This year people are more under pressure as the situation is different. We have requested the state government and Pune municipal commissioner to allow workers to go to nearby sites. We have only 50 days to complete our outdoor construction activities before the monsoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/major-city-projects-metro-24x7-water-supply-likely-to-be-hit-by-labourers-leaving-city-101618149811721.html

It is the same with small scale industries in and around Pune, where labour fears lockdown and are going back to their hometowns.“Me and my family are returning back to Bihar by railways, as there might be a lockdown in Maharashtra and we do not want to suffer like last year. So I booked tickets for my family and am now returning back,” said Gayaram Pande, a labour contractor traveling from the Pune railway station on Sunday. Another worker Mahesh Sitane said, “I am working in a small factory in the Chakan area, but as there are new restrictions in Pune, no work orders were coming. So our owner stopped work at the factory from the last one week, and now we do not know when it will open. I am planning to return back to Karnataka and have booked a private tourist bus ticket for Tuesday night.”Talking about the passengers travelling towards North India, Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson, said, “We have given additional special trains to Bhagalpur and Danapur cities in Bihar. As there is a heavy rush of passengers going towards North India, these new special trains are been given by the Railways. In last couple of weeks there has been a considerable increase in the number of daily passengers travelling by various trains from Pune towards North India.”“These special trains are fully reserved and advance reservation is necessary for passengers. People with confirmed tickets only can travel and they are requested to follow all the Covid norms and safety precautions while travelling,” he added. Both the trains, Pune – Bhagalpur special train (train no. 01427) and Pune-Danapur Special Train (train no. 01429) will depart from Pune on April 12, 16 and 20. Sagar Abnawe, owner of Mahalaxmi tours and travels said, “We are getting bookings mostly for out of Maharashtra cities, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Indore and some cities in Gujarat. People want to go out of the state, maybe it is because of the lockdown fear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockdown-fear-sees-labourers-take-trains-buses-out-of-pune-back-to-hometowns-101618147951603.html

They claimed that the concerned hospitals cited the unavailability of Remdesivir and told them to get it. On the other hand, the Pune district collector has set- up a control room at the collector’s office to monitor and regulate the supply, purchase and sale of Remdesivir. The Pune Zilla Parishad is also going to supply Remdesivir directly to hospitals.Swati Shinde, the niece of a Covid patient, who had come to Poona hospital to buy Remdesivir, said, “I have been roaming the entire city to get this injection. I had even gone to PCMC. My uncle is hospitalised in Morya hospital in Wagholi. They have prescribed eight vials of Remdesivir. I have been looking for this injection for the last three days. Now I have come here to see that they have displayed a board of non- availability of the drug. The hospital said they don’t have stock.” Vikram Chavhan was also trying to get the injection. “My uncle is hospitalised in Pawar hospital in Balajinagar and since Saturday I have been trying to get this injection.

Explaining the position of the private Covid hospitals, Dr Vinod Bharati from Rising Hospital in Kharadi, said that treatment of patients cannot be stopped if hospitals don’t have the stock. “We had placed an order for Remdesivir on Friday and still haven’t got it.

11-04-2021||Bangalore||Covid-19 cases may peak in Karnataka by May 1st week: Health Minister||Amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the state, Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar on Sunday said that the experts have warned of peak in infections by the first week of May. The Minister also said experts have been asked to submit a report, based on which the government would take appropriate measures in the days to come. "According to experts any wave will be there for 80 to 120 days, we have to be careful till May end, as this is just the beginning," Sudhakar said. Speaking to reporters after meeting with the technical advisory committee (TAC) and expert committee on Covid-19 constituted by the government, he said the infections may peak during the next two to three weeks by May first week and decline by the end of that month. "They (experts) have given several suggestions and I have asked them to submit in a report format, which I will discuss with the Chief Minister and other senior Ministers and officials. The suggestions are with scientific evidence, based on which the government will take necessary measures in the days to come," he added. Noting that experts will not be giving any suggestions that will hamper the economic activities, the Minister said but they have asked us to control people from gathering at places for various reasons, at any cost. Not wanting to give any direct answers to a question about suggestions by experts regarding lockdown, he merely said a detailed report has been sought from them, which will be discussed at the government level and a decision will be taken. Asked about extending the corona curfew to other districts, he said it is premature as the curfew has come into effect since last night, and only after analysing for three to four days, it will be looked into. Following the video conference with PM Narendra Modi, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Thursday had announced a a curfew between 10 pm to 5 am in seven district centres of the state along with Manipal, from April 10 to 20, aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19. Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology and member of the TAC Dr C N Manjunath said Bengaluru alone may report 15,000 to 18,000 cases a day by May 15, as per the provisional estimates. "Of 7,000 fresh cases that the state is reporting, lion's share is from Bengaluru. By May 15 there are chances of it increasing as per the mathematical projection. Bengaluru is reporting in the range of 5,500 to 6,000 cases, and as per provisional estimate, the city alone may report 15,000 to 18,000 infections and we need to be prepared for it," he said. Infections are increasing among youths between 20-40 years of age. He said if Covid has to come under control, public cooperation is important, and enforcement of restrictions where people gather in large numbers is utmost important. Citing inputs offered by experts on the trajectory of the infection in the days to come, Sudhakar said when the cases peak, the number of people requiring hospitalisation or in need of bed will increase, also we will have to strictly monitor those in home isolation. The experts have most importantly advised about procuring certain medicines from now itself and supplying them to private hospitals too, also about strengthening telemedicine, tele ICU and triaging, he said. Pointing out that Ugadi and other festivals are coming up and people will travel to their native place from Bengaluru and may carry the virus along with them, Sudhakar said experts have stressed on the need for it to be checked. "We will not get to know about the spike and spread immediately, we will get to know after about 10 days as it happened during the first wave. Inter-state travels have to be monitored very strictly according to experts," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/covid19-casess-may-peak-in-karnataka-by-may-1st-week-health-minister-101618145846845.html
11-04-2021||Delhi||Ramzan food walks: Go solo or in small groups, prefer city foodies||‘Are you doing a solo or a group walk’, ‘How crowded is Old Delhi at present?’ are some of the questions that heads of popular food groups are answering these days, as they take in queries for Ramzan food walks in Old Delhi, amid the fresh rise in Covid 19 cases. From an increased interest in solo walks to demand for more intimate groups, foodies, this Ramzan (starting 12 April 2021), are opting to keep it a low-key affair, to be safe and yet indulge in pleasures of the palate. Night curfew is tricky“Since Ramzan is all about eating post dusk and pre dawn, it’s going to be a tricky affair with the night curfew in place, and Sehri happening at the same time,” opines Shivendu Mittal, from Gurgaon Foodies, who is planning a few walks during Ramzan. “I’m getting requests from single individuals and couples, and we’ll be planning a few food walks exclusively for them during this time. But, it’s only going to be post Navratri. If I allow everybody, the group can become as large as 30 people. Since the eateries in Old Delhi are very small, even if I go with a group, it will have less than six people,” adds Mittal. Prabhjot Singh, from a food group named Foodkars, says he’s yet to finalise the location for Ramzan walks that will be either Jama Masjid or Nizamuddin. “Since there‘s a night curfew, people are a little worried this time around to venture out far. So, we’ll only plan walks with closed members from the community. And it’ll be surely after Navratri,” says Singh. Going solo has pros Paushali Lass, a food entrepreneur from Germany who has grown up in Delhi, opted for a solo food walk during the pandemic. She says, “My main reason for doing a solo walk was that I wanted to get inspiration for myself, and that I wasn’t seeking a touristy experience. Going solo had the great advantage that I was given individual attention, and my ever curious mind could ask tons of questions, which the walk conductor very kindly answered. It was also the right thing to do during a pandemic as there was less of an issue of maintaining social distance with any other tour participant. He was also very careful with all safety precautions and we sanitised our hands ever so often. All in all, a great experience and I will be back for more.” Anubhav Sapra, from Delhi Food Walks, concurs that the walks this year will be for smaller groups, and adds: “We recently conducted a walk for a solo person in Kamla Nagar. She booked another walk in CR Park... Whether the walk is for one person or a group, it takes four hours in total. And for a food walk, you need people to stand close to each other. Gol gappe bhi kha rahe hain, kebab hi kha rahe hai, so one can’t expect ki 10 logon ko dur dur khada karo kyunki jagah hi kitni hoti hai!” Food is good, but place is crowded“Obviously Old Delhi is the most crowded in the city!” says Ramit Mitra, from DelhiByFoot, while answering one of the queries over phone. When asked about his plans, he adds, “We’ve got enquiries from solo, bunch of friends, and small groups. But the crowds at Old Delhi are discouraging most people who are enquiring. We tell them ‘It’s your choice’ but do assure that food is clean and hygienic. I feel there would be barely any walks this year for Ramzan, and know that it’s a big hole in the whole set of walks in our annual calendar!” For Pawan Soni, who runs the foodie group called Gurgaon Food Freak, there’s not much option but to take in requests for solo people for Ramzan walks near Jama Masjid. “Given the volume of people and the increasing Covid cases, we’ll be in an uncontrolled environment where many people won’t be wearing masks and we’ll also have to pull down our masks to eat. So, it looks like we’ll either totally avoid the Ramzan walks this year or will go in groups of just four to five close members. The night curfew is another factor that might impact us all together. There have been a few requests so far, and as soon as we announce on the group that we are going for a walk, many more interested will surely join in!” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ramzan-food-walks-go-solo-or-in-small-groups-prefer-city-foodies-101618145977407.html

March-June is peak season for tour operators. Last year there was a lockdown during this time and this year, a similar situation is in place. Due to an anticipated lockdown, many pre- scheduled tours for April have been cancelled. “I had six scheduled tours in April, but because of this current uncertain situation I had to cancel. These tours were to Kashmir. People are ready to travel, but the uncertainty of the government decisions is holding them back. They fear lockdown. Also, mandatory Covid tests for travellers has created confusion. People have cancelled trips in April. There is still a lot of uncertainty for May. Because of the Covid situation the whole chain of tourism industry has been affected,” said Ajit Takalkar, tour operator, Pravas - the Journey Tour Company. Tour operators say that only five-10 % of pre-Covid bookings were done this year. “I had planned a trip with my family in May to Kashmir. Covid cases have been increasing exponentially lately. We decided to cancel it and go when the vaccine is available for everyone. Also, the government decisions have been changing on a day-to-day basis. We don’t want to get stuck. We decided it would be better to travel when there is some clarity and situation stabilises,” said Pratik Arsade, a tourist from the city who was willing to visit Kashmir. “Everyone in the tourism industry has been hit because of this pandemic. Agents, transporters, hoteliers, guides everyone is affected. Many flights have been rescheduled. It has become difficult to coordinate in these uncertain times. We haven’t received any help from the government. Uncertainty has hit this business,” said Vijay Mandlik, tour operator and a member of Association of Domestic Tour Operators of India.Weekend lockdowns at an MTDC resortGiven the Covid restrictions, many prefer nearby sites for family outings. Many also prefer to spend the lockdown weekends at resorts in the hills close to Pune. “Bookings and visits are comparatively less, but we are getting a good response for weekend bookings since the weekend lockdown was declared. We are providing the facility of work from nature. Wifi connection is provided. Also, though restaurants are closed, room service is provided.

This is the seventh case of corruption among senior RAS officers to have come to light in the past four-months “About ₹80 lakh cash has been found during searches at the house of Meharda and Sharma, located in Vaishali Nagar, Bapu Nagar, Jaipur. Shashi Kant, a broker in the case, has also been arrested under the relevant Sections of Prevention of Corruption Act,” said ACB director general BL Soni. He identified the arrested officers as BL Meharda from the 1996 batch and Sunil Sharma from the 1994 batch. HT has learnt that some other officials could also be involved in the bribery case. The Board of Revenue is the chief controlling revenue authority and the highest Revenue Court of Appeal, Revision and Reference in Rajasthan. It has wide powers and control over all subordinate courts.Sameer Singh, ACB superintendent, Ajmer, said the team acted on intelligence that both the officials in the revenue board, based in Ajmer, took bribes to settle revenue-related matters via agent Shashi Kant. “The Intelligence Wing of the ACB was getting complaints for a long time after which the searches were carried out. Their offices based in Ajmer have also been sealed,” Singh said.Senior journalist Tribhuvan said, “The ‘desire system’ created by the political leaders has added wings to the corruption in the bureaucracy. The corruption which was crawling is now running because of the too much involvement of the ‘desire’ system. If ACB is empowered with more powers including technical, the agency can work even better.” The desire system in Rajasthan refers to the culture of recommending postings of officials in specific areas and associated favouritism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-acb-arrests-2-revenue-board-officials-middleman-more-arrests-likely-101618141351835.html

The measures that need to be taken include age should be lowered for vaccination as the spread is mainly from the young population; vaccination should be decentralised as states can take the decisions based on the situation in their region; fine should be imposed in public places, malls and shops for not wearing masks instead of imposing it on cars and two-wheelers; If lockdown like situation is necessary, then at least staggered timings should be allowed for businesses to function as personal economy has already crashed for most people. People cannot survive another lockdown. Ankit Rungta Wake up Pune... From chaos to strict lockdowns last year, 2021 felt like waking up after a long nightmare. But it’s high time we pinch ourselves out from a world of wishful thinking and face some harsh realities. Our city is witnessing an alarming spike of Covid infections again. Unfortunately, the spread is way ahead as compared to last year. Please remember that vaccines only work as a shield and boost your natural immunity to fight against the virus more effectively. So, don’t expect the vaccine to save you from infection if you do not follow basic social distancing rules and avoid taking precautions. Even if the government does a 24-hour vaccination drive to reduce the infection spike, it will only show effect if people avoid going out unnecessarily. Lastly, please do not fall prey to spreading rumours and delay getting vaccinated. So, everyone should correct themselves by learning from past experiences and contribute to bringing the infections down. The simplest solution would be to stop blaming our government for everything and practice self-restraint as a first choice. Rahul S Upadhye Increase awareness about the virus The scenario has been changed. Many people have lost their job, their beloved, their business and, most important, their hope from the authorities. If we are looking for a good ambiance of society, the government should not put lockdown on people and should not shut businesses. Let the market open and increase awareness among the public. Eventually everyone has its own value of life. Nobody wants to get infected and die because of the deadly virus. Media can play a big role in it. Amol Patil Strictly follow safety norms I think it’s no more about what steps authorities are taking. It was always and it is still about each individual citizen following the protocols. Even now with so many cases, we see people without masks, or not wearing the masks properly on the streets. This needs to be stopped. Aditya Gund People least bothered about safety norms Night curfew is nothing but a big joke especially in our area. I have not noticed any police patrolling now as they used to do it diligently earlier. Late-night group discussions are still going on as normal, drunk guys swearing at each other at the top of their voice and fighting at odd hours, parked autos being used for notorious activities throughout the night. Vehicles freely plying on the roads. What night curfew are we talking about here? Throughout the day, people roaming around in numbers, without bothering to leave alone wear their masks, they do not even carry them along! Shops/stores being crowded, rampant indiscipline and mismanagement at medical centres, Covid testing facilities in hospitals. How does one save oneself from all this? It’s this mess that once sorted will surely get the cases down. Lockdown will only aggravate the desperation in public eyes leading to various other problems. Jayesh Kale Penalise violators The only thing that should be strictly followed is social distancing and it is not seen in Pimpri-Chinchwad. There is no law and order to see if social distancing is practised in crowded markets. Taking fine is not the option as people need to be punished. There are cases of violators not being given fine receipt. This is wrong. People are suffering because of the reckless behaviour of certain citizens. The economy is hit. Officials should impose severe punishment on those not following rules. Sheetal Jain Effective steps needed to check virus spread The virus spread can be stopped, but only with harsh steps. Human interaction and travel must be reduced by the authorities keeping a strict check on the movement of population. The lockdown needs to be accompanied by aggressive testing with over 70 per cent rate accounting for RT-PCR. In addition to this, there has to be compulsory quarantining and effective contact tracing. Ambulatory services should be increased. Work from home for whoever possible, especially IT and ITES companies, should be enforced and observed and companies should be penalised for violating rules. Neha Rathod Vaccinate all by following the poll method Just like arrangements are made during the polls to set up booth/ballets and other facilities and election is conducted in one day, by using the same techniques each and every person should be vaccinated. As per the current situation, all 60+ years people are vaccinated. The remaining population can be given the jab by setting up spots/centres and the state can be covered in a single day. Sagar Shirbhate Impose lockdown only in affected areas Albeit a curfew has been imposed in the city, carelessness is rampant during the day. Basic measures such as wearing masks and social distancing are not being followed. In my opinion, the authorities should target to discipline people and ensure that basic safety norms are being followed. The curfew has reduced the working hours of businesses, which has resulted in crowding during the day. Although easier said than done, the authorities should focus more on enforcing masks. Another idea is imposing stricter lockdowns, but in smaller areas where cases are peaking. This will not only help in curbing the spread of the disease, but also allow life and business to continue as usual in unaffected areas. Aditya Puranik Jab possible spreaders first While the government has taken several necessary steps to curb the coronavirus cases that are increasing by the day, I feel it is extremely important to vaccinate the ones who interact with numerous people on a daily basis such as shopkeepers, local vendors, cab drivers, hawkers and delivery agents. As the new restrictions are in place, it is crucial to help small businesses, workers and labourers in order to protect their livelihood without putting any lives at stake. Every citizen should do the responsible thing and get vaccinated at the earliest. The vaccination process, as mentioned earlier, should be prioritised for people who identify as the point of mass contact. Sadaf Sultana Civilians should be responsible and vigilant The authorities should run awareness campaigns in slum areas of the city in a bid to educate people about the deteriorating situation, explaining the reason behind the restrictions that are in place and how dangerous the situation of the ongoing pandemic is. They should also set up more Covid screening centres in these areas as they are densely populated and encourage the masses to register for the vaccine. The onus to curb the spread is not just on the authorities. Civilians should also be responsible and vigilant. The act of loitering around unnecessarily should not be encouraged. Everyone should stay indoors for their own well-being and not wait for the arrival of the police patrol to dart inside. If we really want to curb Covid spread, the lockdown like previous year will not work this time. Last year everything about Covid-19 was new to people and they responded to it as a good citizen.

11-04-2021||Kolkata||Fake job outlets spreading via social media in Kolkata, cops issue warning||The Kolkata Police has in the last month arrested as many as seven people in connection with fraud job portals duping young job-seekers with fake assurances of lucrative work opportunities abroad, a report by Hindustan Times’ Bangla outlet has said. The Kolkata Police headquarters at Lalbazar has issued a warning against such fraud portals and websites that are getting increasingly common in the city, the report added.According to the police, these scamsters earlier used to lure in potential job-seekers with fake assurances of government jobs in various central and state government-related public services. However, since people have grown more aware of spotting fake government job offers, these counterfeit job rackets have now started using prospective jobs in the private sector, often promising lucrative salaries within the country or abroad, as bait. In March, a number of 'tech-savvy' youngsters fell prey and lost lakhs worth of money to these scams that use social media to propagate these fraud portals.The Kolkata Police have asked citizens, especially the youth, to be on the lookout for such fake job outlets, which usually ask for money from the applicants after conducting a perfunctory 'interview’, according to the report. According to a Kolkata Police official, the report said, that such money transfer requests, on the pretext of 'security deposit' or 'medical exams', often serve as red flags for spotting these fraud outlets, since very rarely do any actual job portals ask for so. The police have urged applicants to not send money willingly to these outlets, even if their websites seem very real, as they may even send counterfeit offer letters to drive in the scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/fake-job-outlets-spreading-via-social-media-in-kolkata-cops-issue-warning-101618132778989.html
11-04-2021||Patna||Bihar dumps action plan on climate change, waits for newer version||Chief minister Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government may have allocated a huge budget to ‘Jal Jivan Haryali’ scheme - an ambitious programme to fight the unpredictability of weather - but it is going too slow to frame a comprehensive action plan to deal with the issues of climate change and its devastating impact on natural resources. While experts blamed the lack of an institutional framework for the implementation of the action plan, others said the Covid-19 pandemic dampened many efforts. Principal secretary, department of forest, environment and climate change, Dipak Kumar Singh, said that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had been tasked to prepare the action plan on climate change. “We hope to get the action plan by the year-end,” said Singh. The proposed plan aims to make Bihar a carbon-neutral state by 2040,” said an official. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, during the conclave of eastern zone states on climate change in 2018, termed the issue crucial for Bihar, particularly in view of the continued decline in rains, and asked the department of forest and environment to get a climate action plan in place so that the emission of greenhouse gases could be curtailed significantly. He had also favoured setting up a fully equipped climate change cell in the department. Although a separate cell to deal with climate change issues was set up within the forest and environment department in 2019, its technical wing (a unit of the cell that comprises technical staff, analysts and researchers) is yet to be constituted for want of recruitment of suitable candidates. Head of the climate cell wing, Santosh Tiwari, said that the recruitment process was hampered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Moved by the CM’s resolve, the department of forest and environment, which got added with climate change mandate on the Centre’s direction in the light of Paris declaration at the United Nations conference of climate change in 2015, teamed up with the United Kingdom government agency, Department for International Development (DFID) and prepared the five-year action plan for climate change (2020-25). The DFID had submitted the draft action plan by 2019-end to the state government, suggesting various strategies, including plans to strengthen the agricultural value chain to ensure a handsome return to farmers of their produce, desiltation strategy of Kosi to enhance is water retention capacity, development of agriculture-based industries, productive use of rivers’ silt, promotion of bamboo farming, etc, to help people tide over the climate challenges. But the same was not approved by the government and was later withdrawn. Climate expert Abhishek Pratap said that the state government lacked an institutional framework to implement the action plan and empower its machinery to act diligently. “Framing of policies or plans would not help until followed up with action. The state might not be grappling with climate crisis had it been woken to the issues of conservation of environment earlier,” said Pratap.• DFID had submitted a draft action plan on climate change to the state government in 2019• State forest and climate change department set up a special wing on climate change in 2019• Bihar govt signed MoU with UNEP for climate resilience and carbon check strategy in 2021• Proposed action plan, being framed by UNEP, will aim to make Bihar carbon neutral by 2040• Kosi desilting, strengthening of agri value chain, proposed by earlier plan, remain non-starter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-dumps-action-plan-on-climate-change-waits-for-newer-version-101618134151529.html

Whatever restrictions have been put in place at the local level is a corona curfew and not a lockdown. Essential services are unobstructed in the state," Chouhan said, according to news agency ANI.Shivraj Singh Chouhan also said his government is making “relentless efforts” to fight the pandemic and sought support from the people of the state.

11-04-2021||Jaipur||2 Rajasthan police constables killed in firing by suspected drug peddlers||Two Rajasthan police constables were killed in two incidents of firing by suspected poppy husk smugglers in Bhilwara on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, said police officials. The incidents of firing took place four hours apart at police barricades at Kotdi and Raika respectively. The accused have not been arrested so far.Vikas Sharma, superintendent of police (SP), Bhilwara, said barricades were put at Kotdi police station area first following intelligence input of movement of suspected drugs peddlers.“The Kotdi police received input that a good quantity of poppy husk was being smuggled in a SUV and some cars were escorting it. Around 10.45 pm barricading was done near Charbhuja Nath Crossroads, where four policemen were present for checking. Some ten minutes later, four cars in a row arrived at the barricade. When one of our constables, Omkar Singh Raika (21), approached the car for checking, one of the occupants started firing. Four bullets were fired at the constable and other policemen before the suspect escaped,” he said.One of the four rounds hit Raika on the chest; he was rushed to the hospital but declared brought dead. Later, barricading was done across all the important points of the city, he added.“There were probably seven to eight accused in four cars. At 2.45 am early Sunday, the same four vehicles crossed a police patrol near the barricade put up at Rayla police station area on the Ajmer state highway. Both the accused and the police exchanged multiple-rounds of fire, resulting in constable Pawan Chaudhary, in his twenties, getting hit above the waist by a bullet. He died while he was being taken for treatment,” added Sharma.Superintendent of police (SP) Vikas Sharma and inspector general of police (IGP) Ajmer range S Sengathir visited both the incident spots and are presently camping in Bhilwara. All police stations of the district were put on alert at night. On Sunday afternoon, officials of the special operation group (SOG) also reached the spot.Another police official familiar with the developments said, “The vehicles have moved towards Beawar in Ajmer. Police teams are camping in Rajsamand, Bhilwara and Ajmer. Intelligence has been gathered from Chittorgarh and Pratapgarh, hotbed of opium cultivation and poppy-husk smuggling. One of the cars used by the suspects was found abandoned near Rayla. It had multiple fake number plates. We will catch the accused soon.”Rashtriya Loktantrik Party convener and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal said the strict action must be taken for the “pure intelligence failure” of Bhilwara police and the state government. He also met the relatives of the killed police personnel and demanded immediate relief from the state government.“At present there are a dozen ministers and 40 MLAs of Rajasthan government in Bhilwara district. Apart from this, many ministers and MPs of the Central government are also roaming here. Despite this, the police machinery of Bhilwara district has been negligent,” said Beniwal referring to the ongoing campaigning by political leaders for the April 17 assembly by-polls on the Sahara assembly constituency in Bhilwara.State Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said “opposition and Beniwal were doing politics over the issue. However, the accused will not be spared.”In Rajasthan, the Central Bureau of Narcotics has allowed regulated opium cultivation in two districts of Chittorgarh and Pratapgarh.

11-04-2021||Chandigarh||Badal wants CM Amarinder resignation, accuses him of aiding BJP||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday said Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should resign for compromising the interests of the state by being hand in glove with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre in punishing the farmers protesting against the three agricultural laws.The SAD president who was addressing a press conference when queried also disclosed that the Punjab and Haryana high court order quashing the SIT formed by the Congress government in the Kotkapura police firing case had made it clear that the chief minister was not interested in finding the guilty but was using the case to implicate the Badal family. He said it was now clear that the SIT was formed to indulge in political vendetta.Stating that the chief minister had sold off the interests of the State to the BJP, Sukhbir Badal said "forget fighting for the rights of the State, Capt Amarinder does not even raise the issues affecting the people of the State with the central government".He said the chief minister had time and again agreed with all the anti-farmer steps taken by the central government.Badal said the Kisan Andolan would not have started if CM Amarinder had taken prompt action when the Agricultural Ordinances were being framed.He said at that time the chief minister was part of the committee in which the Ordinances were discussed."Later when an opportunity arose to repeal the three Agricultural Acts in the Punjab assembly the chief minister proposed amendments in the Acts instead of rejecting them altogether," he said.Badal said recently the chief minister indulged in a drama of opposing the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme which he had agreed in writing to implement from this year."Amarinder even assured farmers and 'arhatiyas' that the scheme would not be implemented in Punjab but the ministerial team led by finance minister Manpreet Badal meekly surrendered before the centre in its meeting with Food and Public Distribution minister Piyush Goyal," he said in a press release.He said the chief minister had similarly also surrendered before the centre on the issue of seeking rightful compensation of ₹800 crore to the State on account of Rural Development Fund (RDF)."It is the State's right to impose taxes and the chief minister should not allow the centre to infringe on the State's powers in a federal set up," he said.He also castigated the chief minister for not opposing the increase in fertilizer prices, stating the latter's unholy tie-up with the BJP government was affecting the very livelihood of the farming community.Badal said it was a matter of record that the chief minister had not met the Prime Minister even once to get the problems of the farmers resolved."Punjabis have been left to their plight. In such a situation Amarinder has lost the moral right to continue in his chair. He should resign immediately," he added.Badal also appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold a meeting with farmer organizations and resolve all their grievances including repealing the three Agricultural laws.He also demanded that the Congress government take appropriate measures for the smooth procurement of wheat.He said the seizure of three truckloads of wheat brought from outside the State yesterday indicated that like during the last paddy season, Congress ministers would also bring cheap wheat from outside the State to be procured on MSP here. "We will not allow such malpractices and will oppose them tooth and nail", he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badal-wants-cm-amarinder-resignation-accuses-him-of-aiding-bjp-101618131404933.html
11-04-2021||Patna||Bihar: Half of Muzaffarpur district faces acute water crisis||Almost half of the population of Muzaffarpur is facing acute water crisis as the water level in the district has gone down by 25 to 30 feet from the normal level.The people from eight out of the total 17 blocks have to roam from one water source to another in search of water as even hand pumps in the area have gone dry or draw water with a lot of difficulty.The condition is worse in areas situated along the rivers passing through the district, especially Burhi Gandak. Even under the limits of Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation, five to six wards are reeling under acute water shortage.Sarita Devi (45) of a village under the Sakra block in eastern part of the district says the condition is same with the start of summer every year. “We have become used to of this situation for the last 10 years. We have approached officials in the block and the district, to no avail,” she says.Surendra Kumar (52) of Muraul block says it gets worse in peak summer. “It is just the start of the April. You can imagine the situation we have to face in May and June before the onset of monsoon,” he says, adding that it was surprising since the region saw plenty of rainfall, much above normal, last season.“Hand pumps have been running dry since mid-March,” he says.David Dwivedi, executive engineer of public health and engineering department (PHED), agrees the problem is serious. “We did a survey in mid-March and found that the water level has dipped by 25 to 30 feet in eight blocks of the district. It will go down further to 40 feet. We have alerted officials from our department at the block level to start a survey of hand pumps, which have gone dry. They have been asked to set up a team, which will visit door to door to carry out repairing works of such pumps,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-half-of-muzaffarpur-district-faces-acute-water-crisis-101618131380313.html

This will prevent the market place to be crowded. Rich people stock up but what about the poor like us who have to earn and then eat daily. The prices are also going up due to the lockdown," a local woman said."The need to impose a lockdown suggests the failure of government in curbing the spread of the infection. Lockdown is not a solution for anything. Businesses are already suffering, I myself am a businessman and know how hard the year has been for us," Sanjay Gupta, a local resident, said."The lockdown seems to be an attempt to cover up their failures. I also don't see any logic in giving relaxations so early in the morning," Gupta added.Another local Ramesh lauded the government's decision to impose the lockdown and hoped it would control the spread of the infection immensely."If people get enough time to buy their daily essentials, the decision is good," Ramesh said.Naushad, a shopkeeper, complained that the relaxation time is too short."If we sell during these three hours, when will we go to refill our stock. There must be relaxations twice daily," he said."Prices are increasing in the wholesale market, we are getting goods at higher prices, but customers accuse us of black marketing, it is better that we keep the shops closed," Naushad lamented.The lockdown currently underway in Indore, which was initially scheduled to end on Monday, i.e. April 12, has now been extended till 6:00 am on April 19, said BJP MP Shankar Lalwani.Lalwani said this was decided in a meeting of the Indore District Crisis Management Committee chaired by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday.He further said that vegetable and milk shops in the city will remain open from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, adding that grocery and medical stores will also continue to remain open during the lockdown.Lalwani said that the situation of Indore is worrisome as compared to other cities and districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/indore-lockdown-3-hour-relaxation-to-buy-essentials-people-visit-markets-101618125299925.html
11-04-2021||Delhi||AAP calls for ‘vaccine nationalism’ to control worst wave of Covid-19 till now||Aam Aadmi Party's Raghav Chadha on Saturday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the urgent need for “vaccine universalisation and vaccine nationalism.” He also urged the government to reassess its vaccination policy and include younger citizens in the inoculation drive.“I urge the Government of India to adopt `Vaccine Nationalism', and prioritise vaccinating the entire 135 crore in India before earning trivial international laurels. Do not let vaccination centre shut while doses are being flown out of the country,” Chadha wrote to the Prime Minister in the letter cited by news agency ANI.The AAP leader accused the Centre of prioritising the international community over Indian citizens in terms of providing the vaccines. He claimed that the nation is facing an acute shortage of Covid-19 shots with thousands of vaccination centres being shut for want of doses. “Several states have run out of stocks of vaccines and remaining states have stocks left only for 3 to 5 days,” Chadha said.The AAP legislator wrote that the central government claims that Pakistan has only exported terrorism to India and yet, “we are exporting life-saving vaccines to Pakistan.”The Vice Chairman of Delhi Jal Board reiterated his party's request to open vaccination for all adults as opposed to making only the elderly, more vulnerable, and frontline workers eligible for the shot in the first three phases of the Covid-19 immunisation programme.The AAP leader added that while other nations were stockpiling jabs for their own citizens, India, despite being a manufacturer of world class vaccines, is gleefully exporting it. “We need vaccines now more than ever, as Governments successively impose further and further restrictions on free movement in their States in a desperate bid to contain what is potentially the worst wave of Covid-19 till now,” he wrote in the letter to PM Modi.As in the current phase all those above 45 years of age can get the vaccine, Raghav Chadha wrote, “While adopting Vaccine Nationalism, please also keep in mind 'Vaccine Universalisation'. I appeal to Government of India to not regard youngsters as expendable collateral damage in the Government's diplomatic moves. The Fundamental Right to health is not the reserve of just the old and the ailing.”Raghav Chadha wrote to the Prime Minister a day before the nation kick-started the ‘Tika Utsav’ (vaccination festival) to inoculate as many eligible citizens as possible over the next four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-calls-for-vaccine-nationalism-to-control-worst-wave-of-covid-19-till-now-101618123590958.html

11-04-2021||Delhi||Baisakhi: The festival of food and gratitude||Festivals are incomplete without food. Preparing an exquisite menu for the guests and exchange of goodies is a custom for Indians, be it during Holi, Diwali, Dussehra or seasonal festivals such as Baisakhi. Majorly, celebrated in north India, Baisakhi marks the beginning of the New Year for the Sikh community and Punjabis. The day holds a special importance for farmers, as it marks the time of harvest of rabi (winter) crops. The festival is celebrated throughout the country with different names.“Farmers celebrate this day by thanking mother earth for good harvest. In Punjab, they wear new clothes and visit gurdwara. Gifts are exchanged and ‘Guru ka langar’ is organised where everyone in the community would come together and share a meal. Kada prashad is distributed in gurdwaras and dishes such as sarson ka saag, makki ki roti, maa ki dal (kaali dal), meethe peele chawal are cooked,” says chef Sanjay Vij, executive chef, Vivanta Surajkund. However, with time, some traditional recipes have been lost in transition. “The tragedy of partition not only affected the people but also the cuisine. Dishes like chaati da kukkad, ghee ki sabji, roh (sugarcane juice) di kheer, alsi pinni, among others, never travelled to India and were lost with time. Probably because there was no scripted record for these dishes and were mostly family heirloom dishes,” shares Vij.Indeed, efforts are being made to reintroduce some of these delicacies during this festive period. With such revival in mind, Ikk Punjab restaurant in Delhi has organised a food festival this Baisakhi. “There were lots of dishes which were common in undivided Punjab but since have disappeared. Lahori kukkadi chargha, panner multani rahra masala, mottiyan wali makki, adraki gobhi masala and kunna gosht were popular pre-partition but not anymore. We want to make people aware about them this year,” says Naresh Kotwal, chef from the restaurant. Culinary expert and chef Reetu Uday Kugaji, feels that revival of such dishes has already been happening over the years. “Thanks to the chefs and food lovers, some of them are already popular. Phulkari pulao that resembles phulkari art is one of them. Prepared with four types of fragrant rice, it’s a vibrant recipe,” shares Kugaji. Elaborating on her food recommendation for the festival she adds, “Gur da halwa, chawal di kheer, badam di kheer, kesari phirni, langar wali dal, pakode wali punjabi kadhi with chawal, pindi chole and mango lassi are dishes one should try during this festival.” On this day, people also dress up in shades of yellow and orange. “The same influence can be seen in their food. If you are in Punjab around this time kadhi pakoda with steamed rice, meethe peele chawal, maa ki daal, meetha gujiya is something that shouldn’t be missed. I look forward to my favourite fresh green chana curry which is prepared during this time of the year,” says chef Tanvi Goswami, who reminisces her childhood memories of travelling to Jammu to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi.“I remember going to a canal in Jammu to take a dip with my other siblings, followed by feasting on delicious delicacies cooked by my mother and aunts. Over time, things change, everyone is busy in their own lives and now the festival is a low-key affair,” she says. With pandemic making this year’s celebration even more intimate, you can also try cooking some of these delectable delicacies at your home and celebrate Baisakhi with your loved ones, in true traditional manner.RecipeLAHORI KUKKADI CHARGHAIngredients• Chicken about 1.5 to 2 kg with skin removed and cuts added.• 1 egg• 2 tbsp of yogurt• 1 tbsp of garlic ginger paste 1 tsp of turmeric powder2 tsp of red chili powder2 tsp of cumin powder1 tsp of whole spice powder (garam masala)3 tbsp of lemon1 tsp chat masala1 tsp green cardamom powder (chotielaichi powder)2 tsp saltA pinch of nutmeg powderA pinch of red food colorOil for fryingInstructionsSkin a whole chicken and clean it.

11-04-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party to form outfit after Dr Ambedkar’s name||In an apparent bid to widen its electoral base, the Samajwadi Party on Saturday decided to set up 'Babasaheb Vahini', a party affiliated outfit after Dalit icon Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar’s name. SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced the decision to form the outfit on the occasion of Dr Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14 in a tweet, saying it will have units at the levels of the country, various states and their districts. "In order to keep the thoughts and ideas of Babasaheb Ambedkar active, remove the disparity and injustice and move towards an equitable social justice, we pledge to form 'Babasaheb Vahini' on the birth anniversary of Ambedkar (April 14),” the SP chief said in a tweet in Hindi. The outfit “will work in the districts, states and the country", he added. Two days ago, Akhilesh Yadav had urged people to observe “Dalit Diwali”, saying, "In the dark (Amavasya) period of BJP's politics, the Constitution, which gave a new light to independent India, is in danger.” “Hence, the SP will celebrate the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar as 'Dalit Diwali' in Uttar Pradesh, the country and abroad,” he had added. Speaking to reporters at the party headquarters here and responding to a question on 'Dalit Diwali', Akhilesh Yadav said, “What’s there in a name? The name can be anything -- Ambedkar Diwali, 'Samvidhan Diwali or Samta Diwas are some of the names.” “Ram Manohar Lohia and Babasaheb Ambedkar had pledged to work together. And, if the Samajwadi Party are embracing the followers of Ambedkar, why should the BJP and Congress have problems?" he asked. The SP chief also asked if the BJP and Congress will not light a lamp on this occasion. The former UP chief minister also hit out at the UP government over the alleged Covid-19 mismanagement. "A number of people in the state are facing hardships. We are getting information that the Covid-19 pandemic has once again aggravated,” he said. “It has put us in such a spot. How do come out of it? We have not seen before such bad days filled with hardships. It is the poor are in the maximum distress," he added. "The poor are facing problems of jobs and employment and those who are to make arrangements for it have moved to other states as star campaigners to speak lies," he said. He also alleged that there are no medicines in UP hospitals and new patients cannot be admitted to hospitals. He expressed concern over the fact that people are catching infection even after getting both shots of the vaccine. "If people from prestigious medical institutes are falling ill, who will give treatment to the common people?" he asked, referring to several doctors of Lucknow's KGMU testing positive for the infection. He also took a dig at the UP government over rabies vaccine instead of those against Covid-19 having been administered to three women in the state. Asked about the West Bengal assembly elections, Yadav said Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will retain power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/samajwadi-party-to-form-outfit-after-dr-ambedkar-s-name-101618106737804.html

Today the situation is getting worse. We are also constantly considering Covid-19 task force experts in the state,” a statement issued by Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) quoted him as saying.“On the one hand there is a public sentiment but on the other hand, there is an outbreak of coronavirus, in which case if you want to win this battle you have to go through some hardships,” he said.Also Read| Mumbai reports 9327 new Covid-19 cases, active cases go past 91,000 markBesides the chief minister, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, other key ministers, opposition leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, Bharatiya Janata Party’s state unit president Chandrakant Patil and key officials attended the meeting.“Though we are not going touch the public transport, the people will not be allowed to travel without valid reasons which include essential and medical services. Similarly, we are not going halt the long distance trains or the flight services...by keeping the trains and buses operating we want to ensure that the people stepping out for the vaccination, exams and urgent travel are not affected,” said an official privy to the matter.A decision on the lockdown is expected to be taken at a cabinet meeting next week, officials said.“The CM is of the opinion that the existing partial lockdown imposed from Monday has remained on paper and has not served any purpose on ground. The experts and the members of the task force are of the opinion that a lockdown needs to be imposed at least for two weeks to break the chain of the transmission of the virus,” said a senior leader requesting anonymity.Maharashtra recorded 55,411 new cases on Saturday, a day after the state went under a weekend lockdown.Streets and markets in most parts of the state, including Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur, wore a deserted look, officials said on Saturday.However, at some places people were seen flouting norms.

All those people and many others will not be able to vote freely due to the fear of the pandemic," it said.The SEC further said it had reviewed the legal aspects of the decision and gone through many judgements of courts in such matters.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had on Friday urged the SEC to postpone the Gandhinagar civic polls.In a letter to the SEC, Rupani had said that it's natural that political leaders and their supporters would gather in large numbers for poll campaigning."Moreover, a large number of government employees would also be engaged in the election-related work. In such a scenario, it is very much possible that Covid-19 infection would spread further. Thus, I urge the SEC to consider these factors and postpone the election to GMC in a larger public interest," the CM had stated.Gujarat's overall caseload stood at 3,37,015 and the death toll at 4,697 as on April 9, as per the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid19-gandhinagar-municipal-corporation-polls-postponed-indefinitely-101618098946326.html

What allowed, what's notThe fresh guidelines – issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Saturday night, a day after a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – said schools, colleges and other educational institutions will remain closed till April 30. It said that all social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings will remain prohibited till the order is in effect. “Whereas, the situation of Covid-19 in Delhi has been assessed, reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a persistent rise in Covid-19 cases in NCT of Delhi during recent past and therefore, it has become necessary to take certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of virus in the interest of public health,” it said.The order allowed some activities with restrictions. Up to 20 people will be allowed at funerals, and marriage functions can have up to 50 guests. Restaurants and bars can function with up to 50% of their seating capacity, according to the order. The Delhi Metro and DTC buses will be allowed to run at 50% capacity, it added. The Delhi Metro has been running at half capacity, with the cap remaining in place since its services resumed on September 7 last year after remaining shut for 169 days.On March 27, DDMA re-imposed restrictions on weddings and funerals by limiting the maximum number of guests to 100-200 for weddings and 50 for funerals.Negative RT-PCR report will be required for travellers arriving in the national capital from Maharashtra by air, DDMA said, adding that those without a report will have to undergo 14-day quarantine. Maharashtra is in the middle of an alarming spike in cases, with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray saying on Saturday that a complete lockdown was being considered in the state. The DDMA order said: “Stadia for organising sports events shall be allowed without spectators. Cinemas/theatres/multiplexes will be permitted to open with up to 50% of their seating capacity.”The fresh restrictions were announced a day after Delhi recorded 8,521 infections were recorded, the second-highest all-time daily tally.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal admitted that the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was raging in the Capital, but did not impose a lockdown or any curbs to control the spike. The government later announced a night curfew between 10pm and 5am, which will remain in effect till April 30.Also Read| 20-30% people lose natural immunity against Covid in 6 months, new study findsThe fresh restrictions in the Capital come at a time the country is witnessing its second wave of infections.

The remaining staff will attend up to 50% as per requirement to be assessed by HOD concerned,” the latest DDMA order said.The guidelines advised private offices and organisations to stagger the office timings and the presence of staff with an objective to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time. “They are further advised to follow the practice of work from home, as far as possible,” it said. A negative RT-PCR report (not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey) shall be compulsory for all people arriving from Maharashtra by air. “The passengers who are found without a negative report will have to remain quarantine for 14 days. All constitutional and government functionaries and their staff members are exempted from these instructions, if they are asymptomatic.”All swimming pools, except those being used for training of sportspersons for participation in national and international events, have also been banned. In containment zones, only essential activities shall be allowed.While the latest order said that students from classes 9 to 12 may be called to schools for academic guidance to prepare for upcoming examinations, a senior official from education minister Manish Sisodia’s office later clarified that no students will be called in. “It seems to be a mistake.

11-04-2021||Chandigarh||Will move SC against HC order on new SIT, keeping current head out: Capt||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday termed the probe into the Kotkapura firing case totally fair and impartial, adding that his government will challenge in the Supreme Court any order of the high court for quashing the investigation of the Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) or removing its chief. Reacting to media reports in this regard, the chief minister said he has directed the state government’s legal team to examine the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court and prepare to challenge the same in the apex court if either the SIT probe is directed to be scrapped or its leader is asked to be removed. The case will be taken to its logical conclusion and none of the guilty will be spared, irrespective of their political affiliation or position, said the CM, declaring his commitment to ensuring the much-awaited justice for the families of the victims of the firing case. Expressing full confidence in SIT chief Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, and the probe conducted so far under his supervision, the CM said he was an extremely competent and experienced officer who had been working relentlessly on the case since the SIT was constituted. Amarinder said neither changing the officer nor setting up a fresh SIT at this stage was acceptable to his government. He pointed out that the investigations were in an advanced stage, with four challans already filed in the 2015 case with final reports submitted to the sessions court for trial. The CM also slammed Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal for “continuing to play dirty politics” over such a grave and sensitive issue. On Sukhbir’s charge of ‘wasting four years in political investigation’, the CM said it was the BJP-led central government, of which the Akalis were a part, that had been scuttling the probe into the case through the CBI, at the behest of the SAD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-move-sc-against-hc-order-on-new-sit-keeping-current-head-out-capt-101618088669653.html

Before entering the complex Mudasir Pandith asked the duo ( Junaid & Imran ) to go inside and to get latest information regarding the presence of Police personal and councillors.Police said that around 12.48 hours they went inside the complex and indiscriminately opened fire on Police personal and councillors resulting on spot death of Riyaz Ahamd Pir, SPO Shafat Ahmad and seriously injured another councillor Shamus Din Pir who later succumbed to his injuries. “Later they boarded Shakir’s bike and escaped into Syedpora orchards using interior roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/terroroutfit-behind-killings-of-sopore-mc-councillors-busted-101618086991798.html
11-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt govt failed in putting up a strong case: Bhagwant Mann||Chandigarh Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann has said that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had failed in putting up a proper case in the 2015 Kotkapura violence incident. “Captain government’s advocate general, who has a team of 150 advocates has proved to be the most failed AG ever as it could not even manage to win a single case for Punjab,” he added. Mann said by not roping in a better advocate for such a big case was a well-planned conspiracy of the Captain government. “In the case related to appointment of Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta, in which petitions were moved by senior IPS officers, including Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, the government had taken the services of former Union minister P Chidambaram to fight the case,” Mann said. “Also, in the Ansari case, the Captain government spent big money on senior advocates. If Chidambaram and other senior advocates can be brought in other cases, then why not for important cases like this one?” said Mann. “Parkash Singh Badal had taken back the cases against Captain Amarinder and now Captain is paying that debt with interest. Both Captain and Badals are in cahoots,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-govt-failed-in-putting-up-a-strong-case-bhagwant-mann-101618086507602.html

Ahead of the exams next week, many have approached the authorities, requesting that the exams be postponed. “At least 450 students across medical colleges have been infected and are undergoing treatment. What’s worse is due to the fear of testing positive and not being allowed to appear for exams, many asymptomatic students are refusing to get tests and in turn are putting others’ lives at risk,” said a third-year MBBS student of Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Medical College (Sion hospital). A letter signed by students across colleges was sent to the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) on Friday. Students are awaiting a response from the authorities. The exams were originally scheduled to take place in February, but were postponed first to March and then to April by MUHS due to the rise in Covid-19 cases and complaints received from medical students. At present, all second and third-year students are worried about being forced to appear for their final-semester exams in the offline mode, starting April 19, especially at a time when the state is registering the highest Covid-19 cases on a daily basis. “In March, when the state was recording 15,000 cases, MUHS postponed our exams fearing for the life of students. But currently, when the state is recording over 50,000-60,000 cases everyday, our exams are supposed to take place as per schedule. How is this fair on us?” asked a second-year MBBS student of Dr VM Government Medical College, Solapur. Students have also approached medical education minister Anil Deshmukh as well as other political leaders, but to no avail. “MBBS students who are back on campus are sharing dorm rooms as well as washrooms with others, which is the main reason for the spread of the virus. Some of our professors have also tested positive, and if exams are held, there’s a greater chance of more students and staff getting infected,” said another student. Students have also pointed that many medical workers have not yet got their second vaccine dose due to the current shortage. “Some of our friends are currently in quarantine either because their parents or family members or they themselves have tested positive. Some of our batch mates are stuck in mini-containment zones. How is the university expecting everyone to appear for exams,” added the student. In their letter, students have requested MUHS to postpone exams and start lectures for the next academic year online immediately. “Once the situation is better, we can appear for exams and continue studying at the same time,” said a student. A senior official from MUHS told HT that the university is in talks with the government and other stakeholders to decide on the matter. “We can’t be postponing exams forever, but we do understand the situation at hand. Students will hear from us soon,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/postpone-next-week-s-exams-maharashtra-s-medical-students-to-authorities-101618085427045.html
11-04-2021||Other||New Maharashtra DGP starts inquiry against Param Bir Singh||Amid the controversies that the home department and Maharashtra Police force have been embroiled in, the state government has started taking steps for damage control. After appointing Sanjay Pandey, director general (Maharashtra State Security Corporation), as the acting director general of police (state police chief) late on Friday, the state has also initiated preliminary inquiry against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh based on the report submitted by city’s current police chief Hemant Nagrale. Pandey is expected to submit the inquiry report in the next few weeks. The inquiry was ordered vide a letter by home department on April 1. The terms of reference set for the probe include whether Singh defaulted in his duty by not apprising the government over the explosives scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and if he failed to provide accurate information about the case to his seniors in March. In the backdrop of the arrest of former cop Sachin Vaze and the established involvement of police officers in the case, the inquiry would try to establish if Singh failed to keep his subordinates under his control and supervision. The probe letter also states that the letter written by Singh to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 was not by using an appropriate channel and was widely published in media, which “maligned” the image of the state government. The DGP will inquire if Singh’s act led to the violation of the All-India Services (Conduct) Rules 1968.Pandey has been given powers under section 32 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to summon officers, personnel to record their statements. Singh, soon after he was shunted out from the top cop’s post, had written to CM on March 20, alleging that Anil Deshmukh, during his tenure as home minister, had forced crime branch officers to collect ₹100 crore each month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours.The report submitted by Nagrale has stated that Vaze, who is the prime accused in the explosives case, was reporting directly to Singh. The report has also stated that Vaze’s appointment in the crime intelligence unit was on Singh’s insistence, though it was strongly opposed by the then joint police commissioner (crime). “The probe will throw light on whether Singh failed in his duty to control Vaze and if he had any role in the actions taken by Vaze. The probe will also be conducted to find out if Singh failed to apprise the government with the facts related to the explosives case, in which the leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, had more information than the home department,” said an official from Mantralaya.The probe will also verify the letter written by Singh was leaked to the media by him. “It was his responsibility to ensure that the issue was raised through the right channel and is not leaked out. He has also moved courts against the state government demanding probe by central agencies. This has dented the image of the state government and the probe will also look into it,” the official said.The state appointed Pandey, a 1986-batch IPS (Indian Police Service) officer who is the senior most among the director generals, as acting DGP after tweaking its decision of appointing Rajnish Seth (1988 batch) as acting DGP after Nagrale, the then acting DGP, was appointed as Mumbai Police commissioner on March 17.“Pandey is an upright officer with high integrity. Though he was sidelined by subsequent governments for various reasons, the decision to appoint him as the acting DGP is a strategic move. He is expected to play a key role in repairing the mess in the police force and take action against the ‘errant’ officials,” said a home department official.Pandey had written a four-page letter to CM last month after he was denied the appointment to DGP’s post. Complaining that “injustice” had been meted out to him, Pandey wrote, “You overlooked me for the post of DG (anti-corruption bureau) which was given to a junior officer, despite the tradition of giving it to the senior-most officer. I was sidelined even when it came to the appointment of the Mumbai Police chief’s post. When Subodh Jaiswal chose to go on central deputation, the additional charge was not given to me, but again to a junior officer. That was illegal as per the SC (Supreme Court) ruling in the Prakash Singh case. The career built over several years is thus demolished just due to some personal prejudices.” Pandey had believably threatened to move court if he was not given a posting with respect to his seniority. The government believably has appointed Pandey to avoid further embarrassment. According to officials, the government is also expecting Pandey to clean up the mess in the force.The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is expected to complete the process of empanelment for the DGP’s post in the next few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-maharashtra-dgp-starts-inquiry-against-param-bir-singh-101618085366977.html
11-04-2021||Chandigarh||Courts can’t act as ‘super examiner’, rules Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has held that courts can’t act as “super examiner” and order re-evaluation of answer sheets.It is for the examiner to decide the manner in which he/she expects a candidate to answer a question in a competitive exam, ruled the HC bench of justices Jaswant Singh and Sant Parkash while dismissing a plea against the Punjab civil service (judicial branch)-2019 exam conducted by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) in which a candidate could not qualify for the interview stage by 0.37 marks. The petitioner, Nishant Dutta, had sought re-evaluation of his English language paper. The court had framed two issues in the case -- whether courts should interfere in the case where multiple choice questions (MCQ) are under dispute and whether courts can order re-evaluation of answer sheets in subjective examinations.The court said for MCQ exams, even if there is a specific bar on re-evaluation of answer sheets, there cannot be a complete ‘hands-off’ approach by the courts. However, it is in rarest of the rare cases, where it is shown without any doubt and without resorting to the process of inferential reasoning that the question/answer is incorrect, the court can order re-evaluation. “The courts have never suggested complete hands-off approach. The writ court would have inherent jurisdiction to interfere, depending upon the facts of the case even if an examination is conducted under the supervision of a subject experts. The court cannot be a mute spectator and can in rare and exceptional cases permit for re-evaluation even when it is not permitted under statute, rule, regulation governing the examination,” the bench said. For that, that it needs to be established that a material error has been committed in the answer key, it added.As of subjective questions, the court said it is best if left for the experts who have conducted the examination to decide the evaluation of marks as courts cannot assume the role of an examiner. “For a subjective-type answer, in which the marking has been uniformly done, the courts are required to adopt a hands-off approach while entertaining a prayer for re-evaluation,” the bench said, adding that merely knowing the correct answer was not important for examiner but answering it correctly with usage of correct grammar was paramount, which is best examined by an expert. These factors cannot be considered by the courts. The court can never sit as a court of appeal on the marking done by an examiner and sit in the armchair of an examiner and find the true intent behind his/her marking, the bench added. To the argument raised that issue should be dealt with sympathetically as the candidate missed his chance by a whisker, the court observed that in case of recruitment, sympathy/empathy does not matter. “There will always be some candidates who will fall out of zone of consideration, may be by a huge margin or by a whisker. The court cannot be permitted awarding marks out of compassion, as it would run against the underlying principle of selection based on merit,” it reasoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/courts-can-t-act-as-super-examiner-rules-punjab-and-haryana-hc-101618085307656.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 55,411 new Covid-19 cases; 536,682 active infections||The number of new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra on Saturday continued to be above 55,000 as the state grapples to cope with the increase in active cases, burdening the medical infrastructure.The state on Saturday recorded 55,411 new cases, bringing the tally to 3,343,951. The state was plagued by a shortage of ventilator beds, even as relatives of patients had to search for Remdesivir injections, which are in short supply due to the surge of Covid-19 infections.According to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, things have changed drastically during the second wave of Covid-19. “Last year, the citizens were fearful and did not even go to meet each other. However this time, things are vastly different. Last time, we saw hardly one family member getting infected, but this time, the virus has become very infective and we are seeing families getting infected. We need to take hard decisions to contain this virus,” said Pawar.The surge has resulted in ventilators beds being exhausted in Pune and Nagpur. The relatives of patients sat on a dharna at Nashik, demanding Remdesivir injections for their dear ones. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, some took advantage of the situation and were seen selling the injection at ₹11,000, despite it being priced at less than ₹1,000 per vial. The state government has now formed district-wise control rooms to monitor the sale of this injection.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, put the onus on the government for this state of affairs. “When the first wave subsided in October, there was euphoria created that the Covid-19 has gone. The government in the last five months should have anticipated a second wave and ramped up its medical infrastructure like increasing the number of hospital beds, ventilators, ICU facilities and also appointed more medical personnel,” said Shaikh. He said that lockdowns never help per se in containing the virus. “What did the last lockdown achieve during the first wave?” questioned Shaikh.The total number of active cases stood at 536,682 ,with Pune leading with 102,115, followed by Mumbai at 89,707. The death toll in Maharashtra has reached 57,638 with Mumbai leading with 11,944 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-55-411-new-covid-19-cases-536-682-active-infections-101618085246828.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination drive hit by shortage, most centres in Maharashtra closed||The Covid-19 vaccination drive in Maharashtra continued to suffer due to shortage of vaccine doses, forcing many centres to shut down.The state received 0.45 million doses on Friday night, but they are still to be transported to different parts, which is causing a problem. There has been a dip in vaccinations. On Friday, 272,421 people were vaccinated, compared to the 354, 027 on Thursday.The state has been accusing the central government of discrimination, saying that it should have given more doses, considering the population size as well as the surge of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, after his meeting with Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, said the situation will be normal in the coming days. “Javadekar has assured he will ensure enough doses for the state. The situation will come to normal in the coming days,” said Pawar. Javadekar said it was not time to play politics. “We will make all arrangements as we have to fight this virus unitedly,” said Javadekar.There was a drop in the number of vaccination centres, as 2,881 centres were operational on Friday, compared to 3,647 on Thursday. The number of vaccinations administered on Saturday stood at 280,684 in 4,275 centres. The total number of vaccines administered is 9,921,170.In Pune, there was controversy as mayor Murlidhar Mohol claimed that the central government had directly dispatched 0.24 million doses to Pune. This caused anger as Congress-NCP leaders called it a classic case of favouritism. However, then it later came to light that Mohol was referring to the doses given by the state. On Friday ,majority of the vaccination centres had closed down as the stock was exhausted. On Saturday, the situation was more or less the same.In Panvel, the drive continued to be suspended due to lack of vaccines. A Panvel resident, 50-year old Kewal Karia, who had gone to take his second dose, returned home after he found his centre was closed and the board there announced that it is shut down due to non-availability of vaccines. “Why did they start vaccinating in the first place when they were not sure of the second dose for us,” rued Karia.Union minister Nitin Gadkari asked the Serum Institute, one of the companies producing vaccines, to ramp up production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-drive-hit-by-shortage-most-centres-in-maharashtra-closed-101618085187800.html

She had levelled sexual harassment charges against Chadha, leading to the original ban. Hours after the Takht’s letter lifting the ban surfaced, the woman wrote a two-page letter to the jathedar of the Akal Takht to lodge her protest against the move. “I am a follower of the Sikh faith and the lifting of ban on Chadha by Akal Takht Sahib has saddened me. I requested you to give me a chance to present my side in this case but my pleas were not entertained,” she says in the letter. Under the ban, imposed on January 23, 2018, the highest Sikh temporal seat barred Chadha from addressing religious, social, political and educational functions. During a meeting held on March 31 this year, the Sikh clergy headed by Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh lifted the ban.“Chadha is misleading the Akal Takht Sahib as a case filed by me in the session court is still pending, with next hearing is scheduled on May 13. In such a situation, he should not have been given the clean chit. Secondly, I have been facing social and mental problems for the last three years and fighting a legal battle to regain my dignity. Your move may leave a negative impact on the case pending against him,” she adds in the letter. Chadha, however, has ruled out pendency of any such case. “There is no case pending against me. The case is against the state. The FIR lodged against me was quashed in 2018 on the recommendation of the police investigation team, which did not find me guilty of anything,” said Chadha.On the woman’s plea for review, he said, “I will like to clarify that the Akal Takht Sahib imposed the ban on me for only two years. It has been lifted after more than three years. I have already faced the ban for an additional year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sleazy-video-victim-appeals-to-akal-takht-to-review-lifting-of-ban-on-exckdchief-101618085187355.html

11-04-2021||Chandigarh||SC asks Centre, Punjab, Haryana to respond on plea seeking repeal of provisions criminalising begging||The Supreme Court has asked the Centre and four states, including Punjab and Haryana, to file their response within three weeks on a plea seeking a direction to repeal the provisions criminalising begging.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy noted in its order that though a notice was issued on the plea on February 10 this year, only Bihar has so far filed its response.The apex court has posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.The top court had in February sought a response from the Centre, and the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Bihar on the plea which has claimed that the sections of the statute criminalising begging are violative of constitutional rights.The plea filed by Meerut resident Vishal Pathak has referred to the August 2018 verdict of the Delhi high court which had decriminalised begging in the national capital and said that provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, which treats begging as an offence cannot sustain constitutional scrutiny.“The provisions of the statutes criminalising the act of begging put people in a situation to make an unreasonable choice between committing a crime or not committing one and starving, which goes against the very spirit of the Constitution and violates Article 21 i.e. Right to Life,” said the plea, filed through advocate HK Chaturvedi.Referring to the Census 2011, the plea has said that the total number of beggars in India is 4,13,670 and the number has increased from the last census.It said that the government has the mandate to provide social security to everyone and ensure that all have basic facilities, as embedded in the Directives Principles of State Policy in the Constitution.“However, the presence of beggars is evidence that the State has failed to provide these basic facilities to all its citizens, thus instead of working on its failure and examining what made people beg, criminalising the act of beggary is irrational and against the approach of a socialist nation as embedded in the preamble of our Constitution,” the plea has claimed.It said that a person, who is compelled to beg due to certain circumstances, cannot be faulted for his actions.The plea has claimed that ‘The Abolition of Begging and Rehabilitation of Beggars Bill 2018’ was introduced in Lok Sabha but “till date, this bill is not passed and is wedged in length parliamentary procedures, that has resulted in thousands of poor facing more hardships because of present arbitrary statutes”.The petition has sought directions to declare as “illegal and void” all provisions, except some sections, of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, Haryana Prevention of Begging Act, 1971 and Bihar Prevention of Begging Act 1951.It has also sought to declare all other similar Acts prevailing in any part of the country as illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-asks-centre-punjab-haryana-to-respond-on-plea-seeking-repeal-of-provisions-criminalising-begging-101618084708064.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||More PPE kits, ventilators were given to BJP-led states than to Maharashtra: Prithviraj Chavan||Former Maharashtra chief minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan said that not only in terms of Covid-19 vaccines, the Narendra Modi-led central government has discriminated against Maharashtra with respect to supply of critical medical equipment such as PPE kits, N95 masks and ventilators. Citing the reply given in Lok Sabha by the Union health ministry in February this year, Chavan said the supply to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh (UP), West Bengal and Tamil Nadu (where polls are on) was much greater than to Maharashtra.According to a table released in the press statement by Chavan, Gujarat received 9,623 N95 masks per 1,000 patients, against the 1,560 to Maharashtra, 3,916 to UP, 3,214 to West Bengal and 2,213 to Tamil Nadu. Gujarat and UP received 4,951 and 2,446 PPE kits for every 1,000 patients, while Maharashtra got just 223 per 1,000 patients. Gujarat and UP were given 13 and seven ventilators per 1,000 patients, while Maharashtra was given just two per 1,000 patients.“Maharashtra has the highest Covid-19 caseload, despite which we are facing step-motherly treatment from the government of India in not only the supply of vaccines, but also in supply of quantities of critical medical equipment supplied to each state, as of 10 February 2021. As per the Lok Sabha reply, in all the categories, Gujarat was given the lion’s share of supply of medical equipment, which is disproportionate to the caseload of Covid-19,” Chavan has said.BJP’s media cell chief Vishwas Pathak said, “The ruling parties in Maharashtra have been blaming the Centre for everything from the day they assumed the power. They first attacked the Centre over the GST share, then they blamed the lockdown announced by the Prime Minister and now they are comparing Gujarat to Maharashtra. But at the same time, they are not talking about Congress-led Rajasthan, which has got same treatment as Maharashtra. The Centre follows WHO guidelines as far as the supply of the medical equipment is concerned. The MVA government should concentrate on its performance, rather than blaming the Centre every now and then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-ppe-kits-ventilators-were-given-to-bjp-led-states-than-to-maharashtra-prithviraj-chavan-101618084706772.html

The woman’s kin claimed that her husband used to harass her and did not take care of her in seven years of marriage. We have arrested the husband and detained the woman’s brother for arson. We will soon be arresting others who were involved in the torching of the house,” said the SHO.Anantnag senior superintendent of police Imtiyaz Hussain Mir said, “The body was found in the morning. Once we removed it from the house, the woman’s family members, came with a huge crowd, and set the house on fire. We have registered two FIRs. All will be dealt equally before law.” Last week, a woman from Anantnag had succumbed to her burn injuries days after she was allegedly set on fire by her in-laws at Aakhoora Mattan.

Social distancing was nowhere to be seen in the train, which originated from the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Mumbai. But NE Railway officials claimed that it was normal. They said Covid protocols were in place and data of passengers was being provided to the state government.Passengers on board the train said they were heading back to their villages fearing further restrictions due to Covid surge. “The trauma that we underwent during the lockdown last year is still fresh in our memories. We don’t want to take any chances and that’s why we are returning home,” said Kamlesh Kumar of Gorakhpur who was employed with a firm in Mumbai.Around 450 passengers onboard the LTT-GKP SPL – 02542 de-boarded at Gorakhpur Junction, said officials.Some migrants also cited Covid fear and panchayat elections as reasons for their return. “It’s a deadly disease, I have seen people dying of Covid, hence don’t want to take any more chances,” another train passenger said. He said since it’s time for panchayat election, he can also cast his vote. Pankaj Singh, chief public relations officer (CPRO), NE Railway, Covid protocols were being followed and NER was co-ordinating with the state government in tracking and testing passengers. “We are providing entire data of passengers to the state government that could be used to track them. We have also provided space to the teams of the state government carrying out random testing of passengers. The entry of only train passengers is allowed on the station premises. The move has helped in cutting down the crowd at the station,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/train-packed-with-migrant-workers-reaches-up-s-gorakhpur-101618084406800.html

Officials say arrival of wheat is expected to pick up after April 15.Mandis wore a deserted look as most of the arhtiyas kept their shops shut till afternoon.Officials attributed the slow arrival to delayed harvesting due to rain and thunderstorm on Tuesday. “Farmers are waiting for another three-four days to start harvesting as fields are wet after a thunderstorm hit the region early this week,” said Gurpreet Kang, Fazilka food and civil supplies controller.Except, Mansa, no other district in the region, including Bathinda, Muktsar, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Moga saw wheat procurement.

11-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra likely to impose strict lockdown of 2 weeks||Amid the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government and leaders from all parties have reached a consensus over a stricter lockdown in the state. Although a decision over the duration of the lockdown is expected to be taken in a couple of days, the government is expected to impose the shutdown at least for two weeks.The decision is expected to be formally taken in a cabinet meeting early next week after a series of meetings.After the state machinery realised that the partial lockdown was not working because of crowding at the public places, the state government decide that there had to be A complete lockdown. To bring all the parties on same pages, amid differences among them, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray called an urgent meeting on Saturday with key leaders from all the parties. Besides CM, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other key ministers, the virtual meeting was attended by leaders of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil and a key officials.The proposed lockdown is expected to be stricter than the one existing on the weekends with public transport, private vehicles likely to be allowed only for essential reasons.“Though we are not going touch public transport, the people will not be allowed to travel without valid reasons, which include essential and medical services. Similarly, we are not going halt long- distance trains or flight services, which means migrant workers or people with their planned travel to their native states will not have flock to the stations in panic. Similarly by keeping trains and buses operating, we want to ensure that the people stepping out for vaccination, exams and urgent travel are not affected,” said an official privy to the development.The government is of the opinion that like, railways, even flight services should not be touched as it will badly hamper the economy. Besides, air travel is well monitored as travellers are allowed only on producing a negative Rt-PCR report.With all political parties agreeing for a shutdown, Thackeray has convened a meeting with state task force comprising of doctors and key officials on Sunday and another meeting of key ministers on Monday to discuss the modalities. The preparations of the revised SOPs for the lockdown will begin from Sunday during the meeting of the secretaries of the key departments. The state government is expected to announce a few schemes and relief packages for the vulnerable groups of the community, before it is announced. It may include the distribution of foodgrains, cash assistance to construction workers and labourers among others.“The CM is of the opinion that the existing partial lockdown imposed from Monday has remained on paper and has not served any purpose on ground. The experts and the members of the task force are of the opinion that the lockdown needs to be imposed at least for two weeks to break the chain of transmission of the virus,” said a minister requesting anonymity.The chief minister, while appealing to all political parties for co-operation for the decision of the lockdown, said that there was not alternative, but to go for a stricter curbs. It is a health emergency and the priority should be for the health and saving the lives of people. “We will take all the steps for the availability of Remdesivir injections, oxygen, test reports in a day, but the real challenge is to reduce the number of cases and spread of the virus. It has become difficult to trace the contacts as people have started stepping out of their houses unlike last year,” he said in the meeting.The CM also said if the lockdown was not imposed in due time, there would be a forced lockdown (because of the grave situation of the pandemic) in the state. “Even we do not want to disturb the livelihood of the poor, labourers, daily wagers, but the transmission and spike needs to be stopped immediately. ”Fadnavis said that the opposition was with the government over the stricter norms, but the state should ensure that the vulnerable class was not affected. “There should not be any unilateral decision on the lockdown as it will lead to the unrest among people. The small-time traders and businessmen should be allowed to keep their establishments open at restricted timings. The vulnerable class, which is likely to be affected completely, should be extended a helping hand,” he said.Fadnavis also called for quick steps by the state to stop black-marketing of Remdesivir, and availability of reports in 24 hours to give respite to the patients.State health minister Rajesh Tope insisted on ramping up the vaccination drive, saying it would be an effective way to arrest the spread of the virus. He said that they expect the supply of 10 million doses from the centre over the next one month.Thackeray said that vaccination on large scale during the lockdown, on the lines of the strategy implemented in United Kingdom, will help the state to protect the citizens from the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-likely-to-impose-strict-lockdown-of-2-weeks-101618083326549.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||5,300 hectares of forest area in Maharashtra affected by fires in 2021: Data||At least 5,318 hectares of notified forest land in Maharashtra have been affected by wildfires between January and March this year, according to forest department data obtained by Hindustan Times. This marks a 74% percent increase from the 3,056 hectares of forest land affected during the same period in 2020, the data showed. However, fire counts (in protected areas) correspondingly went up by 16% this year, indicating significantly more intense incidents this year.Forest department officials attributed this trend to a warmer than usual summer season, which set in quickly and earlier than usual. One range forest officer in Gondia district, where three labourers lost their lives to a forest fire on Thursday, said, “The ground is very dry this year. Last year, there were some episodes of rain even in February and March which helped, but this year the fires are spreading extremely quickly.”Yet another range officer in the Nagpur forest division claimed that community dependence on protected areas has also seen an uptick this year, with the pandemic forcing several people back to their villages. “There are more people engaged in foraging for non-timber forest produce, like tendu leaves and mahua flowers. Because there is more human activity, the fires are leaving behind a larger footprint,” the official said. Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests, Maharashtra, agreed these are both likely explanations, and concurred that the ongoing fire season is markedly more intense than he has witnessed in recent years. “Another possibility is that because there were such few fires last year, largely due to intermittent rains, the current fuel load is more than usual. This gives fires more room to spread and do damage,” he said. As per the data, Gadchiroli’s Sironcha forest division was the most affected, with 551 hectares of land coming under the influences of forest fires. The Nagpur forest division (under the Nagpur circle) and the Jalgaon forest division (under Dhule circle) also faced comparable losses, with 398 and 447 hectares of area lost to fire, respectively. The same figures for these divisions during January to March last year stood at 5 and 24 hectares respectively.Similar upticks are seen across several forest divisions in Maharashtra this year, including Amravati, Buldhana, Melghat, Brahmapuri, Allapalli, Gondia, Nashik, Pusad, Gugamal, Sipna, Thane and the Tadoba Tiger Reserve buffer area. The findings are in line with a Hindustan Times’ report from March 30, which analysed publicly available satellite data to demonstrate a consistent increase in fire counts across the state. The report also identified emerging fire hotspots, namely Thane, Raigad and Pune districts, which are not considered historically fire-prone.However, the forest department’s own figures — which are confined only to legally notified forests — showed that the impact of fires remain largely confined to the state’s eastern districts. Notably this year, even areas like Melghat, where the fire department has seen relative success in mitigating the impact of forest fires in recent year, are once again seeing an uptick in the quantum of forest area affected by wildfires||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/5300-hectares-of-forest-area-in-maharashtra-affected-by-fires-in-2021-data-101618083206499.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders ACP to take sensitisation course on crimes against women||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed a local assistant commissioner of police (ACP) from Aurangabad to undergo a sensitisation course on crimes against women after noticing that he had tried to shield a politically influential rape accused, and harassed the survivor instead of arresting the accused.The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar issued the directive after noticing that ACP Nishikant Bhujbal not only tried to wrap up the rape case against the local Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader by filing a summary report, but also harassed the complainant by repeatedly calling her to the police station under the guise of investigation.The order came on a petition filed by the survivor seeking transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in view of the attempts made to shield the accused. She also sought an enquiry into the conduct of the ACP who took over investigation of the case, in blatant violation of prevailing norms that crimes against women are to be probed by women police officers.The woman alleged that the NCP leader raped her on November 14, 2020, but the first information report (FIR) was registered on December 26 as she apprehended threat to her life. However, after police’s attempts to shield the accused, she had moved the HC.HC found substance in her contention and said, “We do not find a single convincing and plausible reason as to why the investigating officer (IO) (Bhujbal), while conducting investigation into a heinous offence punishable under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, refrained from arresting the accused.” The bench added, “We are also intrigued by the fact that the first IO, a lady officer, was suddenly removed without any reason within four days and the present IO, Bhujbal, was appointed.”The judges also pointed that the statement of the survivor under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was recorded on January 15 this year, in which she had reiterated her allegations, but instead of relying on her statement, Bhujbal chose to rely upon the plea of alibi put forth by the accused that he was not in Aurangabad on the day of the incident but that he had spent the day in company of some national and state level leaders of his party.“This shows either his insensitivity to the offences committed against women or that he was manipulated by the accused,” said the bench, expressing the need to make the ACP undergo a sensitisation course.HC, however, disposed of the petition as the ACP has, during pendency of the proceedings, filed a summary report seeking to close the rape case. HC has directed the magistrate concerned to handover a copy of the report to the survivor so as to enable her to oppose the closure of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-acp-to-take-sensitisation-course-on-crimes-against-women-101618083086534.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Family court lawyers write to Bombay HC over delays, infra issues||Family Court Bar Association has recently written to the Bombay high court (HC) raising concerns about functioning of the family court at Bandra and difficulties faced by the litigants due to delay in deciding the proceedings. In a representation dated March 23 addressed to the guardian judge of the family court, the association has mainly raised issues related to delay in getting the family court proceedings started. The association, in the letter, claimed that after filing the petition, the first date is allotted only after four to five months of lodging of the case.“In the filing department there are limited staff for checking and numbering, due to which first date of the hearing we get after four-five months from the date of filing. Because of the delay in checking and removal of office objections, if any, great hardship is caused to the litigants who are already under emotional turmoil,” states the representation. The association has requested HC to take necessary action to speed up the process and also suggested that the family court should become paperless. It has also sought to set up a computer department which could facilitate e-filing of petitions and virtual hearing of the cases. “It is also a need of the hour to work towards the concept of paper-free court to save our forest, trees and environment. It is also required for the advanced office functioning concept and space management,” the association said in the letter. The association has also sought reforms in functioning of marriage counsellors and uniform procedure for all the seven courts which are functioning at the family court at Bandra. It has also sought clarity on starting eighth court at Bandra and a new building for the court complex.The association claimed that the infrastructure for eight courts is ready since the past three years but the eighth court is still not set up. It is needed to reduce pendency of cases. The association cited that the foundation stone for the new family court building was laid in 2013 and sought the status of the proposed building and progress of construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/family-court-lawyers-write-to-bombay-hc-over-delays-infra-issues-101618083027242.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: EOW books 5 firms for siphoning ₹5 crore from Labour Board||An assistant labour commissioner has lodged a complaint with the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police against five firms allegedly involved in siphoning off ₹5 crore from the board’s bank account using bogus cheques and forged signatures. Bank officials are also suspected to be involved in the alleged fraud.The complainant, assistant labour commissioner Ashok Doke, 53, is holding additional charge of president of the Goods Clearing and Forwarding Establishment Labour Board which looks after the overall welfare and regulation of unsecured labour workers. Labour workers’ provident fund and other funds meant for their welfare are deposited with the board which, in turn, has deposited the same in a saving account with Bank of Baroda.Last month when board’s accountant and his assistant went to the bank’s Masjid Bundar branch to get the passbook updated, they found out that ₹5.06 crore had been deducted from the account. “Further probe revealed that the amount was transferred from the account on different occasions between January 7 and March 2. The unauthorised transactions were carried out using cheques,” said an EOW officer. The board member informed the bank that the cheque book of the said account is at the board’s office and the board as not issued any cheques to anyone. This indicated that bogus cheques were used for the fraud, the officer added.A total of eight cheques were used, and with the help of forged signatures, the money was transferred to different bank accounts of Bank of Baroda in Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, the complaint states.The funds are transferred in bank accounts belonging to Rashid Khan Constructions, Arunoday Shikshan Samiti, Dongergaon, Bhilayi, Maharshi Enterprises General Suppliers, Balaghat, Jayshakti Constructions and Kaushalendra Dekate, Balaghat. All these have been named as accused in the FIR, a copy of which is with HT.The complainant alleged that the bank’s branch manager and other staff did not work as per due procedure and failed to verify or carry out authenticity checks and processed the cheques. “We have sought details of the fraudulent transactions from the bank as well as details of the beneficiary account holders, details of the bank personnel who were involved in processing the duplicate cheques having forged signatures,” said an EOW officer.

11-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 34 years on, court acquits two booked for assault||Thirty-four years after they were booked by the police for allegedly stabbing a hotel manager at Bhandup, the Mumbai sessions court earlier this week acquitted two accused for want of evidence. The victim, Jaya Shetty, was stabbed while he was sitting at the counter of the hotel on August 10, 1985. He was taken to Rajawadi Hospital where he told the police that he was assaulted by four persons namely Arjun Lokhande, Bal Kadam, Rohidas Kharat and Mahesh Khare.Shetty in his statement to police claimed he knew all the accused and he was attacked over issues related to his previous business related to liquor. Based on this, the police arrested Lokhande, Kadam, Kharat and Khare.During trial, Lokhande and Kadam died hence a case against them was abated. Kharat and Khare were prosecuted for the assault. Both of them were, however, granted bail in 1986 after which they absconded.They were rearrested in 2019 and put to trial before the sessions court. The trial could only commence late in 2019.During the trial, the court issued summons to witnesses such as the complainant, eye witnesses who took the victim to Rajawadi Hospital for treatment. However, the prosecution failed to trace the witnesses and filed a report saying the witnesses were not traceable.The prosecution could only examine the investigating officer of the case while no other witnesses were available to depose before the court.The court noted that no examination of key witnesses such as the victim, eye witnesses, medical officer and other relevant witnesses is fatal to prosecution case. Hence, the court said no evidence was put forth by the prosecution against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-34-years-on-court-acquits-two-booked-for-assault-101618082906511.html
11-04-2021||Mumbai||Air India should obey SC ticket-refund order: Legal consumer organisations||National carrier Air India is continuing to protect the air ticket money of passengers affected due to the lockdown, even after the deadline of March 31, 2021. The Supreme Court had, on October 1 last year, issued an order directing all airlines to provide full refund to passengers and allowed only airlines facing financial issues to refund or provide credit shells till March 2021. “The face-value of the ticket is protected against any travel planned in future by the passengers. To provide reassurance and comfort to passengers during the pandemic days, Air India had extended the validity of tickets till March 31, 2021. However, as it was observed that the Covid situation was continuing, the validity for all tickets was further extended up to December 31, 2021, by a circular dated June 17, 2020,” the airline spokesperson said in response to the paper’s query. “While Air India extended benefits to passengers in the form of name, however, Air India has never offered a credit shell to passengers due to its specific system configuration. Hence, the concept of credit shell is not applicable for Air India’s domestic and international passengers,” the spokesperson said.Air India also said that based on continuous feedback from the passengers, additional facilities like change of sector, name dates were added. “It may be noted that unlike some other airlines, Air India did not sell any inventory during the lockdown period. Such extension of validity of tickets was also approved for travel on Vande Bharat Mission flights,” added the airline spokesperson. However, the airline did not comment when asked if they had taken SC’s permission for continuing to give benefits to passengers even after the Apex court’s order.Paragraph 13 A(d) of the refund order states that by the end of March 2021, the airlines should refund cash to the holder of the credit shell. “As per the Supreme Court order there is no differentiation between Air India and private airlines or domestic and international airlines. The order is crystal clear and states that all airlines are supposed to refund passengers immediately. However, the airlines who are undergoing financial crisis can, for the tickets that are booked during the lockdown, issue credit shells for a period up to March 31, 2021. It is the duty of the airline to return their money with interest now. There is no way and means that the airline can give other benefits or credit shells to the passengers. No circular, as mentioned by the airline, is above the Apex court’s order. Air India has to get permission from the court for still issuing credit otherwise it is contempt of court,” said Jose Abraham, president of Pravasi Legal Cell, who filed the matter in the SC.Advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), said, “In short, Air India admits it has decided to utilise crores of lakhs of passengers’ money without their consent which is in flagrant violation of the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court order dated October 1, 2020. Air India, being the national carrier, is also “state” under Indian Constitution and as such has special obligations towards passengers. If Air India persists with such a policy of denial of legitimate refund of lakhs of passengers, MGP will be constrained to approach the Supreme Court once again for ensuring strict compliance by Air India. Air India needs to be reminded that it’s not above the law of the land and there cannot be a separate rule of refund for Air India in any circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-india-should-obey-sc-ticket-refund-order-legal-consumer-organisations-101618082846488.html

He had alleged that court orders of September 25, 2018, January 30 and September 17, 2020 have been violated by the police as the Special Investigating Team (SIT) had not made any tangible progress and has failed to arrest anyone to date. The twin blasts occurred on January 31, ahead of the February 4 assembly elections in Punjab in 2017 in which seven persons were killed and 25 were injured. The SIT filed a challan before trial court on January 29, 2020 but none of the accused persons have been arrested.Police have told the court that passports of accused Gurtej Singh and Amrik Singh have already been revoked and revocation proceedings of the passport of the third accused Avtar Singh has also been initiated.

Speaking to the media, law minister A K Balan said there was no need for the minister to resign now. “No law states that a relative can’t be appointed. He did not even complete one month after his appointment. There is no need of resignation based on the observations of a lower court,” said the minister. Later, Jaleel also took to social media saying he will approach the high court on Monday against the verdict. The Lokayukta on Friday found him guilty of nepotism and abuse of power in the appointment of his second cousin K T Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited. It also observed that he can’t continue in the post and recommended the chief minister to take appropriate action against him. Balan, however, said the CM has three months to take a decision on this and there was no need for the minister to rush to tender his resignation. Even as the government defended the minister, the opposition stepped up pressure for his resignation. “If an iota of morality was left in the CM he should sack the minister immediately,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, also hailing from the state, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan should expel him for violating his oath of office. There was a big uproar when Adeeb was appointed allegedly flouting all norms and later he was forced to resign in 2018. Later in 2019, a lawyer V K Mohammad Shafi, known to be close to Muslim League,had field a compliant with the Lokayukta which on Friday agreed with the contention of the petitioner that he was appointed flouting all norms. A controversial minister, his name was also figured in the gold smuggling case. After the gold smuggling case involving the UAE consulate came to light in March 2020; Jaleel was questioned by the customs and Enforcement Directorate on several occasions. Trouble began for him after phone call records of Swapna Suresh, main accused in the case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently in her list. Soon after the list came out, the minister said he called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate in the state capital. Hailing from Muslim -majority Malappuram district, he had earlier created enough headaches for the government in alleged mark donation move to a failed student and other cases but his proximity to the CM saved him from major troubles. A former member of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) he later joined the Muslim League. He later left the League and joined the LDF camp and he was instrumental in CPI(M) getting some inroads in Muslim heartland of Malappuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-kerala-govt-backs-jaleel-oppn-demands-his-resignation-101618081286334.html
11-04-2021||Other||Former Andhra Intel chief seeks CBI probe into forgery case||Hyderabad Hyderabad: Senior IPS officer and former intelligence chief of Andhra Pradesh A B Venkateshwara Rao on Saturday asked for a comprehensive probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged forgery of documents by certain senior police officials of the state to fix him in a corruption case. Rao wrote a letter to this effect to state chief secretary Adityanath Das. He submitted a set of documents which were allegedly fabricated by the police officials and submitted to the inquiry committee of vigilance and enforcement making false charges against him. The former intelligence chief, who is presently under suspension, named Director General Police Gautam Sawang, Additional DGP of Crime Investigation Department Sunil Kumar and ACB director general P Seetha Ramanjaneyulu among others. Requesting that the matter be entrusted to the CBI for thorough investigation, Rao suggested that the senior police officers be shifted from their present positions so as to ensure fair and timely investigation. Rao, who served as state intelligence chief during the Telugu Desam Party regime, was suspended on February 8 last year for his alleged irregularities in procurement of security equipment from an Israeli company during his tenure. The Jagan government, which entrusted the case to Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleged that Rao had wilfully disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of police to the foreign defence manufacturing firm. Rao challenged his suspension in the Central Administrative Tribunal on February 13, but the CAT dismissed his petition in March. Later, he moved the high court, which revoked his suspension in July. The Andhra Pradesh government challenged this order in the Supreme Court, which lifted stay on his suspension in November, pending inquiry. In January, the state government extended the suspension of Rao for another six months pending inquiry. It told the Supreme Court that it would complete the investigation and submit a comprehensive report to the court before May 3, when the case was posted for next hearing. The ex-intelligence chief said even as the inquiry committee began hearing the arguments on March 18 this year, the ACB conducted searches on his residences in Vijayawada and Hyderabad on March 18 and seized a laptop and a desktop containing the notes and questionnaires he had prepared for the inquiry. “They also seized some documents which I kept ready for filing with the Inquiring Authority as defence documents,” he said. He said he had participated in the inquiry which was held continuously from March 22 to April 4. “During the course of arguments, I found that the police authorities who had deposed before the panel had resorted to forgery, fraud, tampering of witnesses and evidence,” he said, adding that he would prove his charges, if the CBI inquiry was ordered. When contacted, Director General of Police Gautam Sawang said he would not like to comment on the letter written by Rao to the government at this stage, as the inquiry process was going on. “It is against the service rules of the government servants to comment on the issue which is under inquiry,” he said. Another senior police official, who was named in the letter, said on condition of anonymity that Rao should not have leaked the letter to social media and mainstream media at a time when he was the facing certain allegations. “The fundamental to the whole issue is that Rao had entered into an agreement with an Israeli company for supply of some high-cost security equipment and his son was an agent of the company in India. It has been proved. He is only trying to divert the issue by making all sorts of charges against others,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-andhra-intel-chief-seeks-cbi-probe-into-forgery-case-101618081226247.html

It has been two months since the MC took over solid waste management in the city, after A2Z Company self-terminated its contract, but the process has not been streamlined yet.In many parts of the city including Shivpuri, Model Town and Field Ganj, heaps of garbage dumped on the road side disturbs movement of vehicles and the foul smell emanating from it irks residents. There are over 40 secondary dumping sites in the city where waste collected from houses is dumped. From there, it is shifted to the main dump site at Tajpur Road. The civic body has not tackled the problem despite several complaints submitted by residents. Deepak, a resident of Shivpuri area, said, “We have complained against the Shivpuri garbage dumping site as a cremation ground is also situated near it and foul smell spreads in the area. The movement of traffic is also hit as the dump is situated on roadside and waste dumped in the open covers half the road. It becomes difficult to cross the area on a two-wheeler due to foul smell. But, the authorities are not paying heed to the problem.”Shopkeepers of the scooter market in Model town area said civic body officials remained on their toes when the A2Z company terminated its contract in February and in March, when the third inspection under Swachh Survekshan-2021 was scheduled to be held, but the situation has deteriorated again.President of the market association, Satinderpal Singh, said, “The road from Chatar Singh park to scooter market was blocked for hours as garbage was spread in the entire area. It becomes difficult to work at the market as the dump is situated just adjoining to it and foul smell spreads in the area. Repeated complaints have been submitted with the MC to find a solution or ensure regular lifting of garbage.”Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “I will direct officials to keep a check on lifting of garbage, so that residents and commuters don’t face any problem. The civic body is working to appoint a new contractor for lifting of garbage and we are also working on a project to install static compactors at 22 sites in the city to stop open dumping of garbage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tardy-lifting-of-garbage-irks-ludhiana-residents-101618080570627.html

11-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi's Covid-19 positivity rate jumps to 10.2%; 7,897 new cases recorded||Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive – jumped to 10.2% on Saturday, registering a double digit ratio for the first time in 138 days since November 24. There were 7,897 new cases of coronavirus disease and 39 deaths due to the infection reported on Saturday, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government.Experts had expected the number of cases to cross the previous peak of the city of 8,593 cases reported on November 11 when the city saw its third surge in cases. However, the drop in the cases as well as the sudden increase in positivity rate, which is representative of the ongoing transmission of the infection, could be because of fewer Covid-19 test conducted.The city recorded 77,374 tests on Saturday as compared to 89,334 tests conducted daily on average over the last seven days. The daily number of tests crossed the 100,000 mark twice within the week.“Based on the known natural history of the infection, the cases are likely to continue the increasing trend till April end; the infection usually follows a 12-week course, with the decline starting at around six week. If the numbers stabilise and remain almost same for five to seven days, we will know that we have reached the peak and the decline will start,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s initial committee on control and management of Covid-19.He expressed concern over the increasing number of deaths. The average number of deaths recorded each day almost tripled over the last one week. Delhi reported 25 Covid-19 deaths on average daily during the last seven days as compared nine the week before and six the week before that.With a high number of cases, the case fatality ratio – proportion of deaths among positive cases – continues to be low at 0.41% average over the last seven days. “There is no evidence to suggest that the infection this time is milder. However, there is less fatality as compared to last year because now people are better aware about the infection and come to the hospital on time; most of them have pulse oximeter and monitor their oxygen saturation continuously. In addition, the hospitals have also finalised their treatment protocols, they know what works when. However, the deaths will continue to increase at the moment. The peak for the number of death usually comes seven to ten days after the number of cases peaks,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The number of hospitalisations have also doubled over the last seven days from 2,727 recorded on April 4 to 5,398 on April 10. The Delhi government has repeatedly increased the number of beds earmarked for Covid-19 in government and private hospitals over the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-coronavirus-positivity-rate-jumps-to-102-101618080341601.html

Prayagraj wing of Enforcement Directorate (ED) has now registered a case of money laundering against him. The ED registered the case on Thursday and the action was initiated on the basis of pending cases against Atiq in police records. There are 195 cases pending against him, said an official aware of the development. “It is likely that ED would now try to locate moveable and immovable assets of Atiq, his kin and cohorts located both in India and abroad, believed to be in several crores. The ED would strive to trace these assets and initiate attachments process,” he said. The ED is also expected to seek details of all charge-sheets that the police have submitted in courts in connection with the various cases which are currently in hearing phase as well as details of cases whose investigations are at present underway on the basis of case diaries, he said. Once the properties are traced and attached, the ED would then initiate criminal trial against the former MP, he said. Atiq is presently lodged at Ahmedabad Jail where he was shifted from Naini Central Jail on the instructions of Supreme Court. Till now, police have taken action on properties worth more than ₹200 crore. These actions were taken against Atiq Ahmed under the Gangster Act. A joint team of PDA and the district administration has carried out around 60 drives against the illegal constructions and other properties, most of them have direct or indirect links to the former MP, in the district. Along with demolishing the buildings, illegally raised by Atiq and his men, district administration has also attached several properties of him and his associates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/more-trouble-for-atiq-ahmad-as-ed-registers-money-laundering-case-101618079666135.html
11-04-2021||Noida||Night curfew spells bad news for pubs, bars in Noida and Ghaziabad||The decision of the authorities in Noida and Ghaziabad to impose a night curfew from 10pm to 5am has come as a big blow to the hospitality sector, with owners of several restaurants, pubs and bars worrying not only about their business but also about the future of employees, most of whom were called back from their respective hometowns after Covid-19 cases started dropping significantly earlier this year.“As 2021 started, we saw a growth of 20-25% in sales figures. However, from late March, the growth started dipping due to the new wave of coronavirus. Now that a night curfew has been imposed in Noida and Ghaziabad, we are expecting the business of pubs to dip by 70-75%,” said Yogesh Sharma, owner of The Flying Dutchman restaurant and pub. It has outlets in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram and Noida’s Wave City Centre in Sector 32.Usually pubs operate till 1am. However, Sharma added, they will have to close by 9pm so that their staff can reach home before the night curfew starts at 10pm.Shailendra Rao, a manager at Black Club+Café at Gaur City Mall in Noida Extension, said, “All pub owners are in a fix. We were yet to recover losses incurred last year and now again, we have the night curfew. The footfall was increasing earlier this year but is back to zero now”.Even fine-dining restaurants are feeling the pinch of the night curfew.“Family dining starts from 9.30pm onwards. A night curfew from 10pm is going to affect our business badly. We are not in favour of night curfew at all,” said Rajkumar Tomar, owner of Mystery of Food kitchen and bar, and Kafe Republic, both located in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram.Owners of pubs and restaurants are hoping that the night curfew does not get extended beyond April 17.“We are all very scared if the night curfew gets extended further. Just recently, we called our staff back from their hometowns and got the business running. The sudden night curfew is likely to affect jobs again. Business at pubs only starts post 8pm. How will we survive?,” said Sharad Madan,co-owner at Imperfecto chain of restaurants and pubs. Two of its outlets are in Noida’s Sector 32 and 38 and one has been recently launched in Indirapuram.He added that customers are visiting pubs and restaurants as they feel safe when they see that Covid-19 protocols are being followed.“When customers themselves see social distancing and other protocols being followed, they appreciate it and come back again as they feel confident about the safety of the place. Night curfews single out restaurants and pubs that stay open till late night and this does not seem fair to us,” added Madan.Anurag Katriar, president of National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), questioned the rationale behind the night curfew. “The night curfew has been imposed till April 17 and I don’t think Covid cases are going to reduce in such a short span of time. I fear it (night curfew) may get extended. Having said that, I don’t understand if night curfews help arrest the spread of the virus. The hospitality industry is the worst hit when a night curfew is imposed. Things had recently started looking up but this night curfew has come as a big blow to us,” he said.“All restaurants are working in a very controlled environment, following all Covid protocols and working with limited capacity. So how can that be dangerous for the spread of the virus while other services, such as public transport, are running during the day with full capacity? The hospitality sector is with the government in its fight against coronavirus. But the government should also look at us as partners and not barriers. They should not single us out,” said Katriar.Experts, on the other hand, say that while the night curfew may affect businesses, it is one step in the right direction to curtail the spread of coronavirus.“Large groups of people tend to stay at pubs and restaurants for a long time and since they have to eat and drink, they remove their masks. Such places then turn out to be super spreaders. Night curfew will help close all such establishments that stay open till late at night,” said Dr K K Aggarwal, former president and member of the Indian Medical Association, (IMA) Noida.Meanwhile, district magistrate of Noida Suhas L Y said the night curfew has been imposed for the ‘greater good’.“While I understand that the hospitality sector may be affected by the night curfew, this is not an ideal time as a global pandemic is prevailing at this time. We have to impose restrictions for the greater good of the society,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/night-curfew-spells-bad-news-for-pubs-bars-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-101618078945844.html

Further details will be shared when we arrest the suspect,” said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.A police officer who did not wish to be named said that CCTV footage helped them identify the suspect.

11-04-2021||Delhi||Man held for abducting landlord’s son, seeking ₹40 lakh ransom||A 24-year-old man without a job kidnapped his landlord’s seven-month-old son from outer Delhi’s Mohan Garden on Friday afternoon and demanded ₹40 lakh ransom for his safe release, said police.After a combing operation that lasted for nearly 13 hours-- in which 80 police personnel searched in the 50km radius between Ghaziabad and parts of outer and west Delhi, the child was rescued from a taxi and the suspect arrested, said police on Saturday.Priyanshu Kumar, who completed his engineering from a private institute in Kanpur, was doing apprenticeship in a company in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh. He, along with his father (a government employee), moved into a flat owned by the boy’s family in Mohan Garden near Ranhola two months ago, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.“Kumar claimed to be in a relationship with a woman from Kanpur and regularly needed money to fulfil her demands. He had decided to settle down with the woman but was jobless and had no money. So, he kidnapped his landlord’s baby and demanded ₹40 lakh with the hope that the money would enable him to settle down with his girlfriend somewhere away from Delhi,” said Singh adding the police will question the woman to corroborate Kumar’s disclosures.Ranhola police received information about the kidnapping around 2pm on Friday. The police met the child’s parents who said Kumar had kidnapped their son.The boy’s father told police that around 11.30am on Friday, Kumar came to their flat to play with the baby. As the boy was sleeping, Kumar stayed back and waited for him to wake up. The child’s mother was busy arranging clothes in another room, when Kumar left the house with the boy without her permission. The woman panicked and informed her husband when she could not find her son or Kumar for nearly an hour, said police.“The child’s father was rushing home from office when he received a call from Kumar, who threatened to harm the child if ₹40 lakh was not deposited in his bank account or the family informed police about the abduction. Kumar also called his father, told him about the kidnapping and asked him to tell the boy’s parents to cooperate and pay the sum,” said the DCP.Five teams were formed who scanned CCTV footages and found that Kumar had walked for nearly 4kms up to Uttam Nagar bus terminal, from where he booked a cab through a mobile application that dropped him to Ghaziabad.Two teams reached Ghaziabad and carried out searches in areas around Sahibabad and Anand Vihar suspecting that he may have boarded a train or bus to flee. After questioning many people, the police learnt that Kumar had boarded another taxi that was not booked via a mobile application.“Since Kumar was making WhatsApp calls to seek updates about the money transfer, ₹40,000 was deposited in his account to make him believe that his demands were being fulfilled. It also helped us trace his location around Delhi airport. All our team members started searching vehicles around the airport and its adjacent areas,” said additional DCP Dhama.Around 7.30pm, a police team spotted Kumar with the child in a taxi and started chasing it. Anticipating trouble, Kumar abandoned the child in the taxi near Lajwanti Chowk in west Delhi and fled while the police team was about 50m away. “We quickly took the child and the driver in our custody,” said Dhama.For the next seven hours, the police searched many shops and buildings in areas around Lajwanti Chowk to look for Kumar, who was finally nabbed from Pankha Road near Uttam Nagar teminal, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-held-for-abducting-landlord-s-son-seeking-rs-40-lakh-ransom-101618078466467.html

It has been decided that counters will be set up in Narela mandi from April 12 (Monday). The registrations will be open from 10am to 5pm, and coupons will be given to the famers there itself.

At present, the MSP declared by the Central government is ₹1975 per quintal and the 50% bonus comes to ₹987.50 per quintal and this should be paid to the farmers immediately,” said Bidhuri.Vijender Gupta, BJP MLA from Rohini said Kejriwal should also fulfil his promise of providing free electricity to the city’s farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-facilitate-sale-of-wheat-at-msp-101618078465889.html

11-04-2021||Pune||Employees from small scale industries suffer due to RT-PCR Covid-19 test mandate||Many employees from the small scale industries had a tough start to day one of weekend lockdown, as they were stopped by police officials for not providing RT-PCR test reports.Most of the employees who have done the RT PCR test claim they are yet to get the reports.“There are 8,000 companies in small scale industries where around 5,00,000 employees are working. How it is possible to conduct tests for all employees in just a couple of days. The government should think about what problems these employees are facing. They are even waiting in long queues, but are unable to get the tests done or get reports on time due to long queues at hospitals,” said Abhay Bhor, president of Forum of Small Scale Industries Association.Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations have made the Covid test compulsory for those who want to attend the workplace. For those who have not taken the vaccine jab, an RT-PCR test once in 15 days is mandatory.“We are not against conducting RT-PCR tests, but the government should increase the deadline and allow employees to continue with their work. Not all employees can afford RT-PCR tests in private hospitals and government hospitals are struggling with the workload,” said Bhor.Companies are also open to having RT PCR test camps within their premises if the administration can provide manpower. “It will make things easy if civic bodies provide us manpower to conduct the testing camps within the campus. If police continue to stop employees then we will have to shut our industries until all employees complete the RT PCR test,” added Bhor.Sudhir Mehta, president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), tweeted, “Today in Chinchwad Hospitals..govt and pvt both are very crowded today due to irrational mandate of state govt for tests for all private sector employees . Most of hospitals have shortage of rapid test kit as of now. We are increasing the spread.” (sic)Sunil Phadke an employee from Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Bhosari, said, “I somehow convinced the traffic police and came to work as my RT PCR test is pending. Few employees from the other companies went back home and it will cost them a day’s salary. The government should think about extending the RT-PCR test deadline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/employees-from-small-scale-industries-suffer-due-to-rt-pcr-test-mandate-101618073065070.html
11-04-2021||Pune||Déjà vu as Pune preps for more restrictions||The weekend lockdown imposed across Maharashtra to bring the Covid-19 surge under control elicited a strong response across Pune on Saturday with streets and markets across city wearing a deserted look, a scene reminiscent of last year. After Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with leaders of various political parties, Saturday’s complete lockdown could also be a prelude to a complete closure that the state government may announce in the next two days. “To break the chain, the government and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is of the view that a strict lockdown has to be imposed for next few days. After that, some relaxations can be offered gradually. The decision in this regard will be taken in a day or two,” said senior Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan. Most people in Pune preferred to stay at home by following government’s instructions to avoid crowd even during morning hours when essential services like milk supply was operational. The weekend lockdown, announced earlier, will be in effect from Friday evening 6pm until Monday 7am to contain the spread of lockdown. Pune has been worst affected with the district reporting over 10,000 cases every day. The deserted roads brought back memories of last year’s lockdown when citizens were inside their homes for almost two months. Citizens clicked photos of the deserted photos from their buildings and circulated them on social media.Mandai, the major vegetable market was completely closed while Swargate State Transport (ST) bus depot saw fewer people boarding intercity buses. Police and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration since Friday evening ensured that there would be strict lock down in the city and allowed only medical shops and milk shops, even the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC) were closed.APMC administrator Madhukar Garad said, “As instructed by local administration, the APMC had already communicated to the farmers not to bring their agriculture produce to the market on Sunday. The vegetable and fruit market would remain closed.”As the police and municipal administration had already instructed not to allow vegetable sale for two days, the hawkers also did not sell on the roads.All the key roads and chowks including Swargate, Shivajinagar, Laxmi road, Alka Talkies chowk, Solapur road, Ahmednagar road, Pune-Mumbai road, Satara road wore a deserted look.Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar expressed gratitude for giving an overwhelming response, despite some anger among some on the implementation of lockdown. As there was a weekend lockdown in other cities, people travelling from other cities too preferred not to visit Pune.The city only saw essential services and ambulances on the roads. By considering the weekend lock down, some NGOs and political leaders started auto service for needy people who want to visit hospitals or emergency works.Cab driver Satish Kamate said, “Though cab service was allowed, there was less demand for it. Even there were very few commuters at bus stands, railway stations.”Police erected the barricades at various locations and were asking citizens reasons for travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dj-vu-as-pune-preps-for-more-restrictions-101618071565074.html
11-04-2021||Pune||Curtain call: Theatre of the youth, by the youth, for…everyone!||Since the past decade or so, I have started observing a change in the attitude of older people when they talk about the youth. It has changed from “These young people are lazy and useless! When we were young, we used to…” to “Youngsters do so many things these days. It’s incredulous!” I think I belong to a generation that was on the cusp of both these reactions. But I am sure about one thing – all those associated with Thespo would have definitely heard the second reaction more! I had mentioned Thespo two Sundays back while writing about Akarsh. I heard about Thespo in 2007, when I was in the last year of college. Thespo was in its ninth year. I had received a call from a phone number in Mumbai and during those times, seeing such a number flashing on the screen was pretty exciting as it meant that there was a possibility of working with new people! I spoke to Quasar Thakore Padamsee over the phone and he explained the concept of Thespo to me. It was pretty exciting! Their two criteria were that the age of all participants, including the director and technicians, should not be more than twenty-five years and the duration of the play should not be less than sixty minutes. That’s it. We, as participants, had a free hand for everything else. The festival was divided into two rounds, wherein a group of judges would travel all over the country and watch the plays that had registered with them. Out of those plays, around four to five plays would be selected and the main festival would be organised in Mumbai at Prithvi Theatre or the NCPA (National Centre for the Performing Arts). To make it more interesting, the main festival also had awards for best play and other individual awards. I had participated in many inter-collegiate one-act play theatre competitions by then and did not have much experience in putting a play together that was more than sixty minutes in length. This seemed like a good avenue to start. And this, I believe, is the best thing about Thespo - to make young people think in terms of a larger format of storytelling on stage. Quasar then drove down to Pune to hold a formal orientation about the festival and answered all questions that potential participants had. That year, there was only one play that was registered in Pune – ours. We thought that since this was a national-level festival, we should not perform in Marathi and put up a play in English instead. While the judges were supportive of the fact that we put up a play, they unanimously told us that we should have performed in the language that which we were most comfortable about. I was glad to see that they were encouraging people to perform in local languages rather than English or Hindi. Naturally we didn’t get selected that year. Next year with a comedy play in Marathi, I think we were better prepared. Also, the number of registrations from Pune increased to three. The judges that year had a better feedback and two months later we received a call that we were in the finals! I distinctly remember the day we performed our play – “Dalan” – at Thespo finals. It was the opening play of the festival. Thespo is usually sold out with some patrons even sitting between the rows. Before the show, I told our team not to lose confidence if people don’t respond since most of the audience was non-Marathi. I was so wrong! Seldom does a play enjoy such an audience response! The sixty-five minute play went on for nearly eighty minutes. It is one of the most memorable evenings of the entire team. The fact that we were adjudged the best play made the entire experience sweeter. I stopped being eligible for Thespo a few years back. But by then Thespo and Natak Company had built an unbreakable bond. I miss being a participant, but make up for it by being a Thespo-appointed mentor for a local play or by conducting workshops during the festival. The organising faces change every year as Quasar, Toral Shah, Vivek Rao and the original team believe that the festival should be organised by people below twenty-five too. They are now present only to provide advice when needed. They did not break tradition last year and organised an online theatre festival which was also well received. Thespo is now a national phenomenon with nearly two hundred plays registering every year. Most of the young people in this field are Thespo graduates and I am glad that I am one too!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-theatre-of-the-youth-by-the-youth-foreveryone-101618069104674.html
11-04-2021||Pune||Pune to get 165 ventilators in next three to four days||As the non-availability of ventilator beds continued in Pune on Saturday, Pune district administration is looking forward to getting 165 additional ventilators in the next three to four days.Following the Covid review meeting for Pune district, Union minister Prakash Javadekar announced Maharashtra will get 1,121 ventilators from the Centre in the next three-four days.Of these 1,121 ventilators coming from neighbouring states like Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, 165 will be given to the Pune district.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar clarified that the ventilators will first come to Mumbai and then will be distributed in the state.“I have spoken to all the concerned ministers and officials at the Centre. As many as 1,121 ventilators will be made available in Maharashtra in the next three to four days. Out of these, 700 are coming from Gujrat and 421 from Andhra Pradesh. The human resource required for this will be funded by the central government from national health missions,” said Javadekar.Pune has been facing an acute crisis of ventilator beds and various options to increase the availability of ventilators and other health infrastructures were discussed in the meeting. According to the data on the Pune division dashboard, no ventilator beds were available in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits on Saturday.Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that he has demanded 165 ventilators for the Pune district and the administration is also focusing on increasing testing and contact tracing.“On Friday we conducted almost 43,000 tests in Pune district. In the last few days, the positivity rate has come down to 20 per cent. With the increase in beds we are also focusing on vaccination, testing and tracing,” he said.Currently, 30 central teams are in Maharashtra to review the Covid situation. Pawar, who was part of the review meeting, said considering the rate of Covid infection the central team has advised him to emphasise increasing ventilator beds, oxygen beds and oxygen supply.“Our district and municipal administration is trying to increase these facilities. The chief minister of Maharashtra raised the issue of oxygen availability with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference meeting on Friday (March 9). There is an oxygen plant in Alibaug owned by Jindal. They have assured us that we will supply as per our need. A private company has given expensive oxygen generating machine to Sassoon hospital,” Pawar said.“Increase bed capacity at jumbo Covid centres”During the Covid review meeting, deputy chief minister Ait Pawar said, “Administration should increase beds capacity at jumbo Covid centres in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. At the same time, the plan is to increase Sassoon’s bed capacity up to 500.”Currently, the jumbo facility at COEP is operating at 600 beds and it can expand up to 800 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-to-get-1-121-ventilators-from-centre-pune-will-receive-165-101618067904462.html
