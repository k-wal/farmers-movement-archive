01-04-2021||Lucknow||Mohsin Khan: For now, it’s okay but it’s still a long way to go…||Born and brought up in Ayodhya, young actor Mohsin Khan feels it has been a tough journey from a background crowd to the main cast.“I was one of the faces in mob and was paid ₹300 for standing in the crowd. I remember as 17-year-old running to local PR office every day in search of some work as living condition back home was not as good. I knew this is the line I wish work in and earn for my family,” said the young actor. He recalls, “The first time I became part of the crowd was for ‘Aashram’ which shot in my hometown. I stood as a crowd for days that to for 24 hours but that’s how I knew my journey will start,” he said. Mohsin continued being the bystander for a number of projects. “After ‘Aashram’ I was again in the crowd for series like, ‘Cops’, ‘Cassette’ and ‘I984’ till the tables turned for me and I got to be in main cast for films ‘Mission Majnu’, ‘Satyamev Jayate-2’, ‘14-Phere’ and ‘Bhaukaal’ where I got a role to play that too with a name. So, finally I was in the main cast and was paid much better. And also, didn’t had to stand for the whole day in glaring sun.” Recently, Mohsin shot with some known names, “Shooting with John (Abraham) sir, Sharib (Hashmi) ji in the same frame, all of this was like a dream for me and how I wished someday to be where they are,” he said. The teenager thinks the reason for getting good work in a year or two was mainly due to multiple projects happening in the state. “UP has turned into a new shooting hub and the kind of projects that being shot here is the reason why local artistes like me are getting good work along with money. Besides, we don’t have to frequently run to Mumbai for work,” said the ‘Mere Sai’ and ‘Saavdhan India’ actor.Mohsin has managed to buy a home for his family and a two-wheeler for himself and feels happy to be finally getting credit on screen. “For now, it’s okay but it’s still a long way to go. And, I have to become a known face to get that sense of achievement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mohsin-khan-for-now-it-s-okay-but-it-s-still-a-long-way-to-go-101617301799309.html

Police said that the boy’s body was found on Thursday morning at the construction site in an area under the Phase 2 police jurisdiction. The body was sent for an autopsy, they said. “It seems that the boy had been scolded by his parents yesterday for constantly playing PubG on his phone,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2. According to police, the parents, natives of UP’s Mahoba district, had apparently confiscated the class 7 student’s phone after which he had left the house in anger. “Our forensic team has also inspected the area and their findings are consistent with the boy’s jumping down from the third floor of the under-construction building. No suicide note was found at the spot,” said the DCP. Chander said that the family has not filed any complaint in the matter. Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-teen-ends-life-after-getting-scolded-for-playing-online-game-101617301618498.html
01-04-2021||Noida||Phases 2, 4 of Delhi-Meerut Expressway open amid chaos and confusion||Ghaziabad: Roadblocks, jaywalking and traffic violations plagued phases 2 and 4 of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME), which were opened for the public on the first day on Thursday, a spot visit by an HT team revealed. The toll collection is yet to start at the six-lane dedicated access-controlled expressway till the rates finalised get the approval of the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). Many commuters, who had to take the left lane of the DME to go to Hapur, which falls on phase 3 of the expressway, took the wrong lane and inadvertently went towards Meerut expressway from Dasna. “The issue cropped up due to confusing signage. Many commuters drove straight thinking it was the way to Hapur but the lane took them towards Meerut expressway. Many returned to the DME by driving on the wrong side. There were also instances of wrong side driving on the Meerut expressway. Many vehicles were found speeding,” said Satendra Raghav, a resident of Govindpuram. According to officials, the speed limit for four-wheelers is 70kmph in Delhi while it is 100kmph in the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh. Several boulders were also spotted which were put up as road blockade at the DME’s interchange with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) at Dasna. As a result, many commuters coming from Meerut and going towards EPE had to move down from the DME at Dasna and again take the EPE interchange at Dasna to continue their journey towards EPE. The interchange is designed to provide seamless connectivity between the two expressways at Dasna. The blockades, however, disrupted seamless traffic movement. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the blockades were put up as toll collection is yet to start at the DME. Commuters without an entry at the DME toll booths would have faced issues while exiting the toll plazas at EPE. “The issue will be resolved as soon as the toll plazas become operational at DME. We are expecting the MoRTH to approve the toll rates, following which the NHAI will issue a notification. The process is expected to get clearance in a couple of days. We are also remove the current signage and install a new signage that will properly guide commuters travelling towards Hapur as well as Meerut,” said Mudit Garg, project director of the NHAI. He added that for overspeeding and wrong-side driving, he has spoken to the district administrations of Ghaziabad and Meerut. “The district will deploy its enforcement vehicles and details of erring vehicles detected by the automatic number plate reader (ANPR) will be sent to them for issuing challans. We have about 200 cameras installed in phases 1, 2 and 4 and 144 of these are functioning as ANPRs,” added Garg. Jaywalking was spotted at two places in Vijay Nagar. There is no foot overbridge here and an underpass constructed here is hardly used by locals. “The project for putting up additional fencing of 1.5km on each side will be completed soon to stop instances of jaywalking. We did not construct a foot overbridge as the area has high-tension electricity cables passing across the DME at Vijay Nagar. We are monitoring vehicular movement and all issues which crop up will be resolved once more people start using the DME,” said Garg. While the 19.2 kilometre-phase 2 connects the UP Gate to Dasna, the phase 4 of the DME, spanning for about 32 kilometres, connects Dasna to Meerut. The expressway will help bring down the travel time from Delhi to Meeut to about 50 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/phases-2-4-of-delhi-meerut-expressway-open-amid-chaos-and-confusion-101617301558462.html

In its order on March 24, the apex court directed the officials of both the states to take up an “unified approach” for resolving the issues. The Kaushambi and Karwa resident welfare associations had filed a petition, seeking relief from the pollution across the region. About 20,000 residents dwell in Kaushambi high-rises, which is near Delhi’s Anand Vihar border, Anand Vihar ISBT, Kaushambi ISBT, and Sahibabad site IV industrial area. Kaushambi sees regular traffic jams, through the high-rises, besides encroachment, roadside parking of vehicles, and the operation of autos, buses and other vehicles without any designated parking space.Taking up the issue of traffic jam, the SC had directed the officials to prepare a traffic plan within three weeks, and form a committee comprising nine officers with the Ghaziabad district magistrate as the nodal officer. “We have chalked out the removal of encroachment, freeing up roadside parking and regulating the movement of vehicles in our draft plan, along with proposing parking facilities. We also held a virtual meeting with the officers and residents of Delhi-NCR. Our draft plan is complete, and the officials concerned, Delhi, said that they will prepare a similar plan soon. Both the plans will be combined once they are finalised. A meeting with the officials of Delhi is scheduled on April 6,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Under the plan, Ghaziabad officials have suggested parking of autos near Saur Ujra Marg and they will not be allowed to park outside Kaushambi ISBT. They have also suggested to regulate permits for autos/e-rickshaws and also suggested a multi-level parking at Kaushambi metro station to decongest Kaushambi roads from roadside parking. It has also suggested that all the UP Roadways buses operating from Kaushambi will use the Saur Urja Marg (through Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area) for movement as they obstruct traffic coming to Ghaziabad from Delhi border. The plan has also suggested that private city buses operating from outside Kaushambi should operate from any other place and if need be, their permits can also be cancelled. “We have also suggested some infrastructure improvement on roads and also at borders with Delhi. This will help improve movement of traffic,” Pandey added. VK Mittal, president of Karwa said that he is yet to receive the draft plan through official channel. “We are waiting for the Ghaziabad district magistrate to submit the plan before the court. Once we receive the plan through official channel, we will submit our representation before the court. We do not wish to comment till the time plan gets submitted before the court,” he added. Karwa filed several petitions before the National Green Tribunal since 2015 and finally approached the Supreme Court in October 2020 for resolution of pollution issues. The committee directed by the court comprise the Ghaziabad’s district magistrate and police chief, Ghaziabad development authority chairperson, commissioners from the city’s municipality, the East Delhi municipal corporation and the commissioner of Meerut division, chairperson of the UP state road transport corporation, a nominee of the Delhi Police commissioner, and the Delhi government transport secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gzb-admin-draws-traffic-management-plan-for-kaushambi-101617301318491.html

01-04-2021||Noida||Summer migrants arrive at Okhla sanctuary||Noida: The Okhla Bird Sanctuary has started welcoming its summer passage migrants with some rare and stunning birds making a pit stop for a few days before flying further north. With a flock of rosy starlings among other winged delights like Asian paradise flycatcher, Eurasian golden oriole, common rosefinch, and common starling perching in the city’s only eco-sensitive zone, birders and foresters have rushed to spot them.Forest officials and birders said that the summer migrant birds arrive here between late March and early April, and while some stay here, most fly further towards north-west or towards the lower heights of Himalayas to breed. These birds may make a pit stop again during their return journey in August and September, they said.With the flock of starling here, the birders also expect to sight “murmuration” or “dance of starling” in which a large group of starlings fly together around sunset like a swarm with their twists, turns and swirls in the sky replicating shape shifting clouds. “It’s a beautiful sight, and whether a birder or not, one must go to explore them before they leave. There are some of the very beautiful phenomenon like murmuration, for which the Okhla sanctuary might not be the best place but it has been spotted earlier near India Gate,” said Prasanna Gautam, a Ghaziabad-based birder who spotted flock of starlings perching at the Okhla park earlier this week.According to the birders, though the birds fly north, some, in rare spotting, stay behind to breed. “Most of these birds are local summer migrants and most of them fly from south and move towards northern region. However, we have spotted nesting of golden oriole and paradise flycatchers at the Okhla sanctuary earlier. In 2006, there were four nesting of flycatchers in the sanctuary at the same area which was later used to make memorials,” said Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder.According to the forest department, a small flock of over hundred rosy starlings is being spotted at the sanctuary.“It’s the right time to visit the sanctuary as the summer migrants have started to arrive here. Rosy starlings are among the listed passage migrants which have arrived in numbers. They often come here to roost and feed from different parts of the country, including Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The birds stay here for some days before they fly,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/summer-migrants-arrive-at-okhla-sanctuary-101617301201300.html

The DJB officials presented a detailed plan to clean four major drains (which flow into the Yamuna) and the CM expressed concerns and unhappiness over the delay in timelines of each sewage treatment plant (STP) project. He instructed the officials to have a detailed plan ready by next week, and every project will be scrutinised as per the revised time frames,” said a statement issued by the chief minister’s office (CMO).Cleaning the Yamuna has been a promise in the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) manifesto for the 2015 assembly polls as well as the 2020 assembly polls. The party won both elections by a huge majority. Last month, on completion of the AAP government’s first year of the second term, Kejriwal said the Delhi government has plans to clean the Yamuna within three years.After Thursday’s review meeting, Kejriwal said, “The Clean Yamuna project is one of the most ambitious projects of the Delhi government. We must ensure that there is no laxity at any phase of the project. We should work towards expediting the Yamuna cleaning process, and every sub-project should be completed within the stipulated time frame.”The statement issued by his office further said, “The DJB officials apprised the CM that various low-cost technological interventions are being done to expedite the work before scheduled deadlines… CM Kejriwal also reviewed the flagship project of septic tank cleaning in unauthorised colonies of Delhi. The project is expected to be completed within the next few months.”“Of the four drains, the work on interception of two major drains -- supplementary drain and Shahdara drain -- is almost complete. The untreated water from the supplementary drain will be completely tapped and treated by December 2021. The untreated water from the Shahdara drain will be completely tapped in the next few months. The remaining two major drains -- Najafgarh and Barapulla -- will be completed within the stipulated time frame,” the CMO statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-unhappy-with-yamuna-project-progress-seeks-fresh-plan-from-djb-101617301199059.html

The civic body has also taken the digital route to issue birth and death certificates to citizens.The east body ranked 46 out of 47 cities in the Central government’s cleanliness survey of cities with population of more than 10 lakh people. As part of the new feedback system, EDMC on Thursday said QR codes will be pasted outside public toilets, community toilets and dhalaos in its jurisdiction.EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said that citizens will be able to register their feedback about the facilities, maintenance, cleaning system available in toilets through the QR code system.“QR codes will be placed on all public and community toilets and dhalaos of the area. People can scan the QR code and share their feedback about the availability of electricity, water and soap, cleanliness of toilet premises and toilet seat while using the facility. Concerned officials will act swiftly if any issue arises,” Jain said.Meanwhile, the civic body has moved the issuing of birth and death certificates to citizens.“Keeping in the mind the convenience of the local residents, the EDMC has taken an important initiative to simplify its civic services and start birth and death registration completely online. With this facility, the birth and death registrations are now simple and the citizen does not have to deposit any fee. Citizens will no longer have to go to the Citizen Service Bureau and stand in queue for the same,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand.Officials said that in order to register, people have to fill in an online form on mcdonline.nic.in and upload the required documents. After the certificate is approval, the information will also be sent to the applicant on their mobile number. Further, Anand said applicants can also enter the name of a child in the birth certificate which will attract a fee of ₹10 online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-improve-cleanliness-rank-qr-codes-outside-public-toilets-in-east-delhi-101617301142255.html

The L-G also stressed the need to include traditional waste collectors (kabadiwalas) into the formal system for better collection and segregation of e-waste. Baijal issued the instructions in a meeting on e-waste management in Delhi on Thursday.“Chaired meeting on E-Waste Management in Delhi with Chief Secretary, Commissioners of DMCs and other senior officers including Director, IIITD,” Baijal tweeted after the meeting.The L-G also called for developing e-waste parks in a time-bound manner for better management.“With a view to promote organised segregation, dismantling and recycling of e-waste currently being generated in Delhi/ NCR area, stressed upon formulation of a time bound action plan for establishing integrated and economically viable e-waste park(s) in collaboration with industry stakeholders,” said Baijal. The L-G said he has also advised the officers to work in close coordination with the Central Pollution Control Board, the ministry of environment, forests & climate change and ministry of electronics and information technology to ensure effective implementation of the plan in a time-bound manner. Senior officials in the three civic bodies (north, south and east) said so far, there is no government mechanism for e-waste disposal and management in the city and the national capital has been struggling to handle e-waste. A study conducted by environment NGO Toxics Link in 2019 found at least 15 e-waste processing hot spots in the city that were operating without any health or environmental safeguards. Officials said according to a UN report, India is the third-largest producer of e-waste in the world. They admitted government agencies don’t have the exact data about the quantity of e-waste in Delhi and NCR.“We don’t even have the information about the quantum of e-waste being generated in the city. So first, we have to get that and then develop a framework for e-waste disposal and management. In the meeting, directions were also issued to develop an oversight mechanism to ensure compliance with e-waste management rules and form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for better coordination among all the stakeholders,” said a senior municipal official requesting anonymity.Officials privy to the development said that in the meeting, it was stressed that the Delhi government will have to take care of the enforcement part of the mechanism and develop an e-waste park while civic bodies will have to ensure colle ction and segregation of e-waste (mainly electric appliances and e-vehicle batteries) in a better way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lg-for-safe-disposal-of-e-waste-in-city-101617301139594.html
01-04-2021||Gurugram||Over 11,000 vaccinated in Gurugram||Over 11,000 people took the Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, the day it was made eligible for all above 45 years of age. Over the last few days, the footfall at vaccination centres, especially private ones, had been low. The unexpected high footfall meant that many hospitals utilised all their stock of alloted vaccines within a few hours of opening their vaccination drive at 9am. Official data read that nearly 76.6% (8,480) people turned for their vaccination at multiple government facilities across the district, while private hospitals too confirmed a slight increase in the footfall compared to the last few days at 2,590. “Since vaccination is now open for everyone above 45 years of age, the data of 11,000 people has not been divided into those above 60 or aged between 45 and 59 as done earlier. The overall footfall was high in the 198 vaccination centres. It is likely to increase further as vaccination will now be held on all days,” said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer. At least 452 healthcare workers and 749 frontline workers also took the jab on Thursday. Jitender Yadav, a cab driver, who arrived at the Wazirabad urban primary health centre (UPHC) said, “After hearing in the news that no medical certificate is required to get vaccinated, I decided to get the shot. I simply showed by ID proof, waiting for a few minutes until registration was done and thereafter got vaccinated.” Dr Anjul Rao, medical officer at the UPHC, said, “The footfall has been high compared to last few days. Until noon, out of 58 people who got inoculated, nearly 43 were above the age of 45. In other centres too the turnout was good.” Likewise, various sub-centres under Chanderlok UPHC, which included condominiums like Ridgewood Estate, Central Park, Magnolia and Beverley Park, at least 343 people were vaccinated till 1:30pm. Dr Dipanshu, medical officer of the facility said, “Each site was given 150 doses. Even nearby private hospitals coordinated with us for vaccines. Since some were running were short, we immediately provided them with more than 500 doses.” The restocking forced a slight delay. Baljeet, who came along with his parents to get vaccinated at Chanderlok UPHC, said, “We waited for almost 30 minutes and got vaccinated once the fresh doses arrived.” In private hospitals, there was an improved turnout saw an improvement. “Until last week, only 80 people were being vaccinated in a day. But on Thursday it was almost 150. The numbers will increase as we are ready to cover a large group of working population by holding camps in offices,” said Arpita Mukherjee, vice president, operations, Max Hospital. Affirming it, representatives from Fortis, Narayana and Medanta hospitals said that pre-registration for Friday has crossed 500. According to CMO Yadav, in the last three days the cumulative target has been to cover 40,000 people. But they managed to exceed the target by administering doses to 41,595 people. Till now, over 1,38, 493 people in priortised age group and about 30, 317 healthcare and frontline workers have been inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-11-000-vaccinated-in-gurugram-101617301078458.html

The court observed this while rejecting the bail application of a man accused of rape.HC judge SK Panigrahi ruled that rape laws should not be used to regulate intimate relationships, especially in cases where women are entering a relationship by choice. The law on this matter lacks clarity for the conviction of the accused, the court said.Police had booked the accused last year under sections 376(1), 313, 294 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66(E) and 67(A) of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 on charges of raping a girl. The girl had alleged that the accused kept a physical relationship with her and promised to marry her. Due to their physical relationship, the girl got pregnant twice and alleged that the man got both her pregnancies aborted by giving her some medicines.In January last year, when the girl asked the man to marry her, he refused. In April, he allegedly posted their private photographs online using fake Facebook IDs created in her name. The man allegedly threatened to kill the girl and also said he would make her photographs go viral on Facebook, she alleged.Though justice Panigrahi rejected the accused’s bail petition, he observed that rape laws should not be used to regulate intimate relationships, especially in cases where women have agency and are entering a relationship by choice.“The law is well settled that consent obtained on a false promise to marry is not valid. Since the framers of the law have specifically provided the circumstances when ‘consent’ amounts to ‘no consent’ in terms of Section 375 of IPC, consent for the sexual act on the pretext of marriage is not one of the circumstances mentioned under Section 375 of IPC. Hence, the automatic extension of provisions of Section 90 of IPC to determine the effect of consent under Section 375 of IPC deserves a serious relook. The law holding that false promise to marriage amounts to rape appears to be erroneous,” justice Panigrahy said.He further said the judiciary has dealt with this clamour with the use of concepts such as “misconception of facts under Section 90 of IPC” and “intention of accused from the beginning” to provide justice to the parties. However, a certain viewpoint has not been reached and remains under the shroud of confusion.The court, however, said that many of the complaints come from socially disadvantaged and poor segments of the society and rural areas. Women from these sections are often lured into sex by men on false promises of marriage and then dumped as soon as they get pregnant. “The rape law often fails to capture their plight,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rape-law-needs-to-be-amended-over-false-promise-of-marriage-orissa-high-court-101617301022541.html

The last time it was so high was on December 14, 2020.To control the uptick, the district health department said Covid-19 vaccination camps will now be held everyday at government and private facilities throughout April following the union ministry of health and family welfare’s guidelines. The vaccinations will be held between 9am and 5pm.The rising active cases is in keeping with the trend of rising caseloads across the country. Currently, Gurugram is among the 46 districts reporting sharp surge in cases.The city had only 36 new cases and a total tally of 59,029 on March 1; but on April 1 there were 381 fresh cases and a total infection count of 63,394. One more death was reported from the city that took the toll count to 365.The positivity rate, the number of positive cases among 100 tests, too increased to 7.9% on Thursday. In the last seven days, the average rate was 5.9%. According to the World Health Organization, a positivity rate of 5% or below for two straight weeks signalled that the infection was under control in the region. Gurugram health department officials said they were conducting around 5000 tests a day.“As per the central government’s revised guidelines issued on Thursday, Covid-19 doses will be administered on all days, including gazette holidays in April. The decision has been taken to increase the pace and coverage of overall vaccination in order to control the spread of coronavirus infection,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.Earlier this week, taking cognizance of surge in Covid-19 cases the union ministry of health and family welfare directed districts with high case load and fast growth of cases to ensure 100% vaccination of the prioritized population group who were at least 45 years old.Till now, doses were administered in government hospitals four times a week – Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday - at various urban primary health centres and sub-centres under it. Private hospitals committed to vaccinations from Monday to Saturday. In the last few days, the vaccination footfall remained low in private facilities compared to government set ups.“Vaccination will be scaled up, with everyday inoculation of people above 45 years of age. It will be held throughout the month since vaccination will act as a shield in controlling the spike. It will be held in more than 100 sites every day to expand the coverage,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.According to him, testing has been increased to almost 5504 on Thursday. In various urban primary health centres queues were seen at testing booths. Also, teams have been doing home visits to collect samples from people returning from United Kingdom to trace cases of new Sars-CoV-2 variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-active-case-count-crosses-2000-vaccine-to-be-administered-on-all-days-101617301019098.html

Representatives of some of the major private hospitals said many multinational and industrial and corporate offices had approached them to vaccinate their staff and more camps are likely to be held from Friday.“The response was good,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, head and director of the internal medicine department at Medanta Hospital, which conducted the camp at IDA. “Since it was the first day, a few registrations were delayed. From Friday onwards, the hospital will be setting up camps in at least one office every day and on April 5, centres will be set up in at least three offices. The schedule has been fixed till April 15 based on the requests from different corporates, especially in banking, telecom, oil and gas, and retail.”“Corporates approached the hospital even before getting the go ahead for vaccination in offices. We were already administering doses to employees of various companies in our hospital during specific slot from noon till 3pm, especially during the lunch hours. But now, we will be catering to larger section of employees in different offices for longer,” said Dr Vritti Lumba, medical superintendent, Fortis Memorial Research Institute. Lumba said they were in the process of finalising plans to set up camps in more companies. “All Covid-19 vaccination protocols will be followed to set up camp in offices to maintain social distancing,” said Lumba, without disclosing names of the companies. Other big private hospital of the city, Max super specialty hospital has also been coordinating with companies like Powergrid, Indian Oil, ICICI bank, Panasonic India, Maruti Suzuki, Eicher and Quattro. “At least 10 companies have approached us till now. Many of them were interested in sharing the names of all their employees for pre-registration, which will help in streamlining the vaccination process at the site. From Friday onwards, we will be starting with single camp in one of the offices. Since, Gurugram is hub of corporate offices, this move will help in expediting vaccination,” said Arpita Mukherjee, vice president, operations, Max hospital. Narayana Hospital, on the other hand, will hold the vaccination in a corporate from April 5 onwards. Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of emergency, Narayana Hospital, said, “On April 5, the hospital will be setting up a camp in one of the corporates near to the hospital.

The plan has been formulated with the objective to provide economic and social security to the migrants and relief and support to the industries which have offered job opportunities to migrant workers in their respective residential areas. Under this, the government will provide monetary aid of ₹1000 to ₹2000 per month per labourer. In this sequence, the MSME department had sent a proposed plan of ₹629 crore to the finance department, said the statement. The plan is being prepared on the lines of the handloom industry. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has issued directives to provide financial assistance in order to support all the industries that have been providing job opportunities to the migrant workers in the state, similar to the handloom industries where a grant of ₹1000 to ₹2000 per month is given per labourer. This will in turn generate ample job opportunities at the local level for all the migrant labourers. Under this scheme, all the migrant workers who had registered themselves on the migrants’ employment portal of the state government would also be linked to schemes like Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana and Mukhyamantri Pravasi Rozgar Yojana, said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/units-employing-migrant-workers-to-get-grants-101617300958458.html

This time, the trial will last till April 15.The trial will continue to see a ban on four-wheelers inside the market and parking only at designated spots for shopkeepers. The MCG had installed streetlights, benches and placed plants across the market to invite walkers and dissuade motorists. Goods vehicles would continue to be allowed entry only till noon every day.Acceding to the demands from shopkeepers, the MCG has allowed them to bring their vehicles inside the market but not to park there. Two-wheeler customers will continue to be allowed in.The first such trial between March 20 and 27 had failed on the back of protests from shopkeepers who claimed they had not been consulted.On Thursday, MCG joint commissioner Jitender Garg met them at his office in Civil Lines.“Shopkeepers and various association members of the market were informed that the MCG has decided to extend the trial for another 15 days. They have been cautioned that this time around, sterner action will be taken against them for any violation or disorder,” said Garg.On March 20, the first day of the previous trial, shopkeepers surrounded all entry and exit points of the market and closed their shops in protest. They had demanded then too that two-wheelers be allowed, which the MCG had acceded.“We will be extending our support to the MCG for this trial. There were some grievances on our part which they have addressed and there some on their end as well that we have agreed to comply with. All shopkeepers have been informed about the MCG’s direction,” said Bablu Gupta, president Sadar Bazar traders association. “Today, we impounded vehicles found carrying goods into the market after 12 pm. We also removed a sizeable number of illegal banners and hoardings from the market. We are hoping that a sterner approach will pave the way for making the market a vehicle-free zone,” said Garg. He claimed the MCG had the support of 70% of shopkeepers.Garg said the number of designated parking areas for shopkeepers had been increased from five to seven and that the civic body was collaborating with around 100 civic defence volunteers who will be placed at all entry and exit points to keep vehicles off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-takes-another-shot-at-making-sadar-bazar-pedestrianfriendly-101617300959095.html

A fine of upto ₹500 will be slapped on those found defaulting source-based segregation.Inderjit Kularia, additional municipal commissioner of MCF, said, “Waste segregation at source has been a norm for quite some time now. We tried implementing it last year also, but now, we will specially focus on enforcement to check waste is actually segregated at source.” “Our teams will be conducting surprise inspections to check the ground reality and those who discard waste without segregating it will be fined anything between ₹250- ₹500, depending on the quantity of waste and other parameters (to be decided),” said Kularia. The officials are also working on making separate compartments in the garbage collection vehicles for easier segregation. Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson from EcoGreen, MCF’s concessionaire for waste management, said they have been spreading awareness about source-based segregation of dry and wet waste for almost two years now through various platforms. Currently, the waste collected from Faridabad and Gurugram is dumped at Bandhwari land, where legacy waste is being treated. Authorities are working on finding a new dumping site for the waste generated in Faridabad. Kularia said till the corporation finds a new dumping site, the waste will continue to be dumped at Bandhwari landfill itself. In March last year, a proposal to create a 30-acre dumping yard in Faridabad’s Pali Mohbtabad village to divert waste away from Bandhwari landfill was scrapped by the municipal corporations of Gurugram and Faridabad, as the site in question is a ‘forest’ land notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900. A second proposal to divert waste from the landfill to a site in Farrukhnagar was shelved after a stay order was imposed by a local court in December last year in response to a civil suit filed by a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcf-to-focus-on-segregation-of-waste-at-source-101617300899605.html
01-04-2021||Lucknow||22 Gomti tributaries have almost dried up, no flow left in four: Expert’s report||Twenty-two of the Gomti river’s 26 tributaries have almost dried up and there is no flow left in the remaining four, says a report by an expert, Venkatesh Dutta who is professor of environmental science at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow.The report, published in the Indian Journal of Ecology, also says the Gomti’s flow is in “danger”. The river passing through 14 districts of Uttar Pradesh has reached this condition due to excessive use of ground water and less recharge of the underground water table, according to the report. The Gomti originates in Pilibhit district in western UP and merges with the Ganga near Ghazipur district in eastern Uttar Pradesh. According to Prof Dutta, underground water and Gomti are complementary to each other. “During the monsoon, the Gomti river basin recharges underground water table. While, before and after monsoon the underground water table helps the river maintain its flow,” Prof Dutta says. The report says that in Lucknow the Gomti gets 76% of the water from the underground water table, which is referred to as “base flow index”. “Underground water table has reached below the riverbed of the Gomti. Now, the problem is that the river is not able to get water from underground water sources,” Prof Dutta explains. This has led to a reduction in the river’s flow by around 60%, says Prof Dutta. Underground water table is important for the river’s flow, he adds. “The diaphragm wall of the Gomti riverfront in Lucknow has also damaged river’s ecosystem,” points out Dutta. For the revival of Gomti and its tributaries, Prof Dutta says: “There are around 2,000 water bodies in the Gomti river basin expanding from Pilibhit to Ghazipur before it merges in Ganga. All these water bodies must be revived.” He has also suggested a check on cultivation of Satha dhan, a variant of paddy, which “consumes too much underground water”. He has advocated complete stoppage of the discharge of industrial waste into the Gomti in Sitapur, Gola Gokaran Nath and in the upstream areas of the river. In order to prevent encroachment on the banks of the Gomti, he has proposed complete mapping of the river by the land revenue department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/22-gomti-tributaries-have-almost-dried-up-no-flow-left-in-four-expert-s-report-101617300898939.html

They are nine feet in height, of which six feet is underground, and is three feet wide. Each bin has a storage capacity of 1.1 cubic meters. The GPS will help people find the trash bin, and a sensor in it will tell the civic body how much trash the bin carried.Similar systems are in place in Mumbai, Ghaziabad, Dharamsala and Surat.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) built the system at a cost of around ₹3.5 lakh for each bin and will launch it next week.Ecogreen, the MCG concessionaire for door-to-door waste collection, was tasked with setting up the bins at various points across the city and will be responsible for managing it.“The biggest advantage of an underground bin is that it reduces stench considerably and also prevents animals from accessing it. The land near the bins has to be cleaned, and its perimeter fenced. Along with pasting awareness messages near the facility, the remaining work will take a few days to complete,” said Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson, Ecogreen.Ecogreen officials said the bin could be vacuum cleaned through an outlet. They said that they are exploring the possibility of introducing software that will send an alert on the mobile of their staff when the garbage level was above 70%.MCG officials said that the two facilities are being launched on a trial basis while they are also contemplating opening this facility at four more locations in the city within the next three months.“Any facility that is convenient or provides a solution to problems is always supported by the MCG. We initiate trials to check if they are making a difference on-ground and for identifying possible solutions or changes to make it even better. Depending on the success of the underground bins, we will target to introduce them in each of the four MCG zones and eventually ensure all municipal wards and residential sectors are covered across the city,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/in-gurugram-underground-bins-with-tracking-system-to-segregate-waste-101617300838464.html

It was on the insistence of the station house officer of Nauchandi police station in Meerut that the couple wrote a compromise note with the assurance that they would indeed chant the Gayatri mantra, the 58-year-old man Hemant Goel claimed through his lawyer Ram Kumar Sharma. For his part, station house officer Premchand Sharma denied the allegation against him and said, “I have nothing to do what they wrote in their compromise note.” He also denied giving any written advice to chant the Gayatri mantra. The police officer said, “I sent him (Goel) for medical examination and also registered his FIR against his wife Savita (Kaushik) and her son Hemant (Sharma) under Sections 504, 506 and 427 of the IPC.” The SHO said that Savita had also given a complaint of domestic violence and mental torture against Goel. On the other hand, Goel’s lawyer Ram Kumar Sharma said they had no information about the case registered against Savita and her son (from another marriage) on the complaint of Goel. He claimed that instead of registering the FIR against Goel’s wife and her son, SHO Premchand Sharma gave Goel written advice in Hindi, which reads, “Samasya ka sampurn samadhan, 03 din, Shantikunj Hardwar me pravas kare, Maa Gayatri mantra ki deeksha le aur 108 manka ki maala ka Brahmuhurt mein jaap kare” (Solution to the problem, three days: Visit Shantikunj in Haridwar, take spiritual initiation in the Gayatri mantra and repeat it 108 times while counting beads at the auspicious time of Brahmuhurt).” Ram Kumar Sharma said he, along with Goel, met inspector general (IG), Meerut range, Praveen Kumar on Thursday and briefed him about the SHO’s conduct. “The IG spoke to the SSP and directed him to look into the issue and ensure registration of the case on the victim’s complaint,” the lawyer said. He claimed the SHO was lying to protect himself, otherwise why would have they gone to meet the IG to direct the SHO to register an FIR. Giving details of the matter, the lawyer said Hemant Goel, a resident of Shastri Nagar, was unmarried at the time when a woman in his neighbourhood introduced him to Savita Kaushik in February. Savita claimed that she had obtained divorce from her first husband. Soon, Goel and Savita got married. He later came to know that Savita had a 19-year-old-son Hemant Sharma from a previous marriage, the lawyer said. All was well for a few days but then Savita and her son started demanding money and often beat Goel when he refused to accept their demand, the lawyer alleged. Meanwhile, he gave them over ₹22 lakh. On March 19, they again demanded ₹2 lakh and assaulted him when he refused to give it, the lawyer alleged. Goel then visited the Nauchandi police station to lodge his complaint, but instead of registering the FIR, the SHO advised him to chant the Gayatri mantra to solve his problem, the lawyer said. He thrice visited the police station and eventually was advised to go for a compromise, which he signed along with Savita and her son, according to the lawyer. The lawyer claimed the same SHO was recently in the news for sprinkling Ganga jal (Ganga water) on visitors at his police station and offering them “sandalwood powder” to apply on the forehead. Despite attempts to reach him, the IG (Meerut range) was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sho-allegedly-advises-warring-couple-to-chant-gayatri-mantra-denies-claim-101617300418550.html

The Mathura court has fixed April 19 as the next date of hearing in the case. Petitioner Mahendra Pratap Singh said the application was moved on Thursday in the court of the civil judge (senior division) Mathura hearing the matter related to the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi.The present application is one of a number of cases filed in Mathura courts in connection with the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi. In all these cases, different petitioners have sought removal of the Shahi Eidgah (mosque) adjacent to the Sri Krishna temple complex in Mathura, and transfer of 13.37-acre land to the deity, Bhagwan Sri Krishna Virajman.“A temple of Keshav Dev (Krishna) used to exist in a vast area of 13.37 acre in Mathura. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb dismantled the temple and raised a structure at the same place, which is now known as the Eidgah mosque. Many of the stones having symbols of Hindu architecture were removed from the Janmabhoomi and placed in the Eidgah mosque,” Singh claimed.“We have moved an application in the court seeking the appointment of a court commissioner to inspect the Eidgah mosque in regard to such stones moved from Janmabhoomi and the application is pending for disposal,” Singh added.“Many historians and writers have mentioned that besides placing these stones in the mosque, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb took along various idols, including that of Lord Krishna, and had them buried under the stairs of the Chhoti Masjid in the Deewan-e-Khas of Agra Fort,” Singh further said.“We have moved an application, asking the court to depute Archaeological Survey of India or any other competent authority to have these idols excavated from the stairs of the Chhoti Masjid in Agra Fort and brought back to Keshav Dev temple at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi so that they can be placed at the appropriate place in future,” he said.The petitioners in the cases pertaining to Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi have challenged the settlement dated 12.10.1968 between Sri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh and Shahi Masjid Eidgah, which was part of suit No. 43 of 1967. The petitioners have alleged that the settlement had no legal validity because the Sri Krishna Janambhoomi trust, having ownership and title, was not party to the settlement.Thus, the court should order for transfer of the Eidgah mosque land to the deity, the petitioners have urged the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sri-krishna-janmabhoomi-case-plea-seeks-return-of-idols-from-agra-fort-to-mathura-temple-101617300358344.html

The proposal would now be put before the institute’s apex decision-making body, the Board of Governors (BoG), for a final approval, confirmed MNNIT director Prof Rajeev Tripathi. He said that the institute planned to instead double the seats of MTech computer science and engineering course from the existing 25 to 50. The step follows an in-depth study undertaken by the institute.“A scrutiny of past records showed that MTech in software engineering programme was low on the preference of top aspirants as compared to the MTech computer science and engineering course and, as a result, the MTech software engineering was attracting aspirants much lower in the merit. We also observed that even companies hiring our students preferred MTech computer science and engineering pass-outs over the MTech software engineering pass-outs, believing that the course in computer science and engineering to be more holistic and covering a wider spectrum of skills and knowledge as compared to software engineering which they perceived to focus on just software designing and testing,” he explained.Prof Tripathi said though the MTech in software engineering was a well-designed robust course, covering all essential topics of CSE but having specialised electives, the institute decided to go strictly as per the demand and close the post graduate programme in software engineering.“The 25 seats of MTech in software engineering would now be merged in MTech computer science and engineering course which remains the top choice of aspiring techies attracting top rankers from across the country, thereby allowing an intake of 50 students in it. We are confident that this would not only attract better students, but also ensure better placements,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mnnit-to-shut-mtech-course-in-software-engineering-101617300238477.html

Sharma said Malik had challenged the lower court’s judgment of sentencing her to a four-year jail term. “During the hearing, I argued that she is an elderly woman and has not committed any heinous crime here and has already served 11 months in jail. After hearing the matter, the HC reduced her four-year jail term to 11 months, which has been already served by her,” he said. Sharma said the HC also asked the officials concerned to allow her to get back to her country. In April last year, the United States embassy in Delhi had also written a letter to the chief minister of Uttarakhand to deport Malik who was sentenced to four-year imprisonment by the local court for violating the Passport Act and the Foreigners Act.The letter was written by then US ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster to the then Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. “Unfortunately she (Malik) had left her passport in a hotel in Nepal. However, rather than sending her back to secure the proper documents to enter India, Indian authorities arrested and jailed her,” the letter stated. The letter further read, “It is Malik’s first offence... she has already served 8-months in judicial custody at Almora jail. As per her medical record, Malik suffers from acute bipolar disorder - a mental health condition that compromises her ability to make sound decisions. She also suffers from diabetes and other severe health problems related to her back and spine...” Farida Malik, daughter of Sultan Akhtar, was nabbed by the immigration officials at Banbasa check post on July 12, 2019, while she was trying to enter India. She was coming from Kathmandu and posed as a Nepalese citizen but was caught at the border.Since she could not produce her passport and visa, she was arrested for violating Section 3 of the Passport Act (person entering India shall be in possession of valid passport) and section 14 of the Foreigners Act (remaining in any area in India without a visa), an official said.After her arrest, she was produced in the local court from where she was sent to Lohaghat Jail in Champawat. Later, she was moved to Almora jail. The High Court had granted her bail in December 2019 with a condition that she will not leave Almora without the court’s permission till the case is settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-reduces-jail-term-of-elderly-woman-with-us-citizenship-101617299701879.html

He surrendered two days after the Lucknow police announced reward of ₹25,000 on his arrest on March 3 in connection with the Vibhuti Khand case.A senior police official said the reward declared on his arrest was abolished after he had surrendered after which he again procured bail from the MP and MLA court in the old case and came out of the jail. He said the former MP had procured the bail on March 25 itself but the Prayagraj and Jaunpur police counterparts did not inform the Lucknow police about it.“The former MP is still wanted in the Vibhuti Khand shootout case as the Lucknow police failed to serve him the warrant in the matter. He will be arrested again,” senior police official of Lucknow Commissionerate emphasised.The former MP is made key accused in the alleged conspiracy behind the shootout and a non-bailable warrant (NBW) was issued against him by a Lucknow court on February 20. The former MP was booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 302 (for murder), 307 (for attempt to murder), 120-B (for criminal conspiracy), 201 (for concealment of evidence) and 212 (for harbouring an offender).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vibhuti-khand-shootout-case-lack-of-coordination-between-authorities-helped-ex-mp-come-out-of-jail-on-bail-101617299578471.html

While doing this the juniors will save money, given the fact that prices of the books go up almost every year, a bid would also be made for environment conservation as printing less books would mean cutting less trees, the KVS had explained. “The project has received a great response not only in Prayagraj but also at KV-Kathmandu (Nepal) wherein almost half of the students of a respective class have been donating their books to juniors,” said principal of KV-Manauri, Shalini Dikshit. At KV-Manauri, the initiative has proven to be a boon for a lot of students, especially those who are not from well-off families, as around 10 sets of old books, for each class, have been donated by seniors, barring those of classes 10 and 12 who need them for board exams as well as preparation of competitive exams, she added.The principal and teachers of all the KVs are also engaged in sensitising the students of different classes to take good care of their textbooks so that these may be used by others as well. “These books may be either presented by the student to his or her junior of the next batch or can be donated to the school library,” said principal KV-Jhalwa, Vijeyesh Pandey. Besides, students are also being encouraged to donate other books like reference books, novels, non-fiction books etc from their personal possession which will not only save paper but also promote reading habit among students. “This aspect too has worked well as a lot of students have donated books to the school,” Pandey said. Although this is a voluntary decision on part of the schools and students but as more and more students are being made aware of the importance of donating their books to juniors, this concept has started yielding fruitful results every year, added the principal.

Initially, we had planned to shift his possessions to our ancestral home in Bhojpur but later we went ahead with the idea of creating a library,” Singh said. “He has left a great treasure behind in the form of collection of voluminous foreign books, study materials, handwritten notes, thesis. We possess his document in which he challenged Einstein’s theory besides 50 other theses and precious documents,” he shared.“We want to make his possessions free for public so that students, researchers and scholars can use them. We have 12 boxes containing more than 5,000 books which he brought from abroad, but we don’t have enough space to display it. His handwritten notes on loose sheets are tied in bundles. I wish to laminate and digitalise them for preservation, but I don’t have required resources and financial support,” he added.“The motive of my life is to protect his legacy and fight for his due recognition,” said Singh, who quit his job as nodal officer with health department in 2015 to look after his family. Singh had founded the Dr Vashishtha Narayana Singh Education, Research and Social Development Trust in 2016 and runs ‘Shukriya Vashishtha’ coaching classes, free for engineering aspirants of underprivileged class.“Every year, we select 40 meritorious students based on a test and the students are given free classes. State’s prominent personalities like IPS Vikas Vaibhav, former DM Kumar Ravi, veteran mathematicians KC Sinha have also taken a few classes. A total of 18 students appeared in JEE exam held in February and March and all of them have qualified,” he shared.“I am appealing the state government and public to extend their support in preserving his heritage for the coming generations,” he said. Veteran mathematicianBorn in Bhojpur district on April 2,1942, Dr Vashishtha Narayan Singh completed his schooling from Netarhat School and joined Patna Science College for graduation. He earned PhD in mathematics from University of California, Berkeley by the age of 23. He is also said to have challenged Einstein’s theory of relativity.

A bench of Justices S K Kaul and R S Reddy noted that the state government had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court against the September last year order of a division bench of the Patna High Court which had disposed of its plea on “agreed terms”.“... We find this a complete abuse of process of court and that too by a state government, apart from being a utter wastage of judicial time,” the SC bench said.“We thus, dismiss the SLP with costs of ₹20,000 to be deposited with the Supreme Court Group ‘C’ (Non-Clerical) Employees Welfare Association within four weeks,” the bench said in its March 22 order.The apex court said it is open to the state to recover the cost from officers who were responsible for this “misadventure.” A single-judge bench of HC had, in December 2018, delivered a verdict on a plea filed by the public servant who had challenged a June 2016 memo by which he was served the punishment of major penalty of dismissal from service under the Bihar Government Servant (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rule 2005. An FIR was lodged against him for alleged illegal acquisition of property which was disproportionate to his known sources of income and later, he was put under suspension and departmental proceedings were initiated against him.The single-judge bench set aside the order of dismissal contained in the June 2016 memo and also quashed the enquiry report.It had remanded back the matter to the enquiry officer to conduct inquiry in accordance with law. Later, the division bench of the HC had dealt with an appeal filed by the state against the order.The apex court said that the HC had noted in its order that after the matter was heard for some time, the counsel appearing before it in the case had jointly prayed that the appeal be disposed of on agreed terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-junks-bihar-s-plea-asks-to-pay-rs-20-000-for-utter-wastage-of-judicial-time-101617295618921.html

On Wednesday, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had written to 15 top Opposition leaders in the country, urging them to unite against the BJP.Sources said the 31-year-old RJD scion, who has already extended his party’s support to Trinamool in the West Bengal polls by not fielding any candidate, could be scheduled to campaign before fifth and seventh phase on April 17 and April 26 when constituencies like Burdaman, Asansol, Durgapur, which have a sizeable number of Bihar natives, go to vote. “We have received requests from Trinamool leaders and other candidates, but we have not drawn up a schedule so far. We are taking feedback from our party’s West Bengal unit on the canvassing schedule,” said Sanjay Yadav, a close aide of Tejashwi Yadav. Party’s national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said, “It is likely that Tejashwi will be campaigning in Bengal.” Jha had earlier said that Mamata Banerjee’s letter to 15 opposition leaders to unite against BJP was “very timely”. Incidentally, state BJP leaders have questioned Tejashwi Yadav’s “silence” over the Trinamool chief’s recent remarks wherein she accused the BJP of bringing in anti-social elements from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar at Nandigram to intimidate voters. Banerjee is locked in a keen contest with BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram, where polling took place on Thursday. “We condemn the statement by Banerjee about people from UP and Bihar. Why isTejashwi not giving a clarification?” said Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand. RJD’s state spokesperson Chittraranjan Gagan said BJP was in the habit of twisting facts for deriving political mileage. Meanwhile, HAM(S) chief and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, whose party is a constituent of the ruling NDA in Bihar, is also scheduled to campaign in a few areas of Kolkata from April 5 onwards. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, whose party JD(U) is contesting 40 seats in West Bengal, is unlikely to campaign there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tejashwi-may-campaign-in-wb-polls-101617295618219.html

A total 68,911 out of the total 1,81,799 people who took the jab on Thursday belonged to the 45-59 years of age as there was enthusiasm in this age group to take the shot. Bihar had on Wednesday vaccinated 91,339 people of which 13% (12,116) belonged to those in the 45-59 years of age group with co-morbidity. The increase in the number of beneficiaries in this age group on Thursday helped Bihar achieve total vaccination of 30.16 lakh beneficiaries so far of which people in the 45-59 years age group contributed to 3 lakh, according to government data released on Thursday. There was heavy rush of middle-aged beneficiaries at the Gardiner Road hospital around income-tax roundabout, in the heart of the state capital. Many younger beneficiaries complained that it took a long time to take the shot and they had to wait in long queues especially at the Gardiner Road Hospital. The vaccinators, on the other hand, claimed that the CoWIN portal was slow as a result of which uploading document and verification took time. “I had registered for vaccination online 15 days back, but authorities at the hospital took no note of it. I was handed a slip and made to wait for a long duration when I came to the Gardiner Road hospital to take the jab today,” said Sunil Sinha. Health authorities said they would look into the issue and issue specific instructions to the centre in-charge to accord priority to those who pre-book online. “We will look into it. Those who pre-book online should be accorded priority in vaccination,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, also the state nodal officer for vaccination. On the rush at the Gardiner Road hospital, Kumar said, “We will have to mobilise other nearby facilities like the Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan Hospital and the Shastrinagar urban primary health centre for vaccination to prevent crowding at one place.” Bihar aims to achieve at least 2 lakh vaccinations in a day with the opening of vaccination for the 45-59 year age group. It achieved 1.81 lakh on the opening day Thursday. The state was now left with 6 lakh doses of vaccine. It expects to receive an additional 8 lakh doses on Friday after having received 33 lakh doses of the vaccine since the commencement of the COVID-19 vaccination drive on January 16. The state has a target group of 1.80 crore people in the 45-59 years age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/38-young-beneficiaries-take-jabs-on-opening-day-in-bihar-101617295558137.html

The BJP leader alleged that Banerjee influenced officials during the Lok Sabha elections held two years ago and replaced votes for BJP with TMC in two district councils.“Mamata pressurized DM and SDO during last general polls. In Arambag, the BJP candidate lost by 2,500 votes because the votes of 16 EVMs were not counted.

On witnessing ‘Jai Shree Ram’ sloganeering as she visited a polling booth in Nandigram, Banerjee alleged that “goons from other states” were creating a ruckus and that the poll body was acting on instructions from Union home minister Amit Shah. She also said that many local voters in Nandigram were not being allowed to vote.The West Bengal chief minister has filed a complaint with the EC, which has directed two poll observers to submit a report by Friday evening. While the poll body, in a statement, took note of reports of alleged “gherao of the chief minister” in Nandigram, a poll observer told EC that polling wasn’t disrupted at any moment.Adhikari also countered Banerjee’s claim that no matter what EC tries, BJP would lose and 90% of votes in Nandigram would be in favour of TMC. He expressed confidence and stated that 90% of the votes have gone to BJP, according to ANI.Meanwhile, Yashwant Sinha, former BJP leader who recently joined the TMC, told ANI, “As per our information, Mamata Banerjee is winning with a huge margin (in Nandigram) and the opposition candidate is nowhere near her.”The heated battle comes as Banerjee and Adhikari, who was previously a close aide of the CM, are pitted against each other from the Nandigram constituency.

01-04-2021||Mumbai||Never said Sharad Pawar should replace Sonia Gandhi as UPA chairperson: Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday claimed he never said that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi should be replaced by NCP president Sharad Pawar as the UPA chairperson, and added that he had only underscored the need to strengthen the alliance.He said that all the opposition parties need to come together to form a strong alliance at the national level.His remarks come in the wake of Maharashtra Congress leaders criticising him for his suggestion that Pawar should take over as United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson."I have never said Sonia Gandhi should be replaced by Sharad Pawar as UPA chairperson. There is a need to strengthen the UPA for the sake of the country. I just said there is a need to strengthen the opposition alliance. I haven't criticised Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi," Raut said."I fact, I have stood up for them whenever they were targeted by the political rivals," he told a television channel, when asked about the Congress leaders' criticism over his recent remarks.On being asked about his "accidental home minister" comment against Anil Deshmukh, Raut said, "Something happening by accident is a phrase. One always sees an opportunity in an accident."To a question on Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's remarks that nobody should play spoilsport in a coalition government, the Rajya Sabha member said, "People have played spoilsport by taking oath early morning."He was referring to Ajit Pawar's early morning swearing-in with Devendra Fadnavis before the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government after the 2019 Assembly polls. Fadnavis and Pawar had taken oath as the chief minister and deputy chief minister respectively. However, their government had lasted for only 80 hours.Replying to a question whether the Shiv Sena would join the UPA or go back to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Raut said his party does not play politics of convenience."Our alliance with Congress and NCP here was need of the hour since we felt we were cheated by the BJP," he said.Raut hit out at Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari for taking no decision on nominating 12 members from his quota to the state legislative council."The governor doesn't want the MVA to increase its strength in the Legislative Council. He feels the government will not last. But the MVA is strong and will last its full term," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/never-said-sharad-pawar-should-replace-sonia-gandhi-as-upa-chairperson-raut-101617292326860.html

The situation is getting worse ever since the metro work has started near the bus stand.“Earlier traffic police used to take action against them (auto drivers), but now since last one month, the nuisance has increased. The number of autorickshaws keeps on increasing especially after 3 pm every day,” said Nirmala Patil, who works at a private office in Shivajinagar.The spot visit from HT confirmed that drivers occupy more space than commuters and most of the drivers were seen flouting social distancing norms.“I have noticed many times that the auto drivers don’t even wear a face mask and keep spitting near the bus stand and no one takes action against them,” said Rini Patel, who travels from Shivajinagar to Aundh every day.Asif Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver, said, “We don’t have an autorickshaw stand like one at the Deccan Gymkhana bus stand at Shivajinagar. Due to the metro work undertaken in the area, there is no space available for us, we park our autos here to get the customers.”Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Our team keeps on patrolling in morning and evening.

Rao asserted that while curbs are necessary, the Pune district administration has also been focusing on increasing the number of beds, and 600 more beds in private hospitals will be made available by April 6. His remarks assume significance ahead of the Covid review meeting scheduled on Friday, when deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will be present. Last week, Pawar had warned citizens to follow rules to avoid lockdown, saying he would take call on Friday. The meeting is likely to discuss whether to impose a complete lockdown or to bring in more curbs in Pune district, which reported 8,600 cases on Wednesday. “More restrictions are absolutely necessary to slow down the rate of infection. It will be discussed at Friday’s Covid review meeting. We are constantly trying to increase bed capacity. We had the highest numbers of Covid beds in private hospitals on Oct 13, 2020. We want to get those many beds before April 6,” said Rao. On Thursday, Rao and the PMC officials had a meeting with private hospitals and asked private hospitals to make more beds available. On October 13, 2020, there were 2,134 beds allotted for Covid patients in private hospitals. Whereas on April 1, 2021, 1,423 beds are available in private hospitals. “Six hundred more beds will be available before April 6. I have spoken with officials from the Southern Command. They have agreed to give us a dedicated Covid hospital,” Rao said. Even after a month of imposing partial restrictions, Covid cases in Pune have been surging. After the Covid review meeting held last week, Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar had warned to impose lockdown after April 2nd if the number of Covid cases doesn’t come down. The cases have been surging throughout the week and the availability of beds in hospitals has become an issue. There has been widespread opposition to a lockdown. “Lockdown is not the solution. Cases are rising but the mortality rate is low. The focus should be on increasing health infrastructure. The economy will collapse again. People are not in a mental state to accept a lockdown. Increasing the number of beds is the solution. Pros and cons of the lockdown have to be weighed,” said Sidharth Shirole, elected representative from Shivajinagar assembly constituency. On Friday, the Covid review meeting will be conducted at the divisional commissioner’s office in the presence of district and municipal corporation officials, elected representatives and the Pune’s guardian minister, Ajit Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-review-meet-admin-to-push-for-more-strict-restrictions-101617290277831.html

The same has been forwarded to Special General Observer Shri Ajay Nayak and Special Police Observer Shri Vivek Dube under intimation to CEO. They have been asked to send a report by tomorrow 6pm,” the poll body said in a statement.Follow latest updates on West Bengal, Assam voting here Banerjee’s complaint was filed as violence was reported from the Nandigram constituency where the chief minister visited one of the polling stations to oversee voting. As the CM sat inside the booth, loud slogans with iterations of BJP's 'Jai Shree Ram' were heard, according to ANI.The Election Commission took note of the “alleged gherao of Banerjee” and crowding at polling station No. 7 at Nandigram that resulted in disruption of poll process.The general observer, however, told the poll body that the chief minister left the place at about 3.35 pm after staying there for nearly one and half hour and that “polling was not disrupted at any moment.”Earlier in the day, the TMC supremo alleged, “We have lodged 63 complaints since morning. But no action has been taken... This is unacceptable." She also threatened to move the court over the issue, Banerjee said while sitting in a wheelchair outside booth 7 in Boyal in Nandigram, according to PTI. The chief minister alleged, "The EC is working on the instructions of Amit Shah," and added that “goons from other states” were creating a ruckus.While Banerjee said her discussion with the poll observer and governor was “confidential,” Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O Brien said that the chief minister referred to some specific incidents in her statement about the polling booths. “We'll consider taking next step because we want to do this not for just winning Nandigram or West Bengal but we need to do it for keeping democracy in place,” the TMC MP was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He said that though the party was confident of winning the Nandigram assembly seat as well as the overall assembly polls, they may approach the poll body. “Even though we may win, we may still consider going to the Election Commission.

The ambulance service operator claimed that his service has not charged this amount. He claimed that the receipt book was stolen from his vehicle and someone must have forged the bill. “After the incident came to our attention, we served a notice to the registered owner of the ambulance. Concrete action will be taken in next three days. Ambulance operators should not overcharge patients. They should abide by the rates decided by administration,” said Sanjeev Bhor, deputy regional transport officer, Pune RTO. A 45-year-old Covid patient had to be shifted from Naidu hospital to another hospital on March 28 at 2am. The kin of the patient alleged that the ambulance they had booked demanded Rs19,000 for just for 19km, despite of the fact the there is a cap on rates. “The claim of the owner that his receipt book was stolen is preposterous. We didn’t see any other option, but to book the ambulance. The charges were paid through UPI mode,” said Mayur Bolade, a friend of the patient who was present at the time.According to officials, the showcause notice has been issued to Green Park ILF, which owns the ambulance.

All hotels, bars and restaurants currently close at 8pm.Already, notices have been given to support staff, especially helpers, that their services will no longer be required.Maaaz Shaikh, owner of hotel Mughlai in Undri, said, “I have given an intimation to my waiters that they will have to look for options as business has gone down by 90 per cent. How do I pay them?” Haris Meethal, owner of the Agra hotel in Camp said, “Business is next to nil and there is no money to pay rent, so the only option is to remove employees as we have no money to pay them.”Hoteliers claim that the state government’s decision to implement a curfew from 8 pm to 7 am till April 15 is causing severe losses to business.Ikram Khan, who runs Sohos in Kalyaninagar, said, “The Covid-19 lockdown ruined the industry and broke its back. The excise department must partner with the industry as it brings in revenue for the government.” Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said, “The government order states that the hotels and business establishments must be closed after 8 pm. This is resulting in huge losses. Citizens are freely moving on the roads while the hotels are closed. The government must carry out limited restrictions from 3 pm till 5 pm and instead give us permission to operate till 11am. Eighty per cent of business starts late in the evening. The current restrictions will cause huge losses and jobs cuts as we don’t have money to pay for salaries, rents, loans and other expenses which require heavy investment. Moreover, the government has not released any funds for revival of the industry.” Shetty pointed out that several hoteliers had put their staff on notice saying that in case of further lockdown or restrictions, they might lose their jobs.According to PRAHA, 8,500 restaurants which shut down had sustained huge economic losses and the total lockdown losses have been pegged at around ₹300 crore, with more 0.2 million hotel staffers losing their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hoteliers-begin-to-cut-support-staff-due-to-loss-of-revenue-101617284997526.html

In Nandigram, 90% of the votes will go to TMC,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, after she visited one of the polling stations in the Nandigram constituency and alleged that many voters were not being allowed to vote. She also lodged a complaint regarding the same with governor Jagdeep Dhankar over the same.Follow latest updates on voting in West Bengal, Assam hereThe West Bengal chief minister’s comments come after chaos for nearly two hours when she reached the polling booth to oversee the voting process. Intense sloganeering could be heard as Banerjee sat inside the booth, with loud iterations of BJP's 'Jai Shree Ram', ANI reported.The TMC supremo also trained guns at Union home minister Amit Shah saying he was instructing central forces to assist “BJP goons.” “Home Minister himself is instructing CRPF, BSF, and other jawans to help only BJP and its goons. I apologise to my Election Commission for their silence. We have given so many letters but they are one-sidedly supporting BJP candidates,” she was quoted as saying.Banerjee claimed that 63 complaints regarding booth capturing have been sent to the EC and slammed the poll body for “inaction.”Click here for full assembly election 2021 coverageThe EC, meanwhile, sought a detailed report from the administration in connection with an incident of violence in Boyal area in Nandigram, news agency PTI reported.Her opponent from the Nandigram seat, Suvendu Adhikari, who was once known to be Banerjee’s close aide, accused her of disrupting polling for nearly two hours and said that she was indulging in “drama”. “Mamata stalled voting for 2 hours here.

This comes amid the TMC and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s call to opposition leaders to unite against the BJP. Banerjee had written to 15 top opposition leaders on Wednesday to have them unite against the BJP.As per some top RJD leaders, the 31-year old Yadav scion, who has already extended his party’s support to the TMC in the West Bengal polls by not fielding any candidates to strengthen secular forces, has received requests from several TMC candidates and leaders to campaign in various constituencies in the next few weeks before the conclusion of the eight-phased polls. “We have received requests from the TMC leaders and other candidates asking Tejashwi to visit Bengal to campaign but we have not drawn up a schedule so far. There are chances Tejashwi would campaign in few areas in the coming weeks. Right now, we are taking feedback from the state party unit on how the canvassing schedule could be prepared in a consolidated manner,” said Sanjay Yadav, a close aide of Tejashwi. Sources said Tejashwi’s campaign programme could be scheduled before the fifth and the seventh phase of polls on April 17 and April 26 when constituencies like Burdaman, Asansol, Durgapur, having a sizeable Bihari population, will go to polls. Party’s Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Manoj Jha expressed the same and said, “it is likely Tejashwi will be campaigning in Bengal”. The RJD MP had described the TMC chief’s letter to 15 top opposition leaders as “very timely”. “The letter by TMC chief Mamata Banerjee to opposition leaders to unite against the BJP is precisely very timely. The BJP is virtually berserk in destroying institutions and established democratic norms,” said Jha. Bengal BJP leaders have attacked Tejashwi for his silence over Banerjee’s recent remarks where she had accused the BJP of bringing in anti-social elements from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to Nandigram to allegedly intimidate voters. Banerjee is locked in a keen contest with BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram where polling took place on Thursday. “We condemn the statement by Banerjee about people from UP and Bihar. Why is Tejashwi not giving a clarification? The TMC chief’s statement is an attempt to stoke feelings of regionalism,” said Nikhil Anand, state BJP spokesperson. However, RJD’s state spokesperson Chittraranjan Gagan averred that the BJP was in the habit of twisting facts and giving a different angle to the TMC chief’s statement for deriving political mileage. Meanwhile, Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM-S) chief and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, an ally of the NDA, is also scheduled to campaign in few areas of Kolkata from April 5. The participation of top NDA leaders in the West Bengal polls this time has been low with Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar unlikely to campaign, although the Janata Dal(United) is contesting 40 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tejashwi-yadav-likely-to-campaign-in-west-bengal-polls-in-coming-weeks-101617282238220.html

For that reason only, the anticipatory bail application came to be rejected. Similar are the observations of the Hon High Court in the order dated March 3, 2021.”Advocate SS Nikam, who represented Jatkar, argued that the other accused in the case have been interrogated in police custody, entire evidence has already been collected and therefore her custodial interrogation is not necessary. She is ready to co-operate with the investigating officer and make herself available for inquiry.Public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare-Patil demanded her police custody on the ground that there is a big network that needs to be busted. “We have witnesses who have stated that there are seven to eight more land-related matters in which earlier arrested accused Shubhavari Gaikwad (private person) had approached them on behalf of Jatkar to settle the cases and get a judgement in their favour.”“ACB has to seize the mobile phone of Jatkar. She had spoken to Gaikwad 147 times, with another arrested accused police inspector (dismissed) Jadhav 18 times. During the conversation, Jatkar has taken names of judge Deshmukh and Ajay Gopinathan and ACB has to investigate about it,” the public prosecutor said.On hearing both sides, Judge Navander stated, “At this juncture, it is necessary to note that the present accused is the key person of the crime. The actions of the other accused were depending upon her moves and directions. The investigating officer has specifically stated that she has to interrogate the accused not only regarding the incident mentioned in the present crime but some other instances also, the mobile found with the accused has to be seized, her connections with the other accused have to be searched and for that purpose inquiry of accused is necessary while in custody. Ongoing through the case diary, what can be noted is that it is not a single transaction in which there is the involvement of the present accused. It is not a single instance that can be just inquired and closed. Considering the scope of the investigation, custodial interrogation of the accused is absolutely necessary, it cannot be dispensed with only because the accused is a Judicial Officer. The status of a particular person cannot become a hurdle for the investigation.”The first information report (FIR) in the bribery case was lodged at Dehu road police station for offences under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Earlier arrestsACB has already arrested Shubhavari Bhalchandra Gaikwad (29), a resident of Talegaon, Sushant Baban Kenjale (35) of Ravet and dismissed the police inspector Bhanudas alias Anil Jadhav of Mumbai. They are currently lodged in jail under magisterial custody remand while Ajay Gopinathan, a resident of Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, is wanted in the case.On January 13, 2021, a trap was laid and Gaikwad was arrested for accepting a bribe amount, which consisted of real cash of ₹50,000 and duplicate notes of ₹2,50,000. Her hands were checked under the ultraviolet lamp, those were found shining with the anthracene powder. Accordingly, a trap panchanama was prepared.Gaikwad impersonated herself as a court staffer and promised to manage the court’s decision in favour of the complainant identified as Swapnil Madhukar Shevkar, a resident of Induri in Maval taluka.Gaikwad, approached him on January 4- 5 falsely pretending herself to be “Mhatre Madam” and told him that there is a criminal case filed against him in the court of the applicant judicial officer. She also showed him a copy of a criminal complaint and pointed out that it was posted for hearing on January 6 and gave him an assurance that the case will be dismissed by managing the presiding officer if he made a payment of ₹5 lakh.Shevkar showed displeasure after which she reduced the amount of bribe to ₹3 lakh. The complainant, therefore, approached the office of ACB on January 6 and filed a complaint of demand for bribe after which a trap was laid leading to her arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/judge-of-local-court-in-pune-held-for-taking-bribe-on-pretext-of-favourable-decision-sent-to-police-custody-till-april-5-101617279357382.html

From the last 10.5 years, various works on the highway are pending and in spite of that the toll rates have been increased making passengers furious. The NHAI Pune division has given a public notice in the local newspapers according to which, “From April 1, 2021 onwards the rates of the light motor vehicles, minibuses and trucks (two axle), goods transport vehicles, heavy transport vehicles (three to six axle), huge vehicles with seven axles are going to be increased by 5 per cent.” While the activists have opposed this toll hike, Vivek Velankar president of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “The decision of increasing the toll rates at Khed Shivapur toll naka on the Pune Satara highway is not right. As the works are still pending and not done properly in the last ten years several fatal and serious accidents have taken place on this highway. Traffic jams, fuel wastage and mental harassment is also faced by travellers. Due to Fastag, the toll collection has increased then why has this unnecessary toll hike being done?” From April 1 onwards, common passengers travelling by car will have to pay ₹100 one way and ₹150 for return travelling within 24 hours. Similarly, the rates have been increased for other heavy vehicles, trucks, buses and huge transport vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nhai-increases-toll-rate-by-5-per-cent-at-khed-shivapur-toll-naka-101617277138058.html

They said they will intensify their agitation against the three farm laws by holding protests in Delhi and Punjab on the harvest festival of Baisakhi on April 13 and the birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, on April 14 besides marching to Parliament in May. Farmers also plan to block the KMP Expressway in Haryana for 24 hours on April 10. The Supreme Court panel, comprising farm economists Anil Ghanwat, Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi, submitted its report to the top court recently. Bhupinder Singh Mann, a Bhartiya Kisan Union leader, who was also initially a part of the committee, resigned from the panel. No hope from committee: Rajewal “We have already rejected this committee and are not aware about its report. Farmers have no hope from the members of this committee as the three laws have been made on their recommendations. They have expressed their point of view by writing articles in newspapers in favour of these laws,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, the chief of the BKU’s Rajewal faction. He is a senior leader of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 32 farmers groups. “We are not concerned about the report of the SC panel and its hearing.

However, we found it only later,” said Pankaj Deshmukh, deputy commissioner of police, zone-4 of Pune police.“The Amravati police brought the accused to Pune on March 30 and we arrested him on March 31. He was produced in court on March 31 and remanded to custody till April 5. He told us that they had been in a relationship in the past, but were having disputes.

01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid vaccination drive picks up in Himachal||The Covid-19 vaccination drive, which had got off to a slow start in Himachal Pradesh, gathered pace on Thursday with the launch of the third phase for those aged 45 years and above. The enthusiasm is higher among the younger population and the state government has set up 2,700 inoculation centres to cater to the demand. “I got myself registered for the vaccination as soon as the government announced opening the vaccination for us. I have lost many near and dear ones to this pandemic,” said Vikas Singha, 46, an apple orchadist from Kotgarh. National Rural Health Mission state director Dr Nipun Jindal, who is in-charge of the vaccination drive in Himachal Pradesh, said 3.11 lakh doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been received. “We are geared up to cover all those above 45. We are targeting 14-18 lakh people in this phase. A total of 2,500 vaccination centres have been set up across the state and the doses have been delivered. We aim to vaccinate more than 20,000 people daily,” Dr Jindal said. Shimla chief medical officer Dr Surekha Chopra said: “We had been holding 80 vaccination sessions a day in Shimla district but have increased them from today.” Behind target in earlier phases The health department aimed to inoculate 96,000 health workers in the first phase of vaccination but has been able to cover 77,000 so far. District administrations have been asked to complete the coverage of health workers by April 10. “The vaccination drive is being accelerated and we are running a publicity campaign urging all those eligible to take the vaccine,” Dr Jindal said. The department aimed to vaccinate 11 lakh senior citizens but has been able to inoculate only 3 lakh of them so far. Not many above 45 with co-morbidities came forward with only 12,537 of them getting vaccinated. However, the response from frontline workers, particularly those in the police, has been encouraging. Of the 59,000 frontline workers, 46,310 have got themselves vaccinated. Reaching out to remote regions Understaffing at sub centres and primary health centres in remote areas of Chamba and Sirmaur districts is hampering the vaccination drive. “We don’t deny that this is one of the reasons for the slow pace, but arrangements are being made to inoculate people in remote areas,” says Dr Gopal Berry, deputy director, NRHM. The vaccination drive is yet to reach Malana, a remote village in Kullu district that still lacks road connectivity. “So far, no health worker has visited us. Our village deity has been kind and not a single person has been infected during the pandemic,” says Raju Ram, the pradhan of the Malana panchayat. The vaccination drive is slow in Chopal assembly segment in Shimla district due to staff shortage at health centres and lack of transport facilities at some villages. Chamba shows the way to make drive a success In Chamba, the health authorities have started carrying out vaccination in a phased manner. “As far as the remote parts are concerned, we are carrying out vaccination at sub centres and primary health centres on alternate days,” says Chamba chief medical officer Dr Rajesh Guleri. “We have many sub-centres without staff, but our teams have been deputed there to carry out the inoculation,” he said. So far, more than 35,000 people have been inoculated in the district. Of them, about 20,000 are senior citizens with co-morbidities which is an achievement given the district’s topography.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccination-drive-picks-up-in-himachal-101617274437780.html
01-04-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Suez Canal channelling food stuff to Pune since 1869||On July 24, 1876, a letter written by one Mrs. H appeared in “The Statesman and New Friend of India”, a daily published from Calcutta. “Establishments in Mahabalesvar, without being nearly half so well supplied, are much dearer than those of Calcutta and Bombay. It is difficult to purchase good quality jams and other preserves and they bear a most preposterous price. One has to purchase a jar of pickle brought from England for two pounds”, she complained. She also presented a solution to her problem in the same letter. If “provisioners like Havell, Whitley (sic), Wyse and Cox who had shops in Calcutta, Madras and Patna opened their branches in Poona (or preferable Mahabalesvar)”, she would be “spared of the act of extravagance of purchasing jams, pickles, and cheese at exorbitant rates”.Mrs. H further posed an interesting question - with the opening of the Suez Canal, why was it difficult for her to procure fresher and cheaper provisions in Mahabalesvar and Poona? She was not completely off the mark. Worldwide trade surged in the second half of the nineteenth century, and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 had the effect of channelling much of the resultant shipping through the Middle East. Britain and India had become enclasped in an economic partnership, and the essential condition was an uninterrupted procession of steamships passing through the Canal.In the days of sail, the voyage from England to India via the Cape of Good Hope took four months at least. The commodities would further require up to two months to reach their destinations by road, or sometimes, rail. The invention of the compound steam engine dramatically reduced the cost of shipping goods by sea. Coupled with the inauguration of submarine cable links, the opening of the Suez Canal facilitated communication between India and Europe, and the trade on this route largely increased.This directly benefitted establishments like Havell (Patna), Whiteley (Madras), and Tulloh and Co. (Calcutta), who now had access to fresher and cheaper products. They earlier had to face stiff competition from the captains of East Indiamen, who filled the private space allotted to them in their ships with goods for resale in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. As soon as his ship arrived, the captain would advertise his wares in local newspapers, listing such delicacies as tinned lobsters, oysters and reindeer tongues, liqueurs, hams and dried fruits. This illegal trade came to a halt after Britain gained control over the Suez Canal. The British reorganised the Egyptian Government and suppressed corruption, thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal.Refrigeration had by then made it practicable to ship beef, lamb, butter, fish and fruit halfway around the globe. “Mahratta”, the English periodical edited by BG Tilak, in March 1883 reported that European shops in the Poona cantonment area had prospered after the Suez Canal became operational and that they had started stocking goods that were not available earlier. It wished that Maharashtrian youth would take cognisance of this opportunity and export spices to Europe.“Mahratta” did not seem to have pursued this matter again, but almost a decade later, on September 12, 1891, “Bombay Chronicle” wrote about a Parsi gentleman who had set up a small manufacturing unit in Indapur, near Pune. His name was Jamshedji Mehta and he intended to make “a variety of cooking and table sauces and pickles”. The Madras and Poona sauces and the cabbage and raw mango pickles made at Indapur were to be exported to the United Kingdom. Mehta had already applied for required permits and had employed native and European staff. The newspaper does not mention Mehta or his factory at Indapur again. My search for him and his enterprise has drawn no results. Maybe the factory never took off. Or it shut down after it failed to attract customers. But, this seems unlikely given the huge demand for European delicacies in British India. Mrs. H would definitely have been a loyal customer.She might have had to wait for a few years to buy cheaper and fresher European delicacies in Poona after she wrote the letter to the newspaper. Her wish was finally granted when Treacher and Company, Limited (who had their shops in Bombay, Byculla and Poona), proudly announced in January 1881 that, (their) “department was being continuously replenished with supplies purchased from the first English and Continental Houses and shipped weekly via the Suez Canal; the Company was thus placed in a position to guarantee both quality and freshness, advantages which should be specially noted by consumers”.Treacher and Company, established in the late 1860s, had their shop on Arsenal Road in Poona and sold hams, bacon, butter, cheese, tongues, brawn, ox cheek, soups (hare, mock-turtle, ox tail), fish, french pates, beef, lamb, veal, sausages, pies, shrimp, lobsters, vegetables, tart fruits, jams, jellies, pickles, biscuits, sauces, tea, coffee, and chocolates. It was in existence when Mrs. H complained about her plight, and hence, it is a mystery why she chose to ignore Treacher’s.Nevertheless, Poona got its share of fresh European meat and preserves thanks to the Suez Canal. I hope that made Mrs. H happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-suez-canal-channelling-food-stuff-to-pune-since-1869-101617273598398.html

01-04-2021||Mumbai||Cyber cell registers FIR after Maharashtra industrial body’s server hacked||Mumbai’s cyber police on Wednesday registered an FIR in connection with the hacking of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC)’s server. Due to the cyber attack, the functioning of the MIDC’s head office in Mumbai and 16 other regional offices was disrupted. It is alleged that the hackers demanded ₹500 crore as ransom; however, neither the police nor MIDC officials have confirmed the exact amount. It is not yet clear whether the attackers are from India or abroad, the police said.According to the MIDC, the attack took place on March 21 at 2.30am and the attackers demanded a ransom through email. “Ransomware has attacked the local server system and the database which are hosted at the MIDC headquarters. This damaged the computers at the corporation’s (16) regional offices. The email sent by the attackers explained the kind of attack and their demand for ransom,” MIDC officials stated. Also Read | SolarWinds hack: US weighs ‘seen and unseen’ responses to major cyber attackSources said that the hackers demanded ₹500 crore in ransom, but the corporation didn’t bring this up in their complaint. “The FIR (given by the MIDC) in the cyber attack matter does not mention any ₹500 crore ransom,” said Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police (crime), adding, “We are investigating the case further.”MIDC stated that to prevent the spread of the virus after the attack, all computers were disconnected from the server. The corporation also asked all its departments to shut their systems and not to switch on the computers until the issue is completely resolved. This caused a disruption of services across the state.Deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu, the spokesperson for Mumbai Police, stated that the MIDC on Wednesday complained to the Cyber police stating that on March 21, unidentified attackers used ransom malware to access the MIDC’s computer system and encrypted all its important data.All MIDC’s systems are hosted on the ESDS (a cloud service provider) and a local server . The corporation uses Trend Micro anti-virus software for security and maintenance. The corporation claimed that as backup files of its website, Single Window Clearance system, Building Plan Approval Management System (BPAMS), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), computerised land distribution system, water bills, etc. are stored on different networks; they’re all safe. Some services have been restored while some will be restored in a day or two.Commenting on the extent of damage to the MIDC’s system due to the attack and restoring of service, Dr Anbalagan P, chief executive officer, MIDC, told HT, “The retrieval is complete. All customer interface such as single-window and other applications have been restored and made operational.”On MIDC’s complaint, the cyber police registered an FIR under sections 43 A (Compensation for failure to protect Data), F (denies or causes the denial of access to any person authorised to access any computer, computer system or computer network by any means) and 66 (computer related offences) of Information Technology Act.A team of cyber police officers also visited the MIDC office on Tuesday for inquiry. The investigators are now trying to track the digital footprints of the attacker to ascertain who is behind the ransom malware attack. Earlier an attempt at cyber sabotage, allegedly by a Chinese state-sponsored Cyber threat group, caused a massive power outage in Mumbai last October. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh had said that the Maharashtra Cyber police found evidence that suggests that the grid failure in Mumbai on October 12 last year, that resulted in the city plunging into darkness and disrupting train services, shutting down the stock market and generally hitting economic activities, was likely to be cyber sabotage.The New York Times citing a report by a US-based cyber security firm which claimed that Chinese-state sponsored groups had targeted the power sector in India with malware.

01-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Olive trees of Delhi||It might be dry, dusty and polluted, but Delhi is home to 252 species of trees, according to Pradip Krishen’s book ‘Trees of Delhi’. (New York has 130.) Right now, the bloom of the semal’s red flowers is ending. Soon, amaltas will glow with their golden yellow flowers. While every neighbourhood is rich with its neem, peepal or pilkhan.But you won’t find the olive tree in your nearest public park. It belongs to the soil of the Mediterranean. And yet, there’s a place in Delhi where it is flourishing. In the embassy of Italy, the land famous for its Da Vinci and Michelangelo, and its pizzas and... olive oil.This evening Paola Ferri de Luca, the ambassador’s wife, is strolling about the olives in the embassy garden. Her residence is part of the building complex, in Delhi’s Chanakyapuri.The sight of these trees is likely to shock a Delhiite, who may have had olive oil without ever seeing the tree the oil comes from. It is too short for a tree—probably no taller than film-star Amitabh Bachchan—but the foliage is disproportionately vast, and hangs upon the stumpy trunk like a motionless cloud.The garden has the same number of olives as there are figures in painter Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper — 13. They were planted in the 1990s under the supervision of the then ambassador, Gabriele Menegatti. The seeds were brought from Italy. Talking on WhatsApp from the municipality of Labro, in central Italy, where he lives in retirement, Mr Menegatti explains that “to Italians, the olive tree is a symbol of peace, of resilience, with widespread roots, growing on very poor soil, demanding little water.”Looking at the branches, Ms de Luca observes that the trees are trimmed once a year, the most recent was in August. A native of Naples, she confirms that these look similar to the trees growing in her country, though the Delhi ones don’t yield fruit because of different climate conditions.As the evening progresses, Ms de Luca invites the embassy’s gardeners to celebrate these trees— Kallu, Sharda Prasad, Sunil Kumar, Anuj Kumar, Lalu Ram, and Daya Ram. In their presence, the olives start to look as desi as the garden’s neem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-olive-trees-of-delhi-101617232293498.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Truck runs over people at Kashmere Gate, two dead||A 35-year-old homeless man and a civil defence volunteer were killed, and two other homeless men seriously injured, after a mini truck, which was allegedly speeding, first hit a scooter and then ran onto a pavement where the homeless people were sleeping at Kashmere Gate on Wednesday morning, the police said.The deceased civil defence volunteer, who was on the scooter, was identified as 34-year-old Vehram Khan. Police said the identity of the dead homeless man could not be ascertained till late evening.The errant mini truck driver, Atiq Ahmed, was caught by a police team on patrol duty. He was booked for rash and negligent driving causing death and injury, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said around 6.15am, the patrolling staff of Kashmere Gate police station spotted an accident on a loop road towards Nigambodh Ghat from Yudhister Setu. “A mini truck had ran onto the pavement and injured three homeless people sleeping there, after first hitting a man on a scooter. One of the homeless men died on the spot. The other three injured persons were rushed to Sushruta Trauma Centre, where the scooter rider was declared brought dead,” said Alphonse.Also read | Sizzler of a March turns out to be the hottest in 11 years, says IMDA police officer said the truck was carrying some plants and saplings to Sarai Kale Khan from north-east Delhi.The truck driver was alone in the vehicle and it was coming from the Shastri Park side. After crossing the Yamuna bridge (Yudhister Setu), the truck driver took a left turn on the loop towards Nigambodh Ghat. “The truck first hit the scooter before climbing onto the footpath outside a night shelter run by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). It ran over three homeless men sleeping on the footpath before crashing through a concrete wall and into a drain alongside the road,” the officer said.Of the two injured men, one was identified as Ramesh, 52, from Ludhiana in Punjab, while the other person was yet to be identified.At the time of the mishap, civil defence volunteer Vehram Khan was returning home on the scooter after dropping his mother at a bus stop in Jafarabad, his family members told the police.DUSIB member Bipin Rai said there are 30 shelter homes in a two-kilometre radius between Geeta Ghat and Gandhi Park for the homeless. “Despite the caretakers of these homes asking people to sleep inside, some sleep on the pavements to escape the heat. It was an unfortunate incident, and we will try to rope in more NGOs to ensure the homeless sleep inside the shelters only,” said Rai.Sunil Kumar Aledia, member, Centre for Holistic Development, however, said a large number of homeless around Kashmere Gate sleep on footpaths because there is not enough space in shelter homes. “Twenty temporary winter homes where nearly 600 homeless people slept were recently removed from the area. The existing homes are already overcrowded. So these people have no choice but to sleep on pavements. There have been similar deaths in the past, but the Delhi government still does not have a homeless policy to ensure their safety and security,” added Aledia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/truck-runs-over-people-at-kashmere-gate-two-dead-101617232116242.html

All conditions related to space, infrastructure, manpower and cold chain mandated by rules will have to be followed,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Yadav said private hospitals in the city have large capacities and need to be utilised optimally, which was why they allowed private hospitals to tie up with companies in a captive manner. “Teams from private hospitals can set up session sites on the premises of these companies and conduct vaccination as happened in the case of RWAs. Also, with citizens above the age of 45 years being allowed to get vaccinated now, a large number of corporate executives can be covered,” he said.Also read | Drive widens, 50mn set for both shots by May 15As per data shared by the health department, government vaccination sites have inoculated almost double the number of people when compared to the private sector. “If the capacity of private hospitals is used to the maximum, we will be able to vaccinate far more people,” said Yadav.On Wednesday, the government hospitals vaccinated 12,382 beneficiaries while the number in private hospitals stood at merely 1,906 beneficiaries.“The introduction of vaccination in RWAs helped and I hope the vaccination improves with the proposed tie-ups with private companies,” he said.Vinod Sood, managing director, Hughes Systiqe, who also holds the chair of NASSCOM, Haryana, said that allowing hospitals to tie-up with companies for vaccination will greatly boost the numbers.“We were already planning to seek permission for vaccination at our premises and now we will try to take maximum benefit from this directive. We will bear the cost of inoculating not only our employees and their families but also third party workers. To beat Covid-19 we will have to accelerate vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/firms-in-gurugram-can-tie-up-with-pvt-hospitals-vaccinate-staff-on-premises-101617231161227.html

Pawan Kumar Sharma, of Sector 21, Panchkula, had hired the agency to find a match for his daughter, who works at a private bank in Delhi. For this, he paid ₹80,500 on May 12, 2017. Despite assurance of prompt services, the agency failed to set up meetings with the shortlisted matches, Sharma complained.The company also kept sharing profiles, which did not meet their requirements. He wrote to them thrice in 2018 to stop sending these profiles and issue a refund, but to no avail, following which he approached the consumer court.Sycoriaan Matrimonial Services Limited said they provided 112 suitable profiles over 20 months as per the plan chosen by Sharma. However, they changed their preferences and rejected the profiles, which they cannot be blamed for. ‘Harassment writ large’Dismissing the arguments, in its order on Tuesday, the consumer commission said, “No credible proofs of the complainant having received and reverting in rejection of all claimed 112 profiles have been produced. It seems that only with a view to dodge this commission, the matrimonial agency has coined this excuse. The harassment suffered by the complainant is also writ large.” Further, by not promptly refunding the amount paid and redressing the customer’s grievance, the agency certainly and definitely indulged in unfair trade practice, the commission held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-gets-22-000-relief-as-matrimonial-agency-fails-to-find-groom-for-daughter-101617224634422.html

The violators have to pay the fine along with the water bill.”As per the norm, a truck should not carry more than 4,000 bricks and 250 cubic feet of construction material, lest the overloaded trucks should damage the roads.The chief coordinator of the Aerocity Resident Coordination Committee, Vinod Kumar, said, “We are receiving lots of complaints from residents of encroachments on the roads by allottees constructing houses or other commercial projects. They are damaging roads and even hindering traffic. It is a good move by GMADA and we urge them not to follow pick and choose policy.”Provide toilets before constructing building: GMADAIn an effort to stop open defecation, GMADA has made it mandatory to provide toilets for the labourers before the construction of a building in any urban area begins.The orders in this regard were issued after there were several complaints from residents of Aerocity of labourers defecating in the open. The orders stated that any plot owner, who wishes to construct a building, will get temporary sewer connection along with water connection. The owners have to give in writing that they are constructing toilets, failing which action will be taken against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-8-aerocity-allottees-challaned-for-keeping-construction-material-on-roads-101617224274442.html

01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Major fire at Dadumajra dumping ground leaves many breathless||A major fire broke out around 2pm on Wednesday at the dumping ground in Dadumajra , fumes of which triggered breathing problems among many people living in the areas nearby. Thick smoke engulfed the area, leading to poor visibility that caused inconvenience not only to commuters but also to residents staying in close vicinity — Dadumajra , Sector 38 (West), Sector 25 and Dhanas. Residents complained of irritation in throat and burning sensation in the eyes. Eight fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the fire. The cause of the blaze remained unknown so far, but officials on the ground said some waste material caught fire, which was spread further with the winds and soon engulfed a significant portion of the dumping ground. Anil Kumar Garg, chief fire officer, said, “The operation to bring the fire under control is on. The methane gas emitted from the garbage is highly inflammable, which led to a fire at the dumping ground. The waste material, including plastic, is still burning that is why it is taking so much time.” Similar incidents were reported at the same spot in October 2020, 2017 and 2016 as well. ‘No corrective measure taken despite repeated plaints’“The repeated incidents of fire at the dumping ground make it more difficult for us to reside here. Our houses get filled with smoke and stench. The government has failed us time and again and no corrective measure has been taken despite repeated requests and complaints to the authorities,” Dyal Krishan, president, Dadumajra Dumping Site Joint Action Committee, said. “We have submitted complaints to the authorities repeatedly, but no action has been taken. The smoke billowing from the dumping ground brought down visibility, making it difficult to drive,” said Nitin, a resident of Dhanas. Activist takes to Twitter, questions governance A green warrior, Paveela Bali, took to Twitter after the fire was reported at the dumping ground. In a tweet tagging the Prime Minister and his office, Bali wrote, “Honourable @narendramodi @PMOIndia we demand the resignation of @KirronKherBJP and dissolution of @ChandigarhAdmin and @MCChandigarh ,I have never tagged you before but I hope you will understand that this orphan called #chandigarh needs Better governance.if u care for chd RT.

He was relieved from the institute on March 13.In his complaint to the health ministry dated March 25, Yadav stated that one particular resident, who was a senior to him, used to pass derogatory remarks at him and his family and would not even permit him to have meals or rest hours.“I am traumatised and haunted by the ill-treatment I received during my tenure….I have not crumbled under workload, but due to hatred against me along with torture and ragging...He would force me to visit the department and the wards even after my working hours and would humiliate me throughout the day, always threatening me to leave the course mid-way. He maligned my image in the department and I was portrayed as someone who was inefficient or unwilling to work,” Yadav wrote in his complaint.Issue not brought to our notice: RDAPGIMER Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) said that the concerned doctor had not brought any such issue to their notice. However, the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association, a national-level body, has demanded an inquiry into the matter.“I am not aware of any such issue and the doctor concerned should have brought it to my knowledge so that we would have acted on it. He should have approached us before resigning,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of RDA.PGIMER in its official response said that a committee will be constituted to conduct a detailed inquiry into the case.“Dr Satish Yadav tendered his unconditional resignation earlier and no such issue of harassment was flagged at the time. However, all these issues have surfaced only later on after his leaving the institute. The institute has taken a serious view on this and a committee will be constituted to conduct a detailed inquiry to bring the facts to light,” an official statement said.Dr Yadav on the other hand said, “I had cited personal problems and my mental condition in my resignation letter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-doctor-alleges-ragging-by-colleague-resigns-101617224034336.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Renewed Indo-Pak truce raises Jammu farmers’ hopes for bumper wheat harvest||With India and Pakistan renewing the ceasefire pact, farmers with landholdings along the 200-km international border have reason to anticipate a bumper wheat crop this season. Over the years, large tracts of land between the zero line and border fence could not be cultivated to their full potential as India has had to put up anti-infiltration obstacle systems, comprising barbed fence, within its territory to check Pakistani infiltrators, including armed terrorists. A farmer, Amarjeet Singh of Mangral village, says, “The peace pact has given us reason to rejoice as we can now cultivate land beyond the fence. The Border Security Force (BSF) been allowing us to till our land beyond the fence with the help of bulletproof tractors.” “The BSF has granted us access to our fields through gates. Even women are allowed to go to the fields. The land had been lying unused for years together,” said Mukesh Kumar, another farmer.BSF, Jammu frontier, inspector general NS Jamwal said, “We encourage farmers to cultivate their farm lands beyond border the fence and till zero line. Initially, we selected farm land in RS Pura sector of Jammu district and in Kathua district. We were successful in both places and are therefore, hoping to extend it to other sectors.” “We are getting support from the civil administration and farmers as well. The BSF director general wants that our land should be cultivated to the fullest,” he said, adding that the BSF also provides bullet proof tractors wherever needed and security is also provided to workers. “Wherever they (farmers) feel scared or uncomfortable we provide them with security. We have women constables as well on the IB,” said the IG.Notably, the BSF and the civil administration had taken a joint initiative to use the ‘fenced out’ land for farming as the wild grass and bushes that came up on the farm fields over the years has helped Pakistan push infiltrators and dig trans-border tunnels. India and Pakistan on February 24 and 25 mutually agreed on a ceasefire agreement. The director generals of military operations of India and Pakistan reviewed the situation along the Line of Control (Loc) and all other sectors and agreed upon achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders since then not a single shot has been fired along the IB and 744-km LoC thereby bringing relief to the hapless villagers on either side of the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/renewed-indo-pak-truce-raises-jammu-farmers-hopes-for-bumper-wheat-harvest-101617223734068.html

Stress has been laid on easing the map approval system, and CCTV surveillance for security and safety of the residents. To promote the sports and health lifestyle, the Congress promised to implement public bicycle scheme and swimming pool complex. Twenty-four hour water supply, houses for homeless and a tourism schemes are the other key promises made by Congress.Earlier, addressing a press conference Rathore unleashed a scathing attack on BJP-led centre and state governments over rising inflation, unemployment and law and order situation.He said the Congress was contesting the MC elections on the slogan of ‘development and destruction’.Rathore said while the Congress government carried out development in the state, the BJP has ruined what was built over the years. He said in three years the BJP government done nothing which could be counted as a big achievement.“Chief Minister rues that the one year was wasted due to pandemic. It is just an excuse to hide failure of his government. The leadership quality is best reflected during crises. Sadly, the present chief minister doesn’t have such qualities,” he said.The Congress president said the BJP and the state government was nowhere to be seen during the pandemic. Instead, of providing relief, the state government increased the burden on the common public by increasing power and water tariffs and bus fares.He said the Congress workers in Dharamshala were enthusiastic and the party was also getting a huge support in the wards. He expressed confidence that Congress will win all the four municipal corporations in the state.Meanwhile, answering a question on BJP charges of corruption in underground dustbins installed in Dharamshala during Congress regime, former minister Sudhir Sharma said after coming to the power chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had inaugurated a scheme to install similar dustbins in Sunderngar town of his home district Mandi.“However, the project for Dharamshala town was closed and the payment of the German company which installed the bins was halted. The government released the payment only after German government stalled the visa application of chief minister over non-payment of dues,” he alleged.“If there were some irregularities the government should have probed it and punished the guilty, even if it was me,” he said.Congress president Kuleep Rathore said the party has decided to campaign in the elections without posters in the MC elections. The posters not only pollute the environment but also deface the town. Instead we have started “My Flag My Pride” campaign under which the party workers will install flags on their houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-releases-vision-document-for-dharamshala-mc-promises-to-set-up-funicular-railway-system-101617223378358.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Dry spell causes extensive crop loss in Himachal||At a time when the water level in rivers is receding at a rapid pace, the prevailing arid climatic conditions across Himachal Pradesh have caused extensive damage to crops. In March, the hill-state recorded a cumulative rain deficit of around 62% and the dry spell is expected to continue into the first week of April. This month all 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh recorded ‘deficit’ or ‘large deficit’ precipitation, officials said, adding that the average precipitation was 41.7mm. Thirteen spells of precipitation were recoded in March, of which only five gave ‘widespread’ to ‘fairly widespread’ precipitation. The weatherman has predicted a five-day dry spell in the state. “There were a lot of western disturbances but they only caused wet spells over northern parts of the country and regions of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir,” said Shimla Regional Meteorological Centre director Manmohan Singh. Agriculture mainstay for 89.96% population The situation has raised red flags for farmers and the government. Agriculture is the primary occupation for 89.96% of the population. Agriculture and horticulture provides direct employment to around 70% of the total workers in the state. Agriculture in Himachal comprises 13.62% of the state income. Of the total geographical area of the state (55.67 lakh hectares), the operational land holding of 9.44 lakh hectare is operated by 9.44 lakh farmers. Around 80% percent of the total cultivated area in the state is rain fed. The dry spell has made farmers in Kangra anxious as the district accounts for the highest production of wheat crop. Rain in Kangra was 83% below the normal. Chandermani Verma, a farmer from Mandi, said the prolonged dry spell had adversely hit the Rabi crop, primarly wheat. “Around 30 -40% of the crop was damaged. Rainfall in mid-March brought some relief but more damage is likely if it does not rain for few more days,” Verma said. Hamirpur, Bilaspur, Una and Chamba districts have also received scanty rainfall. The dry spell has also delayed sowing of vegetables, particularly the cucurbits ( gourd family), that are sold during the summer. “ There has been extensive damage to the wheat and other standing crops in the lower parts of Himachal Pradesh “ said director agriculture, Naresh Kumar Badhan “So far, around 20 to 25% of the crop has already been damaged, the extent could have been more if the weather remains dry in the coming days,” he said. The agriculture department has sent out its teams for assessing the damage. “Himachal’s economy is largely dependent on agriculture and any fluctuation in the production of food grains affects the economy,” says economist Pradeep Chauhan , former economic advisor to the state government. Apple growers concerned The dry spell has also added to the worries of the fruit growers. “Arid climate has caused stress on the plants, it is resulting in weak blooming in apple trees. The drought like situation will adversely impact the fruit quality,” says Progressive Apple Growers’ association President Lokinder Singh Bisht . “Sudden rise in temperature has caused blooming in higher elevation orchards, which is premature by two weeks” he said. Declare state drought prone: Farmers In the wake of the prevailing dry spell, farmers in Himachal Pradesh are demanding that the government to declare the state drought-prone state . Bharatiya Kisan Sangh has submitted a memorandum demanding the same. “ There has been very little snowfall and winter rainfall has been deficient , it has created a drought-like situation in the state that has affected rabi crops. Water sources are drying up rapidly,” said president Kedar Singh Tomar of Kisan Sangh Shimla . Farmers are demanding relief for the crop damage. Rabi crops such as wheat, gram, barley, peas, and potato and fodder crops have also seen heavy losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dry-spell-causes-extensive-crop-loss-in-himachal-101617222895125.html

As per the Chief Khalsa Diwan’s constitution, a ‘patit’ (a fallen Sikh) or a ‘non-amritdhari’ (Sikh who does not partake of amrit) cannot become its member. The matter was pending in Sikhism’s highest temporal seat for several months after it was brought to its notice that the members were being included in the organisation in violation of the laid-down norms. CKD president Nirmal Singh and other office-bearers appeared in the Takht secretariat before the Sikh clergy led by acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh. The clergy also comprised Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh and Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh. After hearing the CKD office-bearers, the clergymen found that while some of its members were non-amritdhari some were not following the Sikh code of ethics. “These members are directed to appear before Panj Pyaras (five beloved ones of Guru) at any of the five Takhts within two months to partake of amrit or correct their behavior as per Sikh ethos,” said Giani Harpreet Singh.He said, “If anyone is not ready to do so, they must tender resignation as members on their own, or the CKD must cancel the same. We may summon the members in two months and see whether they complied with the orders.”“The CKD is also directed to restore the clause in its constitution that accepts the Akal Takht patronage that was removed after an amendment. Also, submit a clarification about expelling two members — Satnam Singh Mumbai and Avtar Singh— within a week. We also need clarification as why new members are included despite the ban imposed in June last year,” he added. The Takht also sought records of membership forms of all members within two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-compliance-or-show-errant-members-the-door-akal-takht-to-chief-khalsa-diwan-101617222056196.html
01-04-2021||Other||Traders welcome Pak’s decision to import cotton, sugar from India||Indian traders have welcomed the Pakistan government’s decision to allow import of cotton and sugar from India, saying it will pave the way for early reopening of bilateral trade between the two countries via the Attari-Wagah transit route. The traders have also urged the government of India to scrap the 200 per cent duty on items being imported from Pakistan. The neighboring country’s finance minister Hammad Azhar Islamabad on Wednesday said that Pakistan will import sugar and cotton from India. Pakistan had, unilaterally, stopped all trade ties with India in August 2019 when the Centre abrogated Article 370 that gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Before this, India had increased the customs duty on the goods being imported from Pakistan from 5 per cent to 200 per cent in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed. Since August 2019, only imports from Afghanistan have been allowed by Pakistan through the land border. Terming the decision as ‘better late than never’, president of Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association Anil Mehra said, “All Indian traders welcome the decision. With the opening of trade via the Attari-Wagah border, Pakistan will benefit more than India. Due to the rapidly increasing inflation in the neighboring country, the people there have been facing a tough time. India had not severed any trade ties with Pakistan, but it was their unilateral decision.” He said, “Pakistan had been exporting cement to India and due to the closure of the trade, many cement industries have closed there. Pakistan should also take early decision on allowing the import of vegetables from India. In Pakistan, tomatoes are sold for ₹150- 200 per kilo.” Former All-India Cement Importer Association president MPS Chatha said, “We appreciate that the Pakistan government finally considered it important to open trade with India. The Indian government should also take the initiative to strengthen the trade ties.” “India had mostly been importing cement, salt, and dry dates from Pakistan before August 2019. At that time, the price of cement was ₹250 per bag, which is nearly ₹450 now. Similarly, Pakistani salt was being sold for ₹6 to 7 per kg and it is now available for ₹35 per kg. The prices of dry dates have also gone up nearly 10-fold. Salt and dry dates are now being imported from Dubai and Afghanistan.” He said India was exporting dozens of items, including soya bean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chillies, cotton, and spares for automotives, biscuits, newsprints, plastic granules and fresh mutton, through the land route. In the year 2019-20, the integrated check post (ICP) Attari had witnessed only ₹2,767-crore trade, which was ₹4,354 crore in 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traders-welcome-pak-s-decision-to-import-cotton-sugar-from-india-101617221756193.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Srinagar declared orange zone, residents question permitting festivals, opening gardens||With the Jammu and Kashmir administration declaring Srinagar an orange zone on Tuesday, people have raised questions over the government’s reasoning for allowing festivals and keeping gardens and parks open in the district that is emerging as a Covid hotspot. After a relative decline in virus cases in January and February, Kashmir valley witnessed a surge in daily infections in March. “The surging virus cases have taken Srinagar to the orange category. We need to be more cautious and take precautions,” said Srinagar deputy commissioner Aijaz Asad.In March, the UT logged 4,519 cases against 1,935 cases in February, reporting an increase of 133% - a definitive indication of a second wave. Srinagar alone has contributed 2,043 cases, which amounts to 45% of the total cases in March.Irrespective of the surging cases , people have been thronging parks and gardens with utter disregard for Covid-19 protocols. The Srinagar administration has announced that it will impose fines on those caught without masks and subject the person to rapid antigen test (RAT) on the spot.A video of thousands of people attending a musical programme at Badamwari (garden of almonds) on Sunday without any social distancing and negligent use of masks has gone viral on social media with people raising questions on the seriousness of the government to fight the pandemic.Thousands of tourists and locals have also been visiting Tulip Garden owing to the bloom of its 1.5 million tulip bulbs at Siraj Bagh on the foothills of Zabarwan mountain range after it was thrown open for public on March 25. Officials say that more than 50,000 people including tourists from other states have visited the garden in the past week ( around 14,500 visited on Sunday alone).The government is preparing to host a tulip festival from April 3 and has been making attempts to woo more visitors.Advisor to lieutenant governor Baseer Ahmad Khan on Monday directed officers to take all measures ‘meticulously’ so that tourists from the rest of the country and abroad are attracted to the festival. “This must look like the festive tulip season in the real sense,” he said. according to a government spokesperson and also ‘underscored the need to maintain guard against Covid and laid stress on following the protocol adherently”.However, as per the government figures, 34% of Covid-19 cases in March in Srinagar alone have been contributed by travellers.“Srinagar is one of the 46 hotspot districts in the country, showing an exponential rise in cases and we are participating in public concerts and shows. Around 40% of the new cases are travellers,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan,pProfessor and head community medicine, Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar. He said there’s clustering of cases in marriage functions, condolence gatherings, tourist spots and recreational facilities. “We are contradicting our efforts by these activities,” he said.Khan said that after a dip in January and February the rise of the infections in March this year was exponential as compared to the steady rise in the same period last year.“The number of severe admissions in hospitals is more than last year,” he said.People have also expressed concern over ‘unrestricted’ entry of visitors, particularly tourists, saying such a measure will bring mutant strains in the valley. The officials on Wednesday said that they have already sent some samples for genome sequencing. Residents have demanded that those visiting the UT, particularly Srinagar, should be asked to perform a RT-PCR Covid-19 test beforehand and present its report at the airport.“If we allow them to travel and then perform tests on the airport, many people will already get infected during the flight. Such cases do not get detected as they would test positive after three to four days,” said Abdul Majeed, an ex-banker and a resident of Srinagar.“Why can’t we make Covid-19 negative reports mandatory for all those who want to visit? We should take a cue from Ladakh” he said.Divisional commissioner, Kashmir, Pandurang K Pole did not respond to calls and messages . Deputy commissioner Srinagar, Aijaz Asad, ruled out a fresh lockdown in the district, saying such a thing was in nobody’s favour.“We have seen how the previous lockdown affected almost every business. The lower strata of the society such as the labourers and the boatmen were especially affected,” Asad said, stressing that the district administration will scale up testing facilities and upgrade quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-declared-orange-zone-residents-question-permitting-festivals-opening-gardens-101617221574838.html

01-04-2021||Chandigarh||MP Kirron Kher suffering from blood cancer, says BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher is suffering from multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, and is undergoing treatment in Mumbai, according to one of her party colleagues.Addressing a specially-convened press conference here on Wednesday, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood said the 68-year-old Bollywood actor-turned-politician was on the recovery path after her treatment for the disease started last year.“She had suffered a broken left arm at her Chandigarh house on November 11 last year. After her medical tests at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh, she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The disease had spread to her left arm and right shoulder. For treatment she had to go to Mumbai on December 4,” said Sood. Stating that in the latest tests, the disease has receded from her arm and shoulder, Sood said, “Even though she is recovering after her four-month treatment and no longer admitted at Kokilaben Hospital, Mumbai, she has to visit the hospital regularly for treatment.”Took the political plunge in 2014Kher was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 2014 by defeating Congress stalwart Pawan Bansal and Aam Aadmi Party’s candidate and celebrity Gul Panag. Riding on the Modi wave, she again defeated Bansal in the 2019 parliamentary polls. Sood’s revelation on the MP’s health came in the backdrop of criticism of her and the BJP by the opposition Congress for her prolonged absence from Chandigarh during the Covid-19 outbreak. From pasting posters in public places declaring the local MP “missing” to “searching” the MP in the city, the Congress has been accusing Kher of ignoring her constituency during the pandemic.In April last year, Kher had released a video on social media countering the Congress allegations.Sood defended Kher’s absence from the city. “She was in the city till December last year. She is a senior citizen and diabetic. She was advised against venturing outside the house during the lockdown. Only to get treatment for the disease she had left the city. Despite her illness, Kher has been in regular touch with me discussing various city-related issues,” he added.Sood criticised the Congress for attacking Kher at this juncture. “Congress leaders know about her health problems, but still they are repeatedly making it an issue. This is nothing but petty politics.” ‘Advanced treatment has made the cancer manageable’A cancer of the plasma cells in blood, which normally produce antibodies, multiple myeloma may initially exhibit no symptoms. But, as it progresses, bone pain, anaemia, kidney dysfunction and infections may occur.Considered treatable, it is generally incurable. Remissions may be brought about with steroids, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and stem cell transplant. Bisphosphonates and radiation therapy are also used to reduce pain from bone lesions.“It is a type of blood cancer, but manageable. It usually affects the kidney and bones, causing fractures and renal failure. Treatment for this disease has advanced over the years, allowing survival beyond 10 years. Depending on the patient’s presentations, they can lead a reasonable life,” said Dr Pankaj Malhotra, professor of clinical hematology at PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mp-kirron-kher-suffering-from-blood-cancer-says-bjp-101617221334095.html

AAP state unit president Bhagwant Mann, party’s Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-in-charge Raghav Chadha and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema made the announcement at a press conference in Jalandhar. Mann said, “This movement will reach every street, village, town and city. The party volunteers will go from door to door to get information about people’s electricity bills. We will also burn the bills. Earlier, it was the Akali Dal government and now the Congress that has entered into costly power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private companies keeping in mind their vested interests.” Jarnail said even if the Punjab government does not buy power from the three private thermals in the state, it has to pay crores of rupees to them. “Power is so expensive in Punjab though it is being generated within the state whereas there is no thermal plant in Delhi which is providing free electricity to people after purchasing it from outside,” he said. Chadha dared CM Amarinder Singh to reduce electricity bills as was done in Delhi. Cheema said AAP had been raising the issue of power prices in the assembly. “We are left with no option but to launch a mass agitation to resolve the issues of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-announces-to-launch-mass-stir-from-april-7-over-rising-power-tariffs-in-punjab-101617220975627.html

Addressing a press conference, PUTA president Nishan Singh Deol strongly condemned the undue delay in resolving the issues of the varsity employees. “The absence of the acting V-C on the campus is a major reason behind this delay. The process of appointment of a regular V-C should be initiated at the earliest. The resignation of nearly 40 faculty members from administrative posts puts a big question mark on the working style of the officiating V-C. She should resign on moral grounds,” he said. PUTA secretary Avneet Pal Singh said the association’s general body also held an emergency meeting. “All the teachers unanimously decided to reject the 20-point checklist issued by the officiating vice-chancellor. The House also unanimously passed a resolution to oppose the new team to be appointed by the V-C to replace those who resigned from different posts,” he said.The unions also demanded that the state government should provide one-time relief of ₹300 crore to resolve the varsity’s financial crisis and increase the monthly grant to ₹30 crore from ₹20 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/employee-unions-stage-protest-at-punjabi-university-seeking-appointment-of-regular-vc-101617220974253.html

Only eight localities have been given permission by the civic body to install the gates. While seven of these fall in Zone D of the city, one is located in Zone A. No permission has been granted in Zone B and Zone C. The civic body, however, has no record of the number of gates installed illegally by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the city, the RTI further revealed.In 2014, citing the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the Ludhiana MC General House had approved a resolution making it mandatory for all RWAs to seek prior permission before installing gates at the entry points of any locality. Further, it was also decided that no permission would be granted without proper police verification.In the resolution, it was also stated that RWAs that wish to install gates can only do so for security reasons and the gates can be kept closed only from 11pm to 5am, and a guard will have to be deputed there.However, over the years, the gates have proved to be more of hindrance than an assurance of security for residents. Residents of various localities in Dugri, Model Town, Model Town extension, Kitchlu Nagar and Haibowal have been complaining that the gates remain closed even during day time.Hardeep Singh, a resident of Haibowal, said, “Gates are meant provide a sense of security to residents and safeguard their homes from burglaries. But in most localities, the gates remain closed even during day time, blocking free movement.” MC commissioner Pardep Sabharwal said, “I have directed the building branch officials to conduct a survey of gates installed in different areas of the city and ensure that residents’ welfare associations take permission before installing these. Also, they should follow all the norms fixed by MC or be ready to face action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/most-gates-outside-ludhiana-s-residential-areas-illegal-reveals-rti-101617220673813.html

Similar facility will be opened in Jalandhar, and other locations are being finalised,” said the minister.“It will reduce the financial burden on the applicants as they need not visit the state capital for filing appeals or appearing before the revenue courts,” he said.Presently, 11 senior bureaucrats, with the rank of principal secretary and above, have been deputed financial commissioners (appeal) in the revenue department. All these FCs have offices in the civil secretariat, Chandigarh.Complaints pertaining to land mutations with most disputes of inheritance of land and the Indian Stamps Act (with disputes on finalising stamp duty during land registrations) are among the other segments of revenue department jurisdiction that goes for appeal at the financial commissioner-level.“An applicant from Abohar in Fazilka, Ferozepur or Mansa needs at least six-eight hours to reach Chandigarh for his work in the revenue court. Then securing a pass to gain entry to the civil secretariat also takes time. The move of setting up special revenue courts at the district-level will reduce their hardships,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-set-up-special-revenue-courts-of-financial-commissioners-at-districtlevel-101617220318134.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||DSGMC polls: Hours after being barred, SAD gets Delhi HC nod to fight elections||In a relief to the Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a specially constituted double bench of Delhi High Court on Wednesday set aside the order of the Delhi gurdwara election department director who had barred the party from contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) polls scheduled for April 25. The director had taken the plea that only a religious party can contest the gurdwara elections and the SAD was not eligible to contest the polls as it had failed to give an undertaking that it’s a religious party. The SAD contests the DSGMC polls on ‘bucket’ symbol, which was seized by the director and later restored with the SAD by the high court. The director’s order coincided with the declaration of the DSGMC poll schedule by virtue of which the filing of nominations also started for the 46-member gurdwara body. The results will be declared on April 28. “It’s the first step towards our party’s victory in the upcoming polls. The attempt by the Delhi government to interfere into Sikh religious matters has fallen flat,” said DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, adding that his party would announce the candidates tomorrow. The SAD is controlling the DSGMC for the last two consecutive terms since 2013. Meanwhile, former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK, who heads JAGO party announced 14 candidates on Wednesday. DSGMC advocate Avinash Kumar Mishra said SAD was recognised in October 1999 and given bucket symbol by the government of national capital territory by way of a gazette notification, which was subsequently followed ahead of the gurdwara polls in 2006, 2012 and 2017. “In July 2010, the DSGMC amended rules for election of members and mandated parties to register under the Societies Registration Act but the SAD being already recognised was not required to go for fresh registration,” said the advocate. “In 2012 an order was also pronounced by the Delhi High Court that SAD needs not register and so the party’s recognition continued. However, on March 16 this year, the department of gurdwara elections, Delhi government, issued a letter asking the SAD to implement the amendment of July 2010. The orders were stayed on March 26 by a division bench of HC,” added the lawyer. The division bench on Wednesday again stayed the orders of director of gurdwara election department and granted the bucket symbol back to the SAD, Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsgmc-polls-hours-after-being-barred-sad-gets-delhi-hc-nod-to-fight-elections-101617220317033.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet asks CM Amarinder to raise issue of DBT to farmers with Modi for relief||With the central government firm on direct benefit transfer (DBT) of minimum support price (MSP) to Punjab farmers for the wheat procurement season that starts on April 10, the state cabinet on Wednesday asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to take up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking relief. The cabinet said the existing system should be continued as adopting the new structure will not be politically wise for the ruling Congress amid the ongoing farmer protests and also the fact that the assembly polls are scheduled in less than a year’s time. Punjab is expecting to procure 130 lakh tonne wheat and has sought a cash credit limit (CCL) of ₹27,000 crore from the Reserve bank of India (RBI). State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who flagged the issue during the cabinet meeting, said the Centre’s proposal is in violation of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act that governs the functioning of the state procurement machinery. The CM reportedly assured his council of ministers of taking up the matter at appropriate level. The Centre wants Punjab to make payment to farmers for the wheat crop by bypassing commission agents or arhtiyas, who are part of the existing system, he added. Union food minister Piyush Goyal has rejected Punjab’s plea to allow the existing system to stay and suggested the state amend its APMC Act. “This is not possible as it will directly affect the country’s federal structure,” Ashu told the cabinet. In a communiqué to Punjab CM, Goyal on March 27 asked the Punjab government to implement public finance management system (PFMS) and make payment for the crop procured directly into the accounts of farmers.Punjab is the only state among the 12 procuring ones that is not making direct digital payment to farmers as mandated by the Union finance ministry’s PFMS order of May 2018. It continues to pay farmers through arhtiyas under the Punjab Agriculture Produce Marketing Rules, 1962. The state is seeking extension from implementing it for the past three procurements. Goyal in his letter to Amarinder has sought compliance and suggested that Punjab follow Haryana’s software that enables details of tenants or sharecroppers to be uploaded on the portal with a disclaimer that this would not be a legal proof for claiming ownership. Punjab has not integrated its land records with the central procurement portal, he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-asks-cm-amarinder-to-raise-issue-of-dbt-to-farmers-with-modi-for-relief-101617220315127.html

Though no casualties were reported, a Swift and a Santro car were badly damaged. A few other cars parked on the road were saved by some alert passersby and showroom employees who moved the vehicles in time. They also tried to douse the flames on their own but as the fire raged on, they called the fire brigade, which managed to control the blaze in about 15 minutes. Eyewitnesses alleged that a large quantity of garbage had been dumped on the vacant plot and municipal corporation employees had set it on fire. MC health officer Dr Vipal Malhotra, however, denied the claims regarding civic body employees setting the trash afire. He said, “The MC has not marked any dump site in the area. It seems some miscreants had dumped garbage at the site and set it on fire.” Meanwhile, the owners of the two cars, gutted in the incident, were furious. “I had brought this car just around three months ago and now it has been completely destroyed,” said the owner of the Santro car.The owner of the Swift car, Karan, who is an advocate, said, “I was visiting the court complex for some work. I had parked the car here around 15 minutes before the fire broke out. The cars have been badly damaged. Commuters told me that MC employees had been burning the garbage on the vacant plot, from where the fire spread further.” Division Number 5 station house officer Kuldeep Singh said, “It is being claimed that the cars caught fire after someone set the garbage on fire but we have so far received no complaint in this case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-2-cars-gutted-as-trash-burning-goes-wrong-101617220314102.html

The high court bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi also asked the state police to apprise the court of the present status of the cases, copies of orders passed by high court on petitions filed by the accused named in those cases seeking court’s intervention and demanding advance notice prior to their arrest. Orders passed by the Supreme Court on pleas filed and brief statement of proceedings regarding arrest, bail and final orders passed in such cases be placed on record, the court directed. The court asked the government to place on record copies of relevant documents in these cases and also gave an opportunity to other parties to provide relevant record, pertaining to these cases. The court said that since Saini is seeking transfer of investigation of cases registered against him to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any other independent agency, Punjab should file an affidavit of the officer concerned giving details of the cases in which investigation regarding the involvement of Saini is pending. All these details have been sought by April 6. The order was passed during resumed hearing of 2018 plea on March 16, but released now.The 2018 plea was filed by Saini seeking direction to Punjab to transfer probe in criminal cases registered against him to the CBI and giving notice of specified period before his arrest. “The prayer for the above said reliefs is based on the grounds of mala fides on the part of Amarinder Singh and members of ruling party and apprehension of false implication and arrest of the petitioner on accusation of having committed non-bailable offence by Punjab Police on the basis of some tainted investigation,” HC summarises the allegations of Saini in the order. In the in 2018 plea, the HC asked Punjab government to serve a seven-day notice to Saini in the event of government initiating criminal proceedings against him. The 2018 plea claims that during Saini’s stint as head of state vigilance, a number of criminal cases were registered against Amarinder and his family members, citing example of FIRs in Ludhiana City Centre scam, Amritsar Improvement Trust scam and one against Bharat Inder Singh Chahal, adviser to the CM, and Amarinder’s son Raninder Singh.Since he is seen as the man behind starting criminal proceedings against the present CM and his “coterie”, state’s agencies have become “persecuting agencies” instead of “prosecuting agencies”, the plea alleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sainis-plea-for-cbi-probe-hc-seeks-details-of-firs-against-capt-badal-101617220073787.html
01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet okays free travel for women in government-run buses||The Punjab council of ministers on Wednesday approved free travel for women in government-run buses.Women can avail the facility in buses of the Punjab Roadways Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways and city services operated by the local bodies. But it is not applicable to the government-owned air-conditioned, Volvo and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) buses. The announcement on this was made in the Punjab budget recently. The scheme will benefit over 1.31 crore women/girls across the state (as per the 2011 Census). “Also, all women, who are family members of Punjab government employees and reside in Chandigarh, or are themselves employees of the state government but live in Chandigarh, can avail the benefit, irrespective of age and income criteria, of free travel,” an official said.“This scheme is not only expected to reduce female drop-out in schools because of the high cost of daily transport and but also facilitate working women, who have to travel considerable distances to their workplace,” he added. The facility will thus ensure access to “safe, cheap and reliable” travel for women to engage in any economic activity.The cabinet also gave nod to set up an enforcement directorate (ED) to check illegal mining in the state with a view to ramping up the revenues the government loses on account of the unlawful practice. The agency will be headed by a police officer not below the rank of a deputy inspector general (DIG) as part of the mining and geology wing of the state water resources department, a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office said. “The ED will help in keeping tabs on the unauthorised movement of minor minerals not only within the state but also at the inter-state borders of Punjab in coordination with the mining department. It will also get prosecuted those indulging in the illegal activity under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. Besides, it will ensure that those into the sand and gravel business do not overcharge beyond the price prescribed in the mining policy,” the spokesperson added. The agency will have the mandate to come up with measures to achieve its objectives in coordination with the director (mining) and the chief engineers dealing with mining and district-level illegal mining enforcement committees. It will also gather intelligence for the purpose and co-ordinate with the agencies of the neighbouring states dealing with illegal mining. The ED chief will be assisted by 3 superintendents of police (SP)-rank officers in the head office. The 7 mining blocks (number may vary as per government policy) each will be headed by an officer not below the rank of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), who will be assisted by inspectors, sub-inspectors and head constables, constables.The deployment may be modified from time to time keeping in view the functional requirements, it was said. The police personnel deployed in the agency will be given salaries, equipment and arms by the police department. Any special equipment, if required, would be provided from District Mineral Foundation Funds. In addition to the investigation of mining-related cases by district police at present, the ED would also register cases and probe them. It will present final reports (challans) in courts concerned. The investigation will be completed in a time-bound manner. Also, in a bid to streamline the functioning of government-run cattle pounds and to effectively redress of the menace of stray animals, the cabinet also gave approval for running these under public private partnership (PPP) mode. The CMO spokesperson said there would be no financial burden on the state to run these pounds (except in Amritsar and Ferozepur) under PPP mode as they will become self-sustainable by generating the required revenue through various activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-okays-free-travel-for-women-in-government-run-buses-101617219834919.html

The warning comes amid a surge in Covid cases and fatalities in the state. On Tuesday, the state government issued orders to ramp up Covid-19 testing and vaccination and also directed closure of schools and colleges in the state till April 10.Addressing a virtual meeting with top health, administrative and police officials, the CM said a decision on further curbs will be taken after a review of the situation on April 8. “I will watch things for a week, and then if there is no improvement, we may have to go for stricter curbs,” he said. Punjab is witnessing a surge in the infections with more than 2,000 new cases being reported daily. There is also a rise in the number of fatalities due to the disease. On Tuesday, 65 Covid deaths were reported in the state. Mohali, Kapurthala, Patiala, SBS Nagar, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana are reporting the maximum positivity rate. The overall positivity in the state stands at 7.6% as of March 24. Underlining the need for aggressive vaccination, particularly in areas with high case and cities with more than 300 cases, Amarinder directed officials to reach out to eligible people at the mohalla-level in the worst-affected districts to motivate people to get vaccinated. He also directed stricter enforcement of Covid restrictions and protocols in the worst-affected cities of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali and Amritsar. Head of the state’s Covid expert committee Dr KK Talwar said more enforcement of restrictions was needed in the urban areas, which were reporting higher cases. Director general of police Dinkar Gupta said since March 19, 1.3 lakh people have been taken for RT-PCR testing on being found moving around without masks. Of these, 391 were found positive, he said. Taking note of the inconvenience caused to commuters, the chief minister did away with the one-hour silence on Saturdays to commemorate Covid warriors.Taking strong exception to the Centre’s criticism of the Covid-19 management in Punjab, Amarinder said the state’s rate of tests per million was higher than the national average and claimed the situation would have been better if the central government had not “delayed” the vaccination process.Had the central government acceded to the state’s request for allowing vaccination of all 50+ category population earlier, instead of delaying the decision to include 45+ age population by almost two months, the situation would perhaps have been better than present, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-warns-of-stricter-curbs-if-covid-situation-doesn-t-improve-in-a-week-101617219773884.html

01-04-2021||Chandigarh||PM Awas Yojana: Centre dissatisfied with progress, defers Punjab’s request for funds||The Centre has expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of work of the Punjab government in implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) in urban areas of the state. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs expressed its concern over the slow progress of construction and completion of houses under the flagship scheme at a meeting with senior officials of the Punjab government last month. The central sanctioning and monitoring committee (CSMC) for the PMAY (Urban) also deferred the proposal submitted by the state government for approval of 92 new beneficiary-led individual house construction (BLC) and nine BLC enhancement projects worth ₹141 crore. The local government department had proposed 7,942 new houses for beneficiaries from the economically weaker sections (EWS) across the state with financial support under the scheme, seeking ₹121 crore from the Centre for these projects. As per the proposal, the state’s share was ₹19.85 crore. The committee headed by secretary, housing and urban affairs, Durga Shanker Mishra termed the progress of construction of houses ‘not satisfactory’. “The state government may resubmit the proposal once 95% of the sanctioned houses are grounded and 75% are completed,” it said, deferring the state’s request for new projects. The high-level meeting was attended by Punjab’s principal secretary, local government, Ajoy Kumar Sinha and other officials of the department. The ministry told the states that 2021-22 is the most critical year in terms of implementation. Of the 76,230 houses sanctioned to the state government under the beneficiary-led component so far, 35,434, or say 46%, have been grounded and the number of completed houses is just 8,368, according to available information. Sunil Verma, additional project director, Punjab State Urban Livelihood Mission, said the new projects were not approved because the central government had a parameter for grounding and completion of houses under the sanctioned projects. “As and when the criterion is met, they will sanction these new projects awaiting approval. This is their way of building pressure on the state government,” he said. Another official said the department had received the state share recently and the execution of works would gather pace. Under the BLC component, the cost of a two-room house is ₹3.5 lakh. Of this, the central government gives ₹1.5 lakh and the state government contributes ₹25,000 whereas the beneficiary has to shell out the balance 50%. In 2019, the central ministry had urged the state government to give a push to construction of houses for the EWS families under the programme vis-à-vis the housing demand. Against the projected demand of 3.48 lakh houses in cities across the state, the authorities had sanctioned about 20% houses till then. A department official had said that efforts were being made create awareness and more beneficiaries but not many were forthcoming. The state government had arrived at the projected demand houses after a survey by the urban local bodies department in 164 towns. The centrally sponsored PMAY was launched in June 2015 for ensuring housing for all in urban areas by 2022 by way of BLC, credit-linked subsidy scheme, affordable housing in partnership and ‘in-situ’ slum redevelopment. Overall, 1.09 crore houses have been sanctioned so far under the programme. Of these, 70 lakh have been grounded, including 41 lakh that have been completed and handed over to beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-awas-yojana-centre-dissatisfied-with-progress-defers-punjab-s-request-for-funds-101617219354904.html

We have started contact-tracing after eight junior doctors tested positive in just a span of two days. Health of none of the medical staff is serious and all of them are in home isolation,” she added.She added that four patients visiting the gynaecology department have tested positive in the last one month but none of them got infected from the doctors.“Services of the labour room have been started from the civil surgeon’s office. I have asked the health workers to sanitise the labour work and start services there after completion of 48-hours. I have told the civil surgeon to send doctors to treat expecting mothers, if required,” the medical superintendent said.Dr Dahiya said 13 of 23 healthcare providers have received the first dose and two of them had also received shots of the second dose.“Eight junior doctors did not take the vaccine jab due to some health complications. I admit that there is a rush at the gynaecology department but we are conducting tests of patients visiting there.

If a farmer owes money to the arhtiya, he will return it,” Khattar said, indicating that wheat arrival will pick pace around April 8-10.According to the CM, at present, there are 2,421 allottees in the defaulters list of the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) and that about ₹1,131 crore is outstanding on their part.After Wednesday’s announcement, he said that these plot holders will get benefit of about ₹370 crore. The relief is subject to the defaulters clearing entire balance amount by June 15, 2021.Listing out a series of steps that the state government has taken in the past six years to ensure ease of living, the CM said that his government’s aim is to give relief to people by resolving administrative disputes and reducing litigation. BENEFIT TO OVER 2,250 INDUSTRIALISTSUnder ‘Vivaadon Ka Samadhan’ initiative, the state government had announced relief in outstanding payment of interest and penalties for industrialists owning the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HSIIDC) plots.Khattar said that this settlement scheme will benefit over 2,250 industrialists. The outstanding amount is about ₹1,500 crore and the benefit that is likely to be provided is expected to be ₹225 crore, Khattar said.The CM said that there will be no extension beyond six years and the plot will be mandatorily put to auction through the HSIIDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cm-announces-interest-waiver-for-arhityas-defaulting-on-dues-101617218157609.html

While this spike was slightly lower than the peak reported in the month — 1,904 on March 29, it also came on the back of far fewer tests.The test positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — has remained above 2.70% on Wednesday. The city has seen far fewer Covid-19 tests during the past three days, primarily on account of the weekend and Holi.Only 57,544 tests were conducted on average during the three days, in comparison to nearly 83,000 tests conducted each day on average last week.Also read | From today, vaccination drive opens to everyone above the age of 45 years“The test positivity rate over the past few days has been around 3%, because Delhi, along with the entire country, is witnessing a surge. In some states, the positivity rate has crossed 10%. Delhi’s testing capacity has been increased as well. More than 80,000 tests will be conducted every day,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday.Experts have suggested that an increase in the pace of vaccination might help in the long run.“Everyone who is eligible for a vaccine in Delhi should be administered the shot quickly. If south Delhi is reporting a high number of cases right now, there will surely be an increase in other districts as well. The impact [of vaccinations] will be visible only eight to 12 weeks later, in the form of fewer hospitalisations and deaths. This is going by the data that we have seen from Israel. It might take longer in India as Israel has been using the Pfizer vaccine that has a higher efficacy; we would have to vaccinate larger number of people to see the same effect,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.The vaccine rollout in Israel has been among the fastest in the world. Over 50% of Israeli citizens have received both shots of a Covid-19 vaccine, the country’s health minister had said last week.Delhi’s south district has been included by the Centre in its list of 46 “most affected” districts that have seen the highest surge in the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-11-more-covid-19-deaths-most-since-jan-13-101617218033041.html

The city had breathed a brief sigh of relief on Tuesday after strong winds helped keep the temperature under control.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 34.6 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was 20 degrees Celsius.Srivastava said such high temperatures in the month of March can be attributed to the absence of strong western disturbances.“Only one western disturbance affected Delhi this time and the city recorded rainfall only on two days. The capital had registered 10 rain days in March last year,” Srivastava said.The mean maximum temperature for the month of March was 28.2 degrees Celsius in 2020 and 2019.It was 32.8 degrees Celsius in 2018; 30.7 degrees Celsius in 2017; and 31.5 degrees Celsius in 2016, according to IMD data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sizzler-of-a-march-turns-out-to-be-the-hottest-in-11-years-says-imd-101617217974179.html

There are nearly 45 lakh people in Delhi between the age of 45 and 59 years, according to the Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.So far, only those between the ages of 45 and 59 years, who have a combination of 20 listed comorbidities, were being administered the vaccine. Over 74,000 people between the ages of 45 and 59 years have been administered the jab in this category in Delhi until now, government data showed.“According to the population census, there are 65 lakh people over the age of 45 years living in Delhi. This includes 20 lakh people over the age of 60 years for whom the vaccination drive is already open. The vaccination drive will begin on a big scale tomorrow (Thursday) for all those who are eligible. There are currently over 500 centres in Delhi and many of them operate from 9am to 9pm,” said Jain during a press briefing on Wednesday.A spot-check by HT last week had shown that in two of the three hospitals that HT visited, the vaccination centres were not running beyond 5pm.Also read | Delhi's daily Covid tally goes up again with 1,819 new cases; toll at 11,027The minister added that earlier, people were facing problems if they weren’t able to reach the vaccination centre at the allotted time. But now the allotted time won’t be rigid and walk-ins will be allowed across centres after 3pm.In preparation for the larger vaccination drive from Thursday, districts have been gearing up their ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) and ASHA (accredited social health activists) networks to educate and mobilise more people in this age group.“We are utilising our ANM and ASHA network to motivate more people and bring them to the vaccination centres. They are followed by our on-the-spot registration teams in vans in poorer neighbourhoods. They register people and directly take them to the neighbouring centres to get the shot,” said a senior official from south district.When it comes to the number of jabs, west Delhi leads the districts with over 138,000 first doses administered. South Delhi leads the number of second doses administered at over 33,000 doses.South district is currently in focus with the Centre listing it as one of the 46 “most affected” districts in India. “This is because we are conducting more number of tests. If you map the cases, you will see that most are in affluent neighbourhoods -- because residents in these areas are more aware and get tested whenever they have a fever or cold. So, we are reporting a high number of cases,” an official from south district said, asking not to be named.An official from north district said, also on condition of anonymity, “We are working on adding infrastructure, manpower, and conducting information campaigns. We are looking at whether we can expand the drive to dispensaries after they wind up their routine activities at 2pm.”“As for affluent areas, we are mobilising people with the help of residents’ welfare associations. However, in case they need transportation to and from the vaccination centre, we are providing that as well,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-today-vaccination-drive-opens-to-everyone-above-the-age-of-45-years-101617217973073.html

The civic body also approved the levy of an annual fee on banquet halls operating in unauthorised colonies under its jurisdiction. The charges will come into effect after the House approves the proposals.Rajdutt Gehlot, chairman, SDMC standing committee, said, “We have decided to double the parking fee for on-street parking in Yusuf Sarai market near Green Park multilevel parking facility. The parking charges have been increased from ₹20 per hour to ₹40 per hour. This move will discourage people from parking vehicles in surface parking and will enhance occupancy in the (Green Park) multilevel facility.”Gehlot said that the civic body had built a multilevel parking at Green Park to accommodate 136 cars in November last year, but the facility was not being used. The civic body found later, through a survey, that people preferred to park their vehicles in the nearby on-street facility in Yusuf Sarai market. He said that depending on the public response, a similar approach might be taken in other areas too.Also read | CM reviews progress of redevelopment of industrial areasA 17-storeyed multilevel automatic car park near Green Park Metro station was inaugurated in November 2020, with a capacity to accommodate 136 cars, including 32 SUVs. The facility was built on 878 square metres (sqm), at a cost of ₹18.2 crore.Other multilevel car parks in the SDMC area are located in Hauz Khas, Lajpat Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Munirka, Rajouri Garden and New Friends Colony.The parking policy approved by the Delhi government in September 2019 states that there should be no on-street parking within 500 metres of multilevel facilities. In case it is essential, it should be priced exponentially, at least three times that of the multilevel facility charges.Officials familiar with the matter said that the approval of a policy, for registration and collection of permission charges for weddings and social events at banquet halls in unauthorised colonies and unauthorised regularised colonies, is expected to boost revenue.Gehlot said that the municipality provides sanitation and other services to banquet halls but did not receive revenue so far. “So, we have decided to levy an annual fee on such banquets halls or other permanent structures where functions are held in unauthorised colonies. Charges will depend on the size of the plot area. The applicants can either take the licence for one year or half-year. They will be given a rebate of one month if they pay the amount in one go,” Gehlot said.According to the policy document approved by the SDMC, banquet halls having an area of up to 400sqm will be charges ₹6,000 per month and Rs72,000 annually, while those with an area of 401sqm to 1,000sqm will be charged ₹7,000 per month ( ₹84,000 annually). The monthly charge for halls built on an area of 1,001 sqm to 5,000sqm was set at ₹12,000 ( ₹1.44 lakh annually), while monthly fees of ₹27,000 ( ₹3.24 lakh annually) and ₹52,000 ( ₹6.24 lakh annually) would be collected from facilities running built on 5,001sqm to 10,000 sqm and above 10,000sqm, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parking-in-yusuf-sarai-market-to-get-costlier-banquet-halls-in-unauthorised-colonies-to-be-charged-for-services-101617217920380.html

More than 10,000 farmers from neighbouring states have also registered themselves on the portal to sell their produce in Haryana mandis.As per directions of the state government, the deputy commissioners held meetings with mandi officials, commission agents and officials of the procurement agencies. They have been directed to begin the procurement operations smoothly.Besides direct payments from this year, the government has also installed CCTV cameras at all mandis to ensure hassle-free procurement and timely lifting of foodgrains.“Hassle-free and time-bound procurement should be ensured by making advance scheduling plans so that farmers do not face any problem,” chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said.‘WILL PROCURE EVERY GRAIN ON MSP’Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, during his visit to Panipat on Wednesday, reiterated that the government has made all arrangements to procure grains from farmers on MSP of ₹1,975 as fixed by the Centre and the payments will be deposited in accounts of farmers within 48-hours of procurement and submission of the J-Form. He said that if the payment is delayed beyond 72-hours, the farmers will get 9% interest rate.In response to allegations of the farmer union leaders that the government wants to end MSP, Dushyant said that this year, six crops will be procured on MSP and in future, the government is planning to procure 10 crops on MSP.HARVESTING YET TO PICK PACEEven as the government has decided to begin procurement from April 1, according to farmers, harvesting of wheat was delayed by almost a week due to weather conditions and arrival of wheat is expected to pick pace over the next week.“I got an SMS to bring 63 quintal wheat to Indri grain market in Karnal on April 1, but I have not even started harvesting yet and will thus have to reschedule,” said Anil Kumar, a farmer from Indri.Mandi officials said that they are also making phone calls to farmers. The ones who have already harvested the crop will be allowed to bring their produce to the mandis.MIXED RESPONSE FROM ARHTIYASEarlier, the arhtiyas had raised objections over direct payment to farmers but as of now, the arhtiyas association has not taken any decision in this regard.“We are not favour of direct payment to farmers and have called a state-level meeting soon to take a call as procurement will take at least a week to pick pace,” said Ashok Gupta, president of the Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiyas Association.On the other hand, amid ongoing protests against Centre’s three farm laws, Haryana’s decision of direct payment is being praised by farm unions which is why, arhtiyas seem reluctant to oppose the move openly.FACTS & FIGURESTotal registered farmers: 8 lakhGrain markets and purchase centres in state: 400Number of commission agents: 18,000Acreage under wheat: 25.50 lakh hectareEstimated wheat procurement: 80 lakh MTExpected wheat production: 120 lakh MT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-all-set-for-wheat-procurement-operations-beginning-today-101617217919933.html

01-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP terms MVA probe committee an eyewash||A day after the Maharashtra government constituted a one-member probe panel of retired judge KU Chandiwal to investigate the allegations levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against home minister Anil Deshmukh, the opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), slammed the state government, saying the panel is just an eyewash. The ruling parties termed it “BJP’s double standards”.Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis questioned how the committee will probe a home minister in the absence of powers given under the Commission of Inquiry Act. “The committee appointed under retired high court judge KU Chandiwal is just a committee without any powers of judicial commission. The committee has not been appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, nor has it been given any rights under the act. I do not see anything concrete to come from this probe,” he said. Fadnavis said the allegations are serious in nature and the probe is not likely to serve any purpose. He said a committee appointed by his government (to probe graft charges against former revenue minister Eknath Khadse), headed by retired judge Dinkar Zoting, had been given power under the act.The Maharashtra government — comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress party (NCP) and Congress — on Tuesday issued a government resolution to announce the appointment of a single-member judicial panel to probe the allegations. In his letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that the home minister asked police officers from the crime branch to collect ₹100 crore a month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours in Mumbai. The letter had led to a political slugfest between the BJP and state. BJP demanded the home minister’s resignation , while all the three ruling parties rallied behind the minister.The panel under Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal has been asked to submit its report in six months. The three-point terms of reference given to the committee include to look into whether Singh has submitted any proof in his letter dated March 20, to establish that Deshmukh or any officer from his office committed any offence/ misconduct as alleged; whether the allegations levelled by Singh, citing the messages from assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil, (suspended) assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, have any truth; and whether they need to be investigated by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) or any other investigating agency. The panel has also been asked to make any other recommendations it deems fit.BJP’s chief spokesperson Keshv Upadhye said looking at the terms of reference, the report is expected to be in favour of the home minister. “How can ACB conduct a probe, as mentioned in the terms of reference, when it is controlled by the home minister. The panel cannot summon anyone for the statement as it does not have been given power under the act. Thus, the constitution of the committee is meaningless,” he said.NCP slammed Fadnavis, saying his stance is an example of double standards. “The Zoting committee, too, was constituted under similar provisions to probe the allegations of the MIDC land scam. What was valid during their tenure is not valid now, according to Fadnavis. This is nothing but double standards,” said minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said, “Both, Zoting and Chandiwal committees, are under the similar provisions, but Fadnavis has been trying to mislead the people of Maharashtra by false claims. He should prove the Zoting committee was appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act,” he said.IPS officer-turned-advocate YP Singh said the committee is just an administrative arrangement and would not solve any purpose. “It is neither a judicial probe nor the committee been given power under the Commission of Inquiry Act. The committee has not power of summoning anybody or instruct any department for the submission of documents like CDRs,” he said. He said there was no need of the probe committee to decide if the allegations need to be probed by ACB, as they, per se, are related to corruption in the department.The probe panel appointed under Commission of Inquiry Act gets the power of civil court. “The panel can summon any person to examine, ask for production of any document from any public record from any office as per the provision in section 5 of the Act,” said an official from the law and judiciary department. The Chandiwal committee is a high-level committee, which will probe whether the allegations levelled were true and there is any further need to investigate them by ACB or any other agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-terms-mva-probe-committee-an-eyewash-101617217913537.html

The woman, who was in hiding since March, recorded her statement before a judge in the Chief Metropolitan Court complex on Tuesday. A senior police officer familiar with the case said that a series of tests, including the rapid antigen test, was conducted during her visit. The samples were sent to the Forensic Sciences Lab, the officer said. She arrived at the hospital around 11.30 am, accompanied by tight security. Around 4 pm, she left for the Technical Centre in Adugodi for questioning by the Special Investigation Team (SIT). “She is currently giving a statement and voice samples to the SIT. The questioning was limited to the 376 C (sexual intercourse by a person in authority),” said KN Jagadish Kumar, the lawyer of the woman. When asked if she will be questioned regarding the extortion case filed by former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, the lawyer said no such information has been given to them by the SIT. “The accused in this case, who has filed a case with the Sadashivanagar police, has not mentioned my client in the complaint. So, there is no need to question her. If they have to question her, a complaint should have been filed against her,” the lawyer said. A top SIT official said that the woman was questioned on the basic details of the case such as how she came in contact with the former minister, what job offer did he make and who gave her the ministers number etc. He also added that more clarifications have sought on the statements she made in the video released last month and her alleged conversation with the former minister. Jarkiholi who has been giving multiple statements to reporters, remained unavailable for comments after the woman gave a statement before the high court. His number was not reachable when HT tried to contact him for a comment. Meanwhile, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday slammed the Congress party for criticising the probe and said it will not influence the investigation in any way as the SIT was functioning in accordance with the law. “SIT will have to do in detail all round inquiry systematically. There is a set criminal procedure code for it and accordingly, it has to be done and they are doing it. No one can intervene in it, so I will also not comment on it,” Bommai said. “They (Congress) will have to look back and see what they had done while in power. We are doing things in accordance with law because ultimately everything has to be established in the court of law,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sit-questions-woman-in-jarkiholi-case-again-101617217914158.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Scooter rider, homeless man killed, two others injured as speeding mini truck runs onto pavement||A 35-year-old homeless man and a civil defence volunteer were killed and two other homeless men seriously injured after a mini truck, which was allegedly speeding, first hit a scooter and then ran onto a pavement where the homeless were sleeping in north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate on Wednesday morning, the police said.The deceased civil defence volunteer, who was on the scooter, was identified as 34-year-old Vehram Khan. Police said the identity of the dead homeless man could not be ascertained till late evening. The errant mini truck driver, Atiq Ahmed, was caught by a police team on patrol duty. He was booked for rash and negligent driving causing death and injury, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said around 6.15am, the patrolling staff of Kashmere Gate police station spotted an accident on a loop road towards Nigambodh Ghat from Yudhister Setu.“A mini truck had ran onto the pavement and injured three homeless people sleeping there, after first hitting a man on a scooter. One of the homeless men died on the spot. The other three injured persons were rushed to Sushruta Trauma Centre, where the scooter rider was declared brought dead,” said Alphonse.A police officer said the truck was carrying some plants and saplings to Sarai Kale Khan from north-east Delhi. The truck driver was alone in the vehicle and it was coming from the Shastri Park side. After crossing the Yamuna bridge (Yudhister Setu), the truck driver took a left turn on the loop towards Nigambodh Ghat.“Prime facie, it appears that the truck driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel because of which he lost control of the vehicle. The truck first hit the scooter before climbing onto the footpath outside a night shelter run by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). It ran over three homeless men sleeping on the footpath before crashing through a concrete wall and into a drain alongside the road,” the officer said.Of the two injured men, one was identified as Ramesh, 52, from Ludhiana, Punjab, while the other one was yet to be identified. At the time of the mishap, civil defence volunteer Vehram Khan was returning home on the scooter after dropping his mother at a bus stop in Jafarabad, his family members told the police.“My brother’s duty was in a Covid-19 vaccination centre in GB Pant. I called him around 7am but his phone was not reachable, and he had not reached home. We panicked and went looking for him on the route he had taken to return home after dropping our mother. We found his badly damaged scooter at the accident spot. We identified him from the images of the injured persons that the policemen showed us,” said Khan’s brother Zaidan Khan.A homeless men, Mahroof, who was sleeping on the pavement but escaped unhurt, said since it was windy over the past two days, people had started sleeping on the footpath to escape the heat and mosquitoes inside the night shelter.“I was sleeping nearly 10 feet away from them (dead and injured men). I woke up because of a loud noise and saw a truck had fallen into the drain. Three of our men lay bleeding on the footpath while a scooter rider was also lying injured on the road. Had the truck come straight onto the footpath, it would have killed me and a few others as well,” said Mahroof.DUSIB member Bipin Rai said there are 30 shelter homes in a 2km radius between Geeta Ghat and Gandhi Park for the homeless. “Despite the caretakers of these homes asking people to sleep inside, some sleep on the pavements to escape the heat. It was an unfortunate incident, and we will try to rope in more NGOs to ensure the homeless sleep inside the shelters only,” said Rai.Sunil Kumar Aledia, member, Centre for Holistic Development, however, said there is a large number of homeless around Kashmere Gate and they sleep on footpaths because there is not enough space in shelter homes.“Twenty temporary winter homes where nearly 600 homeless people slept were recently removed from the area. The existing homes are already overcrowded. So these people have no choice but to sleep on pavements. There have been similar deaths in the past, but the Delhi government still does not have a homeless policy to ensure their safety and security,” added Aledia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scooter-rider-homeless-man-killed-two-others-injured-as-speeding-mini-truck-runs-onto-pavement-101617217913008.html

They stalled the Delhi government’s home delivery of ration scheme to harass the poor. It is shameful that BJP-ruled MCD has distributed dry ration to only one MCD school and the tender of this scheme is yet to take place, even though BJP leaders have officially inaugurated it. The situation is so serious that there is no clue whether the four lakh students of MCD schools will get dry rations or not,” said the AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations with which AAP leaders are trying to mislead people. The ration distribution to school children started with North MCD schools. It was designed to utilise the already allotted midday meal ration scheme, for which no separate tender is required. New tenders will be floated for the period beyond April 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-alleges-irregularities-in-ration-distribution-at-mcd-schools-baseless-claims-says-bjp-101617217854621.html

Last December, Kejriwal announced the setting up of new industrial zones exclusively for tech industries and the service sector, and opening up the existing ones to more sectors other than just manufacturing.While setting up new industrial areas is the long-term plan, the Delhi government’s key focus currently is to upgrade the existing 29 industrial areas to meet the changing needs of the city, said government officials.Also read | New school session to be online for all classes for now, says govtIn Wednesday’s press statement, the government said, “CM Kejriwal expressed his satisfaction regarding the ongoing industrial work and directed the officials to expedite the ongoing work for larger industrial development in the national capital of Delhi.

The pace of work has been such that the work has been completed before the timeline set by the government. To exemplify their claim, officials cited the example of Mayapuri Industrial area, where more than 85% of the development work has been completed.

01-04-2021||Delhi||New school session to be online for all classes for now, says govt||A day before the start of the new academic session in schools across the national capital, Delhi government officials on Wednesday said all classes in private and public institutions will continue to remain online, a decision which caused confusion for some schools that had prepared to begin the session with in-person lessons for students of classes 9 to 12.Schools in Delhi have conducted online lessons and exams for all students till Class 8 since March last year, owing to restrictions in place to minimise the spread of Covid-19.Between January 18 and February 5, the Delhi government had allowed schools to reopen for students in classes 9 to 12, to allow practical work and remedial lessons. However, government officials on Wednesday said they have not sanctioned these permissions for the new academic session so far and added that schools will have to continue online classes for all students.“The last reopening orders were issued to ensure that schools manage to conduct practical and remedial classes for these students [of classes 9-12]. It was also to prepare students for the CBSE Class 10 and 12 board exams. The order was for a specific purpose. The government has not yet allowed schools to reopen normally for senior students. Delhi government schools will on Thursday begin the new session for students of Class 9 and below remotely. Private schools cannot resume offline classes without the government’s permission,” a senior official at the government’s education department.Although the directorate of education (DoE) had on March 16 issued a circular directing all government schools to begin the new academic session from April 1 for students up to Class 9 online, it is yet to issue any such notification for private schools.Officials at some private schools, including Mount Abu Public School in Rohini and Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri, that had decided to revert to in-person lessons for senior classes, said the education department’s orders needed more clarity.“The DoE’s March 16 notification doesn’t clearly mention which classes can or cannot be called to schools for in-person classes. Besides, the reopening guidelines issued for classes 10 and 12 in January and classes 9 and 11 in February did not mention how long the guidelines were valid. The government needs to make it more transparent,” said an official at Sanskriti School who asked not to be named.Also read | Delhi's daily Covid tally goes up again with 1,819 new cases; toll at 11,027Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School said, “There should be clear guidelines on online and offline classes. The academic session is set to begin tomorrow [Thursday], and we are still waiting for instructions from the state education department.”Lakshay Chhabaria, president of the Affordable Private Schools’ Association in Delhi, said most schools under their umbrella were also planning a blend of online and in-person lessons for senior students.“A large number of parents have consented to sending their children to school, and we are also taking all precautions and due care. The government order dated March 16 was only for aided and government schools. We are yet to be notified of anything,” he said.Meanwhile, a majority of the private schools, including Springdales School, Delhi Public Schools, Tagore International, The Indian School, Birla Vidya Niketan, and Bal Bharti Public School, among others, had earlier decided to continue with online lessons for all classes in the new session.Officials at these schools said a year of familiarity with the process meant that virtual classes this session are likely to be less challenging than they were in 2020.In the last year, both private and public schools in Delhi have switched to online lessons via videoconferencing, recorded video and audio lectures, presentation slides, podcasts, portable document format (PDFs), worksheets, and activities on emails.Meenu Goswami, principal of Bal Bharti School in Pitampura, said, “Over the past year, teachers and students have become familiar with several technologies and learning techniques, which is why it will be slightly easier for us to start a new academic year virtually. However, this year, we have decided to have mandatory slots for personalised, one-on-one interactions between students and class teachers every day, in order to rekindle their personal connection with their school and teachers.”Principals at government schools also said that their teachers and students are more prepared for digital lessons this year. RP Singh, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Surajmal Vihar, said, “Last year at this time, we were struggling to understand the use of technology. However, over the last year, our teachers and students have learned a lot. The quality of worksheets has also improved over the period. But we are really worried about the impact of a prolonged school closures on the overall development of students.”Several students also said they were disappointed to begin another academic year online. Rania Mavinkurve, 14, a Class 9 student at Springdales School, Pusa Road said she would miss wearing a new uniform, buying a new bag and stationery, and meeting friends. “Although we are much comfortable with online learning after a year, I really wanted to go back to school and attend in-person classes this time. I wanted to meet my new classmates since our sections have reshuffled this year. This is so disappointing that we are starting another session online,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-school-session-to-be-online-for-all-classes-for-now-says-govt-101617217853003.html

They slammed him for not supporting their agitation against Centre’s three farm laws.Amid heavy police deployment, Dushyant reached Panipat in a helicopter. Following threat of protests by farmers, the deputy CM had earlier postponed the grievances committee meeting twice.Interacting with the media, Dushyant said everybody has the right to protest. Government is ready to resume talks with the farmers, he said.He claimed that the government was committed towards welfare of farmers and steps are being taken to increase their income. He said that of 15 registered grievances, seven were resolved on the spot.In a sharp reaction to his uncle and INLD leader Abhay Chautala’s statement that the farmers should tie up BJP-JJP leaders if they come to their village, Dushyant said, “I don’t think he is a serious politician. I don’t take such people seriously.”“He (Abhay) may claim that he paid my tuition fee and purchased clothes for me, but such statements are illogical,” he said, regarding Abhay’s claims that he played a key role in Dushyant’s first election as an MP.Meanwhile, he condemned the thrashing of Punjab BJP MLA Arun Narang by farmers and termed the incident a “police failure”.He said that Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh should support Centre’s decision of direct payment to farmers and added that the move will ensure that farmers get payment of their produce without any delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dushyant-chautala-faces-protest-from-farmers-during-panipat-visit-101617217793724.html

Some volunteers of an animal shelter managed to rescue the two puppies after 13 hours of non-stop rescue operation, uniting the two scared but unhurt puppies with their mother and siblings. The incident took place in Badlapur, 52 kilometres from Mumbai, early on Monday morning. Eye witnesses said the female dog did not leave the site during the entire operation. The incident came to notice when Prashant Ghugare, 25, who lives in the building, heard the puppies howling when he was out for a walk around 5.30am. He realised the puppies were barking from inside the borewell and informed a volunteer of Panvatha orphanage for handicap animals, Badlapur. “I was out for a walk and heard the puppies howling and called the orphanage. The borewell, a failed project, was closed earlier but somehow it was left opened recently,” said Ghugare. The volunteers first took photos of inside the six-inch-wide well to get an idea of the situation. “We wanted to know if there is ample space for the puppies to move or they can’t move at all. We did the recording and found that there was no space for them to move and they were covered with muddy water,” said Ganraj Jain, 35, founder of the orphanage that shelters nearly 100 disabled animals. A volunteer group then purchased a rope and binding wire, and prepared a trap using a pipe to pull the puppies out safely. “The puppies were too tiny and it was very important to ensure they are not hurt. Preparing the trap using rope and the pipe took some time. Around 12.30pm we managed to pull out one of the puppies. It looked weak. We believe it might have fallen into the borewell on Sunday night when it was dark,” said Jain. The second puppy was rescued around 6pm in the evening. “We cleaned the puppies and kept them near their mother who was there since we started the rescue operations. It was a touching moment when the mother cuddled the two puppies,” said Jain. The housing society members have closed the borewell for safety reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dog-stands-guard-as-pups-are-rescued-from-borewell-near-mumbai-101617217733621.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Random Covid-19 testing starts at airport, railway stations and ISBTs||The Delhi government on Wednesday started conducting random Covid-19 tests on domestic passengers arriving at the T3 and T2 terminals of the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Covid tests are also being conducted at railway stations and interstate bus terminals since the past two-three months but none of the tests conducted at these places was done on the basis of city of origin -- to test passengers from states witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases.On Wednesday (Day One of the exercise), the Delhi government randomly picked 660 samples for RT-PCR tests from passengers who landed at the IGI airport, even as officials deployed at railway stations and ISBTs were seen testing mostly those who walked up to their counters. There was no prioritisation or identification of passengers who arrived from states that are witnessing a steep surge in cases such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Gujarat, among others.To be sure, the DDMA in its March 23 order had stated, “All district disaster management authorities shall conduct random testing (RAT/RT-PCR) of passengers coming from the states where Covid-19 cases are increasing, at all airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and other alighting points (for private buses) in NCT of Delhi.”When asked about the week’s delay -- the order came on March 23 -- in deploying health teams for random tests at the airport, a senior district official said getting passes for teams and approvals for a space to operate from inside the airport took time.Also read | From today, vaccination drive opens to everyone above the age of 45 years“We are randomly requesting people to undergo RT-PCR tests. If anyone is not willing, we are not forcing them. At present, we are not able to test on the basis of states having a high Covid caseload as the space we have been allotted is not where people immediately deboard from the aircraft. The only way that can be done is by asking people to show their boarding pass -- we do not know how many will be comfortable showing us these,” said the official, asking not to be named.If any of the 660 samples are positive, it will be sent for genome sequencing as well and the person will have to undergo a 10 -day mandatory isolation at their scheduled place of stay or an institutional quarantine facility in the city, the official said.“At T3, we have two teams deployed in the area before the luggage collection zone. At T2, our space is beyond where the passengers collect their luggage, closer to the exit gates,” the official said.AT RAILWAY STATIONSAt the New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations, the district teams said they are conducting around 2,000 tests daily on inbound passengers. Data of the district, seen by HT, showed that on March 28, the positivity rate among the 2,000-odd incoming passengers at the two railway stations was 1.04%.“Whosoever is coming, we are testing them. Nobody is being denied a Covid test,” said a district official engaged in Covid tests at the New Delhi railway station and the Old Delhi railway station.A second district official said random testing at the Kashmere Gate ISBT has been ongoing for almost three months. “We have not been provided with a list of states based on which we would segregate passengers and test them. No such direction was issued,” said the official, asking not to be named.AT ANAND VIHAR ISBTAt Anand Vihar, a common test camp, located between the ISBT and the Metro station, caters to passengers using either of the three modes of transport -- bus, railways or the Metro. The scene was similar at that camp as well.“No new camp has been set up. This camp has been operational for several months now. On average, we are testing 1,500 people every day. But these tests are not happening based on the state of origin of travellers. It is voluntary, so whoever comes, we test them,” said the official involved in the Anand Vihar ISBT testing camp.“Those who are tested through the rapid antigen test get the results on the spot, while those undergoing RT-PCR tests are asked to leave after recording their address and phone number. If their results come positive the next day, the district administration is informed and officials there take the necessary steps thereafter,” the official said.When asked, the Delhi government did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/random-covid-19-testing-starts-at-airport-railway-stations-and-isbts-101617217732986.html

However, the police denied any planned campaign or drive against the community.“It’s just that some refugees were found staying here illegally. There is no drive against them as such,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east).Ali Jauhar, a community leader of the Rohingyas, on Wednesday said the local police detained four refugees each from the Kalindi Kunj and Shaheen Bagh camps on the pretext that they did not have the necessary documents. “They later let go of the Shaheen Bagh refugees, but the Kalindi Kunj Rohingyas have been detained,” Jauhar, who also lives at the Kalindi Kunj refugee camp, said.Jauhar said that on March 24, six Rohingyas from each camp were held.The DCP confirmed that a few refugees were detained earlier as well, but did not elaborate on the exact number or date. “Whenever we get to know that someone is living illegally, we detain them and hand them over to the FRRO,” Meena said, adding that no police cases were registered against them.Jauhar, however, alleged that refugees were being detained despite possessing the necessary documents. “I don’t know why that is being done,” he said.Jauhar said about 600 Rohingya refugees are living in the two camps. “They all have refugee cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner,” he said.Despite repeated attempts, the FRRO wasn’t available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-rohingya-refugees-from-kalindi-kunj-camp-detained-for-not-having-documents-101617217674776.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Man stabbed to death by mob following altercation, police arrest four||A 23-year-old man, working at a restaurant in Connaught Place, was killed after being attacked with a knife, beer bottles and sticks by around six men following a quarrel between them in outer Delhi’s Narela on Monday evening, the police said.Although rumours were rife on Tuesday that the murder had communal tones to it, police categorically quashed these speculations and said most of the suspects also belonged to the same religion as the victim. As a precautionary step, the police also deployed additional force in the neighbourhood to maintain peace and order.Rajeev Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (outer north), said so far four of at least five known suspects have been arrested. “We have arrested Qayamuddin, Salauddin, Kundan and Kaushal. We are on the lookout for one more known suspect and other possible unknown attackers,” said Ranjan.The victim was identified as Bunty Verma, a resident of Narela Industrial Area. He worked in the housekeeping department of a restaurant in Connaught Place.The police said after celebrating Holi on Monday, he visited a water purifier kiosk in his neighbourhood to collect drinking water. “Around 4.30pm, while he was returning with the water, he noticed some drunk men in the local park. He asked them not to consume alcohol in public and they began beating him over that,” Verma’s brother Rahul said.The DCP said it later emerged that Verma, too, was drunk at that time.Some locals intervened in the fight and broke it up. Verma returned home, but around 6pm, he again ventured into the street.This time, the rival group allegedly attacked him with a knife, broken bottles and sticks until his brother rescued him. “Even when I tried to rush him to a hospital in an auto-rickshaw, the men kept attacking us,” Rahul said.Verma eventually succumbed to multiple stab wounds, Rahul said.On Tuesday, Verma’s family took to the street to accuse the police of not acting against the suspects. Police have assured the victim’s family that no effort will be spared in acting against the killers and quashed all rumours of a communal fight. The arrested men either worked at a power plant or did odd jobs. None of them has a criminal past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-stabbed-to-death-by-mob-following-altercation-police-arrest-four-101617217673525.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi zoo to open with Covid-19 precautions||The National Zoological Park will open to the public on Thursday, after a gap of over a year, and operate in two shifts to prevent crowding, officials familiar with the matter said.Ramesh Kumar Pandey, director, Delhi zoo, said, “The entire premises will be completely sanitised before it is opened in the morning. We will operate in two shifts; the first shift will be from 8 am to noon and the second shift will be from 1 pm to 5 pm. Between noon and 1 pm, we will close the zoo for sanitisation to adhere to the coronavirus protocols.”The Delhi zoo was shut for visitors on March 18 last year, a week before the nationwide lockdown that lasted 68 days was imposed. Although most services gradually resumed in the last few months, plans to get visitors back to the zoo were hit by cases of avian flu earlier this year.The first case of bird flu was reported from the zoo on January 15, when a sample from a brown fish owl that was found dead in its enclosure tested positive. Seven more samples collected from the zoo premises also tested positive over the next few weeks.The Delhi zoo is one of the Capital’s most popular tourist spaces, receiving 15,000-20,000 visitors on weekdays before the pandemic. Zoo officials said that the footfall went up to 30,000-35,000 during the weekends and national holidays.Also read | Seven samples from Delhi Zoo test positive for bird fluPandey said that to ensure there is no crowding inside or outside the zoo, the administration decided that not more than 1,500 people will be allowed on the premises at a time. Manual ticketing has been completely stopped and visitors will have to pre-book their tickets online from the official website of the Delhi zoo, nzpnewdelhi.gov.in. To minimise physical exchange, the Delhi zoo will also provide digitised maps and brochures to help visitors navigate.“To ensure that the number of people coming into the zoo is controlled, we opened the website for ticket sale at 8 am on Wednesday, 24 hours before entry. Around 5 pm on Wednesday, we had over 50 bookings,” Pandey said.The cost of entry has increased from ₹40 to ₹80 for adults and from ₹20 to ₹40 for children aged 5-12 years and senior citizens. Officials said that the hike in prices was not related to the pandemic and a proposal was already in the works as the fee was not revised for seven years.While visitors will have to strictly adhere to social distancing norms, they will be welcomed by many new residents, including sloth bears, striped hyenas, chinkara (Indian gazelle), ostrich and Indian boar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-to-open-with-covid-19-precautions-101617217674112.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena reconstitutes panel of party spokespersons||The Shiv Sena leadership on Tuesday reconstituted the party’s panel of spokespersons. The party leadership appointed south Mumbai MP Arvind Sawant as the party’s chief spokesperson along with Sanjay Raut. The decision to reconstitute the panel of spokespersons comes days after Raut’s criticism and comments irked Sena’s alliance partners Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress party. Raut’s editorials and column in party mouthpiece Saamana has also taken shots at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray recently.Over the past few weeks, Raut’s reiterations that NCP chief Sharad Pawar should head the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) upset the Congress leadership in Maharashtra. On Sunday, Raut in his weekly column had criticised home minister Anil Deshmukh regarding the allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. In the same column, the Sena parliamentarian had also criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led government saying it did not have a damage control plan in Sachin Vaze-Mansukh Hiran case.The Sena had appointed Raut as the chief spokesperson and 10 other spokespersons including Sawant in September 2020. Within six months of his appointment, the party has reconstituted the panel of spokespersons. Despite repeated attempts Raut was unavailable for a comment.Sawant was the Union minister in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had held the heavy industries portfolio before he quit in November 2019 after the Sena pulled out of the NDA. In February, he was appointed the head of the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS), the post that fell vacant after Suryakant Mahadik’s demise. BKS has over 500,000 members across the state from workers in airlines, airports, MTNL, hospitals, five-star hotels, banking and manufacturing sectors, etc.As per the new list, the party has added MLA Bhaskar Jadhav who was vocal in the state Assembly while defending the party in Vaze case, and former minister Sachin Ahir who is known to be close to Sena scion Aaditya Thackeray. The party has also included MLCs Ambadas Danve and Manisha Kayande, corporator Sheetal Mhatre, former Mumbai mayor Dr Shubha Raul, OBC leader from Nagpur Kishore Kanhere, former MNS member Sanjana Ghadi and Anand Dubey, who is a north Indian face in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-shiv-sena-reconstitutes-panel-of-party-spokespersons-101617217672985.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro gets ₹8,390-crore loan from Japan agency for Phase 4 expansion work||The cash-strapped Delhi Metro body has received a major funding boost, with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a bilateral cooperation agency of the Japanese government, sanctioning a loan of ₹8,390 crore for Metro’s Phase 4 expansion plan.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said, “The loan agreement between the government of India and JICA for the sanction of loan for Delhi Metro’s Phase 4 expansion was signed last Friday. The amount sanctioned is Japanese Yen 119,978 million (Approximately ₹8,390 crore).”While DMRC started work under the Phase 4 in December 2019, HT has learnt that the body couldn’t start work on some of its underground sections because of questions over funding.Also read | CM reviews progress of redevelopment of industrial areasTo be sure, the JICA loan is meant specifically for the construction of the Phase 4 corridors and can’t be used by DMRC to meet its operational losses.While there are six corridors, spread over 104 km, proposed under Phase 4, the central government has approved three corridors so far. The three corridors will add 65km to the existing 389km network. The approved corridors are Aerocity-Tughlakabad (20.2km), Maujpur-Majlis Park (12.5 km) and Janakpuri West- RK Ashram corridor (28.9 km). DMRC started work on the Janakpuri West-RK Ashram corridor in December 2019.However, the nationwide lockdown last year, and the consequent labour shortages, meant that construction work was stalled in the initial months, but picked up later on. DMRC, HT has learnt, has been incurring huge operational losses since Metro services in the city resumed on September 7 last year. The corporation’s revenues took a severe hit due to the 169-day closure enforced due to curbs put in place to stem the spread of Covid-19.In January this year, DMRC asked the Centre and Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for financial assistance of ₹1,678.41 crore. Officials said this assistance has not been sanctioned as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-gets-8-390-crore-loan-from-japan-agency-for-phase-4-expansion-work-101617217620239.html

In a show of strength, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers, including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat — chief guests at the event — were present. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator and Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar was also present at the event.The ₹400-crore memorial will come up on the plot of the erstwhile Mumbai mayor’s bungalow. Executed by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), phase one of the project is expected to be completed in 14 months.As part of the phase one, it will have architecture including a grand six-metre high entrance, administrative block, interpretation block, cafeteria, a pond. As part of the construction, an underground section will be built where a gallery with pictures, quotes, among other things of the Sena supremo’s life will be displayed. Phase one will also include the construction of a parking lot for visitors and focus on the mechanism of rain water harvesting at the memorial. The second phase will consist of the technological part of the memorial. This will include preparation of digital mapping, films, audio visuals, etc. for the memorial to start its operations. The erstwhile mayor’s bungalow will be untouched and will also house Thackeray’s journey from a cartoonist in a Mumbai-based newspaper to setting up a political outfit and his political journey. Abha Narain Lambha Associates has designed the memorial. The event also had its share of controversy. The official card of the event did not mention urban development department minister Eknath Shinde’s name. The Sena minister was, however, present at the event. The opposition criticised the Shiv Sena for not extending invitation to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis.“The programme was held in the presence of limited people. Once the [Covid-19] restrictions are lifted, we might have a grand event,” said industries minister Subhash Desai, who is the general secretary of Balasaheb Thackeray National Memorial Trust. Sena minister Anil Parab said the opposition is trying to create a difference. “All Sena ministers have been invited.

When Congress government is formed in future, these farmers will be given martyr status and appropriate financial help. Also, government job will be provided to a member of their families,” he said.“In the assembly session, an attempt was made by the Congress to bring a Bill guaranteeing MSP to farmers but the Speaker of the assembly rejected it. It is clear to everyone that the mindset of the BJP-JJP government is anti-farmer,” he added.Hooda urged the Union government to start a dialogue with the protesters and end the ongoing deadlock.“The demands of farmers are justified. It has been more than four months since the movement started. Despite this, the movement continues to be peaceful and disciplined. Farmers’ morale is still high and they are not tired despite their long struggle,” he said.He added that the government will repeatedly try to provoke the farmers and advised the farmers to be cautious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-give-martyr-status-to-farmers-who-died-during-farm-stir-says-hooda-101617217619233.html
01-04-2021||Delhi||68 patients evacuated after fire breaks out at Safdarjung hospital’s HDU||A fire broke out in the high dependency unit (HDU), or step-down intensive care unit, on the first floor of Safdarjung hospital early Wednesday, triggering panic for a brief period and leading to the evacuation of eight patients in the HDU and 60 other patients in the two adjoining wards, fire officials said. No casualty or injury was reported in the incident, the first responders added.Although the fire was small one and was doused quickly using the fire safety equipment available in the hospital building itself, the smoke caused by it had engulfed the HDU and the two adjoining wards because of which the patients had to be shifted, the fire officials said.“The fire broke out around 6.15am in the high dependency unit 11 in the H block of the hospital. It was most likely caused by high voltage fluctuations triggering a short-circuit,” said hospital spokesperson Poonam Dhanda.The HDU is meant for patients admitted to the medicine department of the hospital who are in need of constant monitoring and some life-support.Delhi Fire Services chief Atul Garg said the fire control room was alerted at 6.35am. “It’s a three-storey block and the fire was on the first floor. A total of nine fire tenders were rushed from Safdarjung, Bhikaji Cama Place and other nearby fire stations. The fire was doused and patients shifted to other wards with the help of the hospital staff,” said Garg.Also read | Delhi's daily Covid tally goes up again with 1,819 new cases; toll at 11,027The visuals from the fire spot shared by the fire department showed beds and medical equipment in the affected wards covered by a thick layer of soot but no major visible damage.Assistant divisional fire officer Vedpal Chhikara, who was leading the rescue efforts, said the fire had originated in one of the ventilators in the HDU where eight patients were undergoing treatment. There was smoke all over the HDU but nearly 20 hospital employees, including the nursing staff, ward helpers and security guards, quickly responded to the emergency situation and began shifting patients to other wards, said Chhikara.“The hospital staff and our firefighters lifted patients using the bed sheets and shifted them to other wards about 20 metres away on the same floor. There were 30 patients each in the two adjoining wards. They were also safely evacuated and shifted to other wards. Things were under control within half an hour,” said the fire officer.In a statement issued in the afternoon, the hospital authorities said “regular fire drills in the hospital with cooperation from the fire department helped in managing the situation”.In another incident, a fire broke out at a three-storey ready-made garments godown in east Delhi’s Raghubarpura Part-2, near Gandhi Nagar, on Wednesday morning, fire and police personnel said.Fire chief Garg said 15 fire tenders were sent to the spot to douse the flames. The fire was controlled within an hour but the cooling operation continued till late afternoon.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the fire was on the first, second and third floor of the building. “No casualty was reported.

01-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves order in PILs by Param Bir Singh, others seeking CBI probe||The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh why he did not file a first information report (FIR) against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh if he was aware that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was engaged in extortion.The court made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Singh seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against Deshmukh.“As per your claims you were witness to an offence (Deshmukh asking police officers to extort money from bars and restaurants). Then why did you not file an FIR. You held the highest post in the force, what stopped you from filing the complaint?” a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni asked of Singh, who was transferred out as commissioner on March 17 for his handling of the Antilia bomb scare case, and then chose to go public, on March 20, with allegations against the home minister.The bench reserved its order on Singh’s PIL. “Even if Deshmukh was your boss, why did you not file a complaint against him? No one is above the law,” observed the bench.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the state, started arguments objecting to the maintainability of the PIL by Singh as it was for personal gain, was politically motivated and was based on vendetta as Singh did not share a good rapport with Deshmukh while he was the commissioner of police (CP).Kumbhakoni justified his submissions by stating that the allegations by Singh were made after he was transferred to the home guards by a March 17 order of the home department.Also read | 'Eyewash': Fadnavis on panel formed to probe charges against DeshmukhKumbhakoni further added that while Singh alleged that Deshmukh bypassed him and called police officers to his residence and asked them to collect money from bars and restaurants, there was no affidavit or complaints by the officers themselves.Senior counsel Vikram Nankani appearing for Singh, however, justified the PIL and stated that though his client enumerated the alleged malpractices by Deshmukh in his letter to the chief minister, no action was taken and hence he had no option but to approach the high court.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that prima facie the PIL by Singh was not maintainable as no FIR was registered. The court held that the basic premise of transferring an investigation was when an investigation was underway, however here in the absence of any FIR, no investigation was going on hence the court could not pass orders for transferring investigations to any other agency. After hearing all sides, the bench concluded the marathon hearing that lasted for more than six hours and said that it had heard all sides and the preliminary objections of the state on maintainability of the petition and reserved its order on the same.Singh was transferred following a case that embarrassed the city police and the state government.On February 25, a SUV with explosives was found outside the house of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. It turned out that the owner of the SUV had filed a complaint about the car being stolen on February 18.However, the owner turned up dead on March 5, following which it emerged that Sachin Vaze, a powerful and influential sub-inspector in Mumbai Police, was behind the whole incident, according to the National Investigation Agency which is investigating both the explosives case and the murder.Singh was moved out citing his handling of the case, following which he shot of an angry letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in which he made his allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reserves-order-in-pils-by-param-bir-singh-others-seeking-cbi-probe-101617217553000.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra refuses to extend stamp duty rebate||The Maharashtra government has refused to extend relaxation of stamp duty for real estate sector which had considerably boosted sales of houses across the state from September last year onwards. However, the state has maintained status quo on the ready reckoner (RR) rates, saying it will be same as last year. Stamp duty will now be charged at 5% from the current 3%.“The rebate given in stamp duty to give boost to the realty sector which ends on March 31 will not be extended. The regular stamp duty rates will be applied,” tweeted revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.Builders had hoped that the state will extend the rebate further, especially in view of the second wave of Covid-19. “We are disappointed with the move to not extend the stamp duty rebate beyond March 31. It will impact sales momentum,” said Deepak Garodia, president of Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI), an association of builders across the state. “However, we will continue with our efforts to pursue the government that waiver is necessary as it will boost the money being paid to the state exchequer,” he added.The government in August last year announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 till December 31, 2020,and then hike it to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move had played a huge role in boosting sales of both primary and secondary market.Niranjan Hiranandani, president of National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), urged the government to reconsider reducing both stamp duty and RR rates, saying they were imperative in the post-Covid era to speed up sales and to ensure economic revival.RR rate is a guide published annually by the state government, which determines the rate of properties in a particular area, on which stamp duty and registration charges are levied. In addition, all calculations related to real estate are based on RR, whether it is premium, tax collection or even income tax matters related to the construction sector.“Bringing down the RR rate at this juncture would have definitely aided the real estate market as it was something that all stakeholders were looking forward to. A cut in RR rates would have given more room to developers to bring down the prices,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Property Consultants.The government however will provide a 1% rebate to any woman registering a property in her name solo or with another female member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-refuses-to-extend-stamp-duty-rebate-101617217477368.html

The civic body has maintained that the hospital should get permanent occupation certificate (OC) and no objection certificate (NOC) from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB).According to BMC officials, the BMC gave permission to the hospital in May last to run as a Covid-19 hospital till March 31 this year. The hospital was also given permission to operate on the basis of provisional OC and NOC from MFB.On March 25 around 11.45pm, a level-four fire was reported inside Dreams Mall which also houses Sunrise Hospital on the third floor. The fire was reported on the first floor of the mall and took around 40 hours to douse.Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “We are not going to extend the permission for now. We are very clear that the hospital should get permanent OC and fire NOC, after which we will give them further permission.”BMC has also ordered an enquiry into the fire incident and the report is expected to come out by April 10.Reacting to BMC’s decision, Sunrise Hospital in a statement said, “The hospital had all required permissions including the fire NOC, OC and nursing home license. All the compliances were completed and hence the provisional OC was given. The issue is with the mall administrator for not fulfilling the required compliances leading to the tragedy. We have given our complaints to the authority against the administrator too.”Meanwhile, corporators from all the political parties raised the matter in BMC’s standing committee demanding action against guilty officers. Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh said, “I have written to BMC administration to take action against the guilty officers who gave permission for operation of the hospital by overlooking several factors that has resulted in death of Covid-19 patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dreams-mall-fire-mumbai-civic-body-will-not-extend-licence-of-sunrise-hospital-101617217372987.html

01-04-2021||Mumbai||Coastal road: ‘Translocated from Haji Ali, corals surviving in Navy Nagar’||A total of 329 coral colonies -- belonging to the species ‘pseudosiderastrea tayamai’ -- are surviving in relatively undisturbed conditions at their new habitat in Navy Nagar, Colaba, officials in the forest department’s mangrove cell and the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) said on Wednesday, after undertaking an inspection of the site.The coral colonies had been translocated after being retrieved from 194 rock boulders in the intertidal zone at Haji Ali to Navy Nagar, in November 2020, as they were getting in the way of the coastal road alignment that will connect Princess Street near Marine Lines to Worli. This stretch of the coastal road is expected to be 10.5-km-long when finished.Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forests, mangrove cell, said, “We have inspected the corals along with officials from the National Institute of Oceanography, who had translocated the colonies and are conducting monthly inspections. The area is less polluted than Haji Ali and as it is in a high security zone, the area is not as disturbed either. There is a rich variety of intertidal life in the region already, and all shifted corals are intact.”Somraj said the NIO, at the instruction of the courts, has been conducting monthly visits to inspect the translocated corals (which are protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act). “They have also been submitting quarterly reports directly to the BMC, but we have told them that the mangrove cell also requires these reports. We should receive them shortly,” said Somraj.The proposal to shift the corals had attracted several objections from citizens and experts last year, with the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) in Nagpur finally giving permission on condition that the chief engineer, Coastal Road project, BMC, would continue to monitor the health of the species after they were moved. “We will only really know about their health and growth toward the end of 2021. We need to observe the corals for at least a year before making any conclusions,” said Somraj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/coastal-road-translocated-from-haji-ali-corals-surviving-in-navy-nagar-101617216773434.html

Yashna said that he did not know Jogdhankar and met him as he was along with Kukreja. She saw that Kukreja had plugged her phone with the projector at the party. She said that Kukreja, Jogdhankar and Padalkar were sitting in a corner and did not mingle with the rest. Her friend showed Ahuja that Kukreja and Jogdhankar were kissing, however, later Padalkar came and laid down the mattress besides them and then Jogdhankar got intimate with her, according to the statement. Yashna said Kukreja saw this and immediately unplugged her phone from the projector. Then Ahuja saw Kukreja talking on the phone and crying. Kharwani told the police that Jogdhankar was not invited to the party and she learnt at the party that he was Kukreja’s boyfriend for three years. Arora told the police that at 1.15am when they were chatting on the terrace, Diya began vomiting, after which Kukreja and Ahuja took her to his house where she slept. Kharwani said that when he went to Ahuja’s house to use the bathroom, she saw Padalkar sleeping on the bed as she was drunk. At 1.40am when Kharwani was leaving for home with Arora and Ahuja, they saw Kukreja crying in the passage. When Arora asked her what was wrong, Kukreja hugged him and left. At 2am, Sadhwani said that when he went to Ahuja’s house with a friend, he saw Padalkar washing her face and blood oozing from her lips. When he asked her how she hurt herself, Padalkar said that she was not aware. Ahuja said the same thing. The police officers also spoke to Parnika Nehrulla, 19, who was not present in the party but was constantly in touch with Kukreja over the phone throughout the party. She told the police that Kukreja was upset seeing her friend and boyfriend engage in inappropriate behaviour. She told Nehrulla that she did not want to lose Jogdhankar and began crying after which she hung up around 1.40am and did not call her again. Based on these five statements, the Khar police concluded that Kukreja was upset with the accused and was assaulted by the two when she confronted them and within 20 minutes, she lost her life. Ahuja further said that when he went to drop Karishma and reached the lobby, Dhanuka, who stays on the eighth floor, pointed out towards the passage saying that someone had died there. It was then that Ahuja saw Kukreja’s body. He frantically began calling Jogdhankar as he was closest to Kukreja, but his calls went unanswered. Later, Jogdhankar answered the phone, but seemed indifferent when Ahuja told him about Kukreja’s death, he told police. Ahuja, his grandfather and Saideep then went to the police station and informed the police about the incident. Param Mogal, Jogdhankar’s friend, told the police that at 2.07am, he got a call from Jogdhankar asking whether they were home. He told Mogal that he was on his way there. Mogal further said that 2.23am, Jogdhankar called him again asking to pick him up from Mahim. When Jogdhankar met Mogal, his white shirt was covered in blood and he told Mogal that he does not remember what happened. He then took Jogdhankar to Sion Hospital and got him treated. Jogdhankar’s lawyer, advocate Mahesh Vasqani has, however, expressed doubts about the police investigation. “The police have failed to properly investigate the assault and murderous injuries suffered by my client, Shree Jogdhankar, and have also not filed all the statements of medical personnel with the charge-sheet and it seems police has been misled in investigation. All witnesses statements are contradictory, and it is clear that the police have made some mistake in filing charge-sheet against Shree,” said advocate Vaswani. The defence lawyer added that there were 15 people in the party who were moving up and down (terrace and Yash’s second floor house) but there was not a single eyewitness to the incident. “If police found alcohol bottles on the terrace, why didn’t they test all the people in the party immediately but waited for two days. Even ganja was being supplied there,” said Vaswani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/khar-nye-murder-janhvi-kukreja-was-assaulted-killed-in-just-20-minutes-say-witnesses-101617216713047.html

The remaining six cops will have to pay fine of a month’s basic pay, the officer added. These personnel were suspended immediately after 106 people died and over 70 others were rendered disabled in the tragedy. Most of the victims were construction workers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, and other daily wagers from Malwani.The then Mumbai Police commissioner Rakesh Maria had ordered suspension of these eight policemen posted at beat chowkie under Malwani police station within whose jurisdiction the tragedy happened. He had also ordered departmental proceedings against them. During pendency of the inquiry, two of the eight policemen retired and suspension of the remaining six was revoked and they were allowed to resume duty.Mumbai Police’s crime branch had investigated the case registered in connection with the tragedy and had charged 16 accused with murder, attempt to murder, causing hurt by poison etc. The police officer said the trial is yet to conclude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malwani-hooch-tragedy-8-cops-let-off-with-minor-penalties-101617216592909.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Young adults: Mumbai’s new superspreaders||A high number of young adults is contracting the Covid-19 infection owing to relaxation of lockdown norms and starting of public transport, say experts, adding that although they remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, they are becoming super spreaders, giving the virus to the older, more vulnerable population. Data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows the highest number of infection rates has been recorded between the age group of 30-49 years. Around 150,000 people between the age group have contracted the infection. This is followed by the 50-69 age group, considered the most vulnerable group due to their underlying health conditions. In this category, around 128,000 people got infected with the virus. With the rise in awareness, elderly have become more cautious and avoid travelling outside. The civic ward officers have noticed they are more careful in following Covid safety rules such as physical distancing, wearing a mask than the young adults. But the shift of the pandemic towards the younger demographic is largely contributing to the transmission. “Infection in young adults is mild which is good for them but as many of them live with older individuals, they spread it to them who are more likely to be hospitalized and have higher fatality rate,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, in-charge of Covid beds in private hospitals. As per the BMC, despite having a lower infection rate compared to young adults, the fatality rate is the highest among the older. So far, 5,850 senior citizens between the age group of 50 to 69 have succumbed to the infection. Whereas only 1,428 individuals between the 30-49 age group have died because of Covid-19 in the city. “While doing background checks of infected people, we have found out that most of the young adults either have frequent travel history in public transport or have recently attended family functions. Later, many of those turn into carriers who end up infecting the elderly at home,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer of the R-C ward that covers Borivli. Ward officers have observed that many are contracting infection from their infected colleagues. “Offices are getting contaminated due to overcrowding. The staff who come from far-off have to travel in buses and trains. Also, as most offices have air-conditioners, it leads to faster spread,” said assistant commissioner Vishwas Mote. Many private firms have started to call back their employees who were earlier working from home. Due to this, many are being forced to commute daily including in trains who become a source of infection. “There has been a shift in the behaviour post lockdown relaxation. Many unknowingly become silent carriers. Unlike other cities, most of the families live in a one-BHK flat, with their elderly family members,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital. Public health experts insist on maintaining Covid safety precautionary measures while travelling daily. “We have already imposed night curfew to restrict the night crowd in pubs, clubs and other socialising places. Also, we have issued new guidelines for private firms to limit the number of staffers at offices,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/young-adults-mumbai-s-new-superspreaders-101617216533551.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccination: State plans to cover 33.8mn||With the new phase of Covid vaccination for those above 45 years beginning on Thursday, the state aims to cover 33.8 million citizens of Maharashtra. The number of potential beneficiaries rose to 33.8 million from 17.7 million after the addition of all citizens above 45 years. The state authorities said the new beneficiaries will be accommodated at the existing 3,000-plus centres. Of the 33.8 million population over 45 years, about 4.5 million have already been inoculated as part of the categories taken on priority after vaccination kicked off on January 16. Maharashtra has inoculated 5,296,000 beneficiaries with first dose till March 30,while 733,000 of them have been given their second shots too. The state now aims at inoculating more than 300,000 beneficiaries a day. “We have vaccinated 992,000 health care workers covering almost all of them registered on CoWIN. Also, 851,000 frontline workers have been inoculated so far. Against the capacity of inoculating more than 300,000 beneficiaries every day, our average vaccination is 250,000. This means we can take up additional number of beneficiaries from the new group. If needed, we will increase the number of centres with the permission from the central government,” said an official from the health department. He said that the number of vaccination centres has been increased manifold over the last one month after the new category of senior citizens and citizens over 45 years with comorbidities was introduced for inoculation. The number of centres before March 1 was around 800, which has now crossed 3,000. The state government is expected to get an additional supply of 2,627,000 doses on Thursday. Until March 23, the state has received 76,01,500 doses from the Central government. Mumbai tops the chart of vaccine beneficiaries with 1,126,000 beneficiaries (including second dose), followed by Pune (747,000), Thane (453,000) and Nagpur (360,000).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-state-plans-to-cover-338mn-101617216532970.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s active Covid cases near 50K; civic body takes over bed management||The number of active Covid cases in Mumbai came close to 50,000 on Wednesday. Mumbai reported 5,399 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, and 15 deaths, taking the active cases in the city to 49,953, and the toll to 11,690. So far, Mumbai has reported a total of 414,773 Covid-19 cases.To manage allotment of hospital beds to cater to the rising number of cases in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) took over bed allotment through its Covid war room at the ward level. Hospital beds cannot be directly assigned to patients anymore by the hospital. This system was put in place by the civic body at the beginning of the pandemic in March last year. However, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday reiterated that hospitals will not be allowed to assign beds to patients directly, and such allotment has to happen through Covid war rooms at each ward, in a centralised manner. All assistant commissioners were directed to take over hospital beds in their respective wards.Emphasising that the situation is not out of control, Chahal who took the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday said, “We are detecting high number of cases as we have increased the number of tests. The number of tests will soon go up to 60,000 per day and the number of infected people can be as high as 10,000 per day. Of these, the number of people in need of a bed will be relatively small, given the current situation. The mortality rate in Mumbai is also low now. For the growing number of patients, bed management is being done through ward war rooms, as before.”A total of 85,000 patients were found in the 48 days from February 10 to March 30. Of these, 69,500 patients were found to be asymptomatic, Chahal said on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Mumbai conducted 41,363 Covid-19 tests, with a positivity rate of 13%. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 4,083,173 tests. Presently, the cumulative case fatality rate is 2.8% as opposed to over 3% recorded earlier this month.As of March 31, Mumbai has a total of 13,110 hospital beds for symptomatic, serious and critical Covid-19 patients, of which 10,061 are occupied and 3,049 are available. There are 1,627 ICU beds of which 324 are vacant, 1,000 ventilator beds of which 170 are vacant, and 8,914 beds with oxygen supply, of which 2,219 are vacant. There are 3,451 beds for asymptomatic patients in Covid Care facilities (CCC2) of which 884 are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-active-covid-cases-near-50k-civic-body-takes-over-bed-management-101617216472897.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Donate blood before taking Covid vaccine, urges body||Fearing a possible shortage of blood in the coming days, the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) has requested probable beneficiaries to donate blood before getting the jab as they will not be eligible for donation for 28 days after taking the first shot of the vaccine. Starting from 1 April, people above 45 years old will be able to take vaccines against novel coronavirus. Though doctors across the state have welcomed the move which may contribute to containing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, blood bank officers are quite concerned as it can contribute to further shortage of blood. A recent order by the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) has said that a person cannot donate blood for the next 28 days after taking the last dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Beneficiaries have to take two shots of vaccines. So, considering the new guidelines, a beneficiary cannot donate for 56 days after taking the two jabs. At present, the state has 29,000 units of blood. Blood bank officers fear this new rule may further affect the collection of blood as lakhs of public above 45 years would get inoculated from Thursday. “The demand for blood has increased with the relaxation of lockdown. Now, hospitals are treating both Covid and non-Covid patients. So, we need more donors which are struggling to arrange due to the restrictions on blood camps in the pandemic. Thus, I would request to donate blood before taking the vaccine,” said Dr Arun Thorat, director of SBTC. “Unlike post-Covid days, we can’t arrange large blood camps as it attracts a large crowd. Also, all schools and colleges are closed so we can’t collect blood from youths who were the primary blood donors. Rather than providing some relaxation, the central government has imposed more stringent rules,” said a blood bank officer from a civic-run hospital. Two vaccines ‒ Oxford’s Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute in the country and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – have been approved by the national drug regulator for restricted emergency use in India. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers getting inoculated. From February 2, the frontline workers were added to the list. In the next phase that commenced from March 1, individuals above 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with co-morbidities were enrolled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/donate-blood-before-taking-covid-vaccine-urges-body-101617216412837.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||3,700,000 qualify for new phase: BMC data||A total of 3,700,000 Mumbaiites qualify for the next phase of vaccination for those above the age of 45 regardless of comorbidities which starts from April 1, as per data collected by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) during its My Family My Responsibility survey. The drive will take place across 111 centres in the city. Any citizen above the age of 45 can register on the CoWIN application or the Aarogya Setu application to get vaccinated. Of these, 30 centres are in municipal hospitals, 13 are in state and central government hospitals, and 68 are in private hospitals. Citizens can also walk into any vaccination centres for their vaccine shots. No medical certificate of comorbidities will be required to qualify for this phase of the drive. Currently, the BMC has been vaccinating senior citizens, and citizens above the age of 45 years who also have comorbidities. Iqbal Singh Chahal, municipal commissioner, said on Tuesday, “At least 4,000,000 citizens qualify for the category of above 45 years, of which 300,000 have comorbidities, our surveys have shown. A total of 2,300,000 citizens are above the age of 60.” With this, the BMC hopes to inch closer to its target of vaccinating 100,000 citizens per day. It has vaccinating about 40,000 to 45,000 beneficiaries per day, including healthcare and frontline workers, senior citizens and those above 45 years of age with comorbidities, many of whom have received the second dose of their vaccine shot as well. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said on Monday, “So far, the turnout in citizens above the age of 45 who also have comorbidities is low. Beneficiaries are afraid to bring medical certificates to validate they have comorbidities, which is a prerequisite to qualify for vaccination at present if you are above 45 years, as they do not want this to go on their medical record. They fear this will interfere with their health insurance systems at a later stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3700000-qualify-for-new-phase-bmc-data-101617216352925.html
01-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha sees 227 Covid-19 deaths, highest 1-day toll since Oct 17||The number of new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra jumped to 39,544 on Wednesday, after two days of comparatively lower numbers, even as the single-day toll rose to 227, highest since October 17, 2020 (250 deaths). Also, the last time the state saw more than 200 deaths in a day was on October 20, 2020 (213 casualties).The Maharashtra government, in order to ramp up Covid-19 testing, has reduced RT-PCR test rates to ₹500 and antigen tests to ₹150 for private laboratories.Commenting on the rise in deaths, Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said the problem was that many citizens tend to ignore the initial signs. “We have observed many just tend to neglect signs like headache or body ache. They are seen to test late after their condition gets worse and hence many then succumb to this virus,” said Dr Lahane.Dr Lahane said although 167,078 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, the government wants to increase test rates further and hence the reduction in prices of tests. “We feel that if test prices are slashed, it will encourage more people to test themselves,” said Dr Lahane.The number of deaths in the previous five days was 633 and with the addition of 227 fatalities on Wednesday, the total deaths over six days is 860. The total state toll due to Covid-19 is 54,649, with Mumbai leading the state with 11,690 fatalities, followed by Pune’s 8,326. Maharashtra’s case tally stood at 2,812,980.Dr Neeta Khandelwal, a consultant at Bombay Hospital, said efforts must be made to increase the number of vaccinations to control this toll. “There should be mandatory mass vaccinations for all. Vaccines will reduce the severity of the virus and also bring the death rate down considerably,” said Khandelwal. She said the government needs to strictly penalise people who tend to violate the guidelines and force them to wear masks and observe social distancing. The total number of active cases in the state stood at 356,243, with Pune leading with 64,277 cases, followed by Mumbai at 49,953 active infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-sees-227-covid-19-deaths-highest-1-day-toll-since-oct-17-101617216292893.html
01-04-2021||Pune||Five cars, four small-scale factories destroyed in separate fires in Pune||Five cars and four small-scale factories were gutted in two isolated fire incidents in two parts of the city on Wednesday. In the first incident reported at around 3 am in Baner, the Renault service centre located off the NH 48 Pune-Bengaluru highway caught fire, and cars awaiting repairs were gutted. The officials of the Pune city fire brigade were fighting the blaze for four hours with the help of five fire tender units. In the second incident, a fire was reported from a shed that housed four small-scale factories around 11am in Dhayari area. The factories located near Abhinav College road were used for producing material like cardboard, the foam used for bedding, decoration material, according to fire officials. The Pune city as well as the planning and development authority for the Pune Metro Region Development Authority (PMRDA) fire brigade were deployed for dousing the fire. The fire took comparatively less time to get doused compared to the service centre. In yet another fire incident, the garbage and hay near a temple in Sahakarnagar area of Pune caught fire around noon. One fire tender unit from Katraj division responded to the call and doused the fire. It was the garbage that was thrown in the open area that caught fire and the dry grass increased the intensity before the fire brigade officials could reach and douse the fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-cars-four-small-scale-factories-destroyed-in-separate-fires-101617207412467.html
01-04-2021||Pune||Labourers fear another lockdown, many plan to leave Pune city||As the state government is planning to impose stricter restrictions in the coming days, it has an adverse impact on the labourers in the city.Due to the fear of another lockdown, even as the state government has clarified of no complete closure, several migrant workers who had returned to Pune at construction sites and small industries earlier are planning to go back to the native places.Most of these labourers come from North Indian states and in the last couple of weeks there has been a drastic increase in the number of passengers travelling from Pune to North India, a reflection of it was seen through the increase in passengers travelling in the north-bound trains at Pune railway station.“We have seen a considerable amount of increase in the number of daily passengers travelling through various trains starting from Pune going towards North India. It includes - Pune to Patna, Pune to Lucknow, Pune to Jhelum and others,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson.The developers too reported some workers either planning to leave or already left the city even as numbers are small at this point.“Work is underway at our construction site at Ambegaon and it resumed in August last year when most of our workers returned back from their villages in North India. For the last four to five months work was progressing smoothly, but since the first week of March when the Covid cases started increasing, a fear of infection and now lockdown has started impacting labourers. Of the 40 labourers, 15 of them have left for their hometowns in Bihar last week and we are somehow managing the work at the site,” said Anant Shinde, a builder from the Katraj.Similar is the situation with the small scale industries in and around Pune. Abhay Bhore, state president of Forum of Small Scale Industries Association, said, “There is already a major impact on the business of small scale industries, as 50 per cent of work has reduced. Amid this, workers are now planning to leave for their hometowns due to the fear of lockdown in Maharashtra. Some of them who have stayed back are waiting for work and to earn money.”The fear of lockdown among workers and traders increased after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked the administration to prepare for lockdown. As the fear grew, health minister Rajesh Tope clarified that lockdown will be the last option before the state tries other restrictions.Suhas Merchant, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai)-Pune Metro, said, “If a lockdown is imposed it will majorly impact the work at construction sites. If there is a lockdown imposed for eight to ten days then its effect on construct sites will remain for two to three months. It is not a manufacturing industry and it is a human process, once you stop work then it again takes time to bring all things back and mobilise which takes two months. So we have already requested state government to allow work at construction sites.”“Amid a surge in Covid cases if a lockdown is imposed we are ready to take care of our workers, as it won’t be for many days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/labourers-fear-another-lockdown-many-plan-to-leave-pune-city-101617205132301.html

Alert over new Covid-19 variant Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday urged people to strictly follow the safety protocol and stay alert against the new Covid-19 variant that is more lethal. Presiding over a review meeting at Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, the chief minister said health experts have observed that common symptoms such as cough and fever were not detected in patients infected with the mutant virus and instead, they were suffering from joint pain, weakness and loss of appetite besides pneumonia. The new strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region, rather it directly affects the lungs, which means the window period is shortened.
