The petitioners’ contention was that their members were in business of sale of stamp and if printing of physical stamps was stopped by the government, they would be out of business which would be in violation of Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India which guarantees a citizen to practise a business, trade or profession.The state government’s contention was that licensed vendors have no fundamental right to trade or carry on the business of physical stamps since the conditions of their engagement is circumscribed by the terms of the licence that is granted to them. It was contended that a stock of physical stamp papers valued at ₹17,000 crore still exist in the state and therefore the apprehension that licensed vendors would be deprived of a right of livelihood was clearly misplaced.Advocates Kshitij, Shailendra and Sumeet Kakker appeared for stock holding corporation which is ‘Central Record Keeping Agency’ for administration and implementation of mechanism of e-stamp. They argued that the corporation was appointed as per Uttar Pradesh E-Stamping Rules, 2013 and the rules were not challenged by the petitioners. Hence, the petition was devoid of any merit.The court after hearing the concerned parties observed that, “Introduction of this system rests on sound, germane and weighty reasons such as avoidance of fraud and forgery of stamp paper, securing collection of state revenue and a host of other factors which were taken into consideration. E stamping in essence represents a policy initiative formulated by the state. The aforesaid policy decision has neither been assailed nor has it been established to be arbitrary.”“It would be wholly inappropriate for the Court to frame any direction commanding the State to continue the system of physical stamping in perpetuity,” observed the bench while dismissing the petition.It may be relevant to mention here that the petition was placed before the single bench of Justice Yashwant Varma after the division bench of Justice SP Kesarwani and Justice Ajay Bhanot differed on the issue. Justice SP Kesarwani in his judgment had dismissed the petition while in a separate judgment Justice Ajay Bhanot directed the state government to file a reply in the matter.The judgment was reserved on March 24 and delivered on April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-continuation-of-printing-of-stamps-101618511290960.html

The initiative had been taken to ensure that lesser people arrive at the mosque to clear their doubts during these pandemic times and stay safe from coronavirus. Only a day ago, district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami and senior police officials have sought the help of religious leaders in controlling the spread of Covid-19 among the masses. Ramzan helpline started on April 14 will continue during the holy month between 12 to 4 pm on which members of the Muslim community may call for disposal of their questions from their homes and take advice on religious matters. Besides making calls on helpline numbers, people may also send their queries on WhatsApp numbers 9415253718, 7800714245, 9140367779 and 7007120735. Moreover, questions can also be sent on email id millifoundationalld@gmail.com. Mufti Saif-ur-Rehman said, “Now people do not need to approach him with their questions at the Mosque and instead may call or message on the helpline numbers besides mailing their queries.” He appealed to people to stay home and venture out only when extremely necessary while wearing masks and taking other precautions. People should get them vaccinated and avoid rumours while cooperating with the government in controlling the spread of the global pandemic, he added. As per guidelines issued by the government, only five persons are allowed inside religious places.

In a statement, Jakhar added that the chief minister’s (CM’s) resolve to ensure punishment for those who committed this heinous act is unflinching. He targeted the SAD and the BJP for trying to scuttle the probe by manipulating central agencies. “When the SAD was an ally of the BJP, both tried to suppress the probe through the CBI, but it was the Punjab government which had through legal channels ensured the transfer of case files from CBI to the state to complete the investigations at the earliest,” he said. The PPCC chief said that even now on the high court verdict, the CM has already made it clear that state government would challenge the decision in the Supreme Court to ensure all those guilty of this heinous act of sacrilege are put behind bars. “I will meet the CM to request him to investigate and fix responsibility of anyone found responsible for creating obstacle in the probe. This sensitive case is concerned with religious sentiments of lakhs of people,” he said. Jakhar, while referring to assertions that SIT probe had been completed, said in that case if there is no legal hurdle in filing further appeal, then the report should be made public. He said that people of the state have a right to know at whose behest these incidents were committed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-firing-incidents-punjab-cong-chief-says-govt-will-take-probe-to-logical-conclusion-101618510511366.html

As per the Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) officials, the cloth bag bank has helped in eliminating over 500,000 polythene bags in the city.Depending on the size of the bags, residents could either purchase the bags from the bank at prices ranging between ₹3 and ₹20 or could give old clothes and plastic bottles from their homes to the bank and get cloth bags in exchange for the same.The MCG had set up the cloth bag bank in Nai Basti in Sector 8 on December 14, 2020. The civic body had opened the bank in collaboration with Buland Awaaz Welfare Society — an NGO — amidst the MCG’s growing push for making the city both plastic and polythene free.Kuldeep Singh, MCG brand ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission, said, “We estimate that every cloth bag helps in reducing five polythene bags as they are more durable and sturdier than the former. The bank was opened amidst the MCG’s push for eradicating the use of polythene and plastic in the city, and we have been successful in distributing over 100.000 bags across Gurugram, mainly in sector markets and HUDA markets.”He also said that the MCG’s long-term objective is to set up a cloth bag bank in all its 35 wards in Gurugram, and subsequently in every residential or commercial sector of the city. “The establishment of the state’s first cloth bag bank has not only been successful in curbing polythene carry bags but has also given a boost to self-employment. 31 underprivileged women are also working at the cloth bag bank and earning income for their families. We are aiming to open more such banks in the city,” Singh added.Since its inception, the bank has distributed bags in markets in areas such as Sector 23, Sushant Lok 1, Wazirabad Mandi, Harijan Basti, Sector 46, and Sector 4 among others. Of these, Sushant Lok 1 Vyapar Kendra, Sector 46 market, Sector 4 market, and Sector 23 market are currently under the MCG’s radar. The civic body wants to turn these areas polythene and plastic free. The MCG has banned various types of polythene under the Haryana Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1988, since February 27. The violators would have to pay penalties up to ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-1st-cloth-bag-bank-distributed-over-100-000-bags-in-4-months-101618510271478.html

Office bearers of the apartment owners’ association (AOA) of the society on Thursday alleged that the district administration took up sanitisation of the affected towers only after they submitted a complaint that no sealing or sanitisation was taken up despite detection of 33 positive cases in the past four-five days. However, district administration officials said that they took up sanitisation in the residential society on Thursday and also restricted movement of people as soon as they came to know about the positive cases. Ajnara Integrity has 13 towers with 1,492 flats and is occupied by about 1,250 families. “We submitted a written complaint to the administration officials on Thursday morning and also gave them a list of 33 cases which we found in 13 towers. We suspect that there are more cases in the society, but a few residents are not revealing their health status. We have taken up sanitization of different floors and also requested the residents to restrict their movement,” said KK Yadav, general secretary of Ajnara Integrity AOA. He said that about 250 domestic helps come to the high-rise daily and a testing camp is required for screening of other residents as well. After the complaint was submitted, the district administration on Thursday evening put up a tape at the two of three entry/exit gates. “They have sealed two of three entry/exit gates and asked for restriction of movement. They also took up sanitisation of some towers,” said Neeraj Tyagi, president of AOA. According to the official list of containment zones, the high-rise has only one flat listed having three Covid cases till April 14. “At present, we have a list of only three cases in the high-rise. We have sealed the high-rise and also taken up sanitisation. More comprehensive sanitisation will also be taken up on Saturday. Upon enquiry, we found that many residents have got themselves tested at private labs and these labs have not updated entries on the portal. So, the information could not get to the health department,” said Vipin Kumar, city magistrate and incident commander for containment of the Raj Nagar Extension area. “From Saturday, we will be taking up a comprehensive sanitisation of other high-rises in RNE. Members of the AOAs/RWAs are advised to inform us about positive cases so that we can take up containment and sanitisation activities,” he added. When asked, chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that a testing camp will soon be organised at the high-rise to find out health status of residents.Shailendra Kumar, additional district magistrate (city), who is also the nodal officer for handling the containment zones, said that all required measures will be taken up soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sanitisation-containment-only-after-complaint-alleges-residents-body-of-ghaziabad-highrise-101618510210756.html
15-04-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad extend night curfew hours amid surge in Covid-19 cases, state board exams deferred||Ghaziabad/Noida: Amid an alarming surge in Covid-19 cases, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday extended the night curfew hours in 10 worst-hit districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, and also deferred the state board exams till May 15. District administrations of Ghaziabad and GB Nagar said that they have extended the timing of night restrictions, which will be now from 8pm to 7am, till further orders. Earlier, the night restrictions were from 10pm to 5am till April 17 in the two districts. The directions were issued by UP chief minister for districts having more than 2,000 active cases, and included districts like Lucknow, Prayagraj, and Meerut, among others, the officials said. “The night restrictions will come with immediate effect from 8pm to 7am. This will help us restrict movement of public further. A major proportion of the police force was also deployed for panchayat elections. But the voting was done on Thursday and the police will now be deployed fully to enforce night restrictions and taking up enforcement,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. “Anyone, other than those involved in essential services, will be acted upon in case they violate night restriction timing and other Covid protocols. We will soon take a decision on curbs on weekly markets as well,” he added.The government has also ordered for the closure of all schools in the state till May 15, besides deferring the state board examinations for classes 10 and 12. The UP Board examinations were scheduled to start from May 8.“The new dates for the examinations will be decided in the first week of May after reviewing the Covid-19 situation. For students of classes 1 to 12, offline teaching will remain suspended till May 15 and no examination will take place during this period,” Suhas LY, GB Nagar district magistrate, said, adding that the night curfew restrictions will now begin from 8pm and end at 7am. “It has also been decided to conduct massive random sampling on Noida-Delhi borders from Friday,” he said. Meanwhile, with addition of 538 fresh cases on Thursday, Ghaziabad’s overall tally of infected patients crossed 29,000 and stood at 29,375, which included 104 deaths. Now, the district has 1,723 active cases, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. The members of the traders’ associations said that extension of night curfew timing is vital in present times in order to save lives and check any further spread of infection. “The extended timing of night restrictions would mean that shops, offices and other establishments will close down by 7.30pm. We have also conveyed to our members to fully abide by the new directions. We have also asked our members not to entertain customers coming to shops without wearing mask,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.On Thursday, GB Nagar reported 489 new Covid-19 cases, while one person died due to the infection, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. With fresh cases, the overall tally of infected patients in the district has reached 28,928, which include 2,334 active cases and 98 deaths. The GB Nagar DM said that strict measures are being taken in the crowded areas. “On the basis of the reports, main market of Dankaur and vegetable market of Kasna were sealed on Thursday afternoon for 24 hours by the incident commander concerned. We are also checking the safety measures by different industrial and commercial units in the district,” he said. Meanwhile, the sample positivity rate has further gone up in Ghaziabad. According to figures of the district health department, the sample positivity went up to 2.8% on April 15 with 2,084 test reports turning positive of the total 74,441 in April. The 2.8% positivity rate is the highest since December when it was 2.99%, the officials said. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. “The positivity rate will increase further as spread of infection is on the rise. By extending the night restriction timing, the administration has taken a right step in putting more curbs on movement of public. In present times, the public should also consider that taking all precautions is of utmost importance,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). On April 13 while hearing a PIL, the Allahabad high court in an order said that we need to ensure that there is no unnecessary public movement even during day timings. “We need to restrict public movement at least for a week or 10 days to break the chain... We understand that complete lockdown for weeks together may not be feasible, but looking at the current surge of pandemic, we direct the government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in those districts where spread has increased alarmingly, for at least two weeks or three weeks and at least immediately all public gatherings must be restricted to 50 persons,” the high court said in its order. Meanwhile, Thakur Dhirendra Singh, the BJP MLA from Jewar, tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday. “As per the doctor’s suggestions, I’ve opted for home isolation at my farmhouse,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-extend-night-curfew-hours-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-state-board-exams-deferred-101618510090749.html

Sandeep Bansal, president of the Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Mandal said , “The traders have done what everyone wanted to do. The closure is not as effective as a lockdown, but still, it’s an effective way to stop large gatherings in the markets. They voluntarily closed the major markets of the city from Thursday to Sunday to break the corona chain. All the major markets like Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Aminabad, Mohan Market, Pratap Market, Nazirabad, Alambagh, Chowk, Bhootnath, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar remained closed to break the virus chain. Such voluntary closure without any political reason was seen for the first time.” Sanjay Gupta, president of the Uttar Pradesh Adarsh Vyapar Mandal said, “I am happy to see that traders have selected humanity over money.

The Gurugram Metropolitan Authority (GMDA) had proposed that the NHAI acquire the land and hand it over to the local agency. However, in a letter to GMDA, the NHAI stated that the mandate of the highways authority did now allow for the acquisition of the required parcels for the purpose.“A proposal had come from the side of GMDA in January regarding the acquisition of land on both sides of the Dwarka Expressway and handing it over to GMDA for construction of access roads. This proposal was discussed by the authority and it became clear that NHAI could not hand over the land as it is not a land acquisition authority. We can acquire the land and build this road within a year but handing it over is not in our mandate,” said a senior NHAI official, privy to the matter, who wished anonymity.NHAI officials said that service roads are crucial to provide access to commuters to the highway through the sector-dividing roads in developing sectors. A meeting on the acquisition of this land and the construction of access roads between the two agencies is scheduled for Friday. NHAI officials said that access roads are required along the length of the expressway, as vehicles can’t move directly onto the main carriageways of the access-controlled highway. “Either the NHAI can acquire the land and build it or GMDA can acquire it and build it. We have received only ₹70 crore from the state government for land compensation, while the total amount is close to ₹270 crore,” an official familiar with the matter said.A letter written by the NHAI to GMDA said in the last week of March said, “It is to submit that land is acquired by NHAI under the NH Act for building, maintaining and operation of national highways. There is no provision in the act for acquiring land to hand it over to state government for constructing their roads, which will be in contradiction to public purpose for which the acquisition is intended under the NH Act.”The GMDA, which is the primary agency in the district for planning, developing and maintenance of key infrastructure, however, said that they were constructing a service utility duct on the acquired land but will not be able to comment further on this matter without looking into the details. Jitendra Mittal, chief engineer (infrastructure), GMDA said, “We are undertaking the construction of a service utility duct on plots that have already been acquired. Apart from this, I would not be able to comment, without looking into the details.”Last month, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari conducted a detailed inspection of the Dwarka Expressway project, accompanied by Gurugram Lok Sabha member (MP) Rao Inderjit Singh, and announced a deadline of August 15, 2022, for its completion.The 29-kilometre-long Dwarka Expressway is being developed in four phases and it will connect Kherki Daula and Mahipalpur, in Delhi, on national highway 48 via Dwarka. It will also provide an extension to the IGI Airport through a tunnel. Phase three and four of the project, which fall in Gurugram, are expected to be completed by December 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/not-allowed-to-acquire-transfer-plots-to-gmda-says-highways-authority-101618509433723.html
15-04-2021||Gurugram||Authority plans GIS system to improve air quality, address environmental concerns||In a bid to improve air quality and analyse ecological concerns in the city, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority is working on an environmental and climate monitoring system for micro-level monitoring and better policymaking, officials familiar with the matter said. The system will be deployed in Gurugram and Faridabad and will employ geographical information system (GIS) technology.The GIS technology is a framework for gathering, managing, and analysing data that organises layers of information into visualisations using maps and 3D projections. A network of approximately 200 monitors is likely to be set up by the GMDA for this purpose.Sultan Singh, chief geospatial officer and head of the GIS division for GMDA, said that a system will be worked out to monitor the environment of Gurugram and Faridabad. “We have different data, forecasts to monitor the environment, but the source of this data (meteorological station) is not always close to the specific location, giving us an average and not complete accuracy. So, GMDA is planning to set up appropriate infrastructure like automatic weather monitoring systems, air quality monitoring stations, meteorological stations across Gurugram and Faridabad, based on which micro-level monitoring can be done, leading to better policymaking for the fight against pollution,” said Singh.The agenda for GMDA’s 8th authority meeting, held on April 9, stated, “The GIS applications can be used for modelling water harvesting sites and their selection based on topography with the implementation of new technologies like a continuous dense network of weather stations for effective management of water resources and also for measuring temperature, wind speed, air quality and pollution level. This will help in identifying the areas with less pollution or higher pollution. The reasons may then be identified for pollution and make proper plan for improvement. This will enable the participation of authority and citizens for making the environment better.”The new monitoring systems will be installed after a study of the existing infrastructure and areas where devices are required. Singh said that the number of weather stations in the Gurugram-Faridabad region would be revealed after the survey. Haryana has a total of 14 meteorological centres set up by the India Meteorological Department, located at least 100 kilometres from one another.A senior official of the GMDA, requesting anonymity, said that weather monitoring systems will be installed in grids of 9-10kms under the project. “With monitoring systems in close proximity, we will be able to closely monitor aspects like air quality, humidity, level of pollution. This will further help us in understanding why a particular area is reporting high levels of pollution or if certain areas are doing good work. Over 200 monitoring systems are likely to be installed as part of the project, but it is still being decided as to when work on the ground will start,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/authority-plans-gis-system-to-improve-air-quality-address-environmental-concerns-101618509432010.html

The newly formed MCM cautioned violators regarding encroachments for the first time since its constitution last December and said that teams of officials were constituted for conducting an anti-encroachment drive over the next two weeks. The teams will be handing over notices to violators on the spot and giving them a week to remove the encroachments, said officials.“A meeting was held with enforcement team members and they were issued necessary guidelines. They will be conducting a special survey in the MCM area over a week’s time and give notice to encroachers concerned. If the encroachment is not removed despite the notice, then in the next week, a special campaign will be carried out by the MCM to remove all encroachments. Encroachment will not be tolerated under any circumstance,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), MCM.MCM officials said that they have noticed encroachments mainly in sectors 81, 82, 83, 84, 92, 95, 102 and 110, besides the presence of unauthorised vegetable and fruit markets across the city. The MCM, earlier this week, demolished around 25 illegal structures with the help of earthmovers.The MCM was formed by the Haryana government in December last year, following demands of residents in newer sectors and factory owners.MCG removes encroachment near Sadar BazarThe Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) removed encroachments between Bada Bazar, located next to Sadar Bazar, and Mor Chowk in Civil Lines on Thursday.

15-04-2021||Gurugram||Car thefts: Alertness of cops at checkpoints tested||Senior officials of the Gurugram police said they are taking measures to curb rising car thefts in the city by testing the preparedness of the personnel deployed at checkpoints during the night. Officials said that the success rate of personnel on the ground in spotting stolen cars increased to 80% so far in April, from 20% in March, in an initiative wherein a car bearing the registration number of a stolen vehicle is driven through checkpoints.Officials said that teams performing poorly in the test were warned of strict action, as the city is witnessing at least three car thefts per day, with as many as 299 car thefts reported till March. Last year, 268 vehicles were stolen till March, as per the data available with the police.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “We planned this exercise and hired private cars. We informed the police control room and shared the registration number of the car, which, we said, was stolen.”Rao said that during the initial days of the initiative, launched in the second week of March, the cars passed through without much trouble, despite the information being relayed by the control room. “We started taking action, following which the teams became alert and started checking suspected vehicles,” he said.The city police decided to crack the whip on vehicle thieves, as the number of thefts continued to rise. More than 50 people from Nuh, Faridabad, Delhi and Rajasthan, were arrested from January to March for stealing cars.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that gangs involved in the crimes often are from nearby districts and the vehicles are mostly sold in northeastern states and Uttar Pradesh at knockdown prices. “We are equipped with the latest technology, GPS and wireless communication devices, which are provided to officials deployed throughout the night at 147 spots, and in 79 police control room vans and 123 patrol bikes,” he said.Officials said that for the exercise, they are analysing the spots through crime mapping analytics and predictive system, which accesses real time data from the police control room.Rao said that a cop calls the control room claiming to be a robbery victim and shares the direction the car was taken in, following which the control room relays the same to the personnel deployed closest to the spot. “Even the colour of the car and description is shared to make it easy to identify the car, despite which they were not able to get hold of the drivers, initially,” said Rao.Rao said that teams deployed at as many as 74 of the 114 police posts were warned over their poor performance, while 40 teams were rewarded for spotting the stolen vehicles. On repeated failure, personnel were shuffled and some even sent to Police Lines, following which fresh deployment was processed for the spots, said Rao.Rao said that the exercise not only checks the alertness of the personnel but also the response time to crimes. “The force needs to be attentive and ensure it is doing its best. People have high hopes from the police and if we delay in taking action, their faith in us will weaken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/car-thefts-alertness-of-cops-at-checkpoints-tested-101618509373681.html
15-04-2021||Noida||Man arrested for distribution of liquor to woo voters||Greater Noida: Days ahead of the panchayat polls in Gautam Budh Nagar district, police on Thursday arrested a 32-year-old person for allegedly distributing liquor to voters at a village in Greater Noida. The suspect was identified as Mukesh Bhati alias Mukki, 32, a resident of Nangla Nainsukh village in Dadri. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Dadri police and Noida STF on Thursday received information that someone is distributing liquor to voters in Nangla Naisukh. “A joint team reached the spot and arrested Mukesh with five cartons of illegal liquor. As many as 250 liquor bottles were in the cartons which were smuggled from Haryana,” he said. Raj Kumar Mishra, additional SP (Noida STF), said that besides the liquor consignment, the police team also recovered a countrymade gun, two live cartridges, and ₹10,000 from the suspect’s possession. According to Mishra, the investigation revealed that Mukesh is brother of Manoj Bhati, a sharpshooter of Randeep Bhati gang. Manoj’s wife Sundri Devi is contesting election for zila panchayat member from ward no. 4 in Greater Noida, he said. The panchayat elections in GB Nagar will be held on April 19.“Manoj is presently in Luksar jail and he has over 40 criminal cases. Mukesh had bought the liquor from Haryana and he was distributing it to local people,” Mishra said. A case has been registered against Mukesh under sections 60 and 63 of the Excise Act.

15-04-2021||Gurugram||Unable to find alternative sites for landfill, say MCG officials||A week after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the state government to closely monitor the waste remediation process at Bandhwari landfill, officials on Thursday said that they have hit a roadblock in finding an alternative landfill site due to “not in my backyard syndrome”. Officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that waste remediation is being done at the landfill site and it (treatment capacity) is being expanded gradually. However, they are unable to find an alternative site for a landfill, with residents protesting plans or filing petitions in courts.Sites were previously identified in Farrukhnagar and Sihi of Gurugram last year, but waste disposal could not be started at these sites due to public protests. Thereafter, over the last month, refuse-derived fuel was being temporarily stored on a plot near the Pali crusher zone in Faridabad, but it was stopped after officials learnt that there is status quo on the plot by the high court.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “The problem is of a site which is saturated due to legacy waste and continuous dumping of fresh waste. As per the directions of NGT, legacy waste is being processed but fresh waste is also being dumped. To delink fresh waste from legacy waste, multiple efforts have been made to identify an alternative site, but at all the places we were met with resistance. The corporation wants to resolve the issue, but residents are affected with this syndrome called ‘not in my backyard’.”Officials said that at present, they have over 50,000 metric tonnes of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) ready for processing at either a cement plant or brick kiln. The official said that it is taking time to process RDF as there is “no cement plant nearby and waste-to-energy plants in Delhi, that could have used the RDF, are already saturated.” Meanwhile, RDF was being temporarily stored at a plot near the Pali crusher zone in Faridabad, but due to ongoing litigation in the high court over the plot ownership, storage has been stopped. At present, officials of the MCG have sought clearances from the forest department for setting up a solid waste management plant on the Aravalli forest land.In a report submitted to the NGT on April 5, the MCG said, “…land measuring 92 acres in the revenue estate of Gothra Mohabatabad, district Faridabad is also under consideration for the SWM plant. The ownership of land belongs to Municipal Corporation, Faridabad and is protected by sections 4 & 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act -1900 and is categorized as Aravalli Plantation area. The process to obtain environment clearance has been also initiated by MCF.”The report further stated, “Drone survey of the site has been conducted and it has been decided to engage reputed institutions such as IIT, NEERI etc. to conduct a survey and prepare detailed project report for fresh waste processing facility within two months in coordination with municipal corporations of Gurugram and Faridabad. This facility is planned to operate till commissioning of a waste-to-energy plant in October 2023.” However, citizens engaged in waste management activities in the city said that instead of searching for an alternative site to store waste, an integrated solid waste management approach at the ward level may help the situation. Ruchika Sethi Takkar, a resident working for proper waste management in the city, said, “In this crisis (of finding alternative landfill sites) lies an opportunity to give Gurugram a scientific waste management system, by setting a goal of at least 75% landfill diversion through mandatory recycling and composting or biogas ordinances. A waste reduction hierarchy must be adopted as a chief operating principle that is to prevent waste, reduce and reuse first and then recycle or compost.” She said, “An integrated solid waste management approach is required in all 35 wards for managing the total waste through a combination of composting units and biogas plants for treating the organic matter, which is roughly 60% -65% of the waste. The rest of the dry waste can be collected separately for recycling or processing. This will automatically reduce the load on landfills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/unable-to-find-alternative-sites-for-landfill-say-mcg-officials-101618509371458.html

According to the statement, from now on, maximum 200 people can attend public functions in open spaces, and maximum 50 in indoor events. Also, only 20 people attend funerals.On Thursday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed the district administration to focus on implementation of the coronavirus safeguards strictly, while imposing curbs on gatherings. The state government had also issued an official statement on this.Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said on Thursday, “There will be a curtail in public gatherings in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. The number of people allowed in open spaces is 200, and 50 in closed spaces. The economic activities will continue as before, but everyone will have to follow Covid-19 safeguards strictly to prevent the spread of the virus.”CM Khattar had issued these directions while holding a meeting in Chandigarh with senior officials, deputy commissioners, and health department officials through video conferencing. The CM also directed the police to enforce mask discipline, and social distancing among the people. He asked urban local bodies and district administrations to focus on contact tracing, sanitisation, and better enforcement of micro-containment zones, according to the officials, privy to the meeting.The CM had indicated during the meeting that there is no plan to impose lockdown like last year “to keep the economic cycle running”. “The economic activity had stalled due to the lockdown last year, which took about six months to get back on track. Therefore, we have to keep in mind that the economic cycle should keep going in the state, and that no one is adversely affected,” Khattar had said during the meeting.He also directed all the deputy commissioners to issue an advisory in their respective districts to ensure that night-time ceremonies, including Navaratri programmes, be conducted during the day.The officials, privy to the meeting, said that the CM directed the police department and other civic agencies to impose penalties for not wearing masks and violating social distancing. “The police department was asked to take strict action against the violators and issue challans, and also distribute masks among the people. The urban local bodies and district administrations have been asked to focus on contact tracing, improving sanitisation, and manage micro-containment zones in a better way,” said an official, who was at the meeting.Haryana health minister Anil Vij, who also attended the meeting, said that the government wants to deal with the coronavirus situation with strictness, instead of imposing lockdown in the state. “We can withstand the resentment of people by acting strictly but cannot see people dying. The virus is more aggressive this time,” Vij said.The CM has also reached out to the farmers and asked them to withdraw their movement on humanitarian grounds. If they want to hold protests for their demands, they can do it when the situation improves, he said, adding that the deputy commissioners have been directed to contact the agitating farmers, and try to persuade them.Meanwhile, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the health departments across the state were asked to increase testing and vaccination, and boost the health care facilities in terms of general beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. “Gurugram is already testing over 10,000 people per day, but in line with the directions, we will try to increase the testing numbers. The session sites for vaccinations will also be increased,” said Yadav, adding that the health department is working closely with the district administration to expand testing and vaccine outreach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/200-allowed-for-open-gatherings-50-for-indoor-events-haryana-govt-101618509370661.html

They had to reopen in Srinagar on May 10. However, the spike in Covid cases prompted Sinha to defer the bi-annual exercise.The exercise was introduced by the princely rulers of the erstwhile state during the regime of the then Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1872 to escape extreme heat during summer in Jammu and the biting cold winters in Srinagar.In a series of posts on his official Twitter handle, the L-G relayed the information to people.“As J&K is witnessing surge in Covid cases, the threat it poses to people/staff on the move and implementation of e-Office in both the secretariat, in move offices, it has been decided to defer the #DarbarMove this time,” Sinha had tweeted.The secretariat will function in Srinagar as well as Jammu with staff equitably split between both locations.Lakhanpur Covid control measures reviewedMeanwhile, Jammu divisional commissioner Dr Raghav Langer on Thursday visited Lakhanpur corridor — the gateway to J&K, to take stock of Covid control measures and other amenities for inbound travellers.Langer called upon the officers to keep high degree of vigil and ensure strict adherence to the SOPs at Lakhanpur in view of recent surge in Covid cases.He directed Lakhanpur authorities to strengthen the staff at the control room to ensure testing of all incoming travellers.It was decided that testing of travellers going to Samba, Jammu, Reasi and Udhampur will be done at Thandi Khui in Samba, whereas rest of the travellers have to undergo Covid testing at Lakhanpur entry point.He also directed the Kathua DC to make adequate arrangements for isolation, administrative quarantine and notify paid quarantine facilities for proper handling of Covid positive cases.He called for keeping full track of all travellers and ensure mandatory disclosure of relevant information by all inbound travellers in Lakhanpur.“Only those with negative RT-PCR testing report not older by 48-hours will be exempted for testing in Lakhanpur,” Langer said.Provision of backup for uninterrupted electricity at Lakhanpur facilitation centre, proper cleanliness and a dedicated ambulance for Lakhanpur and other amenities were among the issues discussed during the visit.Later, Langer inspected a 70-bedded Covid care centre established at Kharote and directed CMO Kathua to make all necessary steps for proper care of Covid patients as per protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-spike-in-covid-cases-l-g-defers-bi-annual-darbar-move-to-srinagar-101618506611342.html

15-04-2021||Ranchi||Death toll rises eight times in 15 days across Jharkhand||Covid-19 toll is soaring alarmingly in Jharkhand with death rate rising by eight times in a fortnight as compared to the state’s total figure reported in March. Similarly, the cases rose by more than five times in two weeks compared to the previous month. An analysis of the Covid-19 bulletin issued by the state health department shows that as many as 179 people lost lives due to Coronavirus disease between April 1 and April 14. In entire March month, merely 23 people infected with Covid-19 had died. Scarier is the fact that as many as 100 people died in just past four days (from April 11 to April 14) due to the deadly virus. As far as cases are concerned, the state had registered 4,252 Covid cases in entire March month, while 23,591 cases have been recorded in just 14 days (from April 1 to April 14) this month. The state recorded highest cases of the year on Wednesday with 3,198 people found infected with coronavirus, while 31 people lost lives due to the disease, as per the Covid-19 bulletin. Medical experts warned that the situation would turn more alarming if stern restrictions and precautions were not taken immediately. Ranchi president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Sambhu Singh said there are many reasons behind increasing death toll that include massive violation of Covid protocol, change in viral variant and mismanagement of health care facilities. “We see everyday, many people have been dying due to the virus in want of treatment. People are running one hospital to another hospital but beds are not available, particularly the oxygen supported and ICU beds. Hospital management has turned bad to worse. Hospitals are facing shortage of anti-viral medicines. Mismanagement of health system has also caused rise in death rate,” he said. Singh said, “The new variant of the virus is deadlier. Violation of Covid protocols such as social distancing and use of mask and absence of strict restrictions in crowded places, the virus is transmitting very fast. The second wave of the pandemic is more dangerous for persons with comorbidity. Now, only complete lockdown could improve the situation or it will turn worse.” Due to high death rate in past few days, Ranchi’s cremation ground is over-burdened. Ranchi’s saw cremation of 52 Covid-19 infected persons on Monday night at temporary cremation ground in Ghagra due to sudden breakdown of the gas-based cremation machine at Muktidham in Ranchi’s Harmu on Sunday morning. The cremation developed technical snag due to over-burden, officials at Ranchi Municipal Corporation said. Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra said the burners of cremation machine have got damaged, which would be replaced in next two-three days. Twenty eight bodies were cremated on Tuesday, while 22 bodies were cremated on Wednesday at Ghagra. Ranchi sub-divisional officer (SDO) Utkarsh Gupta said Ranchi is having state tertiary care hospital, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences. “Critical patients from all districts across the state are treated here. If any Covid-19 infected person from any district of the state dies in Ranchi, his/her cremation will be done here following Covid protocol. But, the Covid case/death will be counted in their respective district’s record,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/death-toll-rises-eight-times-in-15-days-across-jharkhand-101618505890258.html
15-04-2021||Patna||Bihar: After long wait, work on SAV campus set to begin||Eleven years after its establishment, for Simultala Awasiya Vidyalay (SAV), billed as Bihar’s answer to undivided state’s pride Netarhat Vidyalay, things have finally started moving for the institution. After the belated finalization of the service condition of its teachers and non-teaching staff, the government is also contemplating to soon lay the foundation stone for its own sprawling campus in Simultala. Officials said chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar may do it online in view of spike in Covid-19 cases. Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said, “The government will soon decide the date for the foundation laying of the school.” Since its inception in 2010, the boarding school, with an annual intake of 120 students (60 boys and 60 girls) through statewide screening test, has been running from rented buildings having prefab structures, though the SAV project was to be initially completed by March 2012. EdCIL— a public sector undertaking under the Union ministry of education— had also prepared its detailed project report for construction on the 46-acre mostly procured via donation from locals and earmarked for another proposed school Gautam Awasiya Vidyalay (GAV). Later, it was handed over to the SAV Education Society. SAV society had superseded the proposed GAV. However, it was decided to build the campus on a different site and the government acquired around 25 acres for it. “The acquisition process is almost complete,” said Jamui district magistrate Avaneesh Kumar Singh. The foundation laying, which was earlier tentatively scheduled this week, could be extended in view of the pandemic. On August 9, 2010 also, the CM had inaugurated the school via video conferencing. Despite deficiencies in infrastructure, the school has been able to prove its credentials in Class 10 Board exams. In its debut class 10 board exams in 2015, 19 SAV students had secured more than 96% , a record since the inception of the Bihar board in 1952. A year later, all the 42 students in the top 10 were from SAV, while in 2017, 12 of the 22 students in top 10 were from the same school. In 2018, out of 24 students in top 10, 17 were from SAV, while in 2019 SAV accounted for 16 of the 18 in the top 10. Last year, however, only three of the SAV students could figure in the top 10 having 41 students, while this year its 13 students figured in the list of 101 students in the top 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharafter-long-wait-work-on-sav-campus-set-to-begin-101618505770222.html

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by additional chief secretary (industry) Brajesh Mehrotra and attended by Deepak Kumar, principal secretary to the chief minister, divisional commissioner Sanjay Agarwal and Patna district magistrate Chandrasekhar Singh, besides 50 representatives of private hospitals and four owners of oxygen refueling plants.Patna divisional commissioner was asked to procure all the empty oxygen cylinders for their refilling to meet the growing demand in the state capital, which is worst hit in the state by the pandemic.Patna district magistrate Chandrasekhar Singh was also asked to arrange gas/liquid tankers. As the pandemic situation worsens across the country, the Centre has started mapping states with greater need of oxygen. Though oxygen production in the country is more than the demand, the challenge lies in ensuring smooth supply to needy states. Meanwhile, reports from several parts of the state capital suggested that private hospitals refused to admit Covid patients mainly due to shortage of oxygen cylinders needed for seriously infected patients as the virus affects lungs and makes it difficult to breathe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-decides-to-divert-oxygen-for-industrial-use-to-hospitals-101618505719985.html

The development comes following talks between ECI and SEC in New Delhi on Thursday.Sources said ECI has assured the state poll panel that it would provide EVMs ( models that are used in assembly and parliamentary polls) based on availability of the voting machines , a proposition the SEC is now open to. “We have discussed the option of using EVMs used by ECI in assembly and general polls. It is a viable option and we will now work on it.The talks have been positive and we feel the panchayat polls would now be conducted at the earliest through EVMs,” said Yogendra Ram, secretary, SEC, on phone from New Delhi. Sources said ECI and SEC representatives held several round of talks on Wednesday and Thursday where all issues regarding procuring of multi-post EVMs model B-3 SSDM from the ECIL (Electronic Corporation of India Limited), Bangalore, were discussed. But the proposition was not found feasible as the ECIL has expressed its inability to provide as many as 15,000 multi-post EVMs of B-3 model in a short time owing to difficulties being faced in importing some equipment due to restrictions owing to Corona pandemic, sources said. “ECIL has communicated it would take at least several months to provide EVMs as per specifications by SEC . That would inordinately delay the panchayat polls. This is why we feel it is feasible to use general EVMs that would be made available by ECI,” said a senior SEC functionary. The task of holding panchayat polls through simple EVMs is said to be more challenging since polling station would require at least six EVMs for the six posts to which election would be held., which means a few lakh EVMs in the state. “There are logistics involved. All these points would be put before the Commission,” said the SEC secretary. In February this year, the SEC had filed a writ petition in the Patna High Court seeking judicial remedy over the ECI’s reluctance in giving permission to ECIL, Bangalore, to provide multi-post EVMs. The court, during the last two hearings, had ordered that both poll panels settle the matter amicably, even as the case is still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ec-state-poll-panel-break-evm-deadlock-for-panchayat-polls-101618505719155.html

While cell phones, on which an intended vaccination beneficiary receives notifications, are not allowed in jails, Aadhar cards are not collected when a person is jailed. The computer software being used for vaccination registration seeks these details as mandatory.In Bihar, there are more than 55,000 prisoners lodged in different jails, of which 25,000 are aged above 45 years and hence eligible for vaccination in the current phase. The problem was encountered when a medical team reached Shahid Khudi Ram Bose Central Jail in Muzaffarpur to administer vaccine to inmates at the initiative of jail superintendent Rajiv Kumar Singh. There are more than 1,700 inmates at the jail, of which 800 are aged 45 years or above.“But the team had to return as the registration of jail inmates for vaccination could not take place since the computer software fails mandates furnishing of mobile numbers and Aadhar numbers. We can’t proceed further due to these two important data requirement for the registration,” civil surgeon Dr SK Chaudhury said, adding that he has informed jail authorities of this technical issue.The jail superintendent said he has written his superiors seeking their direction in this regard. Inspector general (prisons) Mithilesh Mishra said the issue was serious as Covid infected persons were also being taken to jails on judicial remand. “I have sent an SOS to the state police headquarter seeking their intervention as rules don’t permit us to allow inmates to carry their cell phones with them in the jail premises. Even their Aadhar card is not taken at the time of their entry into the prison,” he said.Social distancing is hardly possible in jails where 40-50 inmates share a ward, which, jail officials say, could lead to a serious situation if the inmates were not vaccinated at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-of-jail-inmates-hits-technical-hurdle-101618505650198.html

State capital Patna, the worst affected, with a cumulative death toll of 486 and case load of 66,913 out of Bihar’s 3.01 lakh cases and 1,675 deaths so far, breached all previous records, when it reported 2,105 cases, the highest in a day so far. Patna contributed to 10,068 active cases in Bihar’s 29,078 on Thursday. All 50 beds, which the AIIMS-Patna increased during the day, were filled up in a couple of hours. The AIIMS had now increased its bed capacity to 200, with the state government pushing it to scale it up to 250. Similarly, the 50 ICU beds, which were made operational at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) were also filled up in quick time. Meanwhile, the state government had decided to convert its 750-bed Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. It was declared a Covid-19 dedicated hospital, along with AIIMS-Patna, last year too. “We have decided to convert the NMCH into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital,” said state health minister Mangal Pandey. He said the IGIMS would add another 100 beds for COvid-19 patients in the next three days. Pandey had also instructed the department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen, amid reports of shortage of oxygen at some private nursing homes and clinics. Amrit held discussions with the industries department in this connection. Some private facilities like Sai Hospital and Satyabrat Hospital at Kankerbagh locality in Patna reported of shortage of oxygen on Wednesday. Sources said the crisis had arisen as one of the three suppliers in Patna had shut its unit for two days due to maintenance. Meanwhile, Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, who held a meeting with oxygen suppliers and hospital representatives, had instructed suppliers to make available 90% of their supply to hospitals. He asked the three suppliers — Usha Air Products Ltd, Bypass Road Sipara; Patliputra Industrial Gases Private Limited, Sabalpur, Deedarganj; and Banshi Air Gas Private Ltd at Fatuha — to ensure regular supply of oxygen so that there was no scarcity. Singh also advised all hospitals and nursing homes not to hoard any oxygen cylinder and take them as per their daily requirement to ensure seamless supply as its demand had peaked with a spike in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of days. He also deputed a magistrate at each of the three supply centres to monitor supply to hospitals and ensure there was no hoarding and blackmarketing. The district administration had also sealed a private engineering coaching institute at Kankerbagh, which was functioning despite government’s instructions to keep them closed and was also not conforming to Covid-19 norms. Around 200 students were crammed in two rooms when the raiding party visited the institute on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/24-dead-in-24-hours-nmch-is-a-covid-hospital-again-101618505290152.html

The PMC, on Thursday, has floated a tender for water supply through tankers to these 11 villages.The Khadakwasla Irrigation department, meanwhile, has issued a letter to the PMC pointing out excessive use of water. In 2017, the state government merged 11 fringe villages with the PMC. The area under PMC’s jurisdiction before the delimitation exercise was 250 sqkm, which was increased to 333 sqkm with the inclusion of the 11 villages.The state government is also finalising the process of merging 23 more villages, following which the local area of the PMC will increase to 518 sqkm. The population of the 11 newly-merged villages is 0.278 million as per the 2011 census and after the merger of 23 villages, there will be addition of another 0.5 million. The corporation has raised demand of 18.50 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water from the Khadakawasla Iirrigation division. At present, the corporation is getting 11.50 TMC of water from Khadakwasla.After the merger of 11 villages, PMC supplied two TMC of water every year to these areas, 80 per cent of which was through tankers.Pune irrigation department’s chief superintendent engineer, S D Chopade, has written a letter to PMC as regards the controlled usage of water in the city.According to the letter, PMC is getting 1460 million litres per day (MLD) of water from Khadakwasla. Now, PMC is also getting 100 to 150 MLD of water from the Bhama-Askhed dam. The PMC water supply department, in its reply to the irrigation department has stated that it has reduced water usage from 1,460 MLD to 1,380 MLD. Manisha Shekatkar, executive engineer of the water supply department, said, “We need around 2 TMC water to supply to 11 merged villages. However, we don’t have enough water or a distribution system to supply water through tap. So, we are supplying tankers to the merged villages and every year, we are spending ₹10 crore for that. It is a very difficult situation.” “Besides that, now another 23 villages are coming into the PMC limits. The water supply problem will become more critical. We have demanded 18.50 TMC of water, but the decision is still pending,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-floats-tenders-for-tanker-water-supply-to-11-merged-villages-101618498569449.html

Citizens allege this has been done to stop people from taking photographs of the number of bodies being consigned to flames at the site. Some videos of bodies being burnt were in circulation on social media platforms on Wednesday, allegedly exposing the number of deaths due to the pandemic.“More than 630 cremations have taken place in the city over the last 10 days. As many as 97 bodies were brought to Bhainsakund and Gulalaghat cremation sites on Wednesday. On Tuesday, these sites received 87 bodies,” said Ashutosh Varma, spokesperson of the Samajwadi Party (SP).“On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, tokens were issued for the cremation of bodies and there is no place for the dead at the cremation ground and no beds for patients in hospitals,” he claimed.He added, “Blocking the view of Bhainsakund crematorium is a blatant attempt to conceal the real number of bodies being brought for cremation. Instead of hiding facts, the state government should focus on improving health facilities and saving lives.”Even Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted about tin sheets covering Bhainsakund cremation ground. “Instead of wasting time, resources and energy on hiding the tragedy, please take steps to control the pandemic. Take concrete steps to check the pandemic, this is call of time,” she tweeted.“In Ahmedabad, they had built a wall to hide slum area from Trump. Now they are covering a crematorium in UP to hide sight of burning bodies of COVID patients,” read a tweet by Sandeep Singh, roving journalist. “Lucknow has seen a sudden spurt in Covid cases. In the last one week, over 20,000 Covid cases have been reported from the state capital. For the last few days, Covid count has been over 5,000 per day,” said Girish Mishra, corporator of Congress. However, municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “Only the Covid cremation area has been barricaded from the non Covid cremation area. This has been done on the advice of experts.”“As a number of Covid positive bodies are also being cremated traditionally, barricading of the Covid area was essential,” he added.“The segregation is to separate the Covid area from non Covid area. Don’t you think it’s necessary? Some see a problem everywhere. There is no point in doing politics on bodies,” said Harish Srivastava, spokesman, UP BJP.Munna, who cremates bodies at the electric crematorium, said: “We are working till late at night. But last week from Wednesday to Sunday, we worked 24x7. Things are better managed now as 50 more platforms for traditional cremation have come up at the site.”Labourers hired to shift bodiesIn wake of more bodies being brought to the cremation site, the LMC has hired 100 labourers on contract to shift the infected bodies from buses to the cremation platforms. As no one accompanies many of these infected bodies, these workers do the needful. Fifty labourers are working in two shifts, said the municipal commissioner. Extra platforms for cremation“These labourers are provided PPE kits, gloves and sanitisers for protection. The corporation also raised 50 extra platforms for the cremation of bodies at Bhainsakund and Gulalaghat,” he added.There was a shortage of wood at the site on Friday, Saturday and Sunday due to an increase in the number of bodies, but after that LMC regularised supply of wood at the cremation ground, said Pandit Narendra Mishra, who performs last rites in a traditional way. Blaze in waiting area of BhainsakundThere was a blaze in the waiting area between platform no. 3 and 4 at the Bhainsakund crematorium on Thursday noon, after a plastic sheet caught fire. But no one was injured in the incident.“The sheet caught fire after a pyre was lit up on platform no, 4. The plastic sheet was installed between these two platforms to create a waiting area for people who come with a body. The fire started around 3pm and it was controlled by 5.30pm,” said Mahendra Mishra ‘Sonu’, the priest at platform no. 3 and 4. Ram Nagina Tripathi, chief engineer, rubbish removal department at LMC stated, “This minor fire is a big lesson for us. Fortunately, no one was injured. Now, we will arrange fire hydrants at the site. The place has no shortage of water so having fire hydrants would not be a problem. In future, use of plastic sheet would also be avoided. We will try to increase the height of the roof and use material which is fire proof.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tin-walls-set-up-to-block-view-of-cremation-site-in-lucknow-101618497854096.html

We have also appointed flying squads who are ensuring Remdesivir reaches the hospitals,” said Vijay Deshmukh, additional collector Pune. “Supply is low, but we are trying for the equitable distribution,” added Deshmukh.Due to the non-availablity of Remdesivir, the plight of patients’ relatives is not getting better. “My father is hospitalised in Saksham hospital, Kalewadi. The hospital administration said that the government will give us the injections. We don’t want to protest, but there is no option left. Today’s the third day I am standing in the line for this injection. People are buying it for much higher prices in black,” said the daughter of a Covid patient, part of the protest on Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/relatives-of-covid-patients-unable-to-procure-remdesivir-protest-in-front-of-collector-s-office-101618496589299.html

15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Scientists predict record wheat production this season||The wheat production in the country this Rabi season may break all records to touch 112 million tonnes, predict scientists of the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR), Karnal. Even as the Union government is yet to give third estimate, the scientists are hopeful that the wheat production will cross 112 million tonnes (MT) against 107.06 million tonnes of the previous year.Interestingly, the production estimate for Punjab is marginally lower than the grain state had produced last season, while it has gone up slightly in Haryana.Agriculture experts say besides favourable weather conditions in major wheat-producing states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, another major factor behind this prediction is that the area under wheat cultivation has also reported an increase of around 5% or 1.5 million hectares in states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Haryana, taking it to 31.3 million hectare this year. As per the estimates, the government has set a target of procuring 135 lakh tonnes from Madhya Pradesh, 130 lakh tonnes from Punjab, 80 lakh tonnes from Haryana , 55 lakh tonnes from UP and 22 lakh tonnes from Rajasthan.According to Dr Gyanendra Pratap Singh, director of IIWBR, “As per our estimates, there is a strong possibility that the wheat production in country may break all previous records.” He said the prediction is based on several factors, including an increase in the acreage in several states, favourable weather conditions, development of high yielding varieties like HD-2967, HD-3086 and DBW-187 and efforts of farmers and scientists.Moreover, the agriculture experts are of the view that Minimum Support Price, currently ₹1,975 per quintal, is also a reason behind increase in wheat acreage.Dr Narender Goyal of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Damla in Yamunanagar district, said wheat crop was very healthy this year even though hot weather in February had affected yield in some parts, but the overall production of wheat is good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/scientists-predict-record-wheat-production-this-season-101618495997694.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||3 decades on, Kashmir’s Wular gets fresh lease||A major portion of Wular, Asia’s second largest freshwater lake on the foothills of the Khuehami and Ajaz forest ranges of Kashmir, looks placid and serene. The action is in the distance as five hi-tech cutter suction dredgers besides long and short boom excavators dig out silt deposited over decades. Dozens of workers from across the country are on the job 24x7, cleaning the lake metre by metre as the project to restore its lost glory nears completion before the June deadline. Equipped with helmets, gloves and special shoes, the workers operate the machines unmindful of the slush as they lay pipes inside the lake. Officials say 48.94 lakh cubic metres of silt has been removed. “We’ve been at it even during subzero conditions. Snow, rain or shine, work doesn’t stop here. This is why we are ahead of schedule,” says Neeraj Mishra, the operational head of Reach Dredging Limited, a Kolkata-based company working to increase the holding capacity of the lake. “At present, more than 300 people, including non-locals, are engaged at the eight project sites,” he says, showing the desiltation process being undertaken by the dredgers deep inside the lake. A kilometre away, another group of workers cuts down willow trees that have grown inside the lake and threaten to choke it. Wular has been Kashmir’s saviour during floods with its vast water-carrying capacity that got reduced due to silt and willow plantation over a period of time. The willow plantation altered the hydrological process of the wetland and acted as barrier to silt laden waters of the Jhelum river. As many as 99,162 trees have been axed and auctioned and 16.76 lakh saplings have been planted in the catchment area. Shallow lake in deep waters The shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.8 metres covers 130 sqkm and is spread over two districts of North Kashmir. It provides 60% of the Valley’s fish produce and is home to lakhs of local and migratory bird species. Known for water chestnuts and lotus stems, the lake is the lifeline of the 30 villages surrounding it. It was designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in 1990. Officials of the Wular Conservation and Management Authority (Wucma) are upbeat as the first phase of desiltation will be complete by June. “The first part of the restored portion is ahead of schedule,” says Irfan Rasool Wani, the Wucma coordinator. “This lake serves as a hydrostat, absorbing moisture during the peak months and releasing it in the lean winter months. It’s a flood sink since the water that drains from the catchment areas of the Jhelum river falls into Wular,” he says. Over the past three decades, Wular had been losing its carrying capacity due to plantation and encroachment. The water quality deteriorated after untreated sewage and solid waste was disposed in it, while the inlet and outlet channels were blocked and forest degradation in the catchment areas added to the problem. Work in progress on fast pace since 2020 Wucma was set up for the lake’s conservation in September 2012 but it’s only since May last year that work picked up pace. A sum of ₹200 crore is being spent under the UT’s fund for developing ecotourism in the first phase, while the total tentative cost of project is ₹1,600 crore. Besides land and water resource management, the authority will work for biodiversity conservation, eco tourism, construction of a shoreline around the lake, recreational parks, bird watching points and developing the Wular Boulevard. At present, the first phase of the lake’s demarcation is nearing completion. “We have installed 1,159 geotagged boundary pillars around the lake using GIS technology,” he says. Wucma assistant engineer Mohammad Ashraf says though this project was launched a decade ago, desilting was done by small JCBs and manually. “For the first time last year, we started desiltation with hi-tech dredgers. In this phase, we had to clear 3.1sqkm we and have completed 2.27 sqkm. We have to take out 63 lakh cubic metres of silt from this portion and are done with 48.94 lakh cubic metres.” Villagers demand compensation for demolition Abdul Majeed Dar, a resident of Banyari, says 300 houses are being demolished in his village alone and the government compensation is unlikely as villagers are being blamed for encroachment. “The government should compensate all those whose houses are being demolished as they have lived here for decades,” says Dar. Environmentalist Jalal Jeelani welcomes the restoration of Wular but says the size of the lake’s catchment area is unprecedented. “A holistic approach is needed. Merely clearing a few stretches is insufficient. Reclaim encroachments and involve people in conservation efforts,” he says. Wani says, “In records, 34 hectares of lake land has been encroached upon and most of it is in the shape of plantations.” IN A NUTSHELLSpread over 130sqkm covering two districts of north Kashmir, Wular is the only drainage for the Jhelum, Arin and Madhumati water bodies. It serves as the lifeline for hydro projects during the lean period for power generation on the Jhelum river. 27.73 sqkm is a critically silted area in different parts of Wular. All critical areas will be desilted over three phases. Eight areas are being covered in the first phase. The lake is one of the 42 Indian wetlands designated as a Ramsar site.  ₹200 crore is being spent under the UT’s fund for developing ecotourism in the first phase, while the total tentative cost of project is ₹1,600 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-decades-on-kashmir-s-wular-gets-fresh-lease-101618493229788.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana squeezes number of people at gatherings||With the Covid-19 infection hitting Haryana with vengeance, the BJP-JJP coalition government on Thursday further squeezed the number of people who can assemble in outdoor and indoor functions while imposing the restriction of 20 people in funerals. “It has been decided that from now on, not more than 200 people can gather in open spaces during public functions and not more than 50 in indoor functions. Similarly, not more than 20 people will be able to attend funerals,” an official spokesperson said. Earlier, beginning April 5, the state government had announced fresh guidelines for indoor and outdoor gatherings, besides funerals. While the gathering at funerals had been restricted to 50 people, at indoor events, 50% of the hall capacity and not more than 200 people were allowed to assemble. For outdoor functions, the state government had decided to allow 500 people to assemble. Thursday’s decision to impose stricter curbs comes a day after Haryana recorded 5,398 fresh cases, the highest ever single day surge in new cases ever since the pandemic broke out last year. Presiding over a meeting to review Covid-19 cases and vaccination in Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said this time the spread of Covid-19 started from educational institutions. He directed all the deputy commissioners to issue advisory in their respective districts to ensure that night-time ceremonies should be shifted to the day time and the Navratra programmes be held during the day. He appealed to the people of the state to only leave their homes only if necessary and to wear masks, use sanitiser and maintain social distancing whenever they go out of the house. He said that there is proper arrangement of oxygen, ventilators and beds in the state and people need not panic. During the meeting, home and health minister Anil Vij said there are two ways (lockdown or strictness) to prevent Covid-19 from spreading. “We want the situation to be dealt with strictness instead of imposing lockdown in the state,” Vij said. “We can withstand resentment of people by acting strictly but cannot see people dying,” the health minister said, pointing out that this time Covid-19 is more aggressive. Last year, he said, the number of cases increased gradually. BOX End stir on humanitarian grounds, Khattar tells farmers Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday again appealed to the agitating farmers to call off their stir on humanitarian grounds. Reiterating that it is the constitutional right of every person to protest and that the state government has no problem with those who protest, he said: “However, at this time, due to Covid-19, life may be put in danger and this is not the right time to protest. If they have to hold protest for any of their demands, they can do it when the situation improves,” he said, directing the deputy commissioners to contact the agitating farmers and try to persuade them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-squeezes-number-of-people-at-gatherings-101618493053275.html
15-04-2021||Pune||Nagpur Covid-19 patients share beds at govt hospital. Administration ‘clarifies'||After photos of Covid-19 patients sharing beds at the Government Medical College in Nagpur surfaced on Thursday, the hospital administration claimed that it might be a one-off case when there is an emergency requirement of medical oxygen.News agency ANI released photos showing patients sharing beds at the hospital as they waited for proper medical attention.Maharashtra: In a video, #COVID19 patients seen sharing beds at Govt Medical College, Nagpur. Medical Superintendent says, "It generally doesn't happen. It's a 900-bed hospital. Patients come from neighbouring districts & state. So it's important to give them oxygen quickly." pic.twitter.com/pI0od9OoKrMedical superintendent of the medical college Dr Avinash V Gawande said that such measures are taken only when there is an influx of several patients in a short period of time. He said that the 85-bed ward for emergency patients acts as a station to give them medical oxygen. “It does not happen generally. It is a 900-bed hospital and patients come from neighbouring districts and states hence it is important to give them oxygen quickly,” Gawande was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Our 85-bed emergency ward acts as a station before we shift patients. At times several patients come in simultaneously so in such situations there is a possibility of two patients being kept on a single bed but we shift them within 10-15 minutes,” he saidSeveral hospitals in Nagpur are battling to address the rise in hospitalisations. Nagpur is among the worst-affected districts as it currently has over 63,000 active cases of Covid-19. Nagpur recorded 5,993 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday which pushed the tally in the district to 2,97,036. The death toll also rose to 5,960 as Nagpur recorded 57 more casualties. Nagpur, which is under the imposition of Section 144, like the rest of the state, saw the minimal presence of people on Thursday, according to an ANI report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nagpur-covid-19-patients-share-beds-at-govt-hospital-administration-clarifies-101618488964818.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav writes to PM Modi for financial aid, asks Centre to declare Covid-19 ‘natural calamity’ in Maharashtra||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking financial assistance from the Centre as Maharashtra along with the rest of the country battles a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases.Thackeray in his letter asked PM Modi to extend the timeline of the submission of GST returns for the months of March and April by three months for small and medium taxpayers. He also requested the Prime Minister to notify the pandemic in the state as a natural calamity so that the state can access funds from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Thackeray said the situation in Maharashtra will lead to an imposition of a mini-lockdown and fund from the SDRF will be used to pay gratuitous relief (GR) to families which come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and the Priority Household (PHH) as these families will be adversely affected during the lockdown. Maharashtra government will pay ₹100 per adult per day and ₹60 per child per day as gratuitous relief (GR) during the lockdown period.“The first installment of the central share of the SDRF may be released to the state to tide over the financial situation during the current financial year,” Thackeray wrote in his letter.Requesting the Centre to extend a helping hand to startups, small and medium scale enterprises and various businesses which took loans under different schemes launched by the government the Maharashtra CM urged the Modi government to request banks to defer due instalments in the first quarter of the current financial year without interest. “This is akin to force majeure for business relationships between these entrepreneurs and banks,” the letter said.Maharashtra has been reeling from a severe spike in Covid-19 cases with the state recording more than 50,000 cases daily for more than a week. The state reported 63,294 cases of Covid-19 on April 11, recording the highest single-day tally since the onset of the pandemic.

15-04-2021||Pune||Taste of life: How this community dinner gave orthodox Maharashtra a wake-up call||The day was May 10 and the year 1928. The residents of Gaekwadwada (now known as Kesariwada) in Narayan peth, the Tilaks, had woken up quite early in the morning to prepare for a special feast. Some 200 guests of different castes and religions were invited for dinner. Shridhar Balwant Tilak, son of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, was the host and he himself was overseeing the arrangements. Considering that this was the first time such a “sahabhojan” (community dinner) was being arranged in Gaekwadwada, known to be the headquarters of orthodox Maharashtra, Shridharpant wanted the event to be a success.The occasion had another significance. It was also the first time that one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century and one of the tallest leaders in India, who also happened to be Shridharpant’s close friend, was coming over for dinner. In fact, he was the guest of honour. His name was Dr Bhimrao, alias Babasaheb Ambedkar.Shridharpant had been in awe of Ambedkar’s philosophy and social reforms since 1925. They would regularly meet and communicate with each other and discuss methods to get rid of upper-caste hegemony. Shridharpant not only wanted social equality, but also aimed to end malpractices like child marriages and the tonsuring of widows. Two of his strongest and closest supporters in this journey were Prabodhankar Keshav Seetaram Thackeray and Babasaheb Ambedkar.In 1927, during the Mahad Satyagraha, also known as Chavdar Tale Satyagraha, Ambedkar established Samaaj Samata Sangh, an organisation meant for “upper caste” allies of the Dalit movement. In April 1928, Shridharpant started a branch of the said organisation in Gaekwadwada in Pune. This was a scandalous move and created a furore in the conservative circles of Pune.Especially agitated were the trustees of the Kesari Trust. NC Kelkar and GV Ketkar could not digest the liberal approach of Shridharpant and his brother Rambhau. These disciples of Lokmanya Tilak did not want the bastion of orthodoxy encroached on by “those influenced by the philosophy of Agarkar and Ambedkar”.They launched a systematic attack against the Tilak brothers. Rumors were circulated. The brothers were threatened with legal action. The trustees were already engaged in a legal battle with the Tilak brothers over the ownership of the newspapers “Kesari” and “Maharatta”. Several well-wishers advised Shridharpant to renounce the progressive line of thought and strike a deal with the trustees to gain a role in the running of the newspapers. He firmly refused. He was opposed to untouchability and the Chaturvarnya system and had no intention of compromising on his ideals. So despite several warnings from his detractors, he went ahead with his plan to host a sahabhojan in the presence of Ambedkar.Food was always used as a tool of humiliation for Dalits. Dalit narratives are replete with stories of being unable to eat with upper castes, of being refused food or being given, at best, leftovers which would be dropped into their hands from above; of going thirsty until someone could be found to pour water into their cupped hands. They were almost never allowed to use common wells or tanks in villages and cities. Ambedkar too experienced this. He would go thirsty in school if a peon was not present to pour water in his cupped hands. When a young Ambedkar was asked to solve a numerical on the blackboard, students ran to collect their lunchboxes placed behind the board, claiming his touch would pollute the blackboard and their food.After returning from Columbia, Ambedkar had come to live in Vadodara where he had to work to fulfil his scholarship contract. But, his caste proved an obstacle in him finding a place to eat and live in the city. No inn and boarding house would allow him on their premises. An influential king like Maharaja Sayajirao was helpless in this matter. He asked a dejected Ambedkar to return to Bombay.That is why, sahabhojan was increasingly being used as a tool to break the taboos surrounding food and caste. People from various castes and religions would come together and share food. This movement was largely opposed by the majority of population, but was being consistently endorsed by liberals and rationalists like Shridharpant Tilak.On May 10, 1928, when the trustees realised that all their attempts to thwart the sahabhojan had failed, they switched off the power supply to Gaekwadwada, just before Ambedkar was about to arrive. A small pandemonium broke out.Shridharpant immediately took charge of the situation and requested his friends to bring lanterns and lamps from their homes. In a few minutes, Gaekwadwada was lit up with hundreds of lamps and lanterns. Ambedkar arrived, met his friend. The sahabhojan went on quite peacefully after that.But, orthodox society in Pune did not let Shridharpant work in peace. The legal battle over the ownership of the newspapers and the harassment at the hands of the conservatives because of his liberal and rational thoughts proved too much for him to tolerate. He died by suicide the same year. His suicide note was addressed to his dear friend Ambedkar. He wished him all the luck in his fight to end untouchability and discrimination.Ambedkar later wrote – “If anyone who is worthy of the title Lokamanya, it is Shridharpant Tilak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-how-this-community-dinner-gave-orthodox-maharashtra-a-wake-up-call-101618484221635.html

15-04-2021||Delhi||Curfew call: Weekend chill is out of question, say Delhiites||With Delhi reporting 17,282 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the highest single-day surge in the Capital since the pandemic erupted, it was announced on Wednesday afternoon that Delhiites will have to observe weekend curfew, and “break the chain of transmission” to tackle a steep rise in Covid cases. This implies that auditoriums, malls, gyms and spas will remain shut, and people will not be able to dine in at restaurants as only home delivery of food will be allowed. The weekly markets, however, will be allowed but with restrictions. Only essential services, and people going for weddings will be issued curfew passes.Restauranteurs feel this move will make a further dent in their sales. Umang Tewari, owner, Local, Junkyard, and Liv Bar, says, “With the night curfew, our business was already 70% down. And people were only coming over the weekends, as they were busy on weekdays. With the weekend curfew, our business will be zero because people don’t come out much from Monday to Friday, during the day time.” And Zorawar Kalra, founder, Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd, adds, “The pandemic has affected the entire world and most industries have been hit hard. Especially the already beleaguered food and beverage industry. The past year has been a very difficult one for all. The new measures in place are understandably the need of the hour but will have a huge impact on sales and on the survivability of the industry as a whole. Delivery alone cannot sustain a restaurant enterprise. Already the restaurants were operating on 50% capacity and now with the measures in place it is definitely going to effect business in a huge way!” For Delhiites, such as Vaibhavi Ananya, a final year student of Delhi University, the weekend curfew spells “depressing” vibes. “The whole week we have our online classes so we really don’t have time to go out. Evening tak padai chalti rehti hai. So it’s usually just over the weekend when we get some time, when we can chill a bit while managing our assignments. We have a really short window to take off our mind off these things, but with the weekend curfew, we’ll have to just stay back home. It’s indeed required, but is too depressing to handle.”Mayank Ghai, a fitness expert from Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, says it’s better to shift the workouts permanently to home! “I’ll do home training. Thankfully, I have a gym at home also. Ab aur kya sakte hai. Gym jaate the, friends se bhi milte the to better feel hota tha, Covid mein bhi. Ab woh bhi roz roz nahi ho payega,” says Ghai, and Ayush Jain, a BBA student from Gurugram adds, “I usually took my camera along for weekend trips to places in Delhi, so that I could take part in photo walks. Woh toh nahin ho paayega ab... And I had planned to visit the mall for shopping, which I won’t be able to do either. Ab toh online zindabad!” But some feel that this was the need of the hour. Gaya Kashyap, another DU student, says, “I think it’s a fantastic move, to be fair. I mean people are dying because of Covid, and if we have to sit indoors again for a little while so that it ceases, I don’t think much is lost. I’ve the privilege to make that choice, to choose to stay indoors rather than have fun outdoors. So I don’t mind prioritising seclusion when others have no option but to step outside and work. This much we could do for the society.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/curfew-call-weekend-chill-is-out-of-question-say-delhiites-101618479479891.html

15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Raman Goyal becomes first woman mayor of Bathinda||Raman Goyal became the first woman mayor of Bathinda municipal corporation on Thursday amid allegations of favouritism by a veteran party leader. Ashok Pardhan (ward number 37) was elected senior deputy mayor, while Master Harmandar Singh Sidhu (ward number 28) was elected the deputy mayor. Also read: Students of Classes 5, 8 and 10 to be promoted without exams in PunjabTechnical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who oversaw the election in the Congress-dominant House, said that all three were elected unanimously. The Congress has 43 members in the 50-member House, and all were present during the meeting, which was also attended by state finance minister and local Congress MLA Manpreet Singh Badal. Veteran Congress leader gets cold shoulder A first-time Congress councillor, Goyal, had defeated BJP’s Seema Arora by 1,134 votes from ward number 35. Her election came as a surprise as veteran Congress leader Jagroop Singh Gill, who successfully contested from ward number 48 , had won the civic elections for a record seventh time and was being seen as the strongest claimant for the mayor’s post. Ahead of the local elections, he was asked to quit as chairperson of the district planning board to contest the municipal corporation elections. He polled 1,452 votes, whereas his nearest rival Nirmal Singh of the Shiromani Akali Dal got only 876 votes. Gill had also held the posts of the chairperson of the Bathinda Improvement Trust, vice-president and president of the local civic body and the president of the District Bar Association. Before the formal announcement in the House, Gill expressed his displeasure at being ignored. He said the names of the top three positions were decided two weeks ago and Channi came only as a formality. Mayor’s husband close to Manpreet’s family: GillWithout naming anyone, Gill said certain sections tried to defeat him during the civic body polls, but electors reposed faith in him. “I’m winning the local body elections since 1979 and it was popular opinion that an experienced person should head the MC. But she (Raman Goyal) was favoured only because her husband, Sandeep Goyal, a wine contractor, is close to Manpreet Badal and his core team,” he alleged. Meanwhile, Manpreet and Channi rubbished the charge of favouritism. “No specific criteria were fixed for finalising names for top posts, but it was decided according to popular opinion among the councillors. During the meeting with party candidates today, Gill did not oppose any candidature,” Channi said. Goyal’s election as mayor is seen as one with an eye on the state elections next year. “Bathinda was always a political bastion of the former Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janta Party alliance. It is the first time that the Congress has managed to get a majority in the local body and by nominating Goyal to the top position, the party is looking to consolidate Hindu votes as the SAD-BJP alliance is over now,” said a political analyst, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/raman-goyal-becomes-first-woman-mayor-of-bathinda-101618478039782.html

However, this time, dates are being sold and bought in large quantities in the market.Riyaz Ghazi, owner of Bhartiya Traders, which extensively imports wholesale dates at Indore's Siyaganj, one of the largest wholesale grocery market in Madhya Pardesh, told ANI, "Eating dates is a sunnah (Sunnah, are the traditions and practices of the Prophet, Muhammad). Prophet Muhammad was fond of dates.""Last year, the sale of dates was down due to Covid-19 and lockdown. But this time, from today till 4 pm in Indore, the district administration gave an exemption, so that we are able to do our business. In other cities, there is not enough access to dates. Since the supply of dates has not been able to reach the adjoining cities in sufficient quantity, the purchase of the fruit in Indore is very high. People are sending purchase orders from many nearby cities," said Ghazi.He further added that his company imports dates from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia among others.Dates are a staple on iftar tables during Ramadan. Prophet Muhammad's iftar table always had dates. Accordig to Islamic scholars, at iftar time, Prophet Muhammad used to break his fast with either a few fresh or dried dates or a sip of water.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is celebrated by people belonging to the Muslim community all around the world. This year, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began in India on April 14.During Ramadan, people have their first meal before sunrise known as 'sehri' (also called suhoor) and the other meal is iftar, which is served after sunset.This annual observance is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam.

It also predicted some relief from the scorching heat after 48 hours with light rains expected in some parts of the state.Patna Meteorological department officials said that in most places across the state, the maximum and minimum temperatures were 2°C to 4°C above their corresponding normal range.As per the daily weather bulletin, Gaya recorded a maximum temperature of 42°C, Patna 41.6°C, Bhagalpur 40.8°C, Valmikinagar 39.2°C and Purnea 36°C.

Temperature in most other places in the state was around 36°C to 38°C.A weather department official attributed clear sky for the rise in temperature and added that any respite from the soaring heat was unlikely due to the prevailing meteorological conditions.“Due to mainly clear sky, sunlight directly hits the ground resulting in rise in temperature.

Due to humid formation, light rain accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning is expected in the north-east region after 48 hours,” he added.Patna residents said it was difficult to step out during the day.“Stepping out has become very difficult. Hot air gives a burning sensation on skin. I carry an umbrella and cover my body before going out to avoid direct sunlight,” said Rajni Singh, an office-goer.Dr Sarita Sinha, health expert at a private hospital, advised residents to stay hydrated. “Many people are observing fast due to ongoing festivals but they are advised to take plenty of water. Fruits like orange, tender coconut water, sugarcane juice will help them to stay hydrated. One should not leave home empty stomach as it increases the risk of a heat stroke. Special care should be given to children as they are more prone to falling sick during this season,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/mercury-crosses-41-c-in-patna-gaya-as-bihar-records-above-normal-temperatures-101618457156360.html

We do not trust the CM," Patwari said."The CM should save the lives of the people who require the medical oxygen. The supply from Maharashtra and Gujarat has now stopped," Sharma said.Madhya Pradesh has 43,539 active Covid-19 cases in the state, while the death toll due to infection in the state has mounted to 4,261.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/covid19-congress-mlas-stage-dharna-in-bhopal-over-shortage-of-medical-oxygen-101618452517060.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Alarm for Capital as new Covid-19 cases hit 17,000||India’s daily tally of new infections of Covid-19 stopped just short of the 200,000 mark on Wednesday, as the number of new infections in Delhi soared past previous records with an alarming 17,282 cases recorded in a single day.India reported 199,506 cases on Wednesday, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard, taking the total number of infections in the country to 14,070,831. A total of 1,036 new deaths were lodged across the country on Wednesday, for a toll of 173,170.In Delhi, the test positivity rate – a crucial proxy for outbreak severity – was 15.92%, higher than it had been in the city’s last two waves, bringing yet more signs that the crisis has taken an unprecedented turn and may now require stringent curbs.Over the last two weeks, new cases in Delhi have increased by 586%, and the city now has over 50,000 active cases – the most it has ever had – in what may turn into an unmanageable threat for the health care capacity.Experts believe the curbs announced last week may have come too late, and the Capital may have little option but to enter a circuit-breaker lockdown in which non-essential activities are temporarily barred.Apart from Delhi, the onslaught of the virus was particularly evident in metros such as Chennai and Bengaluru, with these cities setting new records for daily infections on Wednesday, even as Mumbai, India’s worst-hit urban centre, went under a 15-day curfew.A record 8,155 new cases were reported in Bengaluru on Wednesday, while Chennai also set an all-time record with 2,564 new cases.In Mumbai, 9,931 new cases were reported on Wednesday as the city, along with the state of Maharashtra, entered a curfew until the end of April to battle the expanding outbreak. The state, which accounts for about a quarter of the country’s total coronavirus cases, reported 58,952 new infections on Wednesday.Nationally, the number of cases on Wednesday continued a sharp increase from the 185,287 reported on Tuesday, which itself was an all-time single-day record.The seven-day average of national positivity rate has now soared to 11.7% for the week ending Wednesday, the second highest it has ever been. This means that more than one positive case is emerging out of every 10 samples being tested for Covid-19 across the country.The last time the national positivity rate was higher than this was for the week ending July 25.The seven-day average of daily infections, which denotes the case curve of a region, has now surpassed the peak of the first wave in at least 12 states and Union territories across the country, a statistic that shows the geographical spread of the current outbreak.These are Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.All these regions have been setting new records for daily infections on a near-daily basis over the past few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/alarm-for-capital-as-new-covid-19-cases-hit-17000-101618442236324.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi in a Covid-19 spiral as experts call for tighter curbs||The number of new Covid-19 infections in the Capital soared past previous records, with 17,282 cases recorded in the 24 hours till Wednesday and the test positivity rate – a crucial proxy for outbreak severity – was higher than it had been in the city’s last two waves, bringing yet more signs that the crisis has taken an unprecedented turn and may now require stringent curbs.Over the last two weeks, new cases have increased by 586%, and the city now has over 50,000 active cases – the most it has ever had – in what may turn into a threat for the health care capacity. Experts believe the curbs announced last week may have come too late and the Capital may have little option but to enter a circuit-breaker in which non-essential services are shut.The 104 new deaths reported in Delhi’s health bulletin on Wednesday was the highest since November 30, while the test positivity rate of 15.92% was the highest since June 26, when tests were far fewer in number. In the last 24 hours till Wednesday, 108,534 tests were carried out.“The number of deaths have also started going up. If the surge in cases continues at a current pace, the deaths will go up further proportionally. Among the people who have tested positive today, the deaths will be reported after about two weeks,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Dr Mishra warned that the number of deaths will climb faster if the health infrastructure buckles under the load of new cases. “If we do not follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour strictly – and the markets are still crowded – the situation will get worse. We will reach a situation where hospitals start running out of beds in the next few days,” he said.Of the 50,736 people with Covid-19 in Delhi as on Wednesday, close to 17.5% are in hospitals.After cases began climbing last month, authorities in Delhi last week announced a night curfew and curbed the number of people that can gather for weddings, eat at restaurants or attend offices. Save for some services such as swimming pools, most activities are allowed.“India saw 185,000 cases, which have surpassed the last peak of 99,000. In Delhi, just like the entire country, the cases are steadily increasing. The trend has not slowed down yet; unlike last time, when the number went down with each passing day,” Delhi’s health minister Satyender Jain on Wednesday.Officials in Delhi have attempted to increase the number of beds.“In the Delhi Govt app, the total bed count was 6,000 one week ago. Now, the count is more than 13,000. Orders have been given to increase the number of beds. We are increasingly adding more beds. I can assure you that the number of beds in Delhi is double that of any state,” Jain added.Jain said the Delhi government has asked the central government to up bed capacity as well. “During the last peak, 4,100 beds were available with the central government. Today the count is 1,100. We have requested them to increase the beds and discussions are being held daily. The surge has been unprecedented, and the Delhi Government has ramped up the infrastructure in the hospitals. I’m sure they will too. They have not refused to do so, and are working towards it,” said Jain.But there are now questions whether these will be adequate without more curbs. A similar surge in India’s financial capital Mumbai forced authorities to order lockdown-like curbs as hospital beds became scarce and medical oxygen shortages became widespread.The sudden surge in the Capital has raised several other questions: whether the city is battling a more transmissible variant or if the wave of infections being recorded now are a result of the wedding and festive season last month?Experts say the curbs announced last week may have come too late. “We should expect more of the same over the next few days. All the restrictions that are being put in place in Delhi now should have been taken a few weeks ago when we saw an increasing trend in the number of cases,” said said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.“Delhi ministers said that there is no need to worry, there are enough beds. Very little was done to prevent the infections. I do realise that there are economic constraints; but the same constraints are in place even now and we are still implementing the restrictions, aren’t we,” he added.A second expert said at the least, the focus must be on Covid-safe behaviour. “Now that the infection is the community and it is affecting people indiscriminately, the only thing that we can do is maintain Covid appropriate behaviour and treat those who get sick. If beds start getting full, we have to ensure that patients receive good support and care at home so that most of them do not rush to hospitals,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.He added that a Maharashtra-like lockdown or a country-wide lockdown may complicate the situation further. “If you see Maharashtra, the lockdown has had little impact on the number of cases, but it has resulted in migrant workers leaving the city again. This will just lead to spreading the infection to the other parts of the country,” he said.Kejriwal to meet L-GDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will discuss the coronavirus situation in the city with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal during a meeting on Thursday, the chief minister’s office said on Wednesday.The city recorded 17,282 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the highest single-day surge here till date, and over 100 fatalities, according to Delhi government’s daily health bulletin data.“In view of the spread of Covid-19 infection, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will discuss the situation with Lieutenant Governor at 11 am on Wednesday,” the Chief Minister’s Office tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-in-a-covid-19-spiral-as-experts-call-for-tighter-curbs-101618434339934.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Cong govt’s handling of police firing cases exposes Capt-Badals nexus: Mann||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab president Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday alleged that the Congress government’s fiasco in the 2015 Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases has exposed the collusion between chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and the Badal family. Addressing a press conference in Patiala, the Sangrur MP said, “I have been saying it for a long time that Amarinder Singh and the Badals are hands in glove. But now, there is no need to place any evidence of this.”It was shocking that the state government’s lawyers opted to form a new special investigation team (SIT) by rejecting the options of getting the matter probed either by the CBI or Haryana Police as were given by the high court, said Mann. “The Amarinder-led government had appointed state advocate general Atul Nanda who has a team of 150 lawyers only to lose the case. The CM has tainted the career of an honest police officer and is now enacting a drama by appreciating him. The officer has conveyed that he does not want to continue in such an atmosphere,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-govt-s-handling-of-police-firing-cases-exposes-capt-badals-nexus-mann-101618432613836.html

The batch of pilgrims, which crossed over to the neighbouring country via the Attari-Wagah border on Monday, remained stuck at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore over security concerns.The jatha reached Gurdwara Panja Sahib on Tuesday night, where the main function was scheduled to be held on Wednesday.“We celebrate Baisakhi on April 14 every year. On Tuesday, the bhog ceremony of akhand path (non-stop continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib) was performed. Then the guests from India and other countries were honoured. The jatha will leave for Nankana Sahib late Wednesday evening,” said Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) president Satwant Singh on phone.The PSGPC and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) officials have made all arrangements for travelling, accommodation, langar, security of the pilgrims, he said. “The jatha will stay in Nankana Sahib for two days. A one night stay at the Kartarpur Sahib has also been arranged for the pilgrims for the first time,” he added.After visiting the local gurdwaras at Nankana Sahib on Thursday, the jatha will go to Gurdwara Sacha Sauda, Sheikhupura, the next day, Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore on April 17 and 18, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib on April 19. The pilgrims will then visit Gurdwara Rori Sahib and Gurdwara Dehra Sahib, Lahore on April 20 and 21, and then will return home the next day.The pilgrims were stranded at Lahore after violence erupted between the followers of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Hussain Rizvi and the police in Lahore on Tuesday morning. They were apprehensive that they wouldn’t be able to reach Gurdwara Panja Sahib to celebrate Baisakhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-jatha-from-india-celebrates-baisakhi-at-gurdwara-panja-sahib-in-pakistan-101618432554571.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Setback in 2015 police firing case: Bajwa wants Punjab AG to step down, Capt backs Nanda||Chandigarh: A war of words erupted in the ruling Congress in Punjab on Wednesday with Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa demanding advocate general Atul Nanda’s resignation in the wake of the setback suffered by the state government in the Punjab and Haryana high court in the 2015 Kotkapura violence case. The criticism of the advocate general and other lawyers engaged by the state government to fight the case was summarily dismissed by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh who termed it “baseless” and “totally unjustified”. Though Amarinder and Bajwa did not directly name each other, their statements signal the resumption of a fresh slugfest between the two after a brief four-month lull. The Congress MP’s demand came a day after party MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu targeted the state government. The high court had last week quashed the probe reports submitted by Punjab Police in two FIRs registered in connection with the violence, directing the state government to constitute a new SIT, excluding inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Bajwa fired the first salvo by asking Nanda, who was handpicked by Amarinder for the post, to take responsibility for repeated professional failures and resign from his position. “If he is unwilling to do so, I urge the state government to relieve him from his position and appoint a new AG,” he said in a written statement. The MP said that by refusing to take responsibility, the advocate general would seem to be more interested in remaining in his post, rather than focusing on his duties. “In the present case, Punjab has an AG who does not appear himself but gets lawyers from Delhi to appear in front of the HC. This clearly shows that the AG himself is aware of his own failings,” he alleged, claiming that the state paid ₹5.5 crore to Delhi lawyers for the job. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state president Bhagwant Mann also blamed the state government, claiming that the fiasco has exposed the collusion between Amarinder and the Badal family. “The Amarinder government had appointed state advocate general Atul Nanda who has a team of 150 lawyers only to lose the case,” he alleged at a press conference in Patiala. Reacting sharply to allegations against Nanda and other lawyers, Amarinder said the opposition parties and their leaders were deliberately trying to provoke public sentiment on the sensitive issue to create trouble ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. He accused vested interests of attempts to confuse the people with their deliberately misleading statements on different aspects of the sacrilege litigation. Contrary to what these vested interests, including leaders of the SAD and AAP, were projecting, the fact was that the cases relating to the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib were being handled separately in the courts from the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases, he said, defending the AG and his team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/setback-in-2015-police-firing-case-bajwa-wants-punjab-ag-to-step-down-capt-backs-nanda-101618432495143.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan case also hangs in the balance as IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap resigns||With the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing the special investigation team (SIT) report in the Kotkapura police firing case and now the probe team member inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh putting in his papers, the fate of the Behbal Kalan case is also hanging in the balance. As Vijay Pratap had said one chargesheet is left to be filed in the firing cases, lawyers dealing with the Behbal Kalan case said if he retires, the final challan may never see the light of day. Faridkot district attorney Rajnish Goyal, who led the prosecution in both the cases in the trial court, said, “One chargesheet is pending, but the SIT did not clear in which case (Behbal or Kotkapura). We have not received any official copy of the chargesheet. We are waiting for the complete order.” Now, all eyes are on the hearing of a petition of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, suspended IGP Paramraj Singh Umaranagal and Kotkapura ex-station house officer (SHO) Gurdeep Singh Pandher cops by the HC bench of Justice Alka Sarin on April 20. The three, who are accused in the Kotkapura case, had approached the court levelling allegations against Vijay Pratap, seeking his ouster from the SIT. The last week’s order of quashing the SIT findings came on a petition of Pandher who claimed he was falsely implicated in the Behbal Kalan case as he submitted a complaint to the DGP against Vijay Pratap. Two youths had died in the Behbal Kalan firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12. The police also opened fire the same day on protesters at Kotkapura, leaving many injured. Initially, IG Vijay Pratap was appointed to probe the Kotkapura case, while the Behbal Kalan case was entrusted to IG Arun Pal Singh and later SSP Satinder Singh who were also SIT members. In March 2019, the SIT filed first chargesheet naming former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma as accused in the case. The chargesheet was filed by the Satinder Singh-led team which was working separately from Vijay Pratap’s. The probe into the Behbal Kalan case came to a standstill for nearly a year after a rift between the SIT members. It was in June 2020 that the investigation of the case was also entrusted to Vijay Pratap whose team made several arrests and named serving and retired police officers, including former DGP Saini and IG Umaranagal, as accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-case-also-hangs-in-the-balance-as-ig-kunwar-vijay-pratap-resigns-101618432494002.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Cop with a rebellious streak calls it quits||Chandigarh: Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, currently serving in the rank of inspector general in Punjab Police and the face of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing cases, surprised many when he shot off a letter to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday, seeking premature retirement.The 50-year-old 1998-batch IPS officer is reportedly upset after the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed a probe report submitted by the SIT in the case and asked the state government to reconstitute the SIT without him. An upright cop with a rebellious streak, Kunwar Vijay has often found himself in crosshairs of controversies. Also, his self-righteousness has put him at odds with his seniors and politicians many times.During his posting as Ferozepur SSP in 2004, the officer made headlines when he ordered an FIR against his DIG Hardish Singh Randhawa. As Amritsar SSP in 2009, he locked horns with then BJP MLA Anil Joshi, who sat on dharna against his own government demanding Kunwar’s transfer. When Amarinder government came to power in 2017, Kunwar was posted as Ludhiana police commissioner. But he was transferred in less than three months after some Congress leaders complained that the officer “deliberately keeps the elected representatives waiting when they seek appointment with him.” In 2016, he was posted as Jalandhar police commissioner but was transferred within two months. In 2019, during the Lok Sabha polls, his transfer had kicked up a controversy. Following a complaint by the Akali Dal to Election Commission of India which subsequently issued directions to Congress government, Kunwar was relieved from the post of IGP (crime) Bureau of Investigation and IG (organised crime control unit) with immediate effect and posted as IG (counter intelligence), Amritsar. After the model code of conduct ended on May 26, the state government posted Kunwar back as IG (OCCU) with additional charge of IG counter intelligence, Amritsar, the next day (May 27). Earlier, various Sikh organisations and activists raised a big hue and cry over “shifting” Kunwar from the SIT, alleging that same was done under ‘political pressure’ to protect Badals.Locking horns with SIT members In the SIT too, Kunwar was initially inducted as a member, with ADGP-rank officer Prabodh Kumar heading the team. Soon, the officer was at loggerheads with the other members who claimed that Kunwar filed challan in the Kotkapura firing case, without consulting them. The SIT head and other members wrote to the DGP against Kunwar. However, within few months, the other SIT members were ‘sidelined’ and Kunwar was handed over both the cases. Considered to be a well-meaning cop in public perception, the officer is credited with probing high-profile cases of a kidney scam in Amritsar and a sex-scandal. Many of his colleagues, however, term him as self-obsessed and headline hunter --- a charge which Kunwar has often denied, claiming himself to be a an officer who goes by the rulebook. He is popular with a section of press, especially the vernacular media that often addresses him as ‘Punjab’s Singham’ and ‘Super Cop’.Kunwar, who originally hails from Bihar, describes himself to be an ardent follower of Guru Gobind Singh and often quotes Gurbani verses in his interaction with the media. Many in the Congress feel that the free hand given to Kunwar in probing the police firing cases has actually backfired for the state government. “Kunwar was made part of the SIT on the insistence of some ministers. He was given full powers. But if you look at his interviews, he has always projected himself above all. He didn’t even shy away from blaming the state government on many occasions. His resignation at this stage to my mind appears to be part of his larger plan,” said a senior minister, who didn’t want to be named.Readying for political plunge? Though Amarinder has rejected Kunwar’s resignation, the officer has hinted that he will stick to his decision. “I will continue to serve society in the best possible manner. Not as IPS,” he posted on Facebook, showing he is in no mood to relent. Political circles are abuzz that the officer might take a political plunge and contest the 2022 assembly polls using his resignation as a high-morale ground. During 2017assembly elections, there were some unconfirmed reports about the officer coming in close contact with the AAP. Those close to him say the officer is keen on contesting from Amritsar as the officer has made the holy city his home ever since he came in Punjab. Kunwar has a few admirers on both sides of state’s political spectrum, including former BJP minister Laxmi Kanta Chawla and Congress leader Raman Bahl. The officer was not available for comments despite repeated efforts to contact him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cop-with-a-rebellious-streak-calls-it-quits-101618431893851.html

The state government had earlier made it mandatory for people coming from the heavy caseload states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerela , Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan —to bring their negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reports after April 16. “The situation has begun to deteriorate in the other states of the country. Shortly, we will be compelled to impose other restrictions in Himachal too,” he said. In the wake of increase in infections, the government has asked district health authorities to increase its capacity to accommodate patients. “The government will ensure that economic activity in the state is not halted as the tourism industry in Himachal has already borne heavy losses,” the CM said, adding that hoteliers had been asked to strictly follow standard operating procedures (SOPs). “Its is mandatory for hoteliers to check the RT-PCR reports of tourist coming from other states,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/selfquarantine-for-a-week-cm-to-hp-residents-coming-from-high-caseload-states-101618431593834.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Prayers held in mosques on first day of Ramadan with precautions in place in J&K||People thronged mosques, shrines and markets in the Valley on Wednesday, the first day of the holy month of Ramadan. Though, the Valley has been witnessing a huge surge in novel infections since March but religious and tourist places have been allowed to remain open with adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs). Last year, the month was observed amid a strict Covid lockdown. This year too, a night curfew has been observed in urban areas of eight districts. However, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha directed deputy commissioners and superintendents of police to facilitate observance of prayers and other religious functions during Ramadan amid night curfew. Mosques and shrines reverberated with special Ramadan (tarawih) prayers in the Valley on Tuesday evening after the new moon was sighted. At places people maintained social distancing. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, based on the appearance of the moon, which Muslims follow across the world for their Islamic rituals.A crowd was seen in markers where shops were burgeoning with essential items and foods consumed during the holy month. “A significant rush was observed Srinagar markets. People purchased dates, dry fruits, fresh fruits and essential items,” said Aijaz Ahmad, a Srinagar resident.Regular prayers were also held at the two biggest religious places of Kashmir — Dargah Hazratbal on the banks of Dal Lake and Jamia Masjid at Nawhatta in the old city. Both these places were closed last year in the peak of Covid.“All five prayers as well as ‘tarawih’ prayers are taking place at the Jamia Masjid. The turn out was good but all SOPs were observed,” said a representative of Jamia Masjid management.“We are following all the guidelines of the World Health Organisation as well as local authorities. People wear masks and since the mosque is huge social distancing is not a problem,” he said. At Dargah Hazratbal, people from the Hazratbal locality and adjoining areas joined the regular as well as ‘tarawih’ prayers.“Last year, we could not offer prayers at the dargah but this year we are offering ‘tarawih’. People do wear masks and there is also social distancing. The mosque administration also makes regular announcements urging people to take precautions,” said a local, Faheem Mir. At some places where iftar arrangements used to be the norm. However, in the wake of the pandemic the gatherings were not organised.“Iftar arrangements were not made in the wake of Covid. Although volunteers make sure that social distancing is observed in the mosque, Iftar arrangements could have caused indiscipline,” said Fayaz Punjabi of Masjid Bilal at Lal Chowk. The Jammu and Kashmir Waqf Board, which controls more than 100 shrines and mosques, has been directed to impose a fine against those violating the Covid SOPs in mosques. The government has also instructed the board to ensure the availability of masks for those coming to mosques for prayers and to deploy medical officers for implementation of Covid protocols.“ Mosques and shrines are being opened with all the precautions. SoPs, including social distancing and masks, are being followed. People are aware of all issues and there is no indiscipline,” said Mufti Fariduddin, Waqf chief executive officer. Some people also avoid going to mosques particularly in small neighbourhoods where social distancing is difficult owing to the small size of mosques.“I think it is better to offer prayers at home amid the pandemic,” said Majid Ahmad, a resident of the Old City. Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday recorded 1,086 infections and five deaths, taking the UTs case tally to 1,41,736 and death toll to 2042, health officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prayers-held-in-mosques-on-first-day-of-ramadan-with-precautions-in-place-in-jk-101618431235540.html

Amid the pandemic, the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board has made it mandatory for all pilgrims to furnish a Covid negative report. A senior board official, requesting anonymity, said, “The Vaishno Devi shrine is one of the few places of worship in the country that are still seeking Covid-negative reports from pilgrims. Other shrines in the country have gradually removed all curbs and are allowing pilgrims, provided they wear face masks and follow social distancing protocols.” The official said the devotional singers that had been invited for ongoing Navratri festival at the Shrine had been first tested at the Jammu airport before being allowed to proceed towards Katra. “Should they test positive at the Jammu airport, they will not be allowed to proceed to Katra,” he said. 1,709 travellers tested, 69 test positive A health official informed said that of 3,199 travellers who had reached Katra by train, 1,709 were tested for Covid-19 while the remaining had the requisite Covid negative reports with them.“Of 1709 travellers, 69 tested positive and were sent home in specially designed cabs,” said the official.On Tuesday 14, 281 yatris had reached in Katra. Last year, the shrine had been closed on March 18 and re-opened on August 16 after a hiatus of almost five months. A health official said 71 travellers had tested positive in Katra on the first day of the festival. At 5,200ft, the cave shrine is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages and devotees from all over the country and abroad visit the shrine on auspicious days. The administration has fixed a ceiling of 25,000 pilgrims a day. Pilgrims arriving in trains to Katra will undergo rapid antigen tests (RATs) at the Katra railway station where Covid kiosks have been set up. Those arriving via road will undergo the test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir. Local devotees will be tested at Banganga and flying in will be tested at the Jammu airport. However, it is advisable for pilgrims coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR test, not older than 72 hours. The cave shrine was visited by 13,089 pilgrims on April 11. Last year, in August, the figures had dipped to 7,253 and 27,427 in September before picking up momentum in October when 1,21,661 pilgrims visited the shrine followed by 1,03,749 devotees in November and 2,07,533 in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaishno-devi-pilgrimage-11-000-devotees-reach-katra-on-day-2-of-navratras-101618431053839.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||First-of-its-kind: Children’s library setup in Chamba’s Salooni||Hoping to inculcate a reading habit among children, a dedicated children’s library and activity centre has been set up at Talori village in the remote Salooni sub-division of Chamba.Salooni sub-divisional magistrate Indian Administrative Officer Kiran Bhadana, who ideated the concept, inaugurated the ‘children’s learning centre’ on Tuesday. A second such centre will be opened in the same subdivision on Friday.These centres have been built to nurture the natural curiosity of children, said Bhadana. Around 200 English and Hindi books have been made available in each centre for children from ages 3 to 15. Besides this, a wide range of materials for fun-and-learning activity, including puzzles, globes, modeling clay, trampolines, games and toys have also been procured.“The floors at the centres have also been designed as an educational tool, following the building as learning aid (BaLA) system. We have augmented existing unused and under-utilised infrastructure,” she said.The officer said the model had successfully been applied previously while setting up five libraries in Salooni for those state service examinations. These centres were set-up with the help of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding provided by the Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVNL) facilitated by Chamba deputy commissioner DC Rana, pradhan of Sundla panchayat Deep Raj and Salooni’s Vyapar Mandal head Pawan Kumar.The anganwadi workers of the concerned areas have been tasked with running and overseeing the functioning of the centres. Bhadana hopes that the Children’s Learning Centres will not only provide kids with a platform to learn through activities, but set a new benchmark for the functioning of Anganwadi centres, leading to integrated early childhood development in a region which has been hitherto underdeveloped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/firstofitskind-children-s-library-setup-in-chamba-s-salooni-101618430513653.html

SAD leaders and their supporters were seen without face masks and social distancing was not maintained.According to the state government’s directives, there is a complete ban on political gatherings.Taking action, the Fazilka police recovered a fine of ₹10,000 from the brother of Hansraj Josan. It is the first challan issued in the state for violating government’s ban of all political, social, sports or cultural gatherings to curb Covid spread.SSP Harjeet Singh said the penalty under Epidemic Control Act was imposed on Sher Chand, brother of Josan. He said the event was organised at the property owned by Sher Chand in the violation of rules.Josan, who won the 1992 and 2002 elections and remained ministers on both occasions, said 700-800 people had come from Jalalabad and Fazilka assembly segments at the event. “But Covid guidelines were followed at the function,” he said. “I quit the Congress as the party failed to perform on all fronts. People with no mass support are leading the party and resourceful leaders are given preference over those who remained connected with the grassroots-level workers,” said Josan, who had quit on Tuesday as the chairperson of the Fazilka District Planning Board.Lauding his political base, Sukhbir said Josan’s candidature for the forthcoming assembly polls would be announced soon.Sukhbir has already announced to contest from Jalalabad that he represented thrice in 2009 byelection, 2012 and 2017.In 2009 and 2012, Josan had contested unsuccessfully against Sukhbir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-guidelines-violated-during-sad-event-at-fazilka-village-organiser-fined-101618430093749.html

But in an improvement over 2020, some events will be held at the temple and via social media.Komalpreet Kaur, a 16-year-old high school student in nearby Olathe, Kansas, said the parade is “the one big event of the year where everyone gets together, and we welcome other members of the community to participate. ... This is like our Christmas, and it’s something we look forward to so much. But we are going to find alternatives this year to celebrate,” she added.Kaur has been lobbying officials in several area cities trying to get them to declare April Sikh Awareness and Appreciation Month, so far winning one such proclamation from Lenexa, Kansas. Kaur, who was raised in New York City before moving with her family to Kansas in 2017, said she wants to make others more familiar with her faith.In California’s San Joaquin Valley, the Stockton Gurdwara organised a Tuesday evening service of prayers, readings from the Guru Granth Sahib while following health guidelines, said Tejpaul Singh Bainwal, a gurdwara member and student of early Sikh American history. A more involved celebration, including a vaccination clinic, will be held this weekend, also under masking and social distancing rules.At Guru Nanak Darbar of Long Island, in Hicksville, New York, normally there’s a giant tent set up in the parking lot to accommodate crowds of up to 2,000 people at a time coming for festivities and treats. This year, the celebrations were marked by temperature monitors, social distancing and bagged meals to take home. Gurdwara members set a more restrictive attendance level than required, allowing about 150 into prayer services that can normally accommodate 600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikhs-in-us-mark-toned-down-baisakhi-celebrations-amid-coronavirus-concerns-101618429913960.html

He stopped on his route to do a drug deal, before veering into the emergency lane of the freeway in Kew and ploughing his 19-tonne prime mover into officers and their stationary vehicles on April 22 last year, The Age newspaper reported.Constable Lynette Taylor, senior constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene, The Guardian reported.Singh was jailed for 22 years, with a non-parole period of 18 years and six months, the report said.Justice Paul Coghlan said the crash had “shocked the public conscience” and described footage of the incident as chilling.“Such grief is heightened by the sudden and unnecessary nature of the deaths. We can only hope ... as time goes by, some amelioration of their suffering can come about.” He was “actively psychotic” as he claimed he had seen a witch before killing the officers in the crash.The officers had pulled over Porsche driver Richard Pusey for allegedly speeding at the time. Multiple CCTV cameras showed footage of Singh “repeatedly drifting” into the emergency lane of the freeway before the crash, 9news.com reported.The heartbroken families of the four fallen police officers say “no amount of punishment” can ease the grief they feel over losing their loved ones, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjaborigin-truck-driver-jailed-for-22-yrs-over-deaths-of-4-australian-police-officers-101618429253552.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Rise in double-mutant strain in Maharashtra cities’||A rising number of double-mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in Maharashtra, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed on Wednesday. “Different kinds of mutations have been found in Maharashtra, but there is definitely a rising trend of double-mutant variants in several cities. This trend has not been noticed across the state,” Dr. Sujeet Kumar Singh, NCDC director, said. A senior official said over 60% samples from various cities in Maharashtra whose genome was sequenced were found to be of this particular double mutant variant.It is as yet unclear how many samples have been sequenced from the state, and which cities the double-mutant samples belonged to. When asked for this information, Singh refused to comment.For Maharashtra, which has been recording country-wide high numbers in the second wave of the pandemic, the trend is particularly worrisome as these mutations could make the coronavirus spread more readily and, at least to a degree, resist immunity from a past infection or triggered by vaccines, the Centre had said last month.The Union government has on March 24 confirmed the presence of mutations and said that a novel variant with a combination of two mutations E484Q and L452R -- now classified as B.1.617 lineage-- was found in 206 samples taken from Maharashtra since December. The majority of double-mutant variants were found in the samples sent from Nagpur. Doctors across Maharashtra and other parts of the country have been noticing variation in the presentation of Covid in the second wave.“Last year, we saw the involvement of lung infections in over 70% of the cases, but this year we are seeing more and more involvement of the gut,” said Dr Om Shrivastav, infectious disease specialist and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force.“Another alarming trend is patients getting better and then returning with more sickness. Such clinical evidence of possible mutations has been noted by many doctors,” he added.Many experts also pointed that there is not enough data on variants and said that states like Maharashtra should have sent at least 5% to 10% of their samples for genome sequencing, a process to identify the genetic makeup of the organism and study its changes. Mumbai’s civic body sends 50 samples for genome sequencing of infected patients with travel history, from hot spots and families with higher infection rates each week, Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, had told HT last month. “Mutations are commonly seen in single-cell RNA viruses like the coronavirus,” said Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John. “Which are the variants prevalent in states like Maharashtra with a high number of Covid-19 cases? Is the local variant spreading faster than the UK, South African, and Brazilian variants? A clear variant profile helps in answering these questions,” said John. “We need to know if the vaccines are effective on these variants, from a laboratory perspective. And if there is a need to quickly modify them,” he said.A consortium of 10 national laboratories called -Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics- was formed in December 2020 to carry out genomic sequencing of circulating viruses and correlate the findings with other trends. The Ministry, in its statement last month, said that 771 of the 10787 samples that were sequenced were found to have the UK, South African, and Brazilian mutations, which were identified as variants of concern (VOC). The Centre last month said that three known VOCs were also found in Maharashtra, the Centre revealed: 56 of these were of the UK variant (B.1.1.7), five of the South African variant (B.1.351) and one of the Brazilian variant (P.1).It was further revealed that of the 220 samples from Mumbai sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for sequencing, only 22 of them had the B 1.1.7 variant. Of those, half the persons had a travel history, while the other half comprised close contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-in-double-mutant-strain-in-maha-cities-101618428772926.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra board to study CBSE formula, ICSE parents demand similar decision||Hours after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to cancel its Class 10 board exams, the Maharashtra government said it will study the board’s decision implying that it is still exploring options other than physical exams, while parents of Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) urged the board to cancel its exams. In her video message sent on Wednesday afternoon, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The health of our students is our topmost priority. Keeping this in mind, we are now going to ask experts in the state to study the decision taken by CBSE today as per which exams are replaced with internal assessments.” On Wednesday, the CBSE board announced the cancellation of Class 10 exams and the postponement of Class 12 exams across the country this year. Students of Class 10 will be marked based on an objective criterion to be developed by the board. The criteria for marking students are yet to be declared. After the announcement, parents from ICSE urged the board to come up with a similar decision for the students of the board. “If CBSE can cancel its exams, so can ICSE. Students are already under tremendous stress and it would be great if this uncertainty is addressed altogether instead of just postponing the exams,” said the parent of a Goregaon based ICSE school. Reema Lokesh, another parent said parents will write to the board again if a decision does not come in by Thursday. “We are hoping ICSE considers the decision by CBSE and announces a similar decision. We will wait for a day to see if an announcement comes in and will write to the authorities again if it doesn’t,” she added. Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the ICSE board said, “The ICSE Board will take a decision regarding the ICSE and ISC examinations, 2021 and will inform all concerned at the earliest.”In the coming days, the state government will await guidelines from CBSE on the marking criteria for Class 10 students. An expert who works with the state government said the government will wait to see what formula CBSE arrives with. “We will see what components they consider and check the feasibility of using the same in the state board. A common formula for all boards might also help in the sense that it will address issues of equivalence for admissions in future. We hope to study the formula and will then arrive at a decision,” said the expert. On April 12, the state government postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June, following which the state had written to CBSE and ICSE officials requesting postponement in their board exams. While HSC exams were earlier scheduled to take place between April 23 and May 21, SSC exams were planned between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 33 lakh students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from state board every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-board-to-study-cbse-formula-icse-parents-demand-similar-decision-101618428652948.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai airport to see drastic fall of passengers with lockdown: Experts||Mumbai airport is likely to once again suffer low passenger footfalls with the state government imposing a lockdown in an attempt to contain the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city and the state at large. The Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) city, which is the second busiest airport in the country recorded 50.91 lakh passengers from January to March 2021. According to the data, CSMIA saw 41,00,639 passengers from October to December last year.Even though the state has not imposed restrictions on air travel, Jyoti Mayal, president of Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) said no passenger is likely to fly to Mumbai and Maharashtra. “People who have just re-started their business will suffer again. Already 40% business of the travel and aviation sector has been affected due to the night curfew imposed in the state. Covid-19 cases are increasing not only because people are not wearing masks, but they are also increasing because there are no protocols in place.”Mayal said the government needs to come up with unilateral policies for the lesser affected and hard-hit states so that a customer is not confused with changing norms in states. “The environment created currently is too negative for people to travel to Mumbai, because of which, not only the city airport but also other businesses will have to face severe repercussions soon,” she added.Subhash Goyal, general secretary of the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH) said citizens will have to learn to live with the virus, hence lockdowns aren’t a solution to control the spread of the virus. According to Goyal, effective control by the government and discipline in people will lead to the containment of the virus. “If a person in Singapore is caught without a mask for the first time, he is fined S$ 500 and if he is caught for the second time then he is imprisoned. Currently, with the domestic sector seeing some tourism, only hotels are seeing some business, as the remaining business continues to suffer. Mumbai sees maximum business travel along with some visiting friends and relative (VFR) traffic, however, with the news of lockdown and most Covid-19 cases in the city and state, no one is currently willing to travel to Mumbai. The only key to having controlled cases is maintaining hygiene protocols,” Goyal said.Goyal also said that he fears more people dying of economic hunger than from the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-to-see-drastic-fall-of-passengers-with-lockdown-experts-101618428472964.html

Within days, the institute set up a five-member committee comprising senior faculty members, and convened by Milind Atrey, dean, research and development, to seek proposals from researchers across various academic levels, on solutions directed towards fighting Covid-19. The committee sifted through short-term and long-term proposals from various professor-led research groups and collated a list of expertise available for government and industry partnership for technology transfer, licensing and commercialization of technologies and products. A year on, we take a look at three innovations that emerged from the institute: A mask that fights viruses Researchers from biosciences and bioengineering (BSBE), who had been working on technologies for the prevention of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), were quick to extend their research to the coronavirus-induced disease, which also exhibited often as ARDS in acute cases. “As soon as the pandemic broke out, we started exploring ways of extending some of the technologies we were working on to this new virus,” Rinti Banerjee, professor, BSBE, said. Her team, comprising a PhD and three post-doctoral research fellows first developed a wash-resistant biodegradable coating for textiles for environment-friendly masks and PPEs. They called it Duraprot (a combination of two words: durable, protection) technology. The team developed natural biodegradable material (bio-nano polymers), which acts directly on the covering of the Covid-19 virus – or any bacteria – by breaking it down and thus making it inactive. It developed an emulsion into which cloth could be dipped to coat it. The coating would not come off even after 20 wash cycles. “It’s almost as easy as cooking dal at home,” said team member Kapil Punjabi, a post-doctoral research scientist. This technology is awaiting two patents. The only person in team with access to the lab was Roshan Keshari, 23, a student from Nepal. The PhD student was unable to return home when the campus shut down in March as all international borders were sealed. The rest worked from home, reformulating and designing experiments on the coating. They relayed detailed instructions to Keshari, who would then perform the experiments in the lab on campus. He would then send his observations to the team who would analyse the observations and tweak the experiments accordingly. “There was a lot of back and forth. Our goal was to build solutions quickly and get them tested and ready for industry integration. So, it was a stressful time as we had to design experiments, look for standards, test out products, send samples for those tests, get validation,” said Punjabi. “We then decided to apply this technology to develop masks and personal protective equipment for clinical personnel and those exposed to harmful effects of air pollution. We wanted to have an environment-friendly version of N95 masks, which are made of nondegradable polymer/ plastic components,” said Banerjee. Around three months after the lockdown was announced, the Duraprot technology was ready and was licensed to manufacturers such as Ants Innovations, Meemansa and EcoStyleCrafts who launched a range of products such as masks and sanitisers. The key highlight for the team is a social initiative that was launched soon after. The processes associated with the technology of producing these masks were simplified so that around the country could safely and repeatedly make the coating material and the coated masks in low resource settings. The team conducted training sessions with women self-help groups around the country, in states like Kerala and Bihar. Both, the coating material, and coated masks could be made in low-resource settings, which allowed the team to conduct the trainings virtually. “We would let the women know about the materials and chemicals they would need. They would keep these ready for the training sessions, which were held completely online,” said Punjabi. “While the research part was stressful, what we found most fulfilling was training the women virtually. We trained women from Kerala, Bihar and many other states. Training material was developed in vernacular languages and we used a lot of pictures,” said Banerjee. A helmet to breathe easy The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the country’s poor inventory of respiratory support. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP machines, which increase air pressure in the throat -- so airways do not collapse while breathing in -- were in short supply. For patients with breathing trouble, respiratory support is essential to ensure the pressure in the lungs doesn’t fall below the prescribed limit. Three professors from the department of Mechanical Engineering designed a low-cost helmet interface that would help. This helmet, when connected to a CPAP supply, enables enhanced oxygenation for the patients. One of the biggest advantages of this helmet is that it minimised re-breathing of carbon dioxide. “One of the disadvantages of mask-based CPAP devices is that the carbon dioxide breathed out goes back in through the nose. The helmet, however, minimises this rebreathing as the carbon dioxide, a heavy element, settles at the bottom of the helmet,” said Ramesh Singh, project lead. The helmet is designed ergonomically to avoid irritation to patients while allowing them to speak, listen, drink, and wear glasses while being treated. “The device is also embedded with many safety features such as high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter for inhaling pathogen-free air, as well as audio-visual alarms for low/high pressure, battery fault or low battery. Separate flowmeters were installed for measuring oxygen and total air flow,” said Soham Mujumdar, an assistant professor was also part of the team. “Studies show that around 5% of the Covid-19-infected patients needed effective oxygenation with approximately 2% needing ventilator support. Therefore, the idea was to develop a non-invasive ventilation device for Covid-19 patients in mild to medium distress,” Mujumdar added. The project was done in collaboration with Thermax, a Pune-based energy and environment engineering company, and modeled itself on clinical studies done in Europe last year. With the lockdown in place, it was extremely difficult to procure the raw material, sensors, and other testing equipment for the project. “The design and manufacturing of the final prototype of HPI is complete. The device has been tested comprehensively for mechanical integrity and flow performance at IIT Bombay. Stage I clinical studies have been successfully conducted with the help of the IIT Bombay ethics committee and IIT Bombay hospital,” Mujumdar said. The design of the CPAP helmet has been optimised and prototype tested. “We are looking for potential industry partners for manufacturing and scaling-up,” said Singh. The helmet was developed at a cost of ₹8,000 a unit, and it can be re-used after properly sanitising the unit, Singh said. Detecting Sars-CoV-2 Sanjeeva Srivastava, a professor of proteomics in BSBE, was travelling from Delhi to Mumbai by air on March 17, 2020, just ahead of the lockdown. Seeing how the number of travellers outnumbered the security personnel, he realized that screening was absolutely essential. “All I could think of was we have a mass spectrometry facility in the proteomics lab on campus and how we can put it to use in diagnostics,” said Srivastava. Simply put, proteomics is a technology to study proteins. Srivastava’s Proteomics Lab at IIT-B uses a mass spectrometer device to expose proteins in biological samples like blood, tissue and urine, using an analytical technique to calculate the molecular weight of the components in the sample. This technology was already being used by Srivastava and his team for cancer and malaria research. He decided to extend this technology to determine protein variants in swab samples for early detection of the coronavirus. A team of 35-40 researchers including clinicians from Kasturba Hospital, the city’s infectious diseases hospital and one of the first Covid-designated centres, precipitated protein from swabs of infected persons. Unique peptides (amino acids) from the swabs were detected rapidly using mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. Proteomics also helped identify the potential panel of marker proteins which could distinguish the severe from the non-severe cases. The team received clinical samples of Covid-19 from government hospitals like Kasturba, Nair and Jaslok, on which it performed a comprehensive proteomics-based investigation. “The study established a panel of host proteins using high-resolution mass spectrometry—a technique to measure mass to charge ratio of ions. There was a spike in the presence of host proteins such as Interleukin-6, L-lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, Ferritin, and Aspartate aminotransferase in Covid-19 infected swabs. The proteins identified in the study can be potential targets for the Covid-19 therapeutics,” said Srivastava. Their study, which was published in the international peer-reviewed Cell Press journal on February 3, also revealed a set of potential prognosis markers and drug candidates for circumventing the Covid-19 infection. The team has filed for two patents for potential biomarkers it identified for detection and prognosis of Covid-19 using the mass-spectrometry approach. “The mass-spectrometry-based identification of altered host proteins can reveal key information on why a group of population remains asymptomatic whereas few succumb to the infection. It would be interesting to consider the asymptomatic group along with the severe and non-severe groups for the study. Along with this, we also plan to conduct a longitudinal proteomic analysis of patient plasma samples at different time points leading to severity to study the disease progression at the individual level,” said Srivastava. “Even though the samples brought to campus were deactivated, it was still risky. The institute’s Ethics Committee was very strict with guidelines,” said Kruthi Suvarna, an institute post-doctoral fellow from BSBE, who worked on the project. Three PhD scholars were assigned the duty of collecting samples and deactivating them at Kasturba Hospital. “There were travel restrictions so the scholars were put up in a hotel near the hospital. The institute provided for the PPE kits while we handled the logistics of purchasing the reactive agents that would help the scholars deactivate the virus,” said Suvarna. WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM The institute’s research and development (R&D) department released seed fund – between Rs2 to 10 lakh -- depending on the project. Agencies under the Union ministry of science and technology also released funds for Covid-19 related projects. By December 2020, the institute had received over ₹150crore for all research projects, majority of which were related to Covid-19. With the lockdown in place and limited access to resources, industry collaboration helped set things in motion for researchers. Organisations provided access to laboratories, machines, chemicals and fabrication units. Thermo Fisher Scientific, a global company that supplies scientific equipment helped Sanjeeva Srivastava, a professor of proteomics in BSBE, with engineers and application scientists; Thermax not only funded the prototype of the CPAP helmet but also shared expertise of its scientists to IIT-Bombay in the project. According to annual reports, the institute received ₹395 crore in 2016-17; ₹312 crore in 2017-18; ₹362.08 crore in 2018-19; and ₹331.24 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-ians-train-sights-on-sarscov2-101618428425073.html

They alleged that the senior officials have failed to fix their DC rate.“On April 12, we had received a salary of ₹12,700 for a month, which is lower than a labourer’s income. The supervisors working in other districts had received a monthly salary of ₹24,065 but senior officials did not pay any heed to our demands,” they said.“Due to their negligence, our salary is stuck and we received only ₹12,700 for a month. We will not accept this. If our demands are not me, we will go on an indefinite strike,” they added.Three supervisors had even resigned from their post after their salaries were not paid.Rohtak deputy director (agriculture) Rohtash said that he has informed the senior officials about the matter and the supervisors will get their dues after finalisation of DC rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/8-months-on-rohtak-contractual-supervisors-still-await-salaries-101618428294267.html

The accused were on Wednesday produced before the court and remanded to six-day police custody.Call to hire JCB helped nail accusedThe police traced the accused with help of a phone call made by the accused to hire the JCB machine used in the crime. Police used the phone number and tracked down the thieves. They were on their way to sell the stolen network cables to a scarp dealer in Ghaziabad when the arrests were made.Police said the accused used to work as labourers in Chandigarh and knew cable-laying work.Theft disrupted internet services On April 8, the thieves had managed to steal around 16 quintals of underground BSNL cables using a JCB machine in Sector 4 and 10. As a result, internet connection of various government offices was disrupted.Police said cables from the rear of the BSNL office in Sector 4 and from near a petrol pump in Sector 10 were stolen. Internet services of Punjab and Haryana High Court, Haryana Vidhan Sabha and other government offices were disrupted. The police had registered a case under Section 379 of IPC at Sector 3 police station.Role in other crimes suspected Meanwhile, police will be questioning the accused with regards to another cable theft bid in Manimajra. An attempt to steal around 400 metres of wire from Manimajra was reported on the intervening night of March 21-22, but the suspects had fled the scene after being spotted by a passerby. A case was registered under sections 379, 427 and 511 of the IPC at Manimajra police station on April 11.The gang is also suspected to be involved in the theft of a quintal of wires which were stolen from the rear of Punjab Police headquarters in Sector 9 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-of-gang-held-for-stealing-bsnl-cables-in-chandigarh-101618427393389.html

Currently, there are 67 active cases among prisoners and nine among jail staff, including two doctors who were vaccinated earlier this year.An analysis of the cases shows that, till March 16, a total of 120 prisoners had tested positive for the disease.But between March 18 and April 14, this year, as a fourth wave of infections raged, the prison witnessed more than 75 fresh cases, of which three later recovered.On Wednesday, the city reported an alarming 17,282 new positive Covid-19 cases in all.Prison officers attributed the increase in number of cases to a rapid rise in the inmate population in Tihar, which Asia’s largest prison.While the sanctioned capacity of Tihar prison is 10,026, it currently has over 20,000 inmates.The prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, said that the administration was taking all possible measures to conduct medical test of the inmates, and was creating spaces within the prison for social distancing. The officer said that in-person meeting of families with the inmates, which happened twice a week inside the jails, have been suspended for the time being and court hearings of prisoners are happening virtually.Last year, after the pandemic broke out, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole to ensure social distancing inside the jail.However, between February 6 and March 18, almost all of them surrendered, leaving little space for isolation of new inmates and undertrials.Until February, the prison population was below 13,000. It has now crossed 20,000, making it difficult for officials to ensure social distancing inside jails, one officer said, asking not to be named.Experts, such as former law officer of Tihar Sunil Gupta and advocate Ajay Verma last week suggested that the administration should release all prisoners with “good conduct”, and those who surrendered well on time after being granted the special parole during the start of the pandemic last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/17-test-positive-in-tihar-in-a-day-officials-scamper-to-create-isolation-spaces-101618427177734.html

One such video claimed that the overcrowding was because of a second wave of the reverse migration from the city to various parts of the state. However, the Railways, industry experts and activists claim that unlike Mumbai and New Delhi, Bengaluru was yet to witness mass reverse migration like last year. Ashok Kumar Verma, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru Division, clarified that there was no rush or overcrowding at the railway station, adding that the department was running enough trains to cater to the demand. “As per the request from the Karnataka government, we had operated 20 extra trains in the view of Ugadi, festival holidays and strike by State Road Transport Corporation employees. We are ready to run more trains if required. There is no extra demand for trains,” he said. A senior SWR official, who did not wish to be named, said many of the trains, especially those running to north India, are not full during their trips. “Last year, there was a huge demand with many waiting for days to get a train, but the situation is much different now. If there was a mass movement of people, we would be first to know,” said the official. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO and co-founder of LabourNet, a Bengaluru-based social enterprise working in the unorganised sector, said those who left Bengaluru during the last lockdown are still returning. “We have been organising buses from various parts of the state to bring labourers back to Bengaluru and many are opting for these buses. So, if you ask, so far there is not big reverse migration,” she said. She, however, added that any fear of the lockdown could adversely affect this process. “People leaving Bengaluru to various parts during Holi and other festivals is common. But if there is a sense of fear of a lockdown among workers…many who left won’t come back and there could be reverse migration,” Vasudevan said. K Mahantesh, national secretary of the Construction Workers Federation of India, said, “While there is no big movement so far, workers are very careful. Many were stuck without jobs or food last time and they don’t want to be in a similar situation again. So, it is up to the government to give the right assurances,” he said. The availability of transportation is the difference between last year and this, said Chandrabhushan Sahani, who had hitchhiked to Bihar from Bengaluru during the 2020 lockdown. He added that he had no choice but to return to Bengaluru. “There were not enough jobs back home, so we returned. Now, trains are still running. That is a good sign. We can go anytime we need. But we are unsure if they will shut it down. There is a lot of talk about a lockdown,” he said. Karnataka labour minister Shivaram Hebbar said the government does not believe in extreme steps, like lockdown. “The chief minister has made it clear, and we will take care of those working in our state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-yet-to-witness-reverse-migration-of-labourers-but-fear-of-lockdown-lurks-101618427273319.html

Three fishermen were killed and nine went missing after a fishing boat collided with a foreign vessel off the coast of Mangaluru early on Tuesday.The statement added that the two rescued fishermen have been shifted to safety ashore and three bodies have been recovered so far. The search is on for the remaining nine fishermen, the statement said.Watch: Indian Navy divers recover 3 fishermen’s bodies off Mangaluru coast“It was reported that an Indian Fishing Boat ‘IFB Rabah’ with 14 fishermen embarked had suffered a collision with a Singapore flag merchant ship ‘MV APL Le Havre’, 40 nautical miles west of New Mangalore at about 0200 hours (2 am) on April 13. Indian Naval Ships Tillanchang and Kalpeni along with naval aircraft from Goa were deployed in the area to augment SAR efforts of Coast Guard vessels,” read the statement from the ministry.“To assist in the rescue efforts INS Subhadra, a patrol vessel was sailed from Karwar with a Diving Team embarked. The ship arrived on the scene in the early hours of April 14. Two specialist diving teams are undertaking snagline search in the area in an effort to locate the sunken fishing craft,” the statement added.C K Jaffar, the owner of the mechanised boat Rabah from Beypore in Kerala, on Tuesday said the delay in the rescue had resulted in the death. “The Singapore cruise liner which hit the boat alerted Coast Guard officials. Coast Guard began the search in the morning. Delay resulted in the loss of lives,” he said.On Tuesday, the rescue operations were led by the Indian Coast Guard with the help of local fishermen. The two rescued have been identified as Sunil Das of West Bengal and Velu Murugan of Tamil Nadu. Seven of the fishermen are from Tamil Nadu and the remaining from West Bengal and Odisha.Meanwhile, the Mangaluru Police said that as per the preliminary information, the boat set sail from Beypore in Kerala.

15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s 24x7 water supply project to be high on green gains||Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of groundwater and cutback in water wastage in the city from existing 36% to 15% are some of the environmental gains that will come along the 24x7 water supply project once it’s fully implemented. The work on the ambitious ₹500-crore project is set to start in February 2022.“In addition to 24x7 water supply to Chandigarh households, the project will reduce carbon dioxide emission by 5.2 lakh tonne up to FY 2039-40,” said Chandigarh Smart City Limited chief general manager NP Sharma. He added that the project qualifies as ‘climate’ as well as ‘clean technology’ programme as the total greenhouse gas emissions will reach a lower level than the carbon dioxide emitted by the existing system.Chandigarh Smart City Limited will get a loan of about ₹400 crore from French firm Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the remaining ₹100-crore grant from the European Union (EU) to execute the project, which will ensure 24-hour water supply daily.“The project envisages improving the water supply system with better energy efficient devices and increasing the reach of water supply to every household. This will help in energy saving, ultimately leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lesser demand of groundwater,” Sharma said.Water is the primary medium through which climate change influences the earth’s ecosystem. In Chandigarh, due to continuously rising population, the water demand is being met by the groundwater resources.There are 248 tubewells provided by the Chandigarh municipal corporation for water supply directly into the underground reservoir as well as the distribution network. The tubewells are operated for six to 22 hours daily. However, due to substantial pumping, deeper aquifers are under great stress and have been depicting declining water levels.“Chandigarh is growing warmer since it came up in 50s. This is due to rapid development and change in intensified climate conditions of hydrological cycle. Such climate variability and change influence the groundwater systems both directly through replenishment by recharge and indirectly through changes in groundwater use, which are further modified by the land use change activities in Chandigarh,” states the project report. “The project scheme will decrease and ultimately cutoff the usage of groundwater, which would ultimately lower the pressure on underground water. This will help in improving the groundwater condition and micro-climatic conditions of Chandigarh,” Sharma said. The project also aims to improve the social conditions in the city. “Improved water supply system will upgrade the overall socio-economic condition too. Also, decrease in water-related diseases; leakage reduction; improved usage-based billing will provide community-based adaptation, which aims to achieve climate change adaptation in tandem with development goals,” he added.

Gupta runs a gymnasium, the officer said.“As per the initial probe, on April 1 the policeman went to meet Sanjay Gupta in Uttam Nagar. Some argument happened there and some people began beating the policeman,” said the DCP.The video footage showed two men repeatedly slapping the policeman who was seated on a sofa, even as a second policeman made some attempts to intervene.The policeman being assaulted was in his uniform and appeared to be carrying a gun, but the video did not show him attempting to strike back.What issue led to the alleged argument and the assault remained unclear, the DCP said.The matter was not directly brought to the police’s notice and it emerged only after the video clip surfaced.“Prima facie a case of assault on police person appears to be made out. However, Delhi Police takes such matters very seriously. An enquiry into the incident is underway and appropriate action will be taken in due course,” part of a statement released by the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/video-shows-cop-being-slapped-in-uttamnagar-101618427032826.html

Police caught three candidates who had covered their bluetooth mics under their masks, said Rajeev Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north). While they were initially unable to locate the earpiece, a doctoral examination later revealed “micro” audio devices hidden in the ears of the candidates. Police said the audio devices used in the racket were not the usual ones available in the market and were specially procured to carry out the crime.A subsequent probe eventually led to the arrest of a man from north Delhi’s Burari who worked as a peon for the Haryana government. “This peon revealed that he too obtained the job by similar means. We are verifying that,” said Ranjan.According to the DCP, the peon, after getting the job, saw an opportunity for cheating using these tiny bluetooth devices which could be easily hidden inside masks. “The gang also noticed that searching and frisking of candidates at examination centres were being avoided due to the pandemic,” said the DCP.He allegedly had a network of people who would help the candidates with answers from outside the examination centre. “Candidates for the court peon exam were charged ₹7 lakh each,” said Ranjan.While police went on to arrest six more of his associates, apart from the three candidates, they have not revealed the names of the accused as they fear it may alert the others involved in the racket. While the peon allegedly appeared to be a central figure in the racket, police said the mastermind is still absconding.According to police, the arrested peon would allegedly scout for prospective applicants not only among his contacts in the government sector, but also through his Youtube channel which promised help in cracking the exams.The use of a SIM card registered using fake documents and posing as an exam consultant allegedly helped the peon use the Youtube channel without fear of getting caught.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/how-micro-bluetooth-devices-and-lax-checks-due-to-covid-helped-run-an-exam-cheating-racket-101618426975314.html

15-04-2021||Delhi||At least 500 take ill after consuming buckwheat flour||Several residents of Kalyanpuri in east Delhi had to be admitted to different hospitals after they complained of stomach aches, ostensibly after consuming buckwheat flour between Tuesday night and Wednesday evening. While no deaths wee reported, police fear the total number of people affected is around 500.Police suspect food poisoning, and have already arrested the proprieter of a general store. Buckwheat flour is usually consumed during Navratri.The alleged mass food poisoning came to light on Tuesday night after several residents reached Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital, complaining of stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhoea; some even lost consciousness. A stream of patients kept reaching hospitals, officials said. “Till Wednesday evening, roughly around 500 people were reportedly affected. Most of the patients have reported that they had consumed buckwheat flour in some form or the other,” said a senior police officer.DCP (east) Deepak Yadav said they have registered a case under IPC sections 273 (selling noxious food or drink), 284 (using poisonous substance to endanger human life) and 337 (causing hurt or endangering life negligently) at Kalyanpuri police station, and arrested Bunty Lal, the proprietor of Bunty General Store.“Further investigation is on. Our teams are trying to find out who had sold the flour to the residents and from where it had been sourced. Source of the adulterated flour is being traced. It is also being checked if more shops in the area had sold the flour to people,” the DCP said.In a similar case reported from south Delhi, six members of a family from Mehrauli also fell ill after consuming buckwheat in the early hours of Wednesday. Police said they were all admitted in Fortis hospital, and were discharged after treatment.DCP (south) Atul Thakur said the family members are now stable. “We have collected samples of the flour from the shop from where they had bought it. No other customer who had bought the flour from there made a similar complaint. The sample has been sent for testing. We have registered a case under similar sections,” Thakur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-least-500-take-ill-after-consuming-buckwheat-flour-101618426912719.html
15-04-2021||Other||Portal to map evictions in Delhi since 1990||New Delhi: Hundreds of families reportedly lost their homes in 13 slum clusters in Delhi during the coronavirus outbreak last year, as per the Missing Basti project--a web portal launched on Wednesday for mapping evictions in the national capital.The Missing Basti project--started by a group of civil society members and land rights activists--is an initiative to archive past and ongoing evictions in Delhi to “question as well as mobilize action for the prevention of further evictions,” said members. Gautam Bhan, urban researcher and member of the Missing Basti project, said, “This is an attempt to put all the data available on eviction in one place. Close to 300 evictions have happened in the city since 1990. How can you build an inclusive city by evicting the workers who run the city? All the new highways, roads, buildings which have come up in the city are built on the back of evictions. On one side, we have the narrative for housing for all and inclusive city, but on the other side, there are evictors who have destroyed the homes of people who have spent years constructing them...This is the beginning of asking questions about the city.”Shakeel Ahmed, convener of Basti Suraksha Manch, and a member of the project, said, “It is unfortunate that people were rendered homeless during the pandemic, which was a tough period for everyone. These people didn’t even have a place to go.”As per information available on the website, people from at least 280 slum clusters have been evicted since 1990. Members of the project said information about future evictions will be updated on the portal on a regular basis.Swati Janu, architect and founder of Social Design Collaborative, said, “It (the portal) is a repository of evictions in Delhi since 1990. The data has been provided by various academics and housing rights organisations, who have been closely working with people living in slum clusters or JJ clusters.”Land rights activists said government agencies evict people from slums without rehabilitating them despite there being a policy for the same. Mukta Naik, a fellow member at Centre for Policy Research, said, “The idea is to show what is usually not seen. You hear of evictions in the city, but people don’t realise the scale of it. We wanted to create a visual archive to help the general public, who are not working on urban issues, get an idea about the scale of the eviction and where it has happened. Though there is a policy in place for rehabilitation in Delhi, it has not been very successful.”Janu said while some evictions, such as the one in Kathputli Colony, were widely reported, there are many which don’t get the due attention due to various reasons. “Our attempt has been to record all the evictions. We don’t always know the exact number of people impacted by these evictions, but we are working on adding more information so that the general public can get an idea about the severity of the problem.”Janu added, “There are many similar initiatives world over such as Just Space and Living Maps in London or the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project in San Francisco.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/portal-to-map-evictions-in-delhi-since-1990-101618426913285.html
15-04-2021||Pune||Pune sees a stronger second Covid wave||The Covid pandemic has wreaked havoc on 31-year-old Shraddha Shinde’s family. Last August, the Sahakarnagar resident tested positive for Covid-19 along with her father-in-law. This year, her husband’s uncle tested positive and died on April 11. In both instances, Shinde’s family struggled for health care support – last year, for a bed, and this year, for oxygen support. “My father-in-law was a senior citizen and seeing the drop in his oxygen levels our family doctors recommended that we get him admitted. He was admitted at the PMC jumbo centre. Those were really tough days for our family but both of us recovered [Shinde isolated herself at home] and we were beginning to get back to normal life. However, this year again the virus struck, and we lost a family member.” On Wednesday Pune recorded 7,887 fresh cases, taking the tally up to 679,313 of which 112,213 are active. As cases in soar, patients are being turned away due to bed shortage. By comparison, during the first wave, the highest number of cases reported was on September 16 at 5,049. This month, most major hospitals in Pune city have already run out of ventilators and ICU beds; only 27 ICU beds with ventilators were free (out of 1,181 in the district), while 685 isolation beds with oxygen were free (out of 10,228). The demand for oxygen in the district has gone up by over 350% in the first four months of 2021. Overall, only 3,552 beds out of 23,640 beds were vacant on April 14 in Pune. In both waves, Pune district has been one of the worst hit. In fact, if Maharashtra is driving India’s second wave, Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur are the four big urban centres driving Maharashtra’s daily caseload; in the first four days of April, they accounted for 59% of the state’s cases. But this year, there is one crucial difference: vaccination. “While my father-in-law got the vaccine, my husband’s uncle did not take the vaccine and had co-morbidity conditions. Everyone must get themselves vaccinated without any delay as each day they are risking the exposure to infection,” Shinde said. Although Mumbai and Pune have more than 10 million population, the density in Pune district is less than that of Mumbai city, leading experts to ask an important question: why is Pune so highly affected this time around? Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer explains that Pune had reported a similar trend during the H1N1 pandemic, and he attributes it to the city’s climate. However, studies have found little correlation between the spread of the disease and the climate, stressing on the fact that it is the behaviour of humans that affects how fast the virus actually spreads. Awate also pointed out that Pune’s density could also be a possible factor to consider. “40% of Pune’s population is urbanized, and the density is far higher than the state average. The decadal growth rate of Pune’s population density is 36 while Mumbai’s is -5.75.” Then there is the issue with Pune’s poor health infrastructure. He said, “Though Pune managed surveillance activities well in the initial phase of the pandemic with the help of manpower pulled from various other departments, it’s difficult to sustain the tempo once this manpower is withdrawn during the declining phase of the disease. In cities like Pune, it is breath-taking to keep pace with a rapidly growing population in terms of building health infrastructure. Sassoon hospital is the only government tertiary care centre for its 4 million population. Even for Covid-19, only 23 percent of dedicated beds are available in government institutions. Covid-19 pandemic laid open these inadequacies substantially.” Pune’s Naidu hospital which was the first Covid-19 hospital in the state and was pivotal in fighting H1N1 pandemic too did not have a ventilator for months into pandemic. During both waves, the city faced shortages: of beds, Remdesivir (the anti-viral drug) and also, oxygen supply. In terms of vaccination, however, Pune has taken the lead. For over a week the district vaccinated the highest number of beneficiaries in the state. Pune has administered 1,519,763 doses already. By comparison, Mumbai has administered 1,768,939 as of Tuesday. In the sero survey conducted reported on August 18 in five small wards in the highly infected areas, a sero positivity rate of about 51.5% was recorded, indicating that half the population had developed antibodies. This raises the question of the effectiveness of antibodies. DR Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government for Covid-19, who himself got infected after taking the jab (to be sure, the jab does not give 100% immunity against the virus, but it does provide immunity against severity and death) said, “It remains to be seen what duration the antibodies remain effective for. Although people may be infected even after vaccination, the chances of hospitalization fall drastically like in my case.” He had also written to the state government to investigate whether the new double mutant strain of the virus – a variant found in samples from Maharashtra, announced by the Centre last month -- is escaping the antibodies. A Central team which visited the 30 most affected districts in the state, including Pune, last week found that adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour was lacking. This bears out: by April 9, the district administration had recovered ₹28.31 crores from 6.26 lakh violators for not wearing a mask or spitting in public. Pune was also one of the first districts to be declared as a containment zone on April 19, 2020, when Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural Pune was declared as a containment zone to contain the spread. Following this, multiple restrictions through mini lockdowns continued, but implementation remained a problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-sees-a-stronger-second-covid-wave-101618426854528.html

15-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi starts rolling out Union govt’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme||The Delhi government has implemented the Centre’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy in Seemapuri, a senior government official said on Wednesday.The order was issued on Monday under directions from Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain. “‘One nation, one ration card’ scheme and portability option may be launched in fair price shops in Seemapuri circle and new fair price shops will be set up for doorstep delivery of food grains under the National Food Security Act on pilot basis,” said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.The development comes weeks after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government got into a tussle with the Centre after the latter objected to the state government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme. While the Delhi government has dropped the word “Mukhyamantri (chief minister)” from the name of the scheme, its implementation still remains uncertain.Besides the nomenclature of the scheme, the Centre had also objected to the Delhi government changing the mode of delivery of ration being provided under the National Food Security Act, which, it said, is not possible without amending the law.In its letter on March 19, red-flagging the proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme in Delhi, a copy of which HT has seen, the central government also asked the Delhi government why it had still not implemented the “one nation, one ration card” policy.The doorstep ration delivery scheme, too, was supposed to be launched in Seemapuri circle on March 25. The circle has 42 fair price shops, out of total 2,050 functional ration shops in Delhi.The senior Delhi government official quoted above said that since the implementation of the scheme on Monday, 38 ration card holders from other states – 19 of them from Bihar, 18 from Uttar Pradesh and one from Jharkhand -- have availed its benefit.Under the ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy, which was launched in 2019, a person holding a ration card issued under the National Food Security Act, 2013, can collect their monthly quota of food grains from any fair price shop in the country.The policy has so far been implemented in 17 states, including Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, and UPEarlier this month, the Delhi government also started delivering ration with biometric e-PoS machines under a pilot project.The e-POS mechanism was discontinued in Delhi in 2018 based on complaints that many elderly or those who could not reach the shops were being deprived of their share due to technical glitches.A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the matter .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme-takes-off-in-seemapuri-101618426792765.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Fix recurring water shortage problem, Raghav Chadhav asks Haryana CM in letter||Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha on Wednesday wrote to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, seeking prompt solutions to the recurring water shortage problems in Delhi that the utility has long blamed on the neighbouring state.Chadha, who is also an Aam Aadmi Party MLA, on Tuesday warned that large parts of Delhi are likely to witness a shortage of water starting Wednesday, as Haryana, in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines, was sharing a lower than the mandated portion of Yamuna water with Delhi, and was not adhering to safe pollution levels.Chadha, in his letter to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday, said that Delhi was facing a double whammy because of a significant reduction in raw water supply and high ammonia levels in the Yamuna water released from Haryana.“Delhi is facing frequent crises in terms of raw water supply... which adversely impacts the drinking water supply of major areas, including diplomatic missions/embassies, President House, Supreme Court, high court, and at hospitals treating Covid-19 patients of Delhi and neighbouring states. I implore you to, and I am sure you will, extend your cooperation on humanitarian grounds keeping in mind unprecedented emergency of Covid-19,” Chadha wrote.Several parts of Delhi faced water shortage on Wednesday after two of the three water treatment plants in the city could not be operated at optimum capacity because of high ammonia levels.The areas that were worst hit were Vijay Nagar, Timarpur, Khyber Pass, Old Secretariat, Civil Lines, Lahori Gate, Old Sabzi Mandi, Naya Bazaar, Peeli Kothi, Malka Ganj, Motia Khan, Jhandewalan, Baraf Khana, Patparganj, Pusa Road, Rajinder Nagar, Karol Bagh and Giri NagarA senior Haryana government official rejected the allegations by Delhi government, saying the state was receiving 20-25% less water received from the Bhakra reservoir and 50% less from the Yamuna river. This is causing shortage in drinking water supply in Haryana, he said.Chadha, in his letter, said that two water treatment plants in Delhi — Wazirabad and Chandrawal — sourced water from Yamuna. He said that the quantity and quality of water at the Wazirabad barrage depended on the release of raw water by Haryana. “On many occasions, the quality of water available at the Wazirabad barrage is not fit for treatment because of the concentration of pollutants, particularly ammonia, which results in partial or complete shutdown of two water treatment plants. Given that the two plants cumulatively produce about 228 MGD (million gallons per day) of potable water, thid shutdown, when accompanied by a short supply of raw water, adversely affects the availability of drinking water supply to the people of Delhi,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fix-recurring-water-shortage-problem-raghav-chadhav-asks-haryana-cm-in-letter-101618426735477.html

15-04-2021||Noida||Two arrested for killing friend in Bisrakh||Greater Noida: Police on Wednesday arrested two persons over allegedly killing their friend in Bisrakh last month. The suspects were identified as Nazrul Khan, 30, a resident of Jaitpur in Delhi, and Suleman, 40, a resident of Amnabad in Bisrakh. According to the police, they had allegedly murdered their friend Firoz, 32, a resident of Roza Jalalpur, outside Suleman’s rented accommodation on March 3.Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that the three were consuming liquor outside Suleman’s rented house in Greater Noida west. “The two suspects, under the influence of alcohol, attacked Firoz with bricks and killed him. The suspects dumped the body at a deserted location and fled the spot,” he said.The complaint in the matter was filed by sub-inspector Rajeev Kumar at the Bisrakh police station against unknown persons under Section 302 (murder) and Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence). Elamaran said there was no complainant and it was a “blind” case.The police team launched an investigation and started scanning mobile phones networks active in the area at the time. “We noticed a mobile number which had dialled 112 two-three times that day and the day after. We contacted the person, who identified himself as a local contractor. He informed that a person, later identified as Suleman, had been absconding from his home since the body was found in the neighbourhood,” he said. The police then arrested Suleman, who allegedly revealed that he and Nazrul killed Firoz, following which Nazrul was also arrested. “Nazrul revealed that he had talked to the victim’s wife on the phone a few times. The victim started blackmailing him and demanding liquor, or he would file a police complaint. On the day of the incident, they were drinking and had an argument over the same issue. The two suspects hit Firoz with bricks and killed him,” the senior police officer said. The police recovered the victim’s mobile phone and Aadhar card allegedly from suspects’ possession. The two suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-arrested-for-killing-friend-in-bisrakh-101618426614395.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Class 12 students welcome CBSE move to defer exam||School principals and students on Wednesday welcomed the postponement of Class 12 CBSE board exams in view of the second surge of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, but questioned the feasibility of conducting exams after June, saying the board should come up with an alternative assessment scheme.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday cancelled Class 10 board exams and postponed Class 12 exams. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The board exams were scheduled to be held between May 4 and June 14. The CBSE said it will review the situation after June 1 and announce the fresh examination dates for Class 12 at least 15 days in advance.The demands for cancellation of board exams had been raised from various quarters. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia on Tuesday appealed to the Centre to cancel the exams, saying they could contribute to a large-scale spread of Covid-19.Rihan Sharma, a Class 12 student at a government boys senior secondary school in Karol Bagh, said: “I am really relieved that the board has postponed the exams and not cancelled them. We should have proper offline exams in Class 12, whenever the situation becomes normal.”Darshan Ram, a Class 12 student at Bluebells School International, said, “Postponing exams was the wisest decision in the present scenario. But what will happen if the situation continues to remain the same after June 1? It will delay the entire academic cycle once again. The government should have prepared some uniform alternative evaluation criteria for both classes 10 and 12 in the last one year, taking into consideration how exams were cancelled last time as well.”Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road, welcomed CBSE’s decision of postponing exams. “The safety of students and teachers is most important in the present scenario. The board has given a window that talks about a review of the situation. It’s an extraordinary situation wherein we can’t take decisions every minute,” she said.Many principals, however, did not agree with the demand for an alternative assessment method for Class 12. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “We cannot assess Class 12 students using some other method in the absence of any standardised way of internal assessments. Maybe some schools follow strict marking schemes in internal exams and practicals and others do not. This will be injustice to many students. Besides, Class 12 marks are directly linked with students’ college admissions. Many universities take admissions directly on the basis of these marks,” she said.Some schools heads disagreed with this view. They said some “innovative” way of assessment should be explored. Awadesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “Schools should allocate marks to their students. CBSE should instruct schools to issue scores based on the best of the previous three years of school’s result.”Education expert Meeta Sengupta said the board should try to come up with some “innovative” ways to assess Class 12 students. “The best possible decision right now was to postpone exam. But now the CBSE should come up with some innovative way to conduct Class 12 exams. They can call small groups of students in staggered manner and take exams in a different way,” Sengupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/principals-students-welcome-postponement-of-class-12-exams-101618426614919.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha lockdown: Inter-district travel allowed, no need for e-pass||Director-general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey on Wednesday said that the people travelling inter-district for important work would not be stopped and such citizens will not need any police permission or e-pass. Pandey said police will not use force if people follow the rules. “We have asked all our unit heads to show maximum restraint while imposing movement restrictions,” said the DGP. Last year several videos of policemen beating pedestrians and publicly punishing and insulting them for violating lockdown restrictions went viral on social media. Sensing the anger and frustration among the public, traders and daily wage earners, both the state police chief and the Mumbai Police commissioner have instructed the force to go soft on those stepping out for unavoidable important work. The state police chief said that a full force of nearly two lakh personnel would be on lockdown duty. In addition to this 22 companies of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and 13,280 home guards would be put on lockdown duty as and when required. Mumbai and Nagpur Police have been given three and two SRPF companies, respectively. “We will coordinate with other government agencies to ensure that the spread of the virus is prevented,” Pandey said.Speaking about the spread of infection among police personnel across the state, Pandey said since the pandemic began last year, a total of 36,728 police personnel got infected by the virus. Of them, 373 have died due to the infection. Presently, 3,160 personnel are infected by the virus, while the remaining have recovered and resumed duty.Policemen above the age of 50 years with co-morbidities have been asked to take rest.Additional director general of police Kulwant Sarangal said that 81% policemen in the state have been vaccinated with the first dose, while 41% have received the second dose as well.As regards to lockdown violations, so far 3.23 lakh FIRs have been registered across the state since the pandemic began last March and 47,302 offenders have been arrested.Top cop’s directivesMumbai Police commissioner (CP) Hemant Nagrale has urged the police personnel in Mumbai to adopt a humane approach when dealing with people compelled to step out and to not be ruthless while imposing the statewide lockdown.Given the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, the government has announced lockdown and night curfew across the state for the next 15 days, starting from Wednesday at 8pm. Against this backdrop, CP has also urged citizens to cooperate and help in battling the deadly infection.In a video message issued on Wednesday, Nagrale has instructed policemen in Mumbai to not hit, punish poor people venturing out for important work during the lockdown and instead help them. “Adopt a human approach while dealing with such people. Don’t punish them in front of their family members and insult them. Instead, help the needy,” he said. Nagrale has urged policemen to be careful and safeguard themselves from getting infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-lockdown-inter-district-travel-allowed-no-need-for-epass-101618426613807.html
15-04-2021||Other||Hotels and banquets to boost Covid-19 bed count||New Delhi: With the number of Covid-19 cases in the capital increasing at an unprecedented pace, the Delhi government on Wednesday ordered linking of 23 private and five government hospitals with hotels and banquet halls to manage moderate patients who do not need strict monitoring. According to the order signed by health secretary Amit Singla, the hotels requisitioned included Raddison Blue, The Surya, and Crowne Plaza. As many as 100 rooms were reserved in Raddison Blue hotel in Paschim Vihar, which is linked to Maharaja Agrasen hospital in Punjabi Bagh. At least 200 rooms will be reserved in Surya, which is linked to Holy Family hospital, 150 beds in hotel Crowne Plaza, Rohini, which has been linked to Fortis Shalimar Bagh and another 200 rooms in the hotel’s Okhla branch has been attached with Apollo hospital. BLK hospital has been linked with 60 beds in JP Siddharth. Last year too, the government linked hotels and banquet halls to the hospitals to provide additional beds for moderate patients. The linked hotels will provide room, housekeeping, disinfection, and food to the patients while the hospitals will provide the staff, all consumables such as PPE kits, N95 masks, gloves, medicines, and oxygen support. According to the order, five-star hotels will be allowed to charge a maximum of ₹5,000 per patient per day and the four and three star hotels can charge Rs4,000 for the services rendered. In addition, the hospitals can charge ₹5,000 per patient per bed and an additional ₹2,000 for oxygen support. Any investigations needed will be chargeable as per hospital rates, the order said. “The rates of the banquet halls/ other facilities will be provided by divisional commissioner in due course,” a second order signed by Singhla read. In a separate order, the health secretary also asked for 678 more ward beds, 182 more ICU beds without ventilators, and 28 more ICU beds with ventilators in three Delhi government hospitals, including the biggest hospital in the trans-Yamuna region, Guru Teg Bahadur. With the current addition, all 1,500 beds in the GTB hospital will be utilised for Covid-19 services. The civic authorities on Wednesday appealed to the government to utilise municipal establishments, such as community centres and sports complexes, for creating temporary Covid care centres (CCC) or isolation facilities. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to make its Balakram Hospital in Timarpur a CCC. Authorities have also written to the state government to convert Hindu Rao Hospital into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. Earlier too, during the third wave of Covid-19 in October-November last year, the Hindu Rao Hospital, which has 980 beds, was turned into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. “Everyday 30-40 Covid-19 patients are coming to Hindu Rao Hospital. Hence, today (Wednesday), I have written to the Delhi government to make this a Covid-19 dedicated facility as was done before. We have also decided to start a Covid care centre of 200 beds at Balakram Hospital, where patients can get themselves tested and those with mild symptoms can also be isolated there,” said North MCD mayor Jai Prakash.“We are planning to create small isolation centres at our community centres and schools with 50 beds each. This infrastructure can be used by the government,” Prakash said.There are nearly 119 community centres, four stadiums and four sports complex with the North Corporation. Similarly the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) runs 97 community centres. The east civic body has 71 community centres.Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said that the municipality wants to support the government in fight against Covid-19 but they will have to provide resources.“Our dispensaries, mother and child care centres are already being used as vaccination centres, which has helped a lot in vaccination process. So in the same manner if the state government wants they can use over community halls and schools as covid care centres or isolation wards to increase the number of beds,” Chawla said.A senior official at the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, on the condition of anonymity, said that last year when there was surge in covid cases, the EDMC has on its own converted some community halls into isolation wards but they were never used by the government. “So to avoid any such situation this time, we will wait for the government’s requirement. We are offering our infrastructure in fight against covid and if they want they can use these community halls as extended covid facilities,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hotels-and-banquets-to-boost-covid-19-bed-count-101618426613236.html
15-04-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: 20 fall sick after consuming food made of kuttu flour||Greater Noida: Around 20 persons fell sick after consuming spurious food items in Rabupura in Greater Noida on Tuesday night. They have been admitted to a local hospital in Kakod, Bulandshahr where their condition is stable, said officials, adding that the food item in question was kuttu (buckwheat) flour.RP Singh, food safety officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said: “We received information that some people fell sick after eating food items made from kuttu ke laddu, in Jochana village in Greater Noida. A team visited the spot and found that all these people had been admitted to a hospital in Kakod,” he said.Kakod and Jochana villages are near to each other. The patients had complained of stomach-ache and vomiting after consuming the laddu, said officials.Singh said that around 10 persons were treated and discharged on Wednesday morning. “Primary investigation showed that these people had bought kuttu flour from a local grocer. It appears there was some problem with the flour used in making the laddu.” The shop owner, Shushil, had allegedly bought the product from a wholesale market in Bulandshahr, said the officer, adding that food poisoning was reported from Hajipur and Jhanjhar as well, besides Jochana, and that these people had allegedly bought buckwheat flour from the same shop. The food safety department issued a fine to the shop owner and sealed the shop. “We have also taken a sample and sent it for investigation,” he said. The food safety department also conducted a raid at another grocery shop and seized 450 kg of buckwheat flour, which they said was looking suspicious, in Rabupura on Wednesday. Dinesh Kumar, station house officer, Rabupura police station, said that the food department is investigating the matter. “All the patients are admitted to a hospital in Bulandshahr. We have not received a complaint in this regard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-20-fall-sick-after-consuming-food-made-of-kuttu-flour-101618426612692.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI questions Anil Deshmukh about allegations of graft||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for about 11 hours in connection with the allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Responding to summons issued by CBI, Deshmukh reached the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guest house at Santacruz (east) shortly after 10am on Wednesday. CBI officers said Deshmukh was questioned about the allegations and his statement was recorded. CBI had issued summons to the NCP leader on April 12 as part of its preliminary enquiry registered on April 6, a day after the Bombay high court (HC) directed the central agency to probe the serious allegations against Deshmukh. He stepped down from the post of home minister on April 5, shortly after the HC ordered the CBI probe.The central agency has so far questioned Deshmukh’s personal assistant Sanjeev Palande, personal secretary Kundan Shinde, Param Bir Singh, deputy commissioner police (enforcement) Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police (social service branch) Sanjay Patil, suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, and two police drivers attached to the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) of Mumbai Police’s crime branch. CBI has also questioned a few bar owners in connection with the alleged extortion.In a letter addressed to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that on several occasions Deshmukh had summoned some Mumbai Police officers such as Bhujbal, Patil, and Vaze, who has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Antilia bomb scare case, and instructed them to extort ₹100 crore monthly from various establishments, especially dance bars, in the city.Singh’s letter also added that Deshmukh had told the officers that ₹50 crore could be easily collected by extorting ₹3-4 lakh from each of the 1,750 licensed establishments in Mumbai, and the rest from other sources. Singh said Vaze had informed him about Deshmukh’s demands. In addition, Singh also alleged that Deshmukh interfered in policing affairs.Singh was shunted out by Deshmukh from the post of Mumbai Police chief on March 17 and was posted as commandant general of Home Guards and Civil Defence, three days after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Vaze for allegedly planting an explosive-laden vehicle near Antilia, the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, on February 25 with a threatening note, and also for his alleged involvement in Mansukh Hiran murder case.Soon after registration of an offence in the Antilia bomb scare case, Singh had transferred the case to the CIU, which was then headed by Vaze. NIA later also found that during the course of investigation for one-and-half day in the Antilia case, Vaze had collected and systematically destroyed evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cbi-questions-anil-deshmukh-about-allegations-of-graft-101618426552755.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha lockdown: New curbs in effect, citizens still confused||As Maharashtra went under a 15-day curfew along with other strict restrictions from Wednesday evening to break the chain of transmission, confusion prevailed over who could travel in public transport and private vehicles, and services allowed under e-commerce. Senior government officials said the “chaos” prompted it to prepare/issue a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).Hours before the curfew kicked in, citizens, especially in major cities, including Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad, thronged shops and departmental stores to stock up groceries and other essential items. The state has exempted shops and stores selling essential items from the curfew. In Mumbai, migrants flocked to the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and Dadar railway stations to return to their home states. However, there is no restriction on travel with valid tickets. Also, outstation trains, flights etc. will continue to operate.A senior bureaucrat said, “There was a lot of chaos. People went to train stations to leave the city. We wish to inform everybody that all outstation trains are operational and will remain so. Local trains too will be available to use for general public with valid reason such as visiting somebody in the hospital, vaccination etc.” The restrictions however will remain for people travelling far from home in private vehicles, the bureaucrat, who did not wish to be named, added. “If someone drives from Mumbai to Lonavala, they shouldn’t, unless they have a home there and a valid reason to visit.”The state in its order on Tuesday allowed supply of essential goods and services through e-commerce sites. However, there was confusion if non-essential items would be allowed. “E-commerce firms can only deliver essential items such as food grains and medicines etc. They will not be allowed to deliver items such as clothing, footwear etc.” the official added. The state faced stiff opposition from retailers’ association for allowing e-commerce sites to sell non-essential goods. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday issued an order, in keeping with its previous order, allowing maids, cooks, drivers, medical attendants providing services to senior citizens at home between 7am and 10pm on all days. The order, issued by BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, allowed all online home deliveries of food and essential supplies through e-commerce service providers such as Zomato, Swiggy, etc for 24 hours, on all days of the week. During the weekend lockdown, takeaways from restaurants are not allowed in person. However, home deliveries are allowed. Besides, wine and beer shops in the city would also be allowed to sell liquor via home delivery only. While appealing to the people to follow all rules and support the police force, newly appointed state home minister Dilip Walse Patil said the restrictions will put a strain on the police force. “We are definitely facing a big challenge in the state and the government had put restrictions to curb the spread. They (the restrictions) will definitely put a strain on the police force. However, instructions have been given to the force to tackle the situation with utmost restraint,” he said.Meanwhile, as opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued its criticism of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) over the relief package given to some sections of society, MVA ministers said that BJP has been affected by a “disease to criticize”, and also asked if the Centre gave any package to people when it announced a complete lockdown last year.State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The last time when lockdown was announced by the Centre no help was given to common man. Today, when the state has put a lockdown, we have given nearly ₹5,500-crore help to people.” Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh asked, “Did the Centre provide any such package when they announced a lockdown?” Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the government has left out sections of society that constitute a major work force in its relief package. Wadettiwar said that he is going to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday to seek inclusion of the barber community and Bara Balutedar community in the relief package.

The BCAS, which comes under the ministry of civil aviation, is the regulatory authority for civil aviation security in the country.“A great news! The security clearance and vetting for Phase I of the Noida International Airport has been received from BCAS also, and has already been received from the other regulating authorities,” tweeted SP Goyal, additional chief secretary to UP chief minister. The UP government has also approved a proposal for land acquisition for the second phase of the project, officials of Gautam Budh Nagar administration said.Suhas LY, GB Nagar district magistrate, said that the clearance of BCAS is a milestone for Noida International Airport. “This means we are getting closer to the project. This is a significant project for this region, the state and the country. This will usher a new era in terms of development and growth multiplier,” he said. A total of 1,334 hectares were acquired for the first phase of the airport which will be developed in four phases. For the second phase, 1,365 hectares will be acquired, while 1,318 hectares for phase 3 and 735 hectares for phase 4 will be acquired. Balram Singh, ADM (land acquisition) GB Nagar, said that the UP government has approved the proposal for acquisition of land for the second phase. “The government also released ₹1,084 crore for the second phase of land acquisition. The administration will soon conduct a social impact assessment study and then start the land acquisition for phase 2,” he said.Meanwhile, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), which is the nodal agency to monitor the project, has started preparations for the foundation programme of the airport. Yeida officials said that they have issued a request for proposal (RFP) to hire an agency for the programme which will be attended by the prime minister and UP chief minister. The RFP document states that the agency will be responsible for organising the inauguration, bhoomi poojan, and cultural programmes,among others. However, the date of the foundation programme is yet to be announced.“The Yamuna Expressway authority has decided to hire an agency for two years to assist it in organising big events where VIPs and higher dignitaries are expected to attend. This will help us make proper arrangements at a short notice,” said Shailendra Bhatia, officer on special duty, Yeida.Yeida CEO Arunveer Singh was not available for a comment.Swiss company Zurich Airport International AG has been selected as the concessionaire for developing the international airport at Jewar. In total, the airport is projected to have five runways when it is developed to its full capacity over a total of 5,000 hectares of land. There will be two runways in phase 1 and the airport is expected to become operational by 2023-24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jewar-airport-gets-security-clearance-from-aviation-ministry-arm-101618426493229.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Students heave a sigh of relief as board cancels Class 10 exams||Principals, parents and students on Wednesday welcomed the Centre’s decision to cancel the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 exams in view of the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.The decision was announced by the Union education ministry following a high-level meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. The Class 10 students will now be evaluated using an alternative assessment method.While CBSE did not immediately reveal the expected evaluation criteria, board officials said that “it might be done on the basis of internal and practical exams of students”. The board has also announced that if any candidate is not satisfied with the marks allocated, they will be given an opportunity to take an exam as and when the conditions improve.Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said: “It won’t be an issue to evaluate Class 10 students on the basis of internal exams, pre-boards, and practicals. In previous years also, we followed the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system in Class 10, and we have all the criteria in place. We can also do an aptitude test to allot streams to students in Class 11. Under the current circumstances, evaluating students on the basis of internal marks will be less problematic than exposing them to the virus.”Between 2010 and 2017, CBSE followed the CCE system under which students’ marks were replaced by grades which were evaluated through a series of curricular and extra-curricular evaluations along with academics. The external board exam was optional during this period. CBSE had reintroduced compulsory board exams in class 10 in 2018.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School said: “We have already completed all class 10 internal exams and practical exams. We had two pre-board exams as well that can be included while assessing the students.”Several Class 10 students said they are relieved with the cancellation of exams. Vedant Gidra, a Class 10 student at a private school in west Delhi, said: “My parents were really worried about my safety amid the rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi. We are thankful to the government for cancelling our exams and keeping our safety a priority. Most of my friends and I do not have any issue if we get evaluated on the basis of our internals.”Kushagra Sharma, the father of a Class 10 student of Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj, said: “We are grateful that the government put the safety and security of our kids on top priority while taking this decision. We were really worried about the safety of my daughter. We have elderly people at home and her going to the examination centre would have compromised their safety as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/principals-students-welcome-move-to-cancel-class-10-board-exams-101618426433903.html
15-04-2021||Other||Govt allows 14 reserved pvt hospitals to use some beds for emergency care||New Delhi: Two days after designating 14 big private hospitals as dedicated Covid facilities, the Delhi government on Wednesday revised its order allowing the hospitals to use 10%-30% of their beds to provide emergency care as well as follow-up treatment to some of their patients. Only two hospitals, Max Smart Superspeciality hospital and Manipal hospital, remained completely Covid-19 centres after the revised order, which reduced the number of beds accrued from 4,337 beds to 3,553. Big hospitals such as Indraprastha Apollo and Sir Ganga Ram retained nearly 200 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The remainder beds or additional beds in these hospitals shall be used for treatment of non-Covid follow-up patients and patients requiring emergent medical or surgical treatment. Further, the concerned 14 hospitals would be allowed to temporarily increase their bed capacity up to 35% and the additional beds may also be utilised for the treatment of non-Covid patients,” the revised order signed by medical superintendent of Delhi’s nursing home cell Dr RN Das read. The decision to free up beds was taken after a meeting between Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and the representatives from all 14 hospitals. “We met with the health minister today and explained our problems -- of the 14 hospitals, eight are located within 10km, seriously curtailing the chances of non-Covid patients in the region getting emergency care. These are also the biggest hospitals that provide specialised care such as transplant surgeries, complicated brain and spine surgeries and need to follow up these patients regularly. The minister understood our plight and we were told that some beds would be freed up in all the hospitals for non-Covid-19 patients,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary of Delhi Voluntary Hospital’s forum, an association of large private hospitals in the city. He said that during the meeting with the minister, he suggested that smaller nursing homes may be utilised instead to ramp up bed capacity, if needed. Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India), said, “This is our partial victory. These 14 hospitals can carry out the critical procedures. We will therefore not go to court for time being.” The association had prepared a writ petition after the government order. In September, the association had sued the Delhi government after 80% of the ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals had been reserved for Covid-19 treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-allows-14-reserved-pvt-hospitals-to-use-some-beds-for-emergency-care-101618426432768.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena backs MES candidate in Belgaum; Raut campaigns, holds roadshow||Throwing its weight behind Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut campaigned for MES’s Shubham Shelke in Belgaum, Karnataka on Wednesday. However, Raut said the stage of the public rally he was scheduled to address was damaged before he arrived and instead staged a roadshow in Belgaum to campaign for Shelke.Belgaum will go to polls April 17 as a bypoll was necessitated after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Suresh Angadi died due to Covid-19 in September 2020.The region is particularly important for the Sena as these areas have a majority of Marathi-speaking population. Earlier in January, Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had aggressively raised the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute and sought that the disputed areas be made Union Territory till the issue is resolved legally.“Shutting down the campaign rally of an opponent by destroying the stage, microphones and sound system despite permissions is against the democracy and the Election Commission rules. Whoever has given these orders, including the returning officer and district collector, have violated the Constitution today. This is oppression, but it does not affect us; we have been fighting against this injustice. I have come here at the orders of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. The people of Maharashtra are with Belgaum,” Raut told reporters in Belgaum.There is a triangular contest in Belgaum with the MES, BJP and Congress fielding candidates for the sear. The BJP has given the ticket to Mangala Angadi, wife of a former MP, while the Congress fielded Satish Jarkiholi. Shelke could make a dent into the BJP votes as the Marathi-speaking voters could back the party that seeks to include the region in Maharashtra.According to Raut, Shelke is giving a tough fight to the BJP as the national party has deployed Union ministers from Maharashtra to campaign. He said MES and Sena have come together to give “active support” to the young candidate. “It is clear that the MES candidate is giving a tough fight to other candidates. Karnataka CM campaigned here on Wednesday; tomorrow Nitin Gadkari is going to campaign —with such people coming to campaign, it shows that Shelke is giving a tough fight,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-backs-mes-candidate-in-belgaum-raut-campaigns-holds-roadshow-101618426433305.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records 9,931 new cases, tally is 545,195||The city on Wednesday reported 9,931 Covid-19 cases and 54 deaths, taking the tally to 545,195, and toll to 12,147. The city has 86,635 active cases and the case fatality rate is 2.2%. Throughout April, the number of deaths per day in Mumbai has been in double digits as opposed to the figures for February and March, even though the case fatality rate has been steady, owing to the increase in number of cases per day. In the past 14 days, throughout April, Mumbai has seen a total of 457 deaths, as opposed to 215 deaths in March. In the past 14 days, Mumbai has recorded a total of 130,422 covid-19 cases, as opposed to 88,856 cases in the whole of March. The case fatality rate in March was 0.2%, versus 0.3% in April. On April 13, Mumbai reported 27 deaths; on April 12, 43; on April 11, 79 deaths; on April 10, 28 deaths; on April 9, 35 deaths, and on April 8, 25 deaths. Experts and authorities say this is concerning. Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Every death due to Covid-19 is alarming. Our job in the task force is to suggest measures to reduce the number of deaths. Among the main reasons for the deaths in Covid are rapid spread of infections in lungs, delay in reporting to hospital and also delay in testing. Medical attention must be sought right away.” However, Mumbai is also dealing with an overburdened health infrastructure due to the spike in daily cases. Mumbai currently has 4,105 vacant hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, 20% of its total capacity of 20,022. Of the 2,664 ICU beds, only 41 are available in the city; 15 of 1,339 beds ventilator beds are vacant. Of the total capacity of 10,361, 1,444 oxygen beds are available. Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also a part of the government Covid-19 task force, said, “In a pandemic of this magnitude, health infrastructure is burdened. However, out of the total cases that come daily, 80% to 85% do not even require hospitalisation as they are asymptomatic. Not all patients who require hospitalization will require ventilator beds of ICUs.” As per information available with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), for 86,866 active cases in Mumbai, 80% are asymptomatic, 18% are stable symptomatic, and 1.4% are critical. Dr Pandit said, “The present restrictions imposed by the government are needed, so we get time to scale our health infrastructure. In another 15 days, the burden on hospitals will hopefully reduce and more beds will be vacant, following these restrictions.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of the public health department in BMC, said, “The increase in the number of deaths is a matter of concern, even though the CFR is stable. The study is showing most deaths are in senior citizens, or citizens with severe comorbidities. In such cases, the most important aspect is to not waste a lot of time, and take the beds allotted by the civic body. Delay can cause complications in symptoms.” Of the 54 deaths reported on Wednesday, 33 patients had comorbidities, 2 deaths were below 40 years of age, 15 deaths were between the age of 40 years and 60 years, and 37 deaths were in patients above 60 years of age. While the highest number of cases reported in the city during this peak was 11,302 cases on April 4, in the past few days, Mumbai has been reporting under 10,000 cases a day. On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 7,873 cases, on Monday, it reported 6,893 cases, on Sunday it reported 9,986 cases, and on Saturday, it reported 9,330 cases. Kakani said, “We have seen under 10,000 cases per day for the past few days. However, in another week, the picture will become clearer about whether the cases will now begin to plateau, and the effect of the present restrictions in the city will begin to show.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-9-931-new-cases-tally-is-545195-101618426376237.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||How Amravati controlled Covid surge||Amravati district in Vidarbha was the first in the state to witness a surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave. The sudden spike in cases in the second week of February in the district swung the entire state machinery into action, resulting in the imposition of a lockdown and more testing and tracing. The measures helped the machinery bring down the numbers in just four weeks and also set a model, ‘Amravati pattern’, which became a reference point while imposing the stricter curbs, which came into effect on Wednesday night. From less than 100 cases daily till January-end, Amravati reported its highest single-day spike of 1,067 cases in the third week of February. The number was rising rapidly in most urbanised pockets of Achalpur and Warud, straining the health infrastructure to a great extent. While cases were rising in other parts of the state steadily, the cases in Amravati were spiralling at a rapid pace. “We were worried as the health machinery was overwhelmed. We tried the weekend curfew, but it did not work, forcing us to go for the complete lockdown for two weeks until March 8. While imposing a lockdown, we also ensured tracing and testing was ramped up multi-fold. It helped us bring down the cases to 292 on March 9 and 241 on April 5. The positivity rate too was brought down to about 10% by then,” said women and child welfare minister and district’s guardian minister Yashomati Thakur. “We planned the lockdown as well as unlocking in a phased manner. Today, Amravati helps other districts like Buldhana and Nagpur and even other spots like Chhindwara in MP to treat critical patients in need of beds with oxygen and ventilators,” Thakur said. The district administration had identified the pockets with a high number of cases. “We have two huge markets, bordering Achalpur and Warud, with high mobility from Nagpur and even Madhya Pradesh. Most of the cases were from these areas. The positivity rate had gone up to 35%-40%. High-risk contacts were traced, taking the ratio to 19 people per infection and tests were doubled to 5,000 a day. The positive patients were sent to institutional quarantine, while home quarantine was allowed only after taking a ₹25,000 bond to avoid violation. This helped us in reducing the numbers in just two weeks,” said district health officer Dr Dilip Ranmale. “The number of cases in Amravati has reached the level it was two months ago. The number of cases in the state is expected to start reducing by April-end, two months after the rise began,” said Dr Avinash Supe, head of the state-appointed death audit committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-amravati-controlled-covid-surge-101618426375579.html
15-04-2021||Noida||CBSE’s decision on board exams relieves some, miffs few||Noida: The CBSE’s decision to cancel Class 10 exams and postpone Class 12 exams following a surge in Covid-19 cases has evoked a bittersweet response among students, teachers and parents in Noida and Ghaziabad. As per the CBSE order, the Covid-19 situation will be reviewed in June to take a call on the conduct of Class 12 examinations while the result for Class 10 will be declared on the basis of the objective criteria decided by the board.“I am confident about my internal assessment and I am sure I will be promoted to 11th standard. It is a relief that not just the exams are cancelled, we have also been given an option to appear for exams if we are not satisfied with the marks allocated,” said Atish Jha, who studies at Sun Valley International School, Vaishali, in Ghaziabad. Tyakshi Singh, who is a Class 10 student at Army Public School in Noida’s sector 37, was hoping to appear for the Class 10 board exams. “Though I am sure I will be promoted, I think I would have scored better in board exams than the internal exams that were taken by the school,” she said. Meanwhile, students of Class 12 are on the edge. “I had prepared a study schedule according to my board exams and college entrance exams. Now, I will again have to rework my schedule. I hope the board exams don’t get delayed later than June, else they may clash with other exams,” said Astha Singh, who studies at Amity International School, Noida.“It has been over a year that I am stuck in Class 12. I was looking forward to get done with my board exams. We aren’t sure what the Covid-19 situation will be like in future. Last year, board exams were held in September. If the same happens this year too, my whole year will go to waste,” said Saksham Sharma, a Class 12 student of DPS, Noida. The Class 12 exams were scheduled to begin from May 4. “The policy of internal assessment and the option of opting to sit for the exam should also be devised for Class 12 students if the situation remains the same till June to save the crucial year of the students and enable them to apply for courses in foreign universities,” said Rajiv Pant, retired bursar of Sardar Patel Vidyalaya. Meanwhile, school officials welcomed the government decision stating that given how cases are increasing, this is the only solution. “There are 78 CBSE board centres in Noida, where around 500 to 600 students are expected to take the exams. With Covid cases surging, we were worried as to how will the exams be conducted. I believe this is a fair decision,” said Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, Noida. “I believe that health comes first and each student should be protected from Covid-19,” said Kamini Bhasin, Principal of DPS Noida. Welcoming the decision to cancel the Class X board exams, Sangeeta Hajela, principal of DPS, Indirapuram, said , “The focus should now be on addressing the learning gap that has already occurred. However, Class 12 board examinations have a different kind of sanctity attached to them because all higher study opportunities and career choices, both in India and abroad, depend on them,” she added.On the other hand, parents feel the postponement of Class 12 exams will add to the stress of the children. “Till when will you keep postponing the exams? When the coronavirus situation has not ended in the last one year, how can you expect it to get better by June? As parents, we feel the anxiety of our children and making them for the exam dates is not fair,” said Manoj Kataria, who is the president of Gautam Budh Nagar Parents’ Welfare Society. Yatender Kasana, president of All Noida School Parents Association, said, “The Class 12 students should be promoted without exams as in any case, they have to give the entrance exams for colleges and higher studies. Delaying exams is like playing with their future”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cbses-decision-on-board-exams-relieves-some-miffs-few-101618426374401.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC suggests shifting prisoners to open prison||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC), while granting emergency furlough to eight of the nine inmates of Paithan open prison, suggested getting prisoners from congested jails transferred to the open prison to take care of the 220 cattle and 325 acres of sugarcane plantation under the prison administration. The suggestion was prompted after the court was informed that while the prison had a capacity of 500 inmates, it currently has only 41 inmates as the others had taken benefit of emergency parole/ furlough and were released as per the guidelines of the high-power committee (HPC). The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar, while hearing writ petitions filed by nine inmates lodged at Paithan Open Prison, was informed by advocate PP More that the petitioners had been in prison for five to 10 years and that with the exception of one, the remaining eight were never released on parole or furlough. In view of this, More added, that the inmates were aggrieved by the refusal of the jail superintendent to grant them emergency parole/furlough recommended by the HPC. On May 8, 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government had issued a notification permitting release of prisoners temporarily to curb the spread of the virus and decongest jails. The state had, however, left it to the HPC to work out the modalities of the implementation of the notification. The HPC had laid down conditions for release of prisoners convicted and sentenced under the Indian Penal Code but refused parole and furlough to those found guilty under special Acts. More also said it would be discrimination if the petitioners were not allowed emergency parole/furlough, and hence sought directions to jail authorities to consider their application. The chief public prosecutor then informed the court that as many prisoners had taken benefit of emergency parole/furlough, the population of Paithan open prison was only 41 as opposed to its capacity of 500. He submitted that as there was agricultural land and cattle of the prison that needed to be taken care of, he would speak to the additional chief secretary of home department to clarify when and how the released prisoners were to be recalled as at least one-third of the prison’s strength would have to be maintained. After hearing the submissions, the court held the inmates could not be discriminated against just because the prison had to maintain a certain population, and suggested that the state get prisoners who were eligible to be placed in open prisons to be transferred from other congested jails to make up the shortfall.The court then directed the superintendent of Paithan jail to consider the applications of the eight petitioners but rejected the petition of one prisoner who was released on parole once.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-suggests-shifting-prisoners-to-open-prison-101618426374954.html
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Central team finds flaws in Mohali admn’s Covid management||The three-member team from the Centre that was in Mohali district to assess the Covid-19 situation has highlighted multiple flaws on the part of the administration in handling the pandemic.In the past six weeks, the district has reported around 12,500 Covid-19 cases and over 100 deaths. Around 70% cases have surfaced in Mohali city, and Dhakoli in Zirakpur accounts for 1,200 cases in April alone. While the district administration has failed to announce any curbs in Mohali city, sources said Dhakoli, with a population of around one lakh, was declared a containment zone late on Monday only after objections raised by the central team.The team, which was in the district for five days and submitted its report to Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Tuesday, said there is no government facility for critical patients requiring ventilators. The health department has done nothing to recruit manpower or purchase equipment to develop such a facility and all critical patients are being sent to Patiala, it said. The report also highlighted unsatisfactory contact tracing due to manpower crunch. Only addresses are asked and there is no real intent to trace the infection trail, it stated, adding that even containment zones are just on paper and there is nothing being done on the ground to contain the infection spread. The team, comprising two doctors, both named Naveen Kumar, and IAS officer VK Singh, also noted that there is poor coordination between Mohali and Chandigarh administrations regarding Covid-19 patients.The deputy commissioner said the administration has replied to various issues raised by the team. As far as the facility for critical patients is concerned, the civil hospital in Mohali is undergoing construction and the district has been mapped with Patiala for referrals of such cases. We have also directed private hospitals in the district to stop elective procedures to increase the bed capacity for Covid care. On the lack of coordination with Chandigarh, he said: “We have taken up the matter with the Prime Minister, urging him to ensure that all government hospitals in Chandigarh admit critical patients from Mohali, but a reply is awaited.” On contact tracing, Dayalan said Mohali is tracing the highest number contacts in the state, ie 20 per Covid positive patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/central-team-finds-flaws-in-mohali-admn-s-covid-management-101618426373953.html

They should be treated as frontline workers and should be allowed vaccination on priority. Delhi government is writing to the Centre in this regard,” Kejriwal tweeted.The Delhi chief minister’s tweet came hours after the Federation of All India Medical Association wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the same.“Journalists cannot work from home, and have put their lives and health at risk on a daily basis to cover both the Covid-19 pandemic and other matters of public concern, including matters critical to health and safety of the public, and critical to our democracy… While others have the option to walk away from large crowds, or to avoid members of the public that don’t follow ICMR health guidelines, these journalists repeatedly put their own safety at risk to document what is occurring and inform their communities – large and small. As a result, we have seen journalists become infected, hospitalised and even, unfortunately, succumb to Covid-19,” read the association’s letter.Delhi is going through its worst phase of Covid-19, with daily cases crossing 17,000 and active cases above 50,000-mark, as per government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/journalists-are-frontline-workers-must-be-vaccinated-kejriwal-101618426372733.html

Any investigations needed will be chargeable as per hospital rates, the order said.“The rates of the banquet halls/ other facilities will be provided by divisional commissioner in due course,” a second order signed by Singhla read.In a separate order, the health secretary also asked for 678 more ward beds, 182 more ICU beds without ventilators, and 28 more ICU beds with ventilators in three Delhi government hospitals, including the biggest hospital in the trans-Yamuna region, Guru Teg Bahadur. With the current addition, all 1,500 beds in the GTB hospital will be utilised for Covid-19 patients.The civic authorities on Wednesday appealed to the government to utilise municipal establishments, such as community centres and sports complexes, for creating temporary Covid care centres (CCC) or isolation facilities.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to make its Balakram Hospital in Timarpur a Covid care centre. Authorities have also written to the state government to convert Hindu Rao Hospital into a dedicated Covid-19 facility.Earlier too, during the third wave of Covid-19 in October-November last year, the Hindu Rao Hospital, which has 980 beds, was turned into a dedicated Covid-19 facility.“Everyday 30-40 Covid-19 patients are coming to Hindu Rao Hospital. Hence, today (Wednesday), I have written to the Delhi government to make this a Covid-19 dedicated facility as was done before. We have also decided to start a Covid care centre of 200 beds at Balakram Hospital, where patients can get themselves tested and those with mild symptoms can also be isolated there,” said North MCD mayor Jai Prakash.There are nearly 119 community centres with the North Corporation. Similarly the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) runs 97 community centres. The east civic body has 71 community centres.“If the government wants they can use over community halls and schools to set up covid care centres or create isolation wards in them to increase the number of beds for Covid patients,” Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hotels-and-banquets-to-boost-covid-bed-count-in-delhi-101618426078315.html
15-04-2021||Noida||Covid-19 containment zones in Ghaziabad’s urban segments rise rapidly||Ghaziabad: With new Covid-19 cases coming in thick and fast, the number of containment zones in the Ghaziabad district has shot up from 169 on April 11 to 321 as of April 13. These 321 include 174 zones having a single case and 147 having more than one case.Officials said that containment zones having more than one case is a cause of worry and their share is about 45.79%. “High number of containment zones having multiple cases is a cause of worry. It indicates Covid spread among families and neighbours. This trend is more visible in city areas. It also indicated that the virus is spreading fast. Containment is one of the best strategies to curb Covid spread,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “Nowadays, with multiple cases coming from the same family, it is hard to detect the source. So, containment is a must,” he added. According to official records, there were 169 containment zones with 519 cases on April 11 whereas on April 12, the figure increased to 233 containment zones with 709 cases. On April 13, city areas falling under Indirapuram police station area had 37 containment zones, with 157 cases, at an average of about 4.24 cases per zone. In Vijay Nagar, 16 containment zones had 103 cases, while in Kaushambi, there were 102 cases in 25 containment zones. Kavi Nagar, on the other hand, had 143 cases in 35 zones.Meanwhile, localities under Muradnagar police station have 50 cases in as many containment zones. Likewise, Bhojpur has four cases in as many zones and Modinagar also has 26 cases in as many zones.On April 3, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari had issued an order for surveillance in which areas having even one positive case was to be created as a containment zone in a radius of 25 metres (comprising about 20 houses), while areas having more than one case will be in form of a cluster with a radius of 50 metres (comprising about 60 houses). For each case in a high-rise, the entire floor will be contained while in case of multiple cases, the entire tower will be contained. In another order on April 11, the UP chief secretary had directed that the supply of essential commodities should be ensured in all containment zones. “We are ensuring strict compliance of containment zone guidelines. I have asked the respective incident commanders of different areas to ensure strict enforcement. We are ensuring that guidelines are properly followed in containment zones in order to check the spread,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The health department said that more cases in a lesser number of containment zones indicate that infected persons mixed up with others. “It could be their family or friends or neighbours. So, the movement of people having symptoms should be restricted and self-regulation is also a must. Otherwise, it is seen nowadays that the infection is spreading fast. In such a scenario, smaller areas have a risk of getting converted to containment zones,” said an officer from the district health department, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-containment-zones-in-ghaziabad-s-urban-segments-rise-rapidly-101618426315445.html
15-04-2021||Delhi||Physical meetings only if related to Covid or court: Delhi govt to staff||Days after asking nearly 50% of its staff to work from home, the Delhi government has asked all its departments, agencies and state-run companies to strictly prohibit physical meetings -- unless they are related to Covid-19 management, court matters, or some urgent business. The three municipal corporations of Delhi have also issued similar orders to their staff.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in an order issued on April 12, said that “besides the reduction in attendance in the offices of Delhi government, unnecessary interactions amongst officers/officials are restricted. Therefore, the competent authority has directed that no meetings in person shall take place except meetings related to Covid-19 management, court matters, and matters of urgent nature.”Public dealings in the offices of the district magistrates have been exempted from the restrictions.More than 23 revenue services categorised as “non-essential” were shut in Delhi since March 20 last year due to the pandemic and the nationwide lockdown. From June 8 last year, when the first unlocking guidelines were issued, Delhi government’s revenue department also gradually opened up its public services, including issuing income, domicile, marriage, caste and solvency certificates, mutation of properties, enrolment of Aadhaar, recruitment of civil defence volunteers, and registration of documents in sub-registrar offices.The three municipalities have also started following the DDMA directives.North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that orders were issued to ensure that only 50% staff attends office at a time, and officials have been directed to make rosters to implement the order. “This work from home order will be implemented in every department except for public health and sanitation departments. Rosters are being made to call employees alternatively to offices. We have also suspended all physical meetings,” said Prakash.The east and south corporations are also following the same protocols.An East MCD spokesperson said that, by April 12, rosters were made to follow the 50% staff strength rule. “Only A grade officers, such as commissioner, additional commissioner and other senior officials, are asked to come to office every day.”An SDMC officer said, “We will soon make a roster which will ensure only 50% staff is present in offices at a time and rest work from home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/physical-meetings-only-if-related-to-covid-or-court-delhi-govt-to-staff-101618426314814.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha lockdown: Can travel by trains only for valid reason||With the lockdown in the state, restrictions are back on public transport, especially local trains, from Wednesday night. Although transport services have not been suspended, but the general public are not allowed to travel by local trains. People working in essential care, travelling for medical purposes and people travelling to and from vaccination centres across the city will be allowed to commute by local trains. Autorickshaws are allowed to have two passengers only, excluding the driver; taxis are allowed to operate at 50% of vehicle capacity, while BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are not allowed to ferry anyone standing in the vehicle. In order to ensure only authorised people travel by local trains, railway authorities will check passengers at entry and exit points. The Central and Western Railway will deploy additional staff, including Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and ticket-checkers, to inspect people on the station premises. Further, closing of multiple entry and exit points at railway stations is also being considered. “We will randomly check passengers entering the railway stations. We will study the situation and if the need arises, we will close multiple entry and exit points.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway. The number of local train services is also likely to be limited. At present, the railways operate 2,985 local train services, of which 1,685 are operated on the Central Railway and 1,300 are operated on Western Railway. “The decision on limiting the number of local train services has not been taken yet. It will be decided after seeing the number of commuters. We do not want to reduce local trains immediately, as it could later result in overcrowding.” said a senior railway official. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday also announced financial relief of ₹1500 each for registered autorickshaw drivers. “How can one survive on ₹1,500? The condition of autorickshaw drivers is very bad. We had earlier demanded a financial relief of ₹10,000. We will approach the government. If they do not announce additional measures, we will agitate,” said Shashank Rao, leader, Mumbai Autorickshaw Mens Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-lockdown-can-travel-by-trains-only-for-valid-reason-101618426314137.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||No off-Centre talk: MVA’s counter to BJP on Covid-19||In view of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre going after it, the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has decided to adopt an aggressive stance against the Central government. MVA leaders and ministers have started pointing out how the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is doing “injustice” to Maharashtra when it comes to supply of vaccines and other help needed to handle the Covid-19 situation, which has become a talking point in social media. The three parties also asked their legislators and leaders to get actively involved in helping the administration handle the pandemic and at the same time counter BJP’s allegations on poor handling of the same. MVA has also decided to identify sympathisers of the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis regime who are still in the administration and sideline them.For almost two months, MVA has been at the receiving end of a series of allegations against its ministers. It was further cornered after two cabinet ministers — Anil Deshmukh and Sanjay Rathod — were forced to resign following controversies. For the ruling coalition, this episode is unlikely to end soon as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has started its inquiry into the allegations against Deshmukh, former home minister, and it may look to expand its probe following fresh allegations of extortion made by Sachin Vaze, arrested police officer in the Antilia bomb scare case, against Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab, who is a close aide of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.According to MVA leaders, the ruling allies have decided to take on the BJP-led Central government since they are being pushed to corner politically. “Will fight propaganda”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar took a meeting of senior ministers last Friday where a strategy is said to have been discussed. He directed them to expose the BJP-led Centre’ over its “poor” handling of Covid-19 pandemic as they are facing a battle of perception.“Basically, they are creating a perception that the three ruling parties are involved in corrupt practices since they came to power. They have also started to misuse central investigation agencies to get the job done. This fight of perception needs to be fought accordingly. The way they are trying to defame the MVA government, we need to expose them at every front. This is what Pawar saheb wants us to do,” a senior NCP minister said, requesting anonymity.According to Sena insiders, the party has decided to take up matters related to Covid-19 and recent vaccine shortage to counter the BJP, at a meeting chaired by senior Sena leader and industries minister Subhash Desai, at the direction of party chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Saturday. Sena ministers, MPs, MLA and legislators were a part of the meeting held via video conference and have allegedly been asked to mobilise party workers in the battle against Covid-19 as well. “The BJP has been at it since a year now. Baseless allegations upon allegations have been made. But we can only counter them with facts. Showing Maharashtra government in poor light with regards to handling of Covid-19 is clearly another campaign to defame the government. The BJP is targeting the government and CM personally. We will put out the facts on news, social media platforms, etc,” a party MP, who was present in the meeting, said.Congress leaders said they have already decided to be vocal against the propaganda of the BJP which is making efforts to dislodge the state government. Party leaders had earlier discussed the same in a meeting chaired by Maharashtra In-charge HK Patil on April 2. “The propaganda needs to be countered with the same aggression and facts which the party has been doing for quite some time now. Our leaders have been taking upon the BJP very often, compared to the other two ruling partners,” said a senior Congress functionary, wishing not to be quoted.Another Sena functionary, who was present at Desai’s meeting, said, “We will counter this [BJP’s campaign] with facts, by calling out the Centre’s partial treatment and injustice towards Maharashtra. Some of our leaders have been taking them on Twitter and on news channels, and it will continue. At the same time, we will put out Uddhav Thackeray’s decisions in the public domain for people to judge.” Weed out sympathisersIn addition, MVA will also start identifying sympathisers of the Fadnavis regime and move them to less significant positions, said a senior NCP functionary. “This will help the MVA government avoid unnecessary troubles in future. It is expected to start with the home department as the new home minister (DIlip Walse Patil) has been given the responsibility to get it done on priority basis,” he said.Days after NCP’s Dilip Walse Patil took charge as home minister, senior IPS officer Sanjay Pandey was appointed as acting director general of police (DGP). Pandey has also started a preliminary inquiry against former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh based on the report submitted by Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale. Pandey is expected to submit the report in few weeks.The home department is also mulling over action against senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla as Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis allegedly used her report on corruption in police transfers to level allegations against the government, which indicates that she may have leaked the documents. “While we will have a legal battle against the inferences the CBI draws on the allegations against Deshmukh, the action [against Shukla] will send a message to those in the administration who have been hand in glove with the opposition,” said a senior NCP minister. The NCP, however, said that it is just fighting the propaganda against the government. “We have decided to counter their propaganda of lies by bringing out the facts before the people. This is the reason the MVA, especially NCP, has become vocal against the shortage of vaccine doses. People should know who is doing injustice with Maharashtra and what is going on in the name of politics. We will keep bringing the facts before them, as this is the only way to fight against the lies spread by the BJP,” said Nawab Malik, NCP chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister.Covid issuesSena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut also took on the Central government over fewer vaccine stock provided to Maharashtra and lack of availability of antiviral drug Remdesivir, which is used to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. Raut said the politics played by BJP is “condemnable”.“Today, vaccine and Remdesivir injections are readily available in the BJP headquarters in Gujarat, but not in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. This is inhumanity, and we do not see this as an attempt to keep the country as one. The kind of politics that is being played, that too through the administration, is condemnable. The opposition party in Maharashtra should be the first to condemn this as this is an insult of the state. If they do not see this as an insult, then they do not have the right to practice politics in this state,” Raut said.Arif Naseem Khan, working president, state Congress unit, echoed Raut’s view and said, “There should not be any politics over handling of Covid-19. Maharashtra is the most-affected state and is taking all the efforts including stricter restrictions and a relief package of around ₹7,000 crore for the affected sections of the society. The Centre should support the state in this fight, and there should not be any shortage of vaccine, oxygen and Remdesivir doses.” Raut added, “I am surprised that the three states that the [Union health] secretary has mentioned have failed to tackle Covid are all non-BJP states. So, have only non-BJP ruled states failed and Covid-19 fled from the states where there is a BJP CM? The Centre must behave in a sensitive manner and desist from such allegations,” Raut said.To deal with the shortage of blood, the Congress state unit on Wednesday launched a statewide drive with a target of collecting 200,000 units of blood. The virtual event was attended by HK Patil, Mallikarjun Kharge, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan and other senior leaders. It has also decided to set up a helpline in each district to help Covid patients with getting beds etc.BJP hits backHowever, the BJP said the MVA is getting a bad reputation because of its own deeds. Madhav Bhandari, vice-president of state BJP wing, said the ongoing inquiry against Deshmukh was ordered by the Bombay high court and it was started following the allegations made by the former Mumbai Police chief, and added that the coalition partners are dragging the BJP in the issue for no reason.“Currently, only CBI inquiry is going on into the allegations against Deshmukh. It was also not started by the Centre. The allegations were made by Param Bir Singh, former Mumbai commissioner, and an inquiry was ordered by the high court. Even the Supreme Court refused to give any relief to the then home minister. So what is the Centre or BJP’s role in it and why is MVA blaming them,” Bhandari asked.Meanwhile, Fadnavis on Monday said that he will take appropriate action to dislodge the state government at an appropriate time. Campaigning for the party candidate in Pandharpur, he said, “Leave it to me when the government needs to be changed, but bypoll is necessary as the people of Pandharpur got the first chance to show the government, which is involved in all sorts or corrupt practices, its place … I will do the correct programme; don’t worry about that. You just elect Samadhan Autade,” Fadnavis said while campaigning for the party candidate in Pandharpur. The constituency is going for bypolls on April 17.Political analyst Pratap Asbe said the MVA partners took too long to start countering the BJP which has caused a major beating to their image. “The coalition partners remained defensive for too long a period and started countering the BJP and Centre over vaccine shortage only now. They should have started taking on them soon after the allegations were made over various issues. They should have become offensive instead of adopting a defensive stand in this political fight. The delay in giving appropriate response to the allegations has also dented MVA’s image which cannot be overlooked,” Asbe said.“On one hand BJP leaders assure that they will support the state government in the battle against Covid-19 and on the other, they talk about doing the correct programme (referring to Fadnavis’s statement at Pandharpur). They are exposing themselves by saying such things,” he commented.After the ruling coalition started pointing out a shortage of vaccine doses, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit has decided to counter it by putting out daily vaccine stock data on social media platforms for the information of the people. For the last three days, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye has been sharing the details on his Twitter handle. “The state received 12,962,470 vaccines doses, of them, 11,164,812 doses have been administered to beneficiaries and 1,797,658 doses have been left till the morning of April 14,” Upadhye said in a tweet on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-off-centre-talk-mva-s-counter-to-bjp-on-covid19-101618426313512.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha lockdown: ‘200K free meals for poor not enough’||Even as the state announced it would provide 200,000 free meals under its Shiv Bhojan Thali programme to the poor affected by the curbs, food security activists say it is too little considering the number of people who are likely to be hit. There are more than 900 centres and 100,000 subsidised meals are being distributed everyday. The state is planning to increase the centres as well as the ramp up the quota of thalis given to each centre to accommodate another 100,000 meals. Social activist Ulka Mahajan said, “We have a population of more than two crore in the state which is extremely poor and will have no work due to these new curbs. This scheme will hardly cover one per cent of them. Also, we have seen that these thalis are available just in talukas and it is not possible for those living in far-flung villages to come there owing to lack of transportation.” She said that she had come across instances of manipulation. “In Roha district at Raigad, we saw two centres open, while five were registered on paper. This phenomenon is visible across Maharashtra.” The Shiv Bhojan Thali is an ambitious scheme unveiled by the Uddhav Thackeray government on January 26, 2020 to provide nutritious meal at highly subsidized rates of ₹10 to the poor. It was modelled on the lines of Amma Canteen of Tamil Nadu and Indira Canteen scheme of Karnataka. The meal consists of a bowl of rice, lentil, vegetable dish and two rotis. Ever since the 2020 lockdown, the state has slashed the rate of this thali to ₹5. Though the actual cost of the food will be ₹50 and ₹45 for urban and rural population, respectively, the rest of the money is subsidized by the state government. Every chosen centre is given a quota to feed 75 to 300 daily depending on the location and people staying in the vicinity. The state does not give them any food materials and they are paid for the number of thalis they give daily.The Bharatiya Janata Party has called the thali scheme a money-making venture for the Shiv Sena. “The contractors of this scheme are all Sena activists who specialise in manipulating figures by inflating the number of beneficiaries,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam. “On one hand, the government is asking people not to step out of their houses and on the other, they will be distributing meals to citizens.”The Shiv Sena said the opposition parties have become very negative towards government schemes. “The opposition needs to understand that the government is trying its best to feed the poor. We have allowed parcel service for the Shiv Bhojan Thali to prevent crowding,” said Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande. There are estimates that it will cost the exchequer at least ₹150 crore this month.Vilas Patil, secretary, food, civil supplies and consumer protection, said more centres will be added. “We will ensure that no one is turned away. We had received complaints against some centres that were flouting rules and took action against them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-lockdown-200k-free-meals-for-poor-not-enough-101618426312752.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||HC refuses permission for congregational prayers in Juma Masjid during Ramzan||Observing that the public order and safety was of paramount importance amid the surge in Covid-19 cases, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused to grant any relief to the trustees of Juma Masjid in south Mumbai who had sought permission to hold congregational prayers with 50 persons five times a day in the mosque during the holy month of Ramzan.The HC observed that while the right to follow religious practices is important, priority needed to be given to public safety during the current Covid-19 surge. A holiday court of the division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing a petition by the trust seeking opening of its mosque during the holy month of Ramzan for offering prayers, which was restricted as per the Maharashtra government circular dated April 13, was informed that the mosque was spread over an acre and could accommodate around 7,000 persons at a time. However, given Covid-19 restrictions, only 50 persons would be allowed at a time to offer prayers during the holy monthAfter hearing submissions, HC said, “Considering the prevailing situation, we cannot permit the petitioner to offer prayers at the mosque.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-permission-for-congregational-prayers-in-juma-masjid-during-ramzan-101618426252687.html
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha goes under curfew, sees 58,592 fresh Covid cases||Maharashtra recorded 58,952 fresh Covid-19 infections and 278 deaths, pushing the tally to 3,578,160 and toll to 58,804, the ninth straight day of over 50,000 new cases, even as the state began its 15-day curfew, along with other strict restrictions, to break the chain of transmission of coronavirus, from 8pm on Wednesday.Amid this, India’s worst-hit state continues to reel under the unprecedented Covid-19 surge, as a total of 765,094 cases were recorded in the past 14 days. The spike has led to a sharp rise in active cases at 612,070 — 17.10% of the total infections. With a rising number of active infections, occupancy of beds in hospitals and Covid-19 centres are also increasing rapidly, but the state government is more worried about the lack of oxygen. Responding to the request of the state government for providing oxygen from neighbouring states, the central government has allowed them to get it from Haldia and Durgapur in West Bengal, Bokaro (Jharkhand), Rourkela (Odisha), Bhilai in Chhattisgarh, Bellary in Karnataka, Hyderabad in Telangana, among other places. It has appointed a committee of three IAS officers to plan to bring the oxygen from there, said a senior official. Maharashtra produces around 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily and has started consuming the entire production for medical purposes, only owing to the increased demand from hospitals. “We will prefer bringing oxygen by railways, but will choose to bring them by road in a 30- tonne tanker each if there is no other option left. Since some locations are too far, we have planned for it. For instance, oxygen coming from eastern states will supply oxygen in districts such as Nagpur, Amravati, while oxygen coming from southern states will be used in Kolhapur, Osmanabad, Beed, Nanded etc. This will reduce the duration of the journey,” said Sitaram Kunte, chief secretary.He said that the state will require around 7,500 metric tonnes till April 30 in addition to what is going to be produced in the corresponding period.“We have been flagging the projection on the rising use of oxygen since we have started consuming 600 metric tonnes for medical purposes and have been demanding allocation of oxygen from the Centre. After following up the matter for so long, now they have allocated oxygen, which again is too far. Places like Bokaro will take almost seven days for a return journey for oxygen supply in the state,” said a senior officer, requesting anonymity.The health minister maintained that there is no shortage of oxygen in the state yet but they need more oxygen in the coming days. “Yet there is no shortage of oxygen and there is not a single patient who is not getting oxygen in any hospital,” Tope stressed.Thackeray in the meeting with local authorities informed that efforts are going on a war footing to get oxygen supply for the hospitals and thus their rational use has become absolutely necessary. He asked them to ensure rational use of the available oxygen.To arrest the spike, the state government has decided to impose stricter curbs from Wednesday evening till the end of April, but by when the cases are going to stabilize is yet to be seen.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the impact is expected to be visible within a fortnight as peoples’ movement have been restricted. However, we all will have to be very careful as the case may start rising again once restrictions are lifted. “As soon as we restrict peoples’ movement the transmission level will start reducing as the number of people stepping out of the homes will get limited. This will reduce the number of transmissions and ultimately it will start reflecting in the daily figures in the next one or two weeks,” the health minister said.“But it doesn’t mean that the cases will not start rising again. As soon as the restrictions are lifted and people will behave with their callous attitude then no one can guarantee that there won’t be any spike again. We have to be very careful to allow the wave to settle down by means of restricting ourselves,” Tope added.For strict implementation of the fresh restrictions, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of local administration including divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and directed them to shut down facilities allowed by the state if Covid protocols are found to be violated.“We have not closed down essential services but it doesn’t mean they are allowed to violate Covid rules. Shut them down if found violating rules,” Thackeray said, while directing the local authorities.The government on Tuesday had announced stricter, curfew-like restrictions till May 1, however, there was some confusion among citizens over the movement of people via public transport and private vehicles, which services were allowed under e-commerce, following which senior officials issued a set of FAQs to address queries.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 242,149 samples and had a positivity rate of 24.34%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 15.86%. It has also reported recoveries of 39,264 patients on Wednesday taking the tally of recovered patients to 2,905,721.With 6,562 cases, Nagpur recorded the second-highest cases across the state. Of them, Nagpur city and district recorded 4,282 and 2,280 respectively in a day.The chief minister said it is a mutated strain and is infecting younger people more than others. “The current scenario is more difficult and challenging hence all the restrictions imposed need to be strictly followed. The responsibility for the same is on the collectorate and police administration. We cannot afford being careless,” the chief minister said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-goes-under-curfew-sees-58-592-fresh-covid-cases-101618426192704.html

15-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Women in Khaki help woman deliver baby in police van||In a heart-warming incident, three women police personnel from Worli on Tuesday helped a pregnant woman safely deliver her baby inside a police van while taking her to a hospital after finding her in an unconscious state in Worli Naka area. The woman, Pratiksha Kavle, a 32-year-old from Anand Nagar in Worli, was heading to Worli Naka around 5.30pm on Tuesday when she fell down due to dizziness. A local informed the police control room, following which two nearby mobile units were rushed to the spot. The teams found that the woman was in pain and needed immediate medical attention. Instead of waiting for an ambulance, sub-inspector S Patil, constables Reshma Patil and Poonam Sapkal along with other staff on the mobile units decided to take the woman, who was seven months pregnant, to BYL Nair Hospital in the police van.

15-04-2021||Delhi||Government allows 14 private Covid hospitals to use some beds for emergency care||Two days after designating 14 big private hospitals as dedicated Covid facilities, the Delhi government on Wednesday revised its order allowing the hospitals to use 10%-30% of their beds to provide emergency care as well as follow-up treatment to some of their patients.Only two hospitals, Max Smart Superspeciality hospital and Manipal hospital, remained completely Covid-19 centres after the revised order, which reduced the number of beds accrued from 4,337 beds to 3,553. Big hospitals such as Indraprastha Apollo and Sir Ganga Ram retained nearly 200 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“The remainder beds or additional beds in these hospitals shall be used for treatment of non-Covid follow-up patients and patients requiring emergent medical or surgical treatment. Further, the concerned 14 hospitals would be allowed to temporarily increase their bed capacity up to 35% and the additional beds may also be utilised for the treatment of non-Covid patients,” the revised order signed by medical superintendent of Delhi’s nursing home cell Dr RN Das read.The decision to free up beds was taken after a meeting between Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and the representatives from all 14 hospitals.“We met with the health minister today and explained our problems -- of the 14 hospitals, eight are located within 10km, seriously curtailing the chances of non-Covid patients in the region getting emergency care. These are also the biggest hospitals that provide specialised care such as transplant surgeries, complicated brain and spine surgeries and need to follow up these patients regularly. The minister understood our plight and we were told that some beds would be freed up in all the hospitals for non-Covid-19 patients,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary of Delhi Voluntary Hospital’s forum, an association of large private hospitals in the city. He said that during the meeting with the minister, he suggested that smaller nursing homes may be utilised instead to ramp up bed capacity, if needed.Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India), said, “This is our partial victory. These 14 hospitals can carry out the critical procedures. We will therefore not go to court for time being.”The association had prepared a writ petition after the government order. In September, the association had sued the Delhi government after 80% of the ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals had been reserved for Covid-19 treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/government-allows-14-private-covid-hospitals-to-use-some-beds-for-emergency-care-101618425496582.html

I recorded the video playing on the screen on my mobile phone for future evidence,” she said.The mother called the owner of the centre and the police control room, following which a police team questioned the suspect.

15-04-2021||Pune||Covid second wave: Task force urges govt to suspend routine work in hospitals that consume oxygen||As the demand for oxygen in the medical sector has gone up due to the surge in Covid cases, the state task force has recommended that the government should issue guidelines to suspend all routine work in hospitals that consume oxygen. They have also recommended introducing new treatment protocols to ensure that the liquid oxygen is optimally used.On April 1, when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray addressed the state to announce the 15 days curfew period, he mentioned the shortage of oxygen supply for medical purposes. He even requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to airlift oxygen with the help of the Indian Air Force from the neighbouring state to fulfil the needs of Maharashtra.While Pune division needs 385 metric tons of oxygen daily with Pune district demanding a majority of the chunk, 300 tonnes of liquid oxygen. Pune district has only four liquid oxygen manufacturers three of which are located in Pune and one in Kolhapur and supply 383 tons of liquid oxygen. In addition to this, the district also gets 85 tonnes of liquid oxygen from Thane. However, with the rising number of cases, the oxygen demand has also gone up.Dr Sanjay Patil, board chairperson, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “The routine procedures include major planned surgeries like hysterectomy and gynaecology surgeries which require oxygen for about two hours sometimes. However, currently, the routine planned surgeries are not happening anyways as there are no beds, and doctors are busy. So the question arises how effective would the guidelines be in today’s scenario.”“The target to maintain 95 per cent oxygen saturation is acceptable, but it is always better to leave it to the treating doctor’s discretion depending on the patient’s underlying condition or even to maintain his/her condition,” he said.Earlier too, during the September peak, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, Arti Ahuja had written to the states that oxygen is a life-saving essential drug. The target oxygen saturation rate should be 94 per cent-95 per cent for the hospitalised Covid patient. Once this rate is achieved, the flow of oxygen may not be increased as it may not provide any additional benefit to the patient.In addition to this, the task force also recommended that patients who stay long in ICU are undergoing repeated RT-PCR tests which delay their transfer out of ICU (intensive care unit). Some patients stay for 14 or even 21 days in ICU and so the task force recommended that no RT-PCR should be taken between 14 to 21 days and that it should not be mandatory pre-transfer from ICU. If the patient is stable and afebrile 72 hours before the planned transfer from ICU, no such test would be required. However, individual discretion has been advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-second-wave-task-force-urges-govt-to-suspend-routine-work-in-hospitals-that-consume-oxygen-101618417251875.html

Police said his past activity on social media and his frequent visits to Raipur Rani in Panchkula helped them trace him. The accused had managed to spend ₹86,000 of the stolen amount on buying a mobile phone and clothes and paying for his stay at a hotel in Raipur Rani. While ₹3.14 lakh were found in Sunil’s backpack when he was arrested from Shastri Nagar in Manimajra, after being followed from Raipur Rani, ₹4 crore were recovered from a bag hidden in the jungle area near Hallomajra, upon his interrogation.

After the theft, Sunil had gone to the hotel in Raipur Rani after hiding one bag in the jungle area. Later, he had even returned to Chandigarh to check if the money was safe, said police.What had happened on SundaySunil was working as an unarmed guard with the currency chest for the past four years. It is the hub that supplies cash to all ATMs of the bank in the city. While the India Reserve Battalion (IRB) personnel were deputed on the outer security circle of the office, Sunil had free access to the chest. IRB personnel had alerted the officials after Sunil, who was on night duty, went missing and the door of the currency chest was found open around 3am on Sunday. The bank’s chest staff reached the spot and started checking CCTV footage that showed Sunil taking out something wrapped from the premises. On checking, one of the boxes was found damaged and opened. A sum of ₹4.04 crore — in two packets of 20 bundles each of currency notes in the denomination of ₹2,000 — were missing.Checking the CCTV footage further, the staff found that Sunil moved out of the office with two bags. He fled on his motorcycle on which he used to come to work daily. A case was registered under Sections 457 (lurking house-trespass or housebreaking by night to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 381 (theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master) of the Indian Penal Code.
