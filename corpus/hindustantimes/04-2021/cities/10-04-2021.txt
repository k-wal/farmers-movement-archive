10-04-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation proposes 15% hike in house tax||Ghaziabad: Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation have proposed a hike of 15% in the house tax for the current financial year. The officials said that the decision was taken as there had been no hike in the past two years. At present, the civic body has about 368,000 properties under its jurisdiction. The officials said the proposal follows an earlier decision by the corporation’s board in which it was decided that house tax would be increased by 10% every two years or 5% can be hiked for a year. “For the past two years, there has been no hike in the tax and 5% hike is related to the current financial year (2021-22). So, we have an overall hike of 15%. The proposal will be taken to the next board meeting. If the board decides that the tax hike be waived in the wake of the pandemic, then we will abide by the decision,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. Councillors said that the schedule of the next board meeting has not been fixed due to a surge in the Covid-19 cases. “The proposal is as per an earlier decision taken up by the board to increase revenue in order to take up civic infrastructure projects. However, we will oppose the move in which the corporation has proposed a new tax structure which will bring in a steep hike in house tax,” said Rajendra Tyagi, a councillor from Raj Nagar. Under a new proposed structure of taxation, localities in about 100 residential wards will be categorised under three heads based on rental values, which are proposed to be linked to the circle rates set by the district magistrate’s office each year. While category ‘A’ comprises prime localities with the highest rental value, category ‘B’ is for lower rental value while category ‘C’ will comprise localities which are least developed. Categories of properties based on their location on roads of varying width – less than 12 metres; between 12 metres and 24 metres; and over 24 metres – will have a proportional impact on the tax. The officials estimate that the new tax structure under process will hike tax by about 25% on an average. “The objections to the new tax structure have been invited and a process is on to decide the objections. This process is likely to get complete by the end of this month. Then, we will put this proposal before the board. The next board meeting is likely to be held in May,” Tanwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-proposes-15-hike-in-house-tax-101618078825929.html
10-04-2021||Noida||Indirapuram: Women residents demand repair of Mall Road||Ghaziabad: Many flats in high-rises at Ahimsa Khand II in Indirapuram have put up banners bearing slogans demanding repair and resurrection of the Mall Road, which connects one point of the residential pocket to the other spanning over 600-700 metres. The Mall Road in Ahimsa Khand II is in an abominable state with potholes and dust affecting commuters. Residents said the road was repaired a couple of times but dumpers and heavy vehicles plying on the stretch and construction activities taken up by authorities have contributed to the dilapidated condition of the road. Since Friday, many banners have been put up outside the flats facing the Mall Road with slogans reading, “No Road, No Vote,” “Tooti Sadak Ki Maar, band karo ye atyachaar,” “Thak Gaye Karke Prayas, Kiska Sath Kiska Vikas” and “12 Saal ka Intzaar, Ahimsa Khand 2 me sadko ka bura haal.” The protest has been launched by a group of women from Princess Park high-rise. “The banners depict the anger of the residents. The condition of the road is this bad for about 10 years now. A decade ago, we took out a ‘Gutter Yatra’ to highlight the drainage issue. This time, we are protesting silently and putting up banners to draw the attention towards the dilapidated condition of the road,” said Dr Bharti Garg, a resident of Princess Park high-rise. She, along with about 60-65 other women residents, are leading the protest and other high-rises are also following suit. “The road is damaging our vehicles. Even the air pollution levels here are quite high due to the presence of fine dust particles. Many residents have to inhale steam for relief and children have become allergic to dust. We hardly find any difference between our road and that of a road in a nearby village. Residents have to keep windows shut and clean their houses several times due to the dusty road,” said Nupur Sahay, another resident of Princess Park. “We have heard many times that tenders have been floated for road repairs. This time, we need the road in better shape and are not concerned about how long the process is going to be to achieve that. The road is in such a bad condition that many families hesitate to call guests home,” added Sahay. Members of the apartment owners’ association (AOA) of the Princess Park high-rise said banners have been put up at about 65 flats. “The AOA is in full support of the initiative launched by the women residents. Ever since the banners came up on flats of our high-rise, other nearby high-rises are also responding,” said Vaibhav Garg, general secretary of the AOA, Princess Park. The Ahimsa Khand II area is home to about 22 high-rises and has an estimated population of about 35,000 to 40,000. The Mall Road is also an extension of the CISF-Road, which connects residents to Ahimsa Khand II and national highway-9. A major portion of the Mall Road near the connecting point of CISF Road collapsed and caved-in on August 7, 2019, following heavy rain. It was repaired after a fortnight. One side of the CISF Road is also dug up due to a pipeline laying project being undertaken by the UP Jal Nigam. The project was initiated under the Centre’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut ) scheme. Officials of UP Jal Nigam HT spoke to said the work of relaying the CISF Road will be completed by end of May or June. “The Ahimsa Khand II area is badly affected due to the bad condition of the CISF Road and Mall Road. We support the protest initiated by the women residents. We are also approaching high-rises adjacent to the CISF Road to come forward and demand repair of the road,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of association of apartment owners, and resident of Arihant Harmony high-rise in Ahimsa Khand II. Officials of the Ghaziabad development authority said tenders for the repairs of Mall Road have been floated. “We have come to know about the protest launched by the residents in Ahimsa Khand II. The issue has been discussed with the vice chairperson also. A file has been sanctioned and is in the tender process. The issue of the CISF Road is also taken up regularly with the Jal Nigam officials,” said V N Singh, chief engineer of Ghaziabad development authority. “We have initiated the process of road repair and the work will be taken up soon. It may take three months for the work to get completed,” said Krishna Karunesh, vice chairperson of Ghaziabad development authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/indirapuram-women-residents-demand-repair-of-mall-road-101618078765951.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body permits home delivery of liquor||Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], April 10 (ANI): The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has permitted wine shops to sell liquor as per the license issued to concerned shops.The BMC allowed the concerned shops to sell liquor only through home delivery service between 7.00 am to 8.00 pm and delivery executives must follow COVID-19 protocols.It also permitted citizens who are eligible to get vaccinated, to travel only to the centre and back during lockdown, on health or medical grounds.However, the city received 99,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine. As per the BMC, the doses will be distributed to civic and government-run vaccine centres.The shortage of COVID vaccine doses in Mumbai led to the temporary halting of the vaccination drive across 75 vaccination centres in the city on Friday.This comes amid allegations by Chief Ministers of several states across the country that the stock of vaccine is available only for the next few days.Mumbai is currently under a weekend lockdown till 7 am on Monday in an effort to curb the spread of the COVID-19 infection. The city reported 9,200 COVID19 cases and 35 deaths on Friday. There are currently 90,333 active cases in the city.Earlier, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Aslam Shaikh had said that Maharashtra received the least number of vaccines and a majority of vaccination centres were facing closure due to a shortage of doses.Earlier in the day, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray called an all-party meeting via video conference to review the current COVID-19 situation in the state.Maharashtra yesterday recorded 58,993 new COVID-19 cases, 45,391 recoveries, and 301 deaths.The Maharashtra government has also imposed a strict weekend lockdown from Friday night till 7 am on Monday.

10-04-2021||Noida||Police link power outage at station to action against UPPCL staffer||Noida: The power supply to Rabupura police station and nearby residential complex for police personnel was cut for over four hours on Friday night, with police alleging that Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) officials took the action in retaliation against a challan issued to one of their contract staff for not wearing a mask on the road. UPPCL officials, however, dismissed the police allegations and said the action was taken since the police station was using power without a valid meter.Police said the power cut -- from 8:30pm on Friday to 1am on Saturday -- hampered office work and communication.Dinesh Singh, SHO of Rabupura police station, linked the power cut to a face mask enforcement drive conducted by a police team in the neighbourhood on Friday. “Sub-inspector Sanjeev Rathi and his team issued a challan to a power department contractual worker for not wearing a face mask. It appears he got upset over the issue and, in connivance with his seniors, disconnected the power supply to the police station and the residential complex,” he said.The SHO said that all works of the police station stopped due to the outage, which was restored only after senior police officers talked to officials in the administration late in the night.Meanwhile, UPPCL executive engineer P K Singh said that the police station was using power without a valid meter connection. “There was significant power consumption in the police station and also in the residential complex. Once the power meter also caught fire and it was damaged. The police station was directly using power from the neighbouring pole. The power department had disconnected the supply, and later fixed it with a meter,” he said.The UPPCL official further said that the police department also has dues to clear.The SHO, however, said disconnecting power supply was illogical. “The issue of dues should be discussed and cleared at higher level.The outage had created problems for the police personnel and also their family members,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/police-link-power-outage-at-station-to-action-against-uppclstaffer-101618078706591.html

Under the fest, vaccination against coronavirus would restart at all 97 vaccination centres spread across the rural and urban belt alike. This would be possible after the district that was running extremely low on stock of Covid-19 vaccine, would receive fresh stock of 80,000 doses by late Saturday night.Nodal officer of Covid-19 vaccines in the district Dr Tirath Lal said, “The fresh stock of the vaccine had landed at Varanasi airport on Saturday afternoon from where it was dispatched for different neighbouring districts including Prayagraj. The vehicle carrying 80,000 doses of Covishield started for Prayagraj from Varanasi at around 6.15pm and would be arriving at the district by night. The ‘festival’ would commence in the district from Sunday at all 97 vaccination centres.” Earlier in the day, the health department had conducted vaccination at five centres of the city including MLN Medical College, Kamla Nehru (Colvin) Divisional hospital, Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital, Duffrin hospital and Railway hospital of the city. The count of vaccination centres was cut down from the original 97 centres and the recent 34 centres owing to the shortage of vaccines in the district.In a bid to control the use of available stock, vaccination was stopped at many rural-based primary health centres of the district and was being done only at Community health centres (CHC) for the past two days. To effectively take on the Covid-19 outbreak, vaccination was started at 61 PHCs of the district in March. However, on Wednesday, vaccinations by these centres were stopped till further notice and just the 20 CHCs were administering the vaccines. On Saturday, the vaccination process was held only at five centres of the city and all these centres witnessed a heavy rush of denizens who had turned up at the centres to get themselves vaccinated. Because of the heavy rush, the stock of vaccines was over by noon at many centres, a few of which continued with the second dose of the vaccine only. Because of this, many persons had to return disappointed. At a few centres, people were seen arguing with the on-duty staff. At one of the centres, 75-year-old Rajkumari Devi of Alopibagh looked disheartened at not getting vaccinated. She shared that she had somehow climbed down three floors of her house to get vaccinated. “Now, I am told there is no vaccine and I need to come again tomorrow. However, I will not be coming again as it has been exhausting for me,” she said.Like her, Girdharlal, Sohan, Raju and Kajal were also annoyed at not being able to get vaccinated. They were complaining that the government should have made proper arrangements for the vaccine as the government is fully aware of the prevailing Covid-19 vaccine situation. The district nodal officer of the vaccination said, “We have done micro-level preparations for starting the vaccination festival from Sunday and it would be our effort to see to it that more and more eligible people are vaccinated during these four days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-gets-80k-covid-doses-vaccination-drive-at-all-centres-to-resume-today-101618078705976.html

Additional CMO, Dr Lalit Kumar, nodal officer of the home isolation cell, said the cell has 21 operators, four doctors and a nodal officer. “They are keeping a close tab on the persons, who have recently travelled to foreign countries in the recent past,” he said.GHAZIABAD TO GET 80,000 DOSESMeanwhile, the Ghaziabad district will get a fresh supply of 80,000 doses on Sunday morning from Lucknow. Sources in the state health department said that both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have been given a target of vaccinating 18,000 beneficiaries each on April 11 and 35,000 each on April 12 and 13 during the tika utsav announced by the state government. The vehicles were dispatched Saturday to the vaccine depots at Lucknow and Agra.

The vaccine which we get from GB Nagar will be returned to them once our stock arrives. It is an internal arrangement so that vaccination process is not hampered,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey.He had claimed on Thursday and Friday that there was no shortage of vaccines in the district. “We will be getting 80,000 doses by Sunday morning and this will help us take up vaccination drive during the tika utsav and in the meantime, some stock will also be taken from GB Nagar,” said Dr NK Gupta, CMO, Ghaziabad.CASES ON THE RISEWith 221 new cases detected on Saturday, GB Nagar has crossed the 1,000-case mark of active cases in the district, with the figure at 1,121.

10-04-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal only leader with vision for nation, schemes now seen in other states: Sisodia||Pushing Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as the “only leader with a vision for the nation”, deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia on Saturday said the proof for this could be seen in other states that have adopted several of his government’s schemes.“Recently, when Union home minister Amit Shah was campaigning in West Bengal, he promised free electricity up to 200 units to the people there if the BJP is voted to power. In Kerala, the BJP promised free public transport for women, and in Tamil Nadu, the party said that they’ll bring in a model of governance that’s similar to what is seen in Delhi,” Sisodia said at a press conference.He said Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi promised free electricity in Assam and Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had announced free bus rides for women. All these schemes were first introduced in Delhi, he said.“The BJP and the Congress are fighting elections across the country on the foundation of the Kejriwal model of governance. This proves that Kejriwal is the only leader with a vision for the nation. He understands the pulse of the people, and knows what is required to push people, and the nation ahead. He is the only leader with the administrative will to walk the talk,” Sisodia said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s, during a recent interaction with all chief ministers, emphasised on home isolation as a strong response to Covid-19, he said.“Last year, the Delhi government was the first to advise home isolation for asymptomatic cases... However, Union home minister Amit Shah — who wanted a compulsory five-day institutional quarantine — had objected, and it was only after a tough fight that this was then seamlessly implemented across Delhi. We’re pleased that the Prime Minister agrees with this,” he said. Even Modi’s suggestion of micro containment zones was the AAP government’s idea last year to contain Covid-19, while the BJP wanted entire zones to be cordoned off, the deputy chief minister said.BJP did not comment on the matter. Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said Sisoida has been trying to gradually project Kejriwal as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “But the truth is that Kejriwal is only a bad replica of Modi and not an alternative. He never spoke a word against the BJP-ruled Centre during the Shaheen Bagh [anti-CAA] protests or the northeast Delhi riots (in February 2020). Also, in every election, Kejriwal and his number two Sisodia have the habit of saying anything and everything about political parties and their leaders. Once the elections are over, the two apologise in the court to the same leaders from the BJP. Kejriwal is the B-team of the BJP,” said Dutt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-only-leader-with-vision-for-nation-schemes-now-seen-in-other-states-sisodia-101618078405722.html

They had last staged a protest against paying for utilities and facilities not being used by students on April 3. At the time, the school had asked them to wait for a few days before paying the fee. However, another notice was circulated by the school asking them to deposit the fee in its entirety. “Why are we being charged medical and media fee when students are not attending physical classes?” a parent, who did not wish to be named, asked. School asks admn for clarification The school has asked the administration to clarify whether fee is to be charged on last year’s pattern, where only tuition fee was charged, or in its entirety. Principal Pooja Prakash said, “With the start of the new academic session, we have asked the parents to pay the fee. Should the administration modify the fee rule later, we have assured parents that the sum will be adjusted in the next payment.” “We have already accepted parents’ previous demand for monthly fee payments instead of quarterly payments,” she said She added that the school had already accepted their earlier demand and had allowed them to make monthly fee payments instead of quarterly payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fee-row-parents-protest-outside-chandigarh-school-101618077446330.html

The procurement drive garnered a good response as farmers reached the grain market in their tractor-trolleys and qued up to get their mandatory gate passes. Ambala New Grain Market Commission Agents’ Association president Duni Chand said the strike had been called off after a meeting with the state government. “Officials of the concerned department told us that they had already written to and discussed the issue with the Union government, which will take a final call. In the interest of farmers, the strike was called off last night,” he said. A farmer from Bhanoukheri village, who had come to the mandi with his crop, said he had been waiting on tenterhooks for the strike to end and came to the market after consulting his commission agent: “The process is going smoothly. Most farmers are in favour of optional payment as our agents are always available to get funds in emergencies,” he said. On April 9, a group of farmers affiliated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU, Charuni) led by Jai Singh Jalbera had protested outside the commission agent association presidents’ office demanding that procurement of the crop that had already reached the mandi be initiated. A farmer in the group had said that the strike had only been called by commission agents and had nothing to do with farmers. However, Chand denied the allegations and the Union’s district president Malkit Singh, too, dismissed them as ‘personal rivalry’. Only 54 metric tons of wheat was procured at purchase centres in Ambala due to the strike on April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-resumes-in-ambala-as-arhtiyas-call-off-strike-101618077206621.html

Even though night curfew is imposed in the district, with police claiming to be on the watch through the night to check violators, they came to know about the incident only after the bank staff informed them later.Three burglars and the incident were captured in the CCTV cameras installed near the ATM, located in the branch of State Bank of India at Ikolaha village, Khanna. A gas cutter, left behind by the miscreants, was recovered from the kiosk.Police said the CCTV footage showed three men turning up at the bank in a car around 2am. They entered the ATM kiosk after breaking open the locks of the shutter. No security guard was present.As they tried to break into the machine using a gas cutter, it suddenly caught fire.Alarmed by the flames, which engulfed the entire kiosk, the burglars fled from the spot. Locals informed the bank officials on noticing the fire, following which the police were informed. A fire tender was rushed to the spot and the flames were doused in around an hour.Bank manager Rubal said the ₹19.5 lakh in cash, loaded in the machine just a day ago, was completely gutted in the incident.Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gursharandeep Singh Grewal said the police were trying to identify the accused through the CCTV footage. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Khanna) Rajanparminder Singh has been asked to speed up the investigation and arrest them soon.This is the second such incident in the past four months.On December 15, 2020, burglars trying to steal money from an unmanned ATM on Ferozepur Road had burnt ₹5.32 lakh in cash. The Punjab and Sind Bank ATM is situated opposite Verka Milk plant, but no police team noticed the fire. The incident came to light only after bank officials informed the police the next morning.Earlier on December 2, three masked men stole ₹26.37 lakh after cutting open an HDFC ATM in Lall Kalan village of Samrala.

Police officials said that traffic police personnel were deployed at interchanges on EPE in Ghaziabad to minimise the hardships faced by commuters.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that all the seven interchanges of EPE remained non-operational due to the farmers’ protests. The protesters said that the blockade will continue till 8am on Sunday. “The blockade will continue for 24 hours, and will be lifted on Sunday morning. It is because we needed to remind the government of our demands as they are not talking to us. The protesters will stay at EPE on Saturday night and have made arrangement for beds and foods,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee. The NHAI officials expressed helplessness over the state of affairs as one carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway is also blocked by protesters since December 3 last year. “All the seven interchanges on the 135km EPE remained blocked, and this also resulted in loss of toll. The commuters also suffered. We have conveyed the issue to the administration,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. On several occasions, farmers have blocked the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and EPE as part of their protests and have been successful in their blockades. “As the farmers blocked the EPE, we ensured that commuters were diverted to other routes without any problems. Regarding the blockade, we will hold meeting and discuss the future course of action,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The traffic police said that they deployed personnel to prevent traffic jams on the EPE. “Our personnel remained deployed at interchanges in Ghaziabad and ensured that traffic was diverted through other surface roads. Commuters faced issues but we tried our best to divert them to the best available alternate route. The traffic on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway was not affected due to the blockade,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). According to official estimates, the EPE has a movement of about 40,000-50,000 passenger car units per day. The EPE is also linked now to the recently opened Delhi-Meerut Expressway through an interchange near Dasna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-block-epe-in-ghaziabad-for-24-hours-traffic-diverted-101618076726308.html

According to police, the suspects, identified as Sapna and Ankit, 24, were in a relationship. The deceased, Mukesh Kumar, was a native of Badaun. Mukesh lived in a rented accommodation with his wife, and their two daughters aged one and two years, police officials said, adding that Ankit and Mukesh both worked as daily wagers.Sudhir Kumar, station house office (SHO) of Sector 49 police station, said that police on Friday received information about a suspicious death in Barola village. “The police questioned Sapna but her statement was not coherent. She initially said that she does not know how he died,” he said. Police sent the body for post-mortem and a report revealed he was strangled to death, the SHO said.Police revisited the crime spot and interrogated Mukesh’s wife again about the incident. “We also received information that the woman was in a relationship with a person named Ankit, who lived in the neighbourhood. During questioning, she admitted that she killed her husband with the help of Ankit,” the SHO said.According to police, the woman offered her husband drinks on Friday night and when he lost consciousness, she called Ankit and they strangled him to death with a piece of cloth. Police also recovered the cloth used in the crime. A case has been registered against the suspects under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. “The two suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.

A mobile phone was recovered from the woman home guard on duty in the women’s cell, jail officials said, adding that the device is not allowed inside the jail. However, the home guard, Sadhna, claimed that an inmate had given her the mobile phone, the officials said. An FIR was registered against her at Ecotech-1 police station.According to Luksar jail superintendent Bhim Sen Mukund, the jail administration had received information that someone was using a phone to facilitate unauthorised contact between inmates and their family members. “On Friday, we conducted an intensive search of the inmates and then staff members,” he said. Mukund said that the officials did not find any mobile phone or any suspicious object from the inmates. “The woman jail warden checked the staff and recovered a mobile phone from a home guard, Sadhna,” Luksar jailer A K Singh said in a police complaint. A mobile phone charger was also found from her possession. Mukund said the home guard is pregnant and it appears she got access to the premises without strict checking due to her health condition. “We have also written to the commandant, home guard, to take action against her,” he said. It is not clear if the home guard charged inmates for facilitating phone calls, the jail officials said. Rameshwar Kumar, SHO of Ecotech I police station, said a case has been registered against Sadhna under Section 42 of the Prisons Act. “We are investigating the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/home-guard-in-luksar-jail-booked-for-facilitating-inmates-phone-calls-101618076605617.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A fairy tail come true||Aryaman Jain, a budding 12-year-old bird photographer, was out with his dad at the Cactus garden, Panchkula, when an ethereal avian darted into view from amid the leafy boughs. The child’s imagination was tickled to the core at the flash of a black and white bird with long ribbons trailing and twirling behind it.“I told my dad that something was stuck to the bird’s body. I could never imagine that a bird could have such a long and unusual tail. Within a few seconds, the bird disappeared in the trees before momentarily reappearing.The bird looked like a winged white mouse to me because it was playing hide and seek. Dad (Anuj) chuckled and told me that it was a male Indian paradise flycatcher and that its tail was for real. I was wonderstruck; the bird was like a fairy in its movements and appearance. With great difficulty, I captured a photograph of the furtive bird with dad’s old camera and posted it on my chat group. My friends thought the ‘pic’ was real cool, ‘awsum’, and wanted to know this amazing bird’s name,” Aryaman told this writer.The reactions of Aryaman, a resident of Sector-18 and a Class-7 student at St Kabir Public School, to the flycatcher typify the compulsive charm the bird’s aerobatics and elegance exert on all, irrespective of age. The flycatcher is a favoured model and has graced jacket covers of innumerable bird books. A tryst with the flycatcher can sow the seeds for lifelong interest in our winged friends.Rings of passageRings embedded in a tree trunk mark the passage of time. The earth’s orbit around the sun is again a measure of time. The rings of Saturn circling the giant planet comprise ice and rock. So, what did the rings on an enigmatic river pebble lying dormant in the parched seasonal rivulet draining into Siswan dam in the Shivalik foothills embody? The answer is: the river’s passage. Were the rivulet to go dry permanently, ringed pebbles would be rendered relics left in time’s wake and aesthetically evidence its erstwhile flow. “Random abrasion of the pebble as it transits in the river system results in smoothing and rounding off its sharp corners and edges. Transport of pebbles in rivers and streams leads them to collide and rub against one another and the stream bed. These pebble rings are formed due to fluctuation of water levels of the river and groundwater during different time periods. Rounding of grains provides clues to the amount of time sediment has been in the transportation cycle,” Panjab University geology associate professor Ashu Khosla told this writer upon examining the fascinating pebble.Professor RS Chaudhri, former chairperson and director of Geology (PU), elucidated further: “Were we to take recourse to a layman’s analogy, one could imagine a stack of papers and cardboards. The papers will degenerate faster, but the cardboard is more resilient. That would leave the cardboards prominent in the stack and that is what the rings are in the pebble. In this river pebble, there were once layers of coarse and fine materials. The coarse material (mainly sands) projects out as rings whereas fine-layered material (silt and clay) gets eroded as sand is comparatively harder and more resilient. This is the peculiar character of sandstones of the Middle and Upper Shivalik formations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-a-fairy-tail-come-true-101618076546919.html
10-04-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh extends lockdowns in several cities, ramps up oxygen supply||Madhya Pradesh on Saturday announced a slew of measures, including lockdowns in several districts, to contain the surging cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), officials said. A senior official said the lockdown will be in place till April 19 in some areas and in others, it has been extended till April 22.The lockdown was extended till April 22 in Jabalpur city and Balaghat, Narsinghpur and Seoni districts. Madhya Pradesh’s additional chief secretary (home) Rajesh Rajora said that collectors in these districts will soon issue orders related to the lockdown. “The lockdown will be in force in Indore city, Rau, Mhow, Shajapur city and some districts like Ujjain, Barwani, Rajgarh and Vidisha till 6am on April 19. Lockdown will be in force from April 12 till the morning of April 22 in Balaghat, Narsinghpur and Seoni districts as well as Jabalpur city, and orders under section 144 of CrPC will be issued by respective collectors soon,” Rajora was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Madhya Pradesh on Saturday recorded 4986 cases of Covid-19, the state’s highest single-day surge since the beginning of the pandemic, which took the tally to 332,206. Madhya Pradesh also reported 24 fatalities, which have pushed its death toll to 4160. The state currently has 32,707 active cases of Covid-19. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday expressed concern that the number of Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh may reach 100,000 by the end of April due to the spike in the number of infections.Along with the imposition of lockdown in several districts, the Madhya Pradesh government ramped up its oxygen supplies to treat Covid-19 cases in the state. Indore MP Shankar Lalwani said that lockdown measures in the city have now been extended to weekdays. Indore was already under the 60-hour weekend lockdown ordered by the chief minister on Thursday. Lalwani said that measures are being taken to increase the number of beds in the hospitals.“We have extended the lockdown in Indore from Monday to Friday. A 24x7 Covid control room will provide virus-related information to the public. We are working on increasing the number of normal and ICU beds in hospitals,” Lalwani was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Lalwani pointed out that the oxygen demand rose by 60% on Saturday. The chief minister on Friday also highlighted that the supply of oxygen needed to treat Covid-19 patients in the state has risen from 60 metric tonnes to 180 metric tonnes.The state government also opened Covid-19 care centres to tackle the rising Covid-19 cases. The chief minister said that a team is identifying buildings where facilities can be set up to treat Covid-19 patients. Chouhan also said the state is planning to buy Remdesivir injections to ensure there is no shortage.Madhya Pradesh high court on Saturday also asked members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and MP Nursing Home Association to refrain from exploiting the Covid-19 surge and not overcharge affected people seeking treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-extends-lockdowns-in-several-cities-ramps-up-oxygen-supply-101618075717500.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sikhism: Evolved living or organised religion||The Hindus claim that Sikhs are a warrior sect of theirs while the Western world mistakes them for an offshoot of Islam given their looks. The Sikhs, however, insist upon their separate ethnic identity. The evolved concept of life enunciated by the Gurus, transcending the bigotry of an organised religion, remains largely obscured behind superficial symbolism. Born out of an interface of Hinduism with Islam, Sikhism is a confluence of these two mighty faiths, harvesting the essence of both. A disciple who is ever ready to learn and for whom the quest for knowledge never ceases is what defines a Sikh. A Guru for this seeker is someone next only to God in reverence. His gurdwara is not just a temple or final destination, it is the door to his spiritual journey. He believes in one Divine Creator, the only omnipresent truth and the only omniscient reality. For him, this supreme power is so indefinable and all pervasive that no symbol or idol can possibly represent it. He bows only before the Hukam (Divine Order) and what ever this order ordains for him is auspicious and what does not come to pass is surely not for his good. He believes in the humility of being just a pawn of cosmic chess. He discharges all duties and obligations towards his family and society avoiding the path of renunciation or ascetic austerities. He is supposed to be a sannyasin and a householder wrapped in one body. He values the concept of miri-piri, which defines the co-existence of worldly and spiritual authority. For him kirt karo naam japo wand schako (honest earnings, meditation upon the creator and sharing of earnings) are prerequisites for his journey. He denounces the hierarchy of caste system and recites the hymns of Bhagat Kabir: Awwal Allah noor uppaya, kudrat ke sab bandey, ek noor tey sabh jag upjayaa, kaun bhaley ko mandhey (God created light of which all beings were born and from this light the universe; so who is good and who is bad). His diligent community service and sense of camaraderie insulate him from all manmade fissures of society. Recognisable in a multitude, the Khalsa (pure one) in him seeks the divine blessings to never shirk from doing good (deh Shiva bar mohey eha, shubh karman te kabhoon na taroon). To uphold his dharma he is ever ready to sacrifice his life and does not hesitate to pick up the sword when all other means of justice have failed. “At places I see Islam everywhere but Muslims nowhere while at some places I see Muslims everywhere but Islam nowhere.” These words of a Muslim scholar apply to all others faiths as well. Unfortunately, Guru Nanak’s message too has been viewed through the narrow prism of organised religion with set boundaries. To be born into a Sikh household and call yourself a Sikh is no great happening but to choose Guru Nanak and enjoy the spiritual fruits of his message is certainly a great revolutionary act. If this is grasped, one has understood the quest of the East. The writer is a Mohali-based freelance contributor.

10-04-2021||Lucknow||Four research institutes in Lucknow to restart Covid testing at their labs||Amidst steep rise in Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, four prominent Lucknow-based research institutes are set to restart corona testing at their labs as an effort to join the fight against the global pandemic. The four institutes-- National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Birbal Sahani Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) and Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) --had also conducted mass testing last year when the pandemic was on the rise. However, they stalled the testing when the number of Covid-19 cases plummeted. “We are planning to begin Covid-19 testing again as the number of cases are rising. Testing is one of the major aspects of controlling the spread of Covid-19 infection in which we want to assist the health infrastructure of the government,” said NBRI director Dr SK Barik.The administration of all the four institutes are planning to begin the testing from next week.The move came in line of the state government’s decision to boost testing following the recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The state recorded more than 12,787 cases on Saturday. Of these 4059 cases were reported from state capital itself.Currently, majority of the testing is being done by King George Medical University (KGMU) and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow, besides some private labs. If research institutes begin testing, Lucknow can test an additional of 1200 to 1500 Covid-19 samples each day.“Our staff is well equipped with handling Covid-19 testing as we had conducted large space testing last year. We are planning to follow a similar model and begin Covid-19 testing at our institute,” said director of CDRI Dr Tapas Kundu.Last year, all four institutes allocated designated labs within their campus which were used to test Covid-19 samples. Scientists and research scholars at the institutes worked in shifts to conduct the tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/four-research-institutes-in-lucknow-to-restart-covid-testing-at-their-labs-101618075406449.html
10-04-2021||Other||Random Forays: Surrender is often the best option||Those who tend to analyse every issue being faced by mankind and attempt to find a solution to each one of them are usually right-thinking people. Even if public service or governance is not strictly in the purview of their functioning, they tend to discuss threadbare with anyone who is willing to listen, their theories and ideas on the subject.The currently raging pandemic is obviously one mega pain-in-the-neck (or wherever), which has impacted one and all, and it is but natural for human beings to find out as much as they can about such a foe, even if they cannot vanquish it. Thus, each one of us has spent hours, weeks, even months frantically scanning the news, views and hues of the pandemic and its developing ‘worm’ across the graph of time versus number of people afflicted. However, since mankind at large is still groping in the dark to discover and execute a viable and sustainable plan of action against the dreaded virus, there is little point in clouding our minds with the tendency to over-theorise. Those at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic, whether medical researchers or valiant medicos, are obviously doing their very best to come up trumps against the enemy. Political and administrative bigwigs can also be relied upon to at least not take such a gloomy spectre lightly, even if they appear as clueless as the rest of us.The tendency to remain in command and to be able to control most of the forces influencing our lives, is ingrained especially in those who have seen even a modicum of power in their halcyon days. The urge to grasp the bull by the horns and just order it to buzz off, is pretty much evident in retired CEOs and government officers, for instance. The trouble is that the figurative bulls which come charging at humankind from time to time, just do not know how to follow such orders.Thus, at times, even in the face of issues much less grave, it is best to simply let go. In fact, the simplest of quotes, “Let Go, Let God!” has been one of my favourites. Very difficult to execute, but truly worth practising whenever feasible.I myself learnt the art of surrendering just a couple of years ago. And it takes some amount of gumption for me to admit this, but here goes. My wife and I were holidaying at a beach resort and she insisted on trying out the parasailing ride. She is full of bravado at most times, you see. Undaunted by the prospect of being propelled to a height of 150 metres into the thin air with nothing but a nylon rope to clutch upon, and a tiny cushion to plant oneself on, she virtually pulled me into the experience. The trepidation with which I seated myself alongside her, once we had donned the requisite gear, was no laughing business. And my worst fears were confirmed once we were a speck in the blue sky with the sea at its very bluest, in the distance below us. Far from enjoying the view, which she gaily managed to do, I held on for dear life. It was there, up in the skies, with the gusty breeze threatening to topple us, that I realized that I have no control over the situation and might as well relish it. Something clicked in that moment and I surrendered to the Almighty, even managing a smile or two during the second half of the ride.Surrender to God is not like child’s play to those of us who have never let our egos relax. It requires grit and will power. Being able to admit a fault or being humble enough to concede defeat are similar acts of mental surrender.Paramahansa Yogananda suggested the following inspirational prayer: “O Divine Sculptor, chisel Thou my life to Thy design!”The simplest of human beings, those who are perhaps unlettered, their minds uncluttered by vestiges of any powerful hats donned in the past, find it easier to relax and accept their fates. By not over thinking and by letting go of those worrying tendencies, we actually live superior lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/random-forays-surrender-is-often-the-best-option-101618075226753.html

The threat call comes days after a Varanasi court on Thursday ordered an archaeological survey of a centuries-old mosque complex abutting the famous Kashi Vishwanath temple, saying the exercise was required to decide on pleas that allege the mosque was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after partially demolishing a Hindu shrine. Pandey along with Sonmantha Vyas and Rangnath Sharma are the petitioners in the case. They had filed the case on behalf of Swayambhu Lord Vishweshwar in the court. Pandey said on Thursday he received the call from an unknown number wherein a person threatened him saying that even though he had won the case, he will not be able to get survey done by ASI. He will face serious consequences. Pandey said he filed a complaint with police in this regard on Friday. Assistant commissioner of police, Dashshwamedh, Awadhesh Pandey said a probe was being conducted and two cops have been deployed in security of Pandey. The mobile number from which the call was made was also being probed. Earlier, civil judge (senior division) Ashutosh Tiwari had ordered a five-member committee -- comprising two Hindu, two Muslim members and an archaeological expert -- to oversee the “comprehensive physical survey”. A court-appointed observer will chair the panel. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will conduct the exercise at its expense without any media briefings, the judge had ordered. The court had fixed May 31 as the next date of hearing. “This court finds that survey by ASI alone can bring out the truth before this court. Irrespective of what surfaces, the survey by ASI may go on to help not only to the plaintiffs, but also to the defendants, if their version is indeed true,” the order read. Muslim parties had opposed the decision and said they will approach the Allahabad high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-of-the-litigants-in-kv-gyanvapi-case-receives-life-threat-101618075225453.html

The civic body is providing land, a source of water, and electricity connection in this venture. The WHIPL and the JF will look after the maintenance and daily operations of the facility.“In such a type of facility, the water is passed through a six-stage purification process — which includes various stages of conventional filtration, membrane-based purification, and ultraviolet disinfection to ensure that the water quality meets the World Health Organization (WHO) and the ISI standards,” said Azad, adding that it is vital to drink clean water for a healthy body. She attributed the reason behind most of the diseases to impure or unfit drinking water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-sector-9-gets-community-based-water-purification-plant-101618074867521.html
10-04-2021||Gurugram||Man, friend held for assaulting pregnant partner, causing stillbirth||Two persons were booked and arrested on Sunday after a woman alleged that the duo, including her live-in partner, assaulted her when she was five months pregnant leading to stillbirth. The duo destroyed the foetus and threatened the woman’s life, the police said.The complainant, a 24-year-old woman from Tamil Nadu, works as a domestic help in Saraswati Vihar of Chakkarpur. Over the last year, she got acquainted with a native of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, who works as a driver, and started living with him.According to the police, the woman, upon getting pregnant, insisted that the man marry her while he wanted her to abort the foetus. On April 8, the man, along with a friend, is alleged to have assaulted the woman after she refused to undergo an abortion and the argument escalated.Due to the injuries, the woman gave birth prematurely, leading to stillbirth, and the accused destroyed the foetus. They admitted her to Civil Hospital on April 9 as her condition deteriorated, where she informed the doctors about her ordeal. The hospital staff subsequently informed the police and a case was registered.“The accused forced me into a physical relationship and made me pregnant. He killed my child,” said the woman in her complaint filed with the police, alleging that the accused kept promising to marry her to stop her from filing a complaint against him.On the basis of her complaint, a case was registered under sections 201 (destruction of evidence), 313 (abortion without consent of woman), 323 (causing hurt), 34 (common intention), 376(2) (repeated rape of woman by known person) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 29 police station on Sunday. “Both the accused were arrested and sent to jail,” said KK Rao, the commissioner of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-friend-held-for-assaulting-pregnant-partner-causing-stillbirth-101618074866888.html
10-04-2021||Gurugram||Land allotted for fire station in Sector 92||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday approved the transfer of 2.5 acres to the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) for constructing a fire station in Sector 92, during a meeting of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).Officials of the fire department said it is imperative to set up a fire station in Sector 92 as the closest fire stations on either side, at IMT Manesar and Sector 37, are located at least seven kilometres away and it takes them 25-30 minutes to reach the sector during peak traffic hours, due to congestion at the Kherki Daula toll and on National Highway-48.“The decision to build a fire station in Sector 92 is important as in the advent of a fire incident, it takes us over 30 minutes to reach there. We desperately needed to reduce the response time and distance, especially given that newer sectors (58-115) are still developing and will expand further,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).Several high-rises and residential societies, such as DLF New Town Heights, Orchard Avenue Signature Global, Spaze Privy, DLF Regal Gardens, Sare Homes and Ansal Heights, are located close to Sector 92.Kashyap said that as per the Haryana Fire Service Act, the ideal response time in urban areas should be around five minutes. However, he said that due to the size, traffic volume and population of Gurugram and Manesar, in comparison to other cities in Haryana, this is impossible to achieve and as a practice, the fire department aims to at least ensure a response within 15 minutes.Officials said the entire process, including construction, would take around two years.“Drawings for the project first need to be prepared and subsequently, approved.

The shooters mistook him for Chauhan and shot at him, killing him on the spot,” he said.The police said that Deepu was associated with the duo. He met Panchal on Sohna Road before the incident and went to Feroz Gandhi colony to identify Chauhan’s house, the police said.Deepu, during questioning, revealed that the duo went to kill Chauhan out of rivalry as Panchal wanted to have a monopoly of auto-rickshaws in Old Gurugram and Chauhan had a hold over the market, due to which he was unable to set up his transport business.Vij said Deepu was the main culprit in the case and planned the murder. “There were no key witnesses in the case, despite several people being present at the spot. We scanned CCTV footage and identified Deepu, following which he was arrested,” he said.Police said Manish did not have a criminal record, but Chauhan was booked in several cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sharpshooter-of-kaushal-gang-arrested-from-sector-10-101618074805487.html

Pawar’s instructions came after the traders have announced that they will open shops on Monday and violate the guidelines issued by the state government. Pawar said, “It is true that there is anger among traders and many other elements in the society but the Covid situation in the state is in bad shape. Usually, it is my experience that if the facts get put in front of any organisation and people, they agree to the state government’s decision.” Pune traders’ association president Fattechand Ranka said, “If the state government would announce a complete lock down, we would support it and follow all instructions. However, instead of the complete lock down, state government announced half open, and half shut lockdown, we would open our shops on Monday. We got the message from the district administration for Sunday’s meeting.” Ranka said, “Half lockdown create more confusion, we spoke with the Maharashtra traders’ association. They also took the same stand that if there would be a strict lockdown and everything would be closed, we would support it but if it continues to be a half lockdown, shops would open on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-instructs-officials-to-meet-traders-101618071024810.html

To ensure the smooth supply for sale, purchase and distribution this order has been given to the concerned establishments,” the order stated.“There is more demand for Remdesivir from private hospitals and so it has created artificial scarcity. No person will get Remdesivir from any retailer. If a patient requires the injection, it will be made available by the hospital. We are starting a helpline for complaints regarding Remdesivir. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) joint commissioner has been appointed as a nodal officer,” said Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner of Pune.In the last few days, acute scarcity of Remdesivir has been experienced in Pune. The patient’s kin have been crowding the chemists’ shops where the injection is available. The administration also had received complaints regarding overcharging for a vial. In the light of all these events, the district collector has issued specific instructions for the hospitals to provide the injection to the patients.Hospitals are asked to place the order of Remdesivir to the supplier keeping the requirement for three days in mind. Suppliers will have to provide the daily sale report of the drug including hospital name, associated chemists name, bills, total sale to Pune Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The hospitals which do not have associated medical stores can place orders to wholesale suppliers or ‘C and F agents’. Hospitals will have to provide Remdesivir with government-approved rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hospitals-to-provide-remdesivir-injections-to-patients-says-pune-dist-collector-rajesh-deshmukh-101618070784756.html

These colonisers have also failed to respond to a notice sent to them to explain such action. Of 750 illegal colonies on PDA’s record spread across Patiala, Sangrur, Fatehgarh Sahib and Barnala, only 129 have applied under the state government’s regularisation scheme notified two years ago. Only three of these have been regularised to date. “On the basis of complaints received, we carried out a survey and issued notices to 13 colonies under the Punjab Regional Town Planning and Development Act, so as to initiate action under the state’s regularisation policy,” Surabhi Malik, chief administrator, PDA.She added that of 13 colonies, developers of five such units submitted their explanation, while one colony falls under the jurisdiction of the Patiala municipal corporation. “Seven developers failed to respond within stipulated time. We have written to the police to register FIRs against them,” Surbhi added. The FIRs will be registered under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA), 1995.On the whole, authorities have failed to take action against colonisers who have not applied for regularisation of their properties under the policy. According to the new regularisation policy notified in October 2019, colonies developed before March 2018 were to be regularised and action was to be taken against those who failed to follow the law. A coloniser, whose project has been regularised, said laxity on the part of the state government in initiating action against the defaulters was not a positive sign. “The state government had come up with regularisation policies in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018. Yet, no action has been taken against the defaulters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/illegal-colonies-patiala-development-authority-wants-firs-against-7-colonisers-101618070487722.html

In a press conference, Daduwal, a radical Sikh preacher, claimed that the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government had failed to make any headway in cases of sacrilege of Sikh religious scriptures and the death of two persons in police firing in October 2015.“The Sikh sangat has no faith left in the Congress government and it will have an adverse electoral impact on the party in assembly polls scheduled next year,” Daduwal claimed, adding that Punjab government should approach the Supreme Court to challenge the Punjab and Haryana high court that quashes probe reports that the state police’s special investigation team (SIT) had submitted in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing. Daduwal alleged that Amarinder has a hidden pact with the Badal family and the government was working to protect them. “In the run-up to 2017 assembly polls, Amarinder announced that arresting those behind incidents of sacrilege and subsequent deaths of two persons in the police firing will be his priority. Four years on, there has been no progress in any case. Now, the HSGMC will ensure that families affected by police firing get legal support,” Daduwal claimed. He also questioned jathedar Dhian Singh Mand for withdrawing Insaf Morcha in December 2018. “Mand was leading the anti-sacrilege agitation, that lasted for 192 days, when it was ended suddenly on the promises made by Congress government. Victims’ families have told me that they have not got justice, so Mand should start a dharna outside the residence of the CM. Sikh sangat is still waiting for promises he made to be fulfilled,” said the Sikh preacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-move-sc-in-2015-behbal-kalan-firing-case-hsgmc-chief-daduwal-101618065804956.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt may impose lockdown to stop Covid-19 surge; decision on duration to be decided soon||The Maharashtra government is keen on imposing a lockdown as the state struggles to contain the surge in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at an all-party meeting on Saturday said that the decision on the lockdown will be announced soon but a consensus has been reached regarding the imposition of lockdown, people familiar with the developments said. Thackeray is scheduled to hold a meeting with the state task force on Sunday and will meet other stakeholders over the next two days following which a decision on the duration of the lockdown may be announced.The state has already announced weekend lockdown—from 8pm on Friday till 7am on Monday, in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. The Maharashtra government earlier warned that a strict Covid-19 lockdown is needed to arrest the Covid-19 spike in the state. Health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said that if the state cannot contain the spread of Covid-19 then a lockdown cannot be averted. “We would need a complete lockdown for 15 days to three weeks even though I am not in favour of that. If hospitals are overwhelmed, if there is a shortage of medicines and if the government is unable to cope with the growing number of patients then such a step could be taken,” the health minister said, according to a report by PTI.The state recorded more than 50,000 over the past few days. It recorded the highest single-day surge since the beginning of the pandemic on Wednesday with 59,907 cases and recorded more than 58,000 cases on Friday as well. Maharashtra is the highest contributor to the daily Covid-19 caseload as well as the active caseload and also has the most number of districts that are reporting daily surges in Covid-19 numbers, according to data released by the Union health ministry. Among the 10 districts pointed out by the health ministry, which account for more than 45% of the total active cases, six are from Maharashtra. Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik and Aurangabad have reported a large spike in daily Covid-19 cases as well the number of active Covid-19 cases.The state government was involved in a war of words over the allotment of vaccines with the Centre on Friday when health minister Tope claimed that the state has not received adequate amounts of doses. The claim was refuted by the Centre as Union health minister Harsh Vardhan accused the Maharashtra government of using vaccine dose deficit as an excuse for the recent spike in cases and also held the state government responsible for holding the nation back in its fight against the pandemic.The financial capital on Friday also reported a crunch in the shortage of vaccines which led to a temporary halt in the vaccination drive. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Friday also announced that private vaccination centres will have to stop vaccinating people until April 12 due to a shortage of vaccines and centres run by the civic body and government will administer vaccines on Saturday and Sunday. BMC also received 99,000 vaccine doses earlier on Saturday which it distributed to vaccination centres run by the government and the municipality.India recorded 145,384 new coronavirus cases on Saturday setting a new record while recording 794 fresh fatalities in the last 24 hours, taking the tally to 13.21 million. The country has reported the highest number of cases in the past week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-may-impose-lockdown-to-stop-covid-19-surge-101618064588237.html

10-04-2021||Pune||Amidst lockdown talks, board firm on offline exams for 10th and 12th||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) officials have ruled out online board exams for Classes 10 and 12 saying that such an exercise is not feasible.The examinations for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) are scheduled to be conducted offline from April end. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with all party leaders on Saturday, calling for stricter restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19. After a surge in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad issued an order promoting all students from Class 1 to Class 8 without conducting exams recently. This week, Gaikwad also issued an order to promote students of Classes 9 and 11 without an examination. However, the decision regarding Classes 10 and 12 is still pending. Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE said that the board has issued hall tickets to all students of Class 10 and Class 12. “The hall tickets have been issued. There is an increase in Covid cases, however, we are continuing with the preparations for the upcoming examination. But online examination is not an option for the board,” said Patil. He added that the board does not have enough infrastructures to conduct online examinations. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune district Mukhyadhyapak Sangh said that the board does not have the infrastructure needed to conduct online exams. “If students have to visit the centre and give the online test, then how is an offline examination a bad option? We have to understand that taking online examinations in remote parts of the state are a challenge, and in the given condition it is not a feasible one. The education department will take a relevant decision in this regard soon,” said Gaikwad. He further added that many teachers who are above the age of 45 years have already taken the vaccination to stay safe ahead of the scheduled exam dates. “Moreover, there can be other arrangements which can ensure students’ safety like carrying sanitizers and wearing masks. These are already made compulsory by the board,” said Gaikwad. On the condition of anonymity, another official from the education department said that since the department cannot conduct the examination and risk the lives of students, the exams should be postponed. “It is only fit to take this decision. A lot of other states are yet to conduct their board exams. Without exponential rise in cases of Covid in Maharashtra, the decision to postpone seems fit. However, it might affect the morale of students,” said the officials. On Friday, Varsha Gaikwad shared a video on social media stating that the health and welfare of students is the topmost priority of the government. Gaikwad urged students to stay safe and not stress about the increase in cases and the scheduled examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/amidst-lockdown-talks-board-firm-on-offline-exams-for-10th-and-12th-101618064003896.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress' Prithviraj Chavan accuses Centre of bias in Covid-19 help||Senior Maharashtra Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on Saturday accused the Centre of "discrimination on the basis of politics" in the distribution of critical medical equipment such as PPE kits, N95 masks and ventilators to various states.In a statement issued here, the former chief minister said information from the Centre itself confirmed this politically biased distribution, adding that Maharashtra, despite having the highest Covid-19 caseload, was facing step-motherly treatment.The Centre's reply to a starred question in the Lok Sabha on February 12 on distribution of medical equipments revealed a shocking picture, Chavan said."Gujarat got 9,623 numbers of N95 masks per thousand Covid-19 patients as compared to Maharashtra, which got 1,560 masks per thousand patients. Even UP got 3,916 N95 masks, more than twice that of Maharashtra. In PPE kits, Gujarat got 4,951 kits per thousand, and UP got 2,446 kits while Maharashtra got just 223 kits," he said quoting the Centre's reply in the Lok Sabha.Gujarat was given 13 ventilators per 1000 patients, UP got seven while Maharashtra got only two ventilators per thousand Covid-19 patients, with Kerala getting even less than Maharashtra on a per thousand patient basis, he said."As per the Lok Sabha reply, in all categories, Gujarat was given the lion's share of supply of medical equipment, which is disproportionate to the caseload. What is this if not discrimination based on politics," he alleged.Chavan said Narendra Modi was forgetting that he was the prime minister of the entire country and not just Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and some BJP-ruled states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-prithviraj-chavan-accuses-centre-of-bias-in-covid-19-help-101618063357086.html
10-04-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Artificial intelligence in medical space||PUNE AI-enabled radiology platform DeepTek is playing an important role in precise diagnosis of diseases like TB and Covid-19. The Pune-based startup has received strategic investment from a clutch of investors so far, and is eying another VC round in next six months. Ajit Patil and Amit Kharat co-founded DeepTek in 2017. Patil completed his schooling from SSPMS school and engineering from COEP in 1992. He has a Master’s degree from IIT-Kharagpur in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. Amit Kharat, with a DNB and PhD in Radiology, has been engaged in the radiology space for the last 17 years. Ajit Patil’s family hails from Sangli district and his father Surgonda Patil used to work with Kirloskar’s as an engineer. Patil’s father had started a manufacturing workshop which he ran after his office hours. Says Patil, “My father used to return around 6 pm from office and pick up his bag and go to the workshop. He was a role model for me to become an entrepreneur. I was a very shy person and wasn’t sure whether I was geared to be a good entrepreneur.”“Most students from COEP at the time were planning to study or work in the US, but I wanted to do business in India. I worked for one year in Telco under the sandwich programme, but then I realised and decided that I am not going to do a job anymore. I appeared for the GATE exam and went to IIT Kharagpur in 1992. During one of the breaks, I had come to Pune and met a friend from COEP. He had done his mechanical engineering, but was working at a software company called Fujitsu. I was surprised. When I went back to IIT, I was doing an industrial management programme and was asked to analyse the opportunities for the software industry in India. That time, in 1994, I realised that the software industry is a huge wave coming and can transform India. So, I also joined Fujitsu to gain some experience in the software industry. One fine day I decided to stop and go back to India. I met my father and told him I want to do something in software. My father was in mechanical engineering, but he encouraged me. That gave me the confidence. I started the company Vertex Software, a Japan-focused software services firm which had strategic equity investment from Mitsui and exited to NTT DATA. “We were one of the largest Indian companies working on the Japanese market, with over 700 employees, of which 200 spoke Japanese.”What is radiology AIArtificial Intelligence (AI) is very powerful on image analytics and radiology is all about images from MRI, CT scans and X-rays. Analysing these images and identifying the pathology or disease, to what extent it has infected or progressed, is radiology AI. Each machine and its settings are different and the human body is also different. An AI solution which works across these machines and body types is not a trivial problem. Besides, there is a lack of radiologists in almost all countries. India has only 8,000 radiologists who do CT scans, MRIs and another 8,000 do sonography, due to some regulatory issues. Considering the population of India, these are small numbers. Similarly, UK, Japan, Singapore and Australia also have radiologists in few numbers.How DeepTek was born In 2013, Ajit Patil stepped out of Vertex and decided to something else as an entrepreneur. Patil recalled, “In 2017, I was talking to Tsyoshi Kitani, then CTO of NTT Data. He mentioned that they were interested in radiology AI. They had a product in the US which was used in 1,000 hospitals there. In AI, data is the oil and without data you cannot do AI. Kitani said they had the data and wanted to explore something in this space and if I could do something, they will look at it. I started researching. I met almost 30 to 40 people including industry experts, educational experts, AI experts, and radiologists.”“I met Dr Amit Kharat and offered him co-founder of the start-up. Aniruddha Pant, who is a data scientist and also an alumnus of COEP, also came along with us at that time. We had gone to US to visit an exhibition related to radiology, organised by the Radiology Society of America. We were there for four-five days. We talked to lot of companies doing AI and tried to understand what they were doing. We learnt that none of the companies – including a few which were funded – had any commercial adoption. We were on the way back to Newark airport and almost decided that we will not pursue this idea. After a while, we realised that this idea would work only if we take radiology experts on board. We should not just depend on AI, but ask the experts to take ownership. This “expert in loop” model clicked and we all were energised. We thought this is where we can create and deliver value to the hospital,” Patil explained.Team buildingSays Patil, “In 2017, we started working on the model. We did a few things initially and then we approached NTT DATA again. NTT DATA took an immediate interest and decided to invest in our company in 2018. One of the earlier investors, Mitsui also expressed their interest and their group company Nobori, Japan’s largest Cloud PACS provider, came on board as a strategic investor. Aniruddha Pant helped us develop the data science experts’ team. We have a total team of 70 people, including 20 radiologists and 40 data science and technology experts, along with a strong leadership team. This combination is a unique thing we have created so far.” Commercial adoption strategyElaborating on their strategy, Patil said, “Since radiology AI is a large opportunity, there are many start-ups in US, Israel and Japan working in this sector. Although in 2017 we were late, what we learned was that these start-ups were finding it difficult to commercially deploy their solutions in the market.”“Commercial adoption of radiology AI workflow is not happening even now. First intervention in any hospital is an X-ray, but most of them go unreported. DeepTek’s solution is very powerful on X-rays as it can automatically identify 20 pathologies. DeepTek believes in augmenting the radiologists and not replacing them,” he stated.Says Patil, “With the “expert in the loop model” we managed to get 120 hospitals and imaging centres as our paying customers. These are mostly small and medium establishments situated in Maharashtra. Amit Kharat’s teleradiology customers became our first customers. We migrated those customers on our AI platform and now we are adding 10 customers every month. Last year, due to Covid and the consequent lockdown, we explored the overseas opportunities and got customers in Japan. We are conducting pilots in Indonesia, Phillipines and Africa also. NTT DATA and Nobori helped us with relationships and connections in getting the international customers. Apart from NTT DATA and Nobori, Gurugram-based Indo-Japanese Venture Accelerator GHV and Pune-based Pentathlon Ventures has invested in DeepTek.”TB screening solutionDeepTek has partnered with the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) to provide artificial intelligence-enabled solution for screening and triage of tuberculosis from digital chest X-rays. DeepTek has screened 100,000 people using its AI-first population screening platform, GENKI (Japanese word for healthy) since 2019. This ongoing partnership has now been extended to screen 1,50,000 patients by 2022.Effective detection tool for Covid-19A CT scan has evolved as a sensitive and effective tool for detecting the Covid-19 infection. Explaining about this solution, Patil said, “There are certain kind of patches in the CT scan images which are indicative of Covid infection. CT scan has become one of the primary techniques for segregation of Covid patients in the hospitals. A lot of research has been done globally in Japan, China, Singapore, regarding this. DeepTek has also conducted research in collaboration with Nanavati hospital and Ruby Hall Clinic (RHC). We have done a ‘proof of concept’ with Nanavati hospital and we are in the process of publishing papers related to the research conducted with RHC.”“I am pleased to see the increasing maturity of AI technology and medical imaging services at DeepTek since the beginning of its business in 2018. The technology and service helps to solve society issues as we witness in the Chennai TB elimination project. NTT DATA Intellilink will continue working with DeepTek in developing emerging technology and contributing to society,” said Tsyoshi Kitani, president and CEO, NTT DATA INTELLILINK Corporation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-artificial-intelligence-in-medical-space-101618062626229.html

10-04-2021||Mumbai||After shutting vaccination centres, BMC receives 99,000 doses of Covishield||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Saturday it has received 99,000 doses of Covishield, the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and that it will distribute them to civic and government-run inoculation centres. Vaccine shortage in Mumbai led to the temporary halting of vaccination across 75 vaccination centres in the city on Friday. The Bandra Kurla Complex, which has a mega vaccination centre set up, stopped operations on Friday morning due to a shortage of vaccines.The civic body announced on Friday evening that Covid-19 vaccination will be halted at all private centres till April 12 because of the shortage of vaccines and centres run by the government and the municipality will administer the shots to people on April 10 and April 11.“The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) received 99,000 doses of Covishield Covid-19 vaccine which will now be distributed to civic and government-run vaccine centres,” the civic body said.The Maharashtra government and the Centre blamed each other over vaccine allotment over the past week. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope claimed that the state has been allotted fewer vaccines than it needs and demanded more doses from the Centre. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan refuted the allegations and accused the state government of dragging its heels over Covid-19 vaccination and also claimed that the government is trying to shift the blame to vaccine allotment to hide its failure to contain the surge.Mumbai's mayor Kishori Pednekar warned on Friday that vaccine shortage could hit the city’s vaccination drive. “There are several vaccination centres that have no vaccines now and vaccination drive has come to a halt in those centres. I have come to know that around 76,000 to 100,000 doses are about to reach Mumbai by today but I don't have any official info on this,” Pednekar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-shutting-vaccination-centres-bmc-receives-99-000-doses-of-covishield-101618055947168.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Procurement kicks off in Punjab after arhtiyas call off strike||Wheat procurement began in Punjab on Saturday with arhtiyas (commission agents) calling off their proposed strike after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh ordered steps to ensure their continued involvement in the process and the immediate release of their pending payments of ₹131 crore without waiting for dues to come from the Food Corporation of India.On the chief minister’s directives, the state food department amended the procurement software so that the arhtiyas continue to be involved in the process of release of payments to farmers, albeit in a modified manner, while farmers get their payments in their bank accounts within 48 hours, as mandated by the state government.Captain Amarinder Singh said that despite the Government of India’s directive to exclude them from minimum support price (MSP) payments, “the arhtiyas shall always be associated with procurement. Till I am there, you will part of the system, and your role will always remain.” He said he will ensure that the arhtiya commission and other charges permitted under the APMC Act shall continue.Fought hard on DBT but Centre adamant: CMOn the Centre’s refusal to accept the state’s request for deferring the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system, the chief minister said, “We fought hard, but the Centre was adamant, and even went to the extent of threatening not to procure from Punjab if we did not implement the DBT.”The chief minister ordered the finance department to release ₹131 crore due to the arhtiyas without waiting for it from the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which had withheld payments after some commission agents failed to upload details. He assured the arhtiyas that his government will take up with the Centre the issue of 30% deduction in labour payments made by the FCI.He thanked Vijay Kalra, the president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, for heeding to the government’s plea to withdraw the strike and lift the grain as the farmers would otherwise have suffered. He appealed to the arhtiyas to take care of Covid norms. The government had to delay procurement this year till April 10 (from the previously scheduled April 1) on account of the second surge of Covid.Passes to be issued to reduce congestion at mandisThe chief minister said like last year, farmers will be issued passes this year to reduce congestion at the mandis (grain markets) in view of the pandemic. He assured farmer passes will be issued at the district level in consultation with arhtiyas, who know which farmer has harvested his crop and is ready to come to the mandi. He said arhtiyas are not middlemen but service providers.Announcing the withdrawal of the strike in the interest of the state and farmers, Kalra thanked the chief minister and said the Centre is penalising Punjab for the farmers’ agitation. State food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told the chief minister the arhtiyas simply wanted protection for their business and livelihood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/procurement-kicks-off-in-punjab-after-arhtiyas-call-off-strike-101618055603842.html
10-04-2021||Pune||Dr RK Naidu’s legacy lives on at Naidu hospital||During any pandemic or infectious disease outbreak, the Naidu Hospital is at the centre of the state’s response to the crisis. As the Covid-19 pandemic completed one year in March, HT, in a series of articles, covered Naidu hospital and tried to get information about who the hospital is named after. After reading the article, relatives of Dr Naidu contacted this reporter and provided information about Dr Naidu and his achievements. The plan is to draw up a proper profile and hand it to over to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), along with a photograph of Dr Naidu to be put up in the hospital.Dr Naidu’s full name is Ramchandra Krishnaswami Naidu. He was an eye specialist and did excellent work during the plague that affected Pune and Mumbai during the British rule. He was also a member of the Pune Municipal Council and an active member of Lokmanya Tilak’s Swaraj party. During plague, he built a mandap on the premises of what is today Naidu hospital to treat patients. Dr Naidu was actively supported by the British in his endeavour. Dr Naidu too got affected by the plague, but after recovering, he once again started to serve the patients.Dr Ramchandra Krishnaswami Naidu was born on July 1, 1885. He was from South India, but settled in Pune. Earlier, he worked in Solapur as a compounder, but later took a medical degree from Mumbai and worked with Sassoon Hospital.Dr Naidu’s relative, Sharmila Nandula, who resides in Hyderabad, provided details of his living grandchildren, some of whom are living in Pune. She said, “Dr Naidu did excellent work, but the new generation is not aware about it. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi contacted the nurse from the Naidu hospital, we all felt very proud. Even we are trying to compile Dr Naidu’s profile and will hand it over to the PMC.”Dr Naidu’s grandson, Vivek Naidu, said, “Dr Naidu’s residential address was 473-74 Somwar peth near Daruwala Bridge. Later it was sold. Our family has all his medals and certificates with us. Our wish is to bring his achievements in front of a new generation and even appeal to the PMC to put up his photo in the Naidu Hospital.”Naidu added, “After Dr R K Naidu’s demise, Pune’s first mayor Baburao Sanas suggested Dr Naidu’s name for Dr Naidu Hospital.”Who was Dr R K Naidu- 1915-24 – passes out of BJ Medical college- 1929-1941- Mumbai University senate1944 - Maharashtra and Karnataka Medical council president1922-1946 - Indian Medical Association, Pune chapter president1922-1939- Pune Municipal Council member1928,1929 and 1932- Pune Council presidentHe was associated with following institutes in Pune:Founder - Raja Dhanraj Giri High SchoolCamp Education society presidentModern Education Society and Wadia CollegeSound Indian Saraswati VidyalayaProgressive Education Society||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dr-rk-naidu-s-legacy-lives-on-at-naidu-hospital-101618054103789.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: HC grants bail to two men in murder, conspiracy case||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to two persons, facing prosecution in a case of murder and criminal conspiracy relating to last year's northeast Delhi riots.Justice Suresh Kumar Kait noted that the accused Pradeep Rai and Aman Kashyap are in judicial custody and the trial shall take substantial time.However, without commenting on the merit of the case, the court said it was of the opinion that the two men deserve bail.The high court directed that the two accused be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of ₹20,000 each with one surety of like amount.It directed them not to directly or indirectly influence any prosecution witnesses.The two men are accused in an FIR lodged at Dayalpur police station in northeast Delhi for offences of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy under the IPC.The counsel of the accused submitted that one of the eyewitnesses in the case is an eyewitness in multiple FIRs lodged at Dayalpur police station relating to the riots incident that took place on February 25, last year.He said the incidents took place in Gali no. 10 and 3 and there is a distance of around 500-700 metres between them and therefore, he seemed to be a planted witness.The high court had directed the prosecution to verify as to how the concerned witness had witnessed the incidents which took place in different lanes.After verification, the prosecution filed a report stating that the distance between Gali no.10 and Gali no.3 is about 350 metres.To this, the high court said, “In the prima facie opinion of this court, it is possible that the eye witness, who in the present case is resident of Gali no.8, might have seen the incident taking place in Gali No.10, which is close to his place, but how he could see the present incident which has taken place in Gali No.3, and away from Gali no.10 and Gali no.8, is doubtful.”Earlier, the trial court had dismissed the bail pleas of the two men saying the eye witness' statements cannot be thrown into the dustbin merely on the bleak allegations that they are “planted witnesses”.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protestors spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-two-men-in-murder-conspiracy-case-101618053375639.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||New restrictions to be announced soon, says Delhi CM Kejriwal as Covid-19 surge||Amid escalating cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said lockdown is "not an option" but some restrictions will be put in place in the national capital which is reeling under the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The chief minister said this during an interaction with reporters after visiting the LNJP Hospital -- the mainstay of Delhi's fight against Covid-19 -- to review its preparedness."Lockdown is not an option, however, we will be putting some restrictions in place to contain the spread of the virus. We will release the restrictions in the coming few days. Covid centres are being rebuilt and some have already started functioning," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the chief minister's office.Kejriwal said the administration and hospitals are working to contain the fourth wave of the pandemic in the city."We are currently in a comfortable position with reference to beds and ventilators. We will ensure that the people of Delhi stay safe, to the best of our abilities," he added.Coronavirus cases in Delhi have mounted at a very rapid rate in the last few days, and the number of deaths too have risen.Delhi recorded 8,521 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Friday, the highest single-day surge since November 11 last year, while 39 more people died due to the coronavirus infection, taking the death toll to 11,196.The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11 in 2020, while on November 19, the city had recorded 131 Covid-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date."Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital on Saturday, to review its preparation in the face of the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has hit Delhi. He took stock of the situation and the facilities provided to the patients in the hospital," the statement said.At present, 1,500 beds out of 2,000 are reserved for Covid-19 patients, and the number might be increased according to requirements in the future, Kejriwal said."The last few days have seen a rise in the number of corona cases in the entire country, including Delhi. We need to simultaneously spearhead an aggressive vaccination campaign and also put in place measures that can effectively contain the spread of the virus along with making the hospital management equally effective," he said.This is the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi. The last wave was in November after which the new cases had become so few in Delhi that "health system and agencies began to lax", he was quoted as saying in the statement.It is imperative that they gain their momentum again and begin to function in the same efficient manner that they did, which helped contain the spread of the virus, the chief minister said. "The Delhi government and hospitals of Delhi are working in earnest to revert to their November level of preparation that helped contain the virus," he said.The Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital has 2000 beds. During the last wave, all 2000 were declared as Covid beds.Right now, we have declared 1,500 of those as Covid beds, 500 are still non-Covid. Slowly, the outpatient department will also be shut at the hospital and if the situation demands, all 2,000 will be made available for Covid patients, the chief minister said."Whatever is required by the hospitals from our end, will be provided. We sincerely hope and pray to God that no one falls prey to the disease but in the scenario that they do, we will ensure that the hospitals are ready for the challenge and the people of Delhi face no obstacles in recovery," he said.Asked about the vaccination campaign and preparation of the government in the face of rising cases, Kejriwal said, "I have written a letter to the prime minister (Narendra Modi), in which I have said that if adequate doses of the vaccination are made available to us; if we are given permission to increase the number of vaccination centres and if the age limit is removed then within 2-3 months we can vaccinate the entire state"."I cannot talk about the rest of the country, but according to Delhi government's level of preparation, if these three pre-conditions are met, we can assure you that all residents of Delhi will be vaccinated within 2-3 months," Kejriwal asserted.Once everyone is vaccinated, it will greatly aid in containing and ending the severity of the virus, he said."At the moment, we have vaccination for 7-10 days and the conditions for administering them, particularly the age limit, are very rigid. According to me, there is an impending need to remove these obstacles that are coming in the way of the vaccination campaign," the statement said.During his visit to the hospital, Kejriwal also spoke to a patient admitted in the Covid-19 ward through a video call facility and enquired about his condition.With the help of the video call facility at LNJP, patients can directly talk to their family members, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-restrictions-to-be-announced-soon-says-delhi-cm-kejriwal-as-covid-19-surge-101618052809147.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Allocate Covid-19 vaccines based on population, active cases: Maharashtra to Centre||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday asked the Centre to fix criteria to allocate states vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) keeping in mind the number of people and the active caseload they have. Tope once again alleged that many states, which have a lesser population than Maharashtra, have received more doses of the vaccine from the Centre. “The criteria should be decided in terms of the size of the population and the number of active cases,” Tope was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Maharashtra has claimed there is a shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in the state, setting it on a collision course with the Centre. Several senior Union ministers, including health minister Harsh Vardhan, have dismissed the claim made by the western state, which is the worst-hit region in the country, saying they were attempts to hide their incompetence.Also read | Maharashtra Covid-19: Uddhav Thackeray calls all-party meet, more curbs likelyThe Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader also said that the Centre had earmarked only 700,000 doses to Maharashtra of the latest dispatch of 3.5 crore. Another 1 million doses were allotted for the state only after “much persuasion,” Tope said according to PTI.He also said that the vaccine is the only way to develop immunity against the coronavirus disease. “We have scaled up the daily vaccination up to 6 lakh people. Weekly we are able to vaccinate 40 lakh people and monthly around 1.60 crore... We need vaccine accordingly. Where there are more cases, it is necessary that we develop immunity and vaccine is the only answer,” Tope said.Expressing concerns over the transport of vaccine doses to the many vaccination centres in the state, Tope said “Today we have 8 lakh doses available and we have been told we will get four lakh doses in a day. If the supply of doses is on a daily basis, how will the vaccines be transported to other parts of the state on time?” He also alleged that the central government was not addressing such concerns seriously.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced on Friday night that for three days beginning April 10, vaccination would be done only at government and municipal hospitals and not at private centres, citing non-availability of stock. Also, as many as 75 out of the 120 vaccination centres across the city were shut due to a shortage of vaccine doses, PTI reported.Also read | Punjab, Rajasthan join list of states facing vaccine shortageWhile the Centre has denied any shortage in vaccine supplies, few other states have followed Maharashtra’s suit and have asked for more stock.

She will also unveil the flag and the agenda of her party on the same day.She said she was compelled to launch a political party to fight for the aspirations of the people of Telangana, which remained unfulfilled even seven years after the formation of the state. Sharmila said all the existing opposition parties had miserably failed to question the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) which betrayed the people.Paying rich tributes to hundreds of youth of Telangana who laid down their lives for separate Telangana state, Sharmila said it was unfortunate that farmers and unemployed youth were dying by suicide even in the new state.“KCR (Telangana chief minister) has failed to fulfil many of his promises. There have been no pensions, no land for Dalits, no funds for corporations and no jobs for the youth. He is ruling the state like a feudal lord. He is perhaps the only chief minister who hasn’t entered the Secretariat. And he demolished the existing one to construct a new complex which he never enters,” she said.Sharmila said the self-respect of four crore people of Telangana was being crushed under the feet of the chief minister. “Those who remained loyal to him were given high positions and those who questioned him were discarded,” she said.Stating that there was a need for strong opposition to question the ruling party, Sharmila said there was no party that could question the high-handed rule of KCR. She claimed that she was the real daughter of Telangana and had every right to fight for the state. “Let the people decide whether I am justified in fighting for them or not,” she said.YSR’s widow and Sharmila’s mother YS Vijayalakshmi, who attended the meeting, became emotional while recalling the regime of her husband. She said she was happy that her daughter had come forward to realise the dreams of YSR, who left an indelible mark in the hearts of the people of Telangana.“When he died in a helicopter crash in September 2009, most of those who died of grief were from Telangana. We are deeply indebted to the people of the state,” she said and wished her daughter all the success.Earlier on Friday, Sharmila left for Khammam from her Lotus Pond residence in Hyderabad in a convoy of hundreds of vehicles. She waved at the cheering crowds at every town during the 200-kilometre-long journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-cm-s-sister-announces-launch-of-party-in-telangana-vows-to-get-rid-of-kcr-s-rule-101618048943433.html

10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab has only five days of Covid vaccine left: CM||Punjab’s Covid-19 vaccine stock will last another five days, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said on Saturday as he urged the Centre to share the schedule of supply of the vaccines. The state has been inoculating 85,000-90,000 beneficiaries in a day, and at this rate, Punjab’s present stock of 5.7 lakh vaccine doses will run out in five days, he said. Also read: Govt exported Covid-19 vaccine and allowed shortage in India: Sonia GandhiPinning hopes on fresh batches of vaccines from the Centre, Singh said that if Punjab was able to meet its target of administering two lakh shots a day, then its supplies will last only three days. Amarinder writes to Modi, Harsh Vardhan In an official statement in Chandigarh, he said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to give confirmed supply schedules for the next quarter. Despite being a slow-starter in vaccination, Punjab has inoculated more than 16 lakh people, at an average of 85,000-90,000 a day, the chief minister said at a virtual meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the party-ruled states. The meeting was attended by chief ministers of Congress-ruled states and senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Capt Amarinder Singh said people in Punjab were still not coming out in large numbers for vaccination due to the massive anger against the Government of India on the issue of farm laws. Since Punjab has a majority population of the agriculture community, even the common man is affected by the farmers’ agitation, he said. “This anger is impacting the vaccination drive,” he said. The chief minister said his government was undertaking an extensive media campaign to address misinformation around Covid-19 and vaccination hesitancy. Curve has flattened over fortnight but case fatality rate a concern Ranked 18th in the country at present in terms of daily cases reported, Punjab is showing a positivity rate of around 8%, with an average of nearly 3,000 new cases a day for over two weeks now, Capt Singh told Sonia Gandhi. The number of daily cases is slightly stable, he pointed out, adding, “This shows that the steps taken in the last three weeks are in the right direction.” Even in the graphs put up by the health ministry in the Prime Minister’s review meeting, the “curve appears to have flattened over the past fortnight,” Singh said. He said the state has 27,200 active cases at present and a recovery rate of 87.1%. The number of daily fatalities is a concern for Punjab as it is reporting around 50-60 deaths in a day, with a case fatality rate (CFR) just under 2% in the second wave. Overall, the CFR is 2.77% for all reported cases since March 2020, he said. High positivity among youngsters Pointing out that on April 9, a total of 3,459 people tested positive in Punjab and 56 deaths were reported, the chief minister said the high death rate is due to late reporting to hospitals and high comorbidities (non-communicable diseases). According to reports from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), high positivity is being seen in the younger population. More than 80% samples have been found to be positive for the more contagious and virulent UK variant of the disease, the CM said as he spoke about measures taken by his government to combat the spread. He apprised Sonia Gandhi of his communication with the Centre to seek flexibility for states to devise their local vaccination strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-has-only-five-days-of-covid-vaccine-left-cm-101618045163184.html

10-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 spike spoils city’s eating out scene||The news of eateries reopening in August, last year, came as a big relief, not only to restaurateurs but also for diners, who were thrilled to step out, albeit with all the necessary safety precautions. However, with Covid-19 cases on the rise once again in the Capital, are denizens now wary of eating out? Himanshu Pahuja, an entrepreneur and a regular diner at popular restaurants in the city, says, “I was surprised to see nearly vacant restaurants in the evening last week, near Qutab Institutional Area, Mehrauli... A lot of my friends have shifted to get-togethers at home, due to the sudden surge in cases, for safety purposes.” Kritika Seth, another Delhiite, also had a similar experience. “I get free from work by 5pm and try to catch up with friends at some or the other restaurant, as they have happy hour offers. It’s baffling to see the crowd going down at places I used to visit regularly,” says this HR professional. Restaurateurs say with the spike in Covid-19 cases over the last couple of weeks, they have noticed a dip in sales as well as diners. And the recently-announced night curfew has come an added setback. “The restaurant industry was just getting back on its feet. People have become very cautious because of the second wave, and since the vaccination is only accessible to those above the age of 45, youngsters are still at risk. Since restaurants usually target the younger crowd, things have gone slow for us again,” rues Udit Bagga, co-owner of OTB Courtyard, adding that restaurants did notice an increase in the footfall when there was a dip in cases. While some eatery owners are disappointed with a drop in the number of patrons, others reveal that diners are even hesitant to attend live performances and comedy shows. Sharad and Naresh Madan, co-directors of Imperfecto, observe that patrons feel reluctant in attending day-to-day events, too. And the case isn’t very different on Sundays either, which are usually packed during lunch hours. “Businesses have gone down drastically since the last two weekends. Sunday is very promising, as food joints see better sales, but the trend is going downwards,” says Saurabh Khanijo, managing director, Kylin Experience, who is also worried as the rent and salaries of staff have been restored to pre-Covid times. He, however, points out that delivery has picked up by around 20%.To this, Rohit Aggarwal, director, Lite Bite Foods, adds, “Request for our private dining rooms has also picked up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-spike-spoils-city-s-eating-out-scene-101618040250302.html

The farmers blocked the KMP and KGP for three kilometres from zero point on both sides.Inderjit Singh, a leader of the Morcha, said only emergency vehicles were being allowed on the expressway. Farmers from Sonepat brought their tractor-trollies and parked them in the middle of the six-lane highway, also known as the Western Periphery. The protesters, including women and children, carried black flags and raised slogans against the BJP-led central government for not accepting their demand to revoke the laws. Gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who is wanted by the Delhi Police in connection with the Red Fort violence on Republic Day during the farmers’ tractor parade, arrived at Kundli but did not reached the KMP toll, where farmers were protesting. Few farm leaders also announced that Sidhana will address the gathering and challenged the police to arrest him. The farm leaders said that they can extend the blockade on KMP if their senior leaders give directions in this regard. Police divert traffic in Sonepat, Rohtak and Jhajjar Commuters in scores of vehicles, including trucks and cars, remained stranded at Ganaur and Murthal, while two-wheeler riders were seen taking a detour through village roads. Heavy police force was deployed in Rohtak, Sonepat and Jhajjar districts on Saturday and the police made traffic diversions for commuters. On Friday, Sonepat superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa said though traffic diversions have been made, people should avoid travelling unless required. “Heavy vehicles coming from Ambala and Chandigarh on NH-44 may go towards North/East Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida via Karnal-Shamli-Baghpat-Khekra or from Panipat-Sanauli-Baghpat-Khekra to Ghaziabad and Noida.

But this year too, business prospects are not good for us, especially for small jewellers catering to middle-class families because they are struggling with an extreme cash crunch. This has affected our business."The 'wedding business' is impacted in Delhi as well. The night curfew imposed in the national capital amid the resurgence of Covid-19 has adversely affected the businesses of several wedding halls.Many couples have minimized the "grandeur wedding jingles" and thereby opted for rescheduling of events and a reduction in the number of attendees at the wedding events.Small businesses are impacted not only in Bihar but other states as well. In the past few days, several migrant workers opted to travel back to their hometowns from Delhi's Anand Vihar Bus Terminal and Mumbai's Lok Manya Terminus to avoid chaos like the previous year's lockdown, which, they (migrants) believe is very likely.On April 6, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar held a review meeting over the Covid-19 situation in the state via video conferencing.

10-04-2021||Jaipur||‘It’s clear there is shortage of vaccines in many states’: Gehlot||Countering the Central government’s claim of no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in the country, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday issued a statement and demanded that the Centre clarify the status of vaccine dosages in public.“In many states, the unavailability of the vaccine across vaccination centres has been reported. In such a situation, the central government should clearly state the lack of vaccine in public. No politics is being done in the work of vaccination but it is clear from the facts that there is a shortage of vaccines in many states. The central government should clarify the status of vaccine dosages in public,” the chief minister stated. Gehlot said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for celebrating ‘Teeka Utsav’ from Jyotiba Phule Jayanti on April 11 to Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14 but the vaccine is not available in the states. Gehlot said that Union ministers Amit Shah and Ravi Shankar Prasad have made factually false claims by saying there is no shortage of vaccines. The BJP was quick to react with spokesperson and MLA Ram Lal Sharma saying that the statements by Shah and Ravi Shankar Prasad are based on facts. “The GoI has never denied providing vaccination to states, rather has been the first to ask and fulfil requirements,” Sharma stated. Also read: Curfew to check Covid-19 spread extended in RajasthanIn the statement, Gehlot said Rajasthan has been a pioneer in Covid-19 management and vaccination from the beginning and that the state leads among all states in the vaccination of people above 60 years of age. “The central government has proposed the next consignment of 3.83 lakh doses of vaccine on April 12. Due to this, vaccination work will have to be stopped in many districts in Rajasthan tomorrow. The 3.83 lakh dosages stock will not last more than one day,” the CM said.Rajasthan received 1,07,40,860 Covid-19 vaccine doses from the Central government till April 6. Of these, 2,15,180 vaccines have been made available to the Army; 91,55,370 dosages have been used for the vaccination drive till April 8. About 4,34,888 dosages were damaged, which is less than half of the 10% limit allowed by the central government. On April 8, around 4.65 lakh people were vaccinated, which was 5.81 lakh on April 7; 4.8 lakh on April 6; and 5.4 lakh vaccine doses were placed on April 5. On the morning of April 9, there were about 9.70 lakh vaccine dosages left in the state - an average of 5.18 lakh vaccines are being administered daily in Rajasthan, as per the official state data. After the completion of today’s vaccination, there are only about 5 lakh vaccine doses left in the state which are insufficient for further vaccination, Gehlot added. As per a media report published on April 8, Andhra Pradesh currently has 1.2 days of doses are left. Bihar has 1.6 days of doses left, Uttar Pradesh has stock that can run till about 2.5 days, 2.9 days of vaccine stock is left in Uttarakhand while 3.2 days of vaccine supply remains in Odisha, 3.5 days in Madhya Pradesh and 3.8 days in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/its-clear-that-there-is-shortage-of-vaccines-in-many-states-gehlot-101618032082957.html

Earlier, the curfew was imposed from 10 pm to 6 am till April 19. Rajasthan on Friday reported 3,970 Covid-19 cases and 12 deaths.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has directed officials to ensure zero mobility in micro-containment created to contain the spread of coronavirus.He chaired a Covid-19 review meeting and issued directions for increasing testing and contact tracing of the infected people. Gehlot asked the officials to identify micro-containment zones in all districts.Gehlot has separately urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide the state with 30 million Covid-19 vaccine doses as the state’s stock was likely to finish in two days.Several states have warned that they would run out of vaccines. This has prompted Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to reiterate that there was no shortage.To be sure, the problem seems to be more a result of the last-mile allocation of vaccines within states.The Rajasthan government has also issued directions for setting up a state-level “Corona war room” and district-level control rooms.Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said that Covid-19 sampling has been increased to 55,000 daily and the target was to increase it to 10,00,00 by the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/curfew-to-check-covid-19-spread-extended-in-rajasthan-101618030942280.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Protesting farmers block KMP expressway in Haryana||Intensifying their protest against the three farm laws, farmers blocked the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway at some places in Haryana on Saturday.The blockade started at 8 am and would last 24 hours.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting farmer unions spearheading the agitation against the agriculture-related legislations, on Friday gave a call for a 24-hour blockade of the KMP expressway.The 136-km-long expressway is also known as the Western Peripheral Expressway.Protesting farmers, however, said emergency vehicles will be allowed to ply.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said the blockade would be for 24 hours.Haryana Police in the meanwhile issued a traffic advisory, asking travellers to avoid the KMP expressway.Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Navdeep Singh Virk on Friday said elaborate arrangements were in place to maintain peace and order, prevent any kind of violence and facilitate traffic movement and public transport on the expressway.Traffic diversions have been planned by affected districts especially Sonipat, Jhajjar, Panipat, Rohtak, Palwal, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Nuh, Virk said.Passengers coming from Ambala/Chandigarh side on National Highway-44 may go towards UP's Ghaziabad and Noida via Karnal to Shamli and from Panipat to Sanauli.Vehicles going towards Gurgaon and Jaipur can take National Highway-71A from Panipat and travel via Gohana, Rohtak, Jhajjar and Rewari.Hundreds of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi -- Singhu, Tikri (along Haryana), and Ghazipur -- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesting-farmers-block-kmp-expressway-in-haryana-101618028372370.html

Employees working in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Bhosari, have already suffered due to inconvenient public transport. “Many workers are still not able to come as there is no frequent bus transport facility available. If we keep companies closed, then it will be a big blow as most of the companies in Bhosari don’t have holidays on Sunday,” added Bhor. “If we keep our company closed for two days then the workflow gets disturbed as we have an off on Thursday,” said Pankaj Rao, who works at MIDC Bhosari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/small-scale-industries-to-remain-functional-during-two-day-lockdown-101618028361521.html

This comes just 24 hours before the counting of votes polled for the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC). “Let us fight politically without physically attacking me. Let’s see who has the support of the people,” said Kishore in an oblique reference to the ruling party legislators. However, he also appealed to his activists and supporters to restrain from resorting to violence. Kishore later told the reporters that some miscreants came to the SDM office and attacked the TIPRA activists by pelting stones at them. He also added that chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb and director general of police VS Yadav have called him up to know about his condition and also gave assurances of speedy action against those behind the attack. A police official said that the situation is under control and Pradyot Kishore reached home safely. No other administrative and police officials were available for comment. State ruling party’s, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said the opposition was behind the attack. “The opposition CPM is behind creating the trouble through a backdoor. People have rejected them already,” Bhattacharya said. Kishore resigned from Congress in 2019 after which he floated his political party the Tipraha Indigenous People’s Regional Alliance (TIPRA) this year and contested the 30-seated in the district council polls that were held on April 06.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-day-before-district-council-poll-results-tripura-royal-scion-attacked-101618027942704.html

My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives, Praying that the injured recover at the earliest," PM Modi tweeted.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also expressed his condolences and tweeted, "I am deeply saddened by the news of a fire in a hospital in Nagpur. In this hour of grief, I express my deepest condolences to the relatives of the dead and pray to the Gods to get well soon for the injured." Also Read: 4 dead in massive blaze at Nagpur's Covid-19 hospitalThe fire may have started from an AC unit of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on the first floor of the hospital. "The fire reportedly started from an AC unit of the ICU. The blaze remained confined to the floor and did not spread further," Nagpur Municipal Corporation's (NMC) chief fire officer Rajendra Uchke said.The Well Treat Hospital, located in Wadi area of West Nagpur, was treating patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

10-04-2021||Delhi||AAP attacks Centre over vaccine exports, BJP hits back||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled central government for exporting 64.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 84 countries, even as several states across the country claimed they were short of jabs.Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said, “As many as 109 vaccination centres in Pune were shut down due to deficiency of doses. In Mumbai, 26 vaccination centres were locked... In Odisha, more than 700 such centres were shut down... The amount of Covid vaccine doses exported or gifted to other countries by India is more than the number of people inoculated in our own nation.” He did not specify the number of doses available in Delhi. State health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said Delhi has vaccines for the next four to five days.Chadha said at a time when Covid-19 cases are on a steep rise, the Centre’s focus should be to get everyone inoculated. For this, CM Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to the Centre to open vaccination for all adult citizens.“Once the entire Indian population has been successfully vaccinated, it is then that we should export it to other nations...,” he said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday reiterated that there was no shortage and the country has more than 43 million doses in stock or in the pipeline.The Delhi BJP also hit back, saying that the AAP is trying to spread ‘misinformation’.“Today...Chadha quoted figures of stock availability of different states, but kept mum on Delhi’s vaccination stock because there is no such shortage in Delhi. In the AAP’s bid to be seen on a national platform, it is trying to create confusion on vaccine stock,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.‘PM backs Delhi model’In another press conference, senior AAP spokesperson Atishi said that in a meeting with the chief ministers, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday made suggestions to tackle Covid-19 which were part of the Kejriwal model. “The PM has asked states to implement home isolation, aggressive testing and micro-containment zones -- models that the Kejriwal government put in place -- to tackle Covid-19 across the country. It is the same model that the Union home minister [Amit Shah] rejected last year when Delhi government first introduced home isolation for asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients. Today, while 13 lakh Covid-19 tests are being conducted in the whole country, one lakh tests are being conducted in Delhi itself,” she said.The Delhi BJP said AAP and Atishi “cleverly ignored” Shah’s intervention in controlling the first wave of Covid-19 in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aapattacks-centre-over-vaccine-exports-bjp-hits-back-101618020293449.html

10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to approach HC to review stay on twin-bin garbage collection||The municipal corporation has decided to move the Punjab and Haryana high court to vacate its stay order on collection of segregated garbage through twin-bin vehicles. In the meantime, the corporation will continue to collect waste through its vehicles and also allow cart-based collectors to pick garbage through door-to-door visits. “Following legal advice from senior standing counsel (SSC) of the Chandigarh administration, we have decided to approach the high court for vacation of the stay order,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.Stating that MC will keep running its parallel system of garbage collection, Yadav said, “It is the primary responsibility of the MC to ensure sanitation in the city and that garbage is collected from all localities. So, MC vehicles will continue to collect garbage. At the same time, we will not stop any cart-based door-to-door collector, who will have to pick up waste in segregated manner.”He added that most of the garbage collectors were already on board with MC’s takeover of door-to-door garbage collection. “Of the 1,286 informal garbage collectors, 1,035 have signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) to work with MC,” Yadav said. No user charges in AprilOn the issue of user charges to be imposed in this scenario, Yadav said, “At present, proper garbage collection is our priority, so there will be no user charges in April. Sanitation has become all the more important amid the Covid-19 pandemic.”On April 7, the high court had put a stay on the operation and effect of the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2018 and a December 2019 resolution by the MC through which it had purchased motorised vehicles for garbage collection.The 390 vehicles were bought at a cost of over ₹30 crore in the wake of directions by the National Green Tribunal to streamline solid waste management.The first phase of garbage collection through MC vehicles was started in December last year in Sectors 1 to 30. In April, most of the city was brought under the MC drive. It was contended in court that the bylaws and the resolution were contrary to the letter and spirit of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, issued by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which contemplated the need to empower the garbage collectors and help ensure their employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-approach-hc-to-review-stay-on-twin-bin-garbage-collection-101618000877649.html

Earlier, addressing a gathering at the gurdwara, Sidhana said he was not scared of being arrested and the farmers’ agitation was a battle of survival for Punjab. “The farmers are united and thousands of youths are marching to Delhi again. It is important how we win the struggle,” he said. “We will block the KMP (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal) Expressway in Delhi on Saturday and a protest march will be taken out to Parliament next month. We will follow the instructions of farmer unions. The Delhi Police have even arrested my cousin Gurdeep Singh and his friend Gurpreet from Patiala yesterday,” added Sidhana while addressing the gathering from a truck.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders Surjit Singh Phool, Manjit Singh Rai and Baldev Singh Sirsa besides Sikh preacher Harjinder Singh Majhi were also present at the gurdwara.The procession was organised by Sidhana’s youth supporters after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha allowed him to address the protesting farmers from the stage at Singhu recently. On Sidhana’s address at the rally, Sangrur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vivek Sheel Soni said, “We are looking into the matter.”Skips address at Shambu border The gangster-turned-activist skipped his scheduled address to the protesting farmers at Shambu barrier on the Punjab-Haryana border. Navdeep Singh, a youth farmer leader, said the decision to skip the address was taken due to security reasons.The farmer leaders who addressed the gathering from a truck slammed the Delhi Police for framing Sidhana by invoking “false charges”. No office-bearer of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) was seen in the procession.

10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement: Punjab arhtiyas call strike from today over DBT row||A day after the Punjab government agreed to implement the Centre’s direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for farmers, arhtiyas (commission agents) announced to go on strike in the state from Saturday and stop the mandi operations to press for an immediate rollback of the move. Wheat procurement in Punjab starts on Saturday. Punjab Arhtiya Association president Vijay Kalra said the decision was taken after a meeting with chief minister Amarinder Singh even as he assured them that his government was making efforts to find a way out to accommodate them while implementing the DBT scheme. The CM also asked the officials to make sure that arhtiyas were not ignored while implementing the new system. His assurance, however, failed to satisfy the arhtiyas who are apprehensive that DBT will end their role in the procurement process. “The state government has asked us to wait till some solution is found. But are going to shut our operations from tomorrow,” Kalra said. Punjab has nearly 33,000 arhtiyas who deal with 10.93 lakh farmers. They also provide logistical support by cleaning, weighing, packing and loading grain in vehicles in lieu of ‘incidental’. The arhtiyas were paid 2% of the minimum support price (MSP) as commission. Now, the Centre has proposed to give them fixed ₹48 per quintal for running the mandi operations but the commission agents are up in arms against it. The state has set a target to procure 130 lakh tonne wheat this season. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who also along with his cabinet colleagues attended the meeting with Union minister Piyush Goyal, said his department will make efforts to start the procurement from Saturday itself. “We are also working on a mechanism to bring changes in the public finance management system (PFMS) so that money goes directly into farmers’ accounts but the arhtiyas will have a say in clearing the payment,” he added. CM Amarinder is expected to make a formal announcement about the changes in a day or two. So far, payments for procurement of foodgrains for the public distribution system (PDS) were made to the farmers through arhtiyas. Though the Centre has been pushing for direct payment to farmers for several years, the state government has been opposed to DBT, saying arhtiyas are integral to the procurement system. A five-member team of the Punjab government led by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal met Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday to seek more time to implement the new system, but the latter refused to budge. Punjab procures wheat and rice at MSP on behalf of the central government under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Currently, MSP to farmers in Punjab is paid through arthiyas unlike directly to farmers’ bank accounts in other states. A senior mandi board official said, “Procurement will take place whether arhtiyas go on strike or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-punjab-arhtiyas-call-strike-from-today-over-dbt-row-101618000761698.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Freehold commercial properties may soon become reality in Chandigarh||Paving the way to allow leasehold-to-freehold conversion of commercial and industrial properties, the UT administration has decided to seek approval from the central government for a policy in this regard. Nearly 70% commercial and industrial plots in the city are leasehold, allowing occupation for a limited period, mostly 99 years. Ownership rights in this case are with the government agencies like the UT Estate Office, municipal corporation and Chandigarh Housing Board. On the other hand, freehold status gives the owner complete rights of the property.More than 5,000 lessees stand to get ownership rights if the administration’s decision is approved by the central government. A policy for residential properties is already in place in the city since the conversion rates were fixed in 2017. Confirming UT’s decision, adviser Manoj Parida said, “We will be seeking in-principle approval of the Union ministry of home affairs for allowing leasehold-to- freehold conversion of commercial properties. Once the approval is granted, we will be formulating a policy detailing the rates of conversion and other conditions.” The UT administrator’s approval is awaited before the proposal letter is sent to the ministry. Long-standing demand The city’s business and industrial community has been for long demanding the right to own properties to facilitate expansion and loans. The Chandigarh Industrial Policy has also promised allowing conversion of industrial plots from leasehold to freehold to promote ease of doing business in the city. The demand had recently got fresh impetus with the Administration’s Advisory Council favouring the conversion of leasehold properties, an idea repeatedly supported by MP Kirron Kher. Earlier in February, the council’s Standing Committee on Urban Infrastructure had also favoured the proposal. “The demand for a conversion policy has also found strong support in the municipal corporation, where the General House has already passed a resolution demanding a policy for its properties. Similar demands have been made by the UT Estate Office and CHB,” said a UT official, privy to development. Stagnating realty marketIn the absence of the conversion policy, MC, UT and CHB have been losing out on revenue, as there are few takers for leasehold properties.For instance, in 2019, CHB and the Estate Office failed to auction even a single leasehold property. While the freehold plots generated sizable revenue through auction, commercial properties on lease didn’t attract any bidder. Similarly, MC has failed to sell any of its properties despite multiple auctions. “Chandigarh trails behind Mohali and Panchkula on this account. While the satellite towns have freehold properties aplenty, a lot of properties in Chandigarh are stuck due to leasehold status. Lack of ownership rights has also created artificial stagnation in the market and impinged on business growth in the city,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/freehold-commercial-properties-may-soon-become-reality-in-chandigarh-101618000397389.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||After Covid-19 surge, all schools in Delhi closed||In the wake of a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced the closure of all schools and colleges in the city, suspending all in-person academic activities until further orders.It was, however, not immediately clear if the order will affect the CBSE board examinations for Class 10 and 12 students that are scheduled to be held next month. While the board’s controller of examinations could not be reached for comment, a senior CBSE official who asked not to be named said it was too early to comment on any potential changes to the examination schedule. “We have said before that schools must comply with state guidelines and Covid-19 protocols. If the Delhi government has asked for the closure of schools, the orders should be followed. The decision on practicals and other matters [including board exams] can be taken later.”The central board has so far maintained that it will not conduct exams online. On Thursday, it announced that it will increase the number of examination centres by 2,500 this year to ensure social distancing and other Covid-protocol during the board exams.“Due to increasing Covid cases, all schools (including government and private) in Delhi are being closed for all classes till further orders,” Kejriwal tweeted on Friday when the Capital recorded its second highest ever single-day increase in cases at 8,521. The government order came after a Covid-19 review meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).In a directive issued on Friday evening, director of education Udit Prakash Rai said, “In view of the sudden surge in the cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, all the heads of government, government-aided and unaided recognised schools are hereby informed that conduct of all academic and examination activities through physical mode shall remain suspended with immediate effect till further orders.”“They are further directed to ensure that no student of classes 9 to 12 is called to school in person for any kind of academic or examination activity like practice of practicals, mid-term and annual examination related work i.e., practical, project submission, assessments, etc. till further orders,” the order read.On April 1, the Delhi government announced that all academic activities for the new academic session beginning in April will continue online across classes in private and public schools. However, students of classes 9 and 11 of the previous academic session (2020-21) were allowed to visit schools for their internal exams, and students of the outgoing classes 10 and 12 could visit schools for board practicals and pre-board exams.Awadesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said, “This was a necessary step. We had parents requesting us to cancel or postpone internal exams, fearing for the safety of their children amid rising Covid-19 cases. Though school authorities are able to enforce Covid protocols inside the premises, overcrowding outside schools could have put children at risk.”Most of Delhi’s 2,168 schools are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which had announced last year that it will conduct practical exams from March till the last theory paper in June. Theory exams for both Class 10 and 12 students are slated to begin in May. While private schools are mostly done with their Class 9 and 11 internal exams, government schools were currently busy in finishing the mid-terms of these classes with the finals scheduled in May.Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of Government Girls Senior Secondary School in New Kondli, said schools will now have to wait for clarity on promotion and assessment for Class 9 and 11 students. “Of the 17 subjects in Class 12 which had a practical component, we have conducted exams for only a handful as we were waiting for our mid-terms of classes 9 and 11 to get over by mid-April. Since we had time, we were planning to conduct the rest of the practicals after that. Now with cases rising again, we don’t know what to do and have to wait for further instructions.”While Minj suggested that CBSE might consider forming a revised assessment policy like last year for the board students as they had little practice for the practical exams, Jha said even an extension could work.“CBSE has said that they can conduct practical exam till the end of theory papers which will be around mid-June. If they could extend the dates further till the end of June, we could conduct the remaining practical tests in around two weeks,” said Jha.Private schools also endorsed the government’s decision, especially after reports of some students testing positive for Covid-19 after attending offline classes. Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said, “We have conducted all practicals except one. It will be disturbing for students who have not appeared for the practicals, so schools have to counsel them and tell them that their safety is of prime importance. The current strain is affecting youngsters, so we have to take all precautions. As far as holding theory exams are concerned, it is almost a month away and it is early to comment on them.”A senior education department official said the Directorate of Education will take a decision on the suspended academic activities when the schools reopen. “Exams and syllabus become trivial issues when compared to health and safety of children. As of now, all offline academic activities stand postponed and we will make the decision on how to proceed later when the Covid-19 situation is better.”Twisha Kacker, a Class 12 student at The Indian School, said her three practicals are pending due to the closure of schools. “While some of my friends are happy to get some time to prepare for the practicals, many just want to get it over with. I personally wanted to focus on my theory papers after finishing practicals which help us score more,” she said.Parents welcomed the government’s order which comes a day after Delhi Parents’ Association writing to the government demanding closure of schools. “Though some practicals are pending, we believe authorities can figure out alternate ways to conduct practicals or viva using smartphones or through voice calls with students of both government and private schools,” said association president Aprajita Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-covid-19-surge-all-schools-in-delhi-closed-101617999921152.html

10-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha Class 12 students worried about competitive exams||Along with the confusion over the status and mode of board exams, Class 12 students are also worried about the status of all-India competitive exams. While the National Testing Agency (NTA) has already announced that the third session of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains will take place in the last week of April, there is no clarity if the exam will be delayed in Maharashtra owing to lockdown restrictions implemented until the end of April in several states. “Neither the state nor NTA is providing any clarity. Students and parents are more anxious than ever. Many Class 12 students are preparing for JEE Mains or the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and at the same time also preparing for their Class 12 exam,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist. The state education department is still deciding on the board exams scheduled in April in the offline mode. “We’ve heard of numerous cases from other states where students and staff in schools and colleges have contracted the virus during offline exams. This is worrying,” said Anuradha Singh, mother of a Class 12 student. Recently, NTA extended dates for registrations for the April JEE Mains session, but as yet, there has been no clarity on whether exams will be conducted as per schedule. “We are in talks with several officials across various states to determine the on-ground situation and accordingly a decision will be taken soon,” said an official from NTA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-class-12-students-worried-about-competitive-exams-101617999497595.html
10-04-2021||Other||2 yrs on, 80-yr-old mother of Vir Chakra awardee awaits relief from GMADA||Two years on, Surjit Kaur, an 80-year-old mother of a Vir Chakra awardee, is yet to get compensation of ₹60,000 along with 12% interest on principal amount from the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). The relief was awarded by the Punjab state consumer disputes redressal commission in 2019 in a case pertaining to a flat in Purab Apartments in Sector 88. Bedi, in her complaint to the prime minister, had stated that GMADA officials did not obey the judgment and kept her in the dark by stating they will appeal to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi. However, no case has been registered by the GMADA in Delhi in the past two years, she said. It is pertinent to mention here that Bedi was allotted a flat in Purab Apartments under the reserved category of gallantry award winners after a draw and was issued letter of intent (LOI) in May 2012. GMADA promised possession in May 2015, failing which she had the right to withdraw from the scheme after sending an application to the estate officer. Despite being paid ₹63.3 lakh, GMADA failed to deliver the apartment to Bedi, following which she moved the Punjab consumer disputes redressal commission. The commission in its order on February 4, 2019, had awarded ₹60,000 as compensation for not getting delivery of a GMADA apartment. The commission had ordered to repay the 10% deducted from the apartment cost (as part of the builder-buyer agreement) by GMADA with 8% interest compounded annually over the refunded amount of ₹55.7 lakh. The commissioner further observed, “Since GMADA has not delivered the possession to the complaint within three years under clause 3 (ii) of the LOI, hence they are deficient in service, thereby entitling the complainant to seek the refund of the amount. Bedi has already been refunded ₹55,7 lakh by GMADA out of the ₹63.3 lakh she paid, but the 10% deduction was unjustified, unauthorised and uncalled for.” Bedi said that she had again approached the state consumer court by filing execution of not obeying the judgment of February 2019 by GMADA in January this year. She said even the national consumer court executive had helped her by suggesting that there was no case registered by GMADA for an appeal to their commission. She said this was a sheer case of delay and harassment of a senior citizen and a mother of a braveheart who laid his life and gave the supreme sacrifice for the nation. Bedi’s son second Lt Amardeep Singh Bedi was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously on January 26, 1990, for exemplary action in confining militants to a jungle strip on January 18. 1989, thwarting their escape and killing one. Unfortunately, he died after being injured in firing by another militant group. GMADA chief administrator Pradeep Aggarwal said, “I am not aware of the case, but will definitely look into it and get it resolved as per the norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-yrs-on-80-yr-old-mother-of-vir-chakra-awardee-awaits-relief-from-gmada-101617999497144.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||State defers MPSC exam||In view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government on Friday decided to postpone the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examination scheduled on April 11. The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The new dates will be declared soon, the officials said. Initially, the exam was scheduled in April 2020. There were demands from many sections of society, including students and parents, to defer the exams owing to the risk of getting infected with the virus. A few days ago Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray too made the demand. “In the backdrop of sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and considering safety and health of students and demands from various sections including students it has been decided to postpone the MPSC examinations,” chief minister said in the meeting attended by home minister Dilip Walse Patil, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, relief and minister rehabilitation Vijay Wadettiwar, leader of opposition in legislative Pravin Darekar, Raj Thackeray and senior officials. The new dates will be determined based on the situation in the state. The chief minister also assured students they won’t be affected with the age bar limit owing to the deferment of the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-defers-mpsc-exam-101617999377034.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha teachers worried about multiple RT-PCR tests||Teachers and non-teaching staff in schools and junior colleges across the state are worried about having to undergo the RT-PCR test for Covid-19 multiple times during the board exams that commence late this month. As per the Standard Operating Procedures issued for the conduct of board exams last month, the entire staff which is on duty for the conduct of board exams has to undergo a test to ascertain that they are not positive for Covid-19. The test report is valid only for 48 hours from the time it is released. The board exams will last for nearly a month. “We will need staff for conduct of board exams and this year the strength required will be more as there will be more classrooms and centres. Having to undergo the test repeatedly is stressful. Teachers and other staff will have to go to a government facility for the same and scheduling appointments will add to the already existing stress,” said the principal of a school in the city. Officials from the state education department did not respond to calls and messages. “We have to keep a lot of backup options in case a teacher is unable to do the test or the report is awaited. This means a lot more people will have to be assigned duties than usual,” said a teacher. While the HSC (Class 12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, SSC (Class 10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-teachers-worried-about-multiple-rt-pcr-tests-101617999376469.html

The district has 25,490 recoveries so far, while 469 people have died, including two on Friday.Noticing the surge in cases in Dhakoli and Mohali city, civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur has constituted teams for extensive sampling.“Eligible people are requested to come forward for vaccination, and those with even mild symptoms should get tested. The transmission rate of the UK variant of the virus is quite high and is spreading fast among youngsters,” she said, while emphasising the need for the younger population to exercise precautions like wearing masks, maintaining distance and keeping hands sanitised.Within nine days of April, the district has recorded 3,911 cases and 36 deaths, as compared to 6,315 cases and 48 deaths in March. UT’s active cases reach highest-ever numberIn Chandigarh, the cumulative cases reached 29,943, while the active cases, at 3,213, surpassed the previous high of 3,171 on September 1.

10-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha sees vaccine shortage, centres shut||Amid shortage of Covid vaccines, scores of vaccination centres were shut across Maharashtra on Friday, leading to panic among citizens. A day after the state-Centre spat over supply, the state got 459,310 more doses on Friday, which are expected to last for three more days. Considering the time required for the transportation of the new stock, many centres are expected to face the problem on Saturday. Friday’s stock has brought the total number of doses received by the state to 11.08 million. The state vaccinated 267,687 beneficiaries till 7pm on Friday, against the daily average of 350,000-400,000, taking the number of inoculated beneficiaries to 8,698,426 with 9,628,138 doses. Considering the wastage, the state has about 1,150,000 doses left for vaccination, said state health officials. The state had inoculated 479,215 citizens on April 5, which dropped to 354,101 on April 8 and 267,687 on April 9. The number of centres was 4,938 on Friday, against 3,647 on Thursday. “Many centres operated for the first few hours till the stock lasted. The stock received from the Centre is being transported to the respective districts and may take a day. This will result in shortage at some centres even on Saturday and Sunday,” said an official from the health department. The official said the state was expecting 1.56million more doses to be delivered in the next few days. “Considering the state’s wastage rate, which is around 3%, around 300,000 doses have been wasted, leaving around 1,150,000 doses available for vaccination. We fear that even with the promised stock by the Centre, we would not be able to maintain our targeted pace of inoculating more than 400,000 people a day. After vaccinating more than 400,000 beneficiaries early this week, our rate has dropped owing to the shortage,” said the official. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the promised stock of the jab was not sufficient. “We are targeting vaccination of more than 600,000 beneficiaries a day, for which a supply of 4 million doses a week is necessary.” In Beed, a centre at a rural hospital in Ambejogai was shut down after inoculating 100 beneficiaries. Centres in Panvel in Navi Mumbai ran out of stock resulting in closure of centres after inoculating 4,000 beneficiaries against the daily average of more than 8,000 people. The number of beneficiaries in Chandrapur fell to 567 (till 7pm) on Friday, against 5,117 on Thursday and 8,467 a day before. In Sangli, only 716 beneficiaries were inoculated (till 7pm), against 4,495 on Thursday and 12,422 on Wednesday. In Satara, 2,160 people were inoculated against its daily capacity of more than 22,000. In Thane, 22,973 were inoculated till 7pm against the inoculation of 28, 593 on Thursday and 32,829 a day before. Maharashtra has targeted inoculating 33.8mn people above 45 years. Besides vaccines, Maharashtra also faced acute shortage of anti-viral drug Remdesivir and the oxygen while treating Covid-19 patients. Food and drugs administration minister Rajendra Shingne announced the state would procure oxygen from other neighbouring states and banned the use of oxygen for industrial purposes. “Our consumption of oxygen for Covid-19 patients on Thursday was 923metric tonnes against the production of 1,287 tonnes. The demand for patients is expected to go up as the number of the positive patients is expected to go up in the next few days. It is clear that our domestic production would not be sufficient for the demand and hence we have decided to procure it from states like Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. We have also increased the reservation of the production to 100% for medical use by banning industrial use for a few days,” he said. Shingne said the supply of Remdesivir is expected to increase to 75,000 vials from the existing supply of 55,000 vials in the next few days. He said they have also directed production companies to tap the possibility of stalling the export of Remdesivir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-sees-vaccine-shortage-centres-shut-101617999316472.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Online exams for SSC, HSC not feasible||Class 10 and 12 board exams in the state cannot be conducted online this year as per the feedback given by various experts to the state government in the last few days. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad released a short video message on Friday evening urging students appearing for their boards not to worry. “Students in the state should just focus on studies and not worry. Their health is our topmost priority,” said Gaikwad, adding that she had spoken to representatives of companies like Google India and Tata Consultancy Services in the past few days regarding the conduct of board exams in the state. Officials in the education department said these companies had mentioned that with the magnitude of the board exams, in which nearly 33 lakh students appear every year, readying digital infrastructure can take upto two years. “They were of the opinion that this cannot be done overnight, especially this year at such a short notice. It is a known fact that in Maharashtra, considering the state’s topography and challenges with online learning in rural parts, it is not feasible to conduct exams as crucial as the boards online. Hence that option is nearly ruled out,” said an official present at the meeting. Gaikwad said that a detailed announcement regarding the board exams will be made soon in consultation with the chief minister and deputy chief minister. While numerous consultations have been held regarding the conduct of board exams in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the government is likely to push exams further. A final decision in this regard is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/online-exams-for-ssc-hsc-not-feasible-101617999317093.html
10-04-2021||Other||CBI records statements of suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze, bar owner||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday recorded the statements of a bar owner and suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze as part of its probe into the allegations of corruption raised by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. A team of the central agency, which is in Mumbai to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the allegations as directed by the Bombay high court (HC), visited the office of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday to record Vaze’s statement the third day in a row, following which Vaze was sent to judicial custody by the special NIA court. Vaze was in custody of the NIA in connection with his alleged role in planting explosives in an SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February. He is also accused of allegedly murdering Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the SUV. On Friday, a CBI team questioned the owner of a bar in Kandivali, who was also questioned by the NIA. “The owner of a bar and restaurant in Kandivali area was questioned twice by the NIA and his detailed statements were recorded when the agency learnt that he was allegedly collecting monthly collection (money) from other restaurant owners on behalf of a former police officer,” a senior NIA official said on condition of anonymity. “[The bar owner’s] statement was recorded to corroborate the allegation made by Singh,” a CBI official said, refusing to elaborate. The CBI had recorded Param Bir Singh’s statement on April 8, a day after Vaze attempted to submit a letter to the special court in which he stated that Deshmukh and state transport minister Anil Parab had asked him to extort money from businessmen and establishments. On March 20, three days after he was transferred to take charge of the Maharashtra Home Guard, Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other top officials alleging that Deshmukh ran an extortion racket, and had set targets of ₹100 crore to some policemen, including Vaze to collect this money from establishments like restaurants, bars and hookah bars. Deshmukh, who rejected the allegations, resigned from the cabinet on April 5 after the HC order. In an official report submitted on Wednesday, newly appointed Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said all critical decisions related to arrests and raids were taken under Vaze’s directions, who reported directly to Singh. Assistant police inspectors do not usually report directly to the chiefs. The CBI has also recorded the statements of deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil, and Dr Jaishri Patil whose Public Interest Litigation led to the HC order directing a probe by the CBI. A team of 10 officers – including a superintendent of police – is conducting the probe and will submit a report within 15 days. “We have recorded statements of other bar and restaurant owners and all documents related to investigation were handed over to the CBI which will help in their investigation,” the NIA official quoted above said. “Apart from the Kandivli bar owner, we will record statement of other bar owners to verify the facts,” a CBI official said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-records-statements-of-suspended-mumbai-policeman-sachin-vaze-bar-owner-101617999256433.html

The agency did not seek his further custody and said that he may be remanded to judicial custody.Vaze’s lawyers pleaded the court that Vaze be lodged in a secure cell in prison as they apprehend threat to his life. The court noted the request.During the hearing, NIA brought to the notice of the court about Vaze’s letter getting leaked. The agency claimed that the letter was written while Vaze was in their custody. On Wednesday, when he was produced before the court, he was allowed to meet his lawyers for five minutes and the time was misused.The court reprimanded the defence lawyers saying they were asked to follow proper procedure, but they did not. The court warned them to not repeat it in the future.Vaze was arrested on March 13. He has been booked under various charges of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Under the Act, the agency can seek custody of the accused up to 30 days, which otherwise is restricted up to 14 days only. Since his arrest, Vaze had been in NIA custody.Vaze has also been named an accused in the murder case of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran. The 48-year-old auto spare parts trader is suspected to be murdered on March 4, the day he went missing. His body had washed ashore at a creek at Mumbra the next day.The murder is also being probed by NIA as the same being linked to the Antillia case. The Scorpio found parked outside Antilia on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin was the one that Hiran had been driving for three years and was reported stolen on February 18.Meanwhile, the special court has allowed the plea of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), seeking records from NIA about their investigation into the case. CBI is probing the allegations against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh by ex-Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.During the Antilia probe, Singh was transferred to a low-key post in the home guard department. Subsequently, he made several allegations in a letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 against Deshmukh.The Bombay high court (HC), which was hearing of multiple public interest litigations and a writ petition seeking a CBI probe into the accusations, had directed the central agency to conclude a preliminary inquiry in the case within 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-former-mumbai-police-officer-sachin-vaze-in-judicial-custody-till-april-23-101617999196494.html

The report was submitted by the team of defence lawyers for Dr Anand Teltumbde while arguing his bail recently. The court, after perusal of the report, observed that though the report is addressed to the special court, it has not reached the court. “It appears that it is the copy of the report addressed to the court in the present proceeding. On inquiry with the sheristedar [court officer], it is reported that the court has not received such a report. Record reveals that at no point of time, the agency, Arsenal Consulting, was called upon by this court to submit the report,” read the court’s noting of Friday. The court then asked that if the copy addressed to the court has not been received, how was it accessed by the defence lawyers. Teltumbde’s lawyers have been asked to clarify “how he got custody of the document, which has been purportedly addressed to the court.” Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty objected to the report which the defence relied upon while seeking bail for Teltumbde.

Raut had earlier denied the allegations. The PIL, based on information received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from various power generation and distribution companies, has alleged that during the lockdown, the Congress leader had used chartered flights on numerous occasions in the name of ‘administrative work’ and had made the power companies foot the bills . The PIL has claimed that as the money shelled out by the companies is public money, the minister should be directed to reimburse the said amounts, as he used the chartered flights for his personal use. The PIL filed by social activist and lawyer Vishwas Pathak was mentioned on Friday before the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni. Pathak, who is also the media head of the Bharatiya Janata Party, sought an urgent hearing of the petition as it involved loss of public money. He claimed that during the lockdown, when the country’s highest officials were performing their duties from remote and virtual setups, Raut “flouted existing norms on multiple occasions and took the liberty to travel around the country during the lockdown period for his personal reasons under the pretext of administrative work.” Pathak has alleged that the bills were paid by state-owned companies that are publicly funded and are discharging public duties and public welfare schemes. The petition has alleged that companies – Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (Magagenco), Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (Mahatransco) and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) – under pressure from Raut had to pay for the flights. In light of these submissions, the PIL has sought directions to the minister to reimburse the companies as well as to a couple of companies to furnish information of the flight bills paid by them which they had refused to share through the RTI queries. After hearing the petition, the bench said that due to the Covid-19 situation, it was hearing only urgent matters till April 30 and hence would hear the petition only after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-maharashtra-minister-should-foot-42-l-bill-for-chartered-flights-used-by-him-101617998896270.html

CBI conducted searches at the accused’s residences in Mumbai and Delhi and recovered ₹7 lakh and some incriminating documents related to investment in commercial and residential properties from one of the accused. The accused have been identified as Dilip Kumar and Ashish Kumar, while another official, who is also booked in the case, is being investigated by CBI. According to CBI, the complainant works as general manager in a logistics company in Mumbai and has alleged that the accused had demanded ₹15 lakh for helping him in a case in which the I-T department is probing him. The complainant did not want to pay the bribe, so he approached CBI last month. The agency verified the facts from independent witnesses and recorded the conversation of the accused, when they had demanded money from the complainant. The officials then laid a trap in Goregaon (East), when Dilip Kumar arrived to accept the bribe. He was nabbed while accepting ₹10 lakh. “Later, when they laid a trap to nab Ashish Kumar, he suspected something amiss and fled after throwing the bribe amount of ₹5 lakh, said a CBI official. However, the officials chased him for around 200m towards the fire brigade office from Oberoi Mall and managed to nab him. The CBI court has sent the duo to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-i-t-inspectors-held-for-accepting-15-l-bribe-in-mumbai-101617998836326.html

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh for the families of each of the victims and said that the cost of treatment for the injured would be borne by the state. M Ramanujam, field director and conservator of forest, NNTR, claimed that the blaze had been started by unidentified persons in compartment numbers 97, 98, 99 and 100 of the Nagzira wildlife sanctuary and Pitezari forest reserve – estimated to be about 2,000 hectares in size – around 11:30am on Thursday. Officials said that some locals abet with poachers and start fires to reduce the density of the forest. “It took about 50-60 people to put out the fire by around 5pm. But the weather was stormy, and the wind picked up speed in the evening, because of which another fire broke out and spread even faster,” said Ramanujam. Nitin Kakodkar, state’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said, “This was an unfortunate accident. According to the information we received, a sudden change in wind direction changed the orientation of the fire, trapping five labourers who were helping to bring the blaze under control.” A huge portion of the lush green habitat is now a vast black terrain without any trace of plant or animal life after the fire. The exact area of damage is yet to be ascertained. The forest labourers who died in the mishap have been identified as Rekchand Rane, 45; Sachin Ashok Srirange, 22; and Rakesh Madavi, 24. They had been hired by the forest department as fire-watchers for the summer season. The two injured forest labourers – Vijay Maraskolhe, 40, and Raju Sayam, 30, are undergoing treatment for severe burns at Orange City Hospital in Nagpur. They hail from Thadezari, Kosamtondi and Dhanori villages in Gondia district. After the fire, villagers from Thadezari – where the labourers hailed from – assaulted a forest official, leading to a violent confrontation between forest guards and residents. The superintendent of police and other personnel rushed to the spot after the violence, reports stated. “We were not able to assess the damage because we were busy responding to the law and order situation. One of our forest guards was manhandled by the community, who has been protesting. We have assured the families of the victims that they will receive an additional ₹5 lakh from the forest department,” said Ramanujan. Nagzhira is the home to several species of wildlife, including tiger, leopard, Indian gaur, wild boar, sloth bear, barking deer and wild dogs. Kakodkar said a similar incident had been reported from adjacent Bhandara district a day earlier, when a labourer employed with the Forest Development Corporation was left in a critical state while fighting a wildfire. A veteran Indian Forest Services officer, who has occupied senior positions at the Forest Research Institute and in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), said, “Forest fires have been raging in other parts of India too, but we haven’t heard of any casualties from Uttarakhand or Odisha where the fires are more intense. The authorities need to reveal what went wrong here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-killed-2-critically-hurt-in-fire-at-maharashtra-s-tiger-reserve-101617998536203.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||2015 post-sacrilege violence: HC quashes SIT probe reports, asks Punjab to form new team||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday quashed the probe reports submitted by Punjab Police in two FIRs registered in connection with 2015 Kotkapura violence. The high court bench of justice Rajbir Sehrawat also asked Punjab government to constitute a fresh special investigation team (SIT) excluding IPS officer of the rank of IGP, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Multiple lawyers associated with the case confirmed the development, including senior advocate RS Cheema. However, detailed order is yet to be released. Former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, former IGP PS Umaranangal and former SSP Charanjit Sharma were among the seven accused against whom challan was filed by the SIT in a 2018 FIR. Lawyers said since the same SIT had probed FIRs in Behbal Kalan cases too, this order may have a bearing there as well. Two people had lost their lives in the violence reported after incidents of sacrilege in 2015. Three FIRs on incidents of sacrilege were recommended for CBI probe in 2015 by the then SAD government in Punjab, out of which, the state passed a resolution to withdraw two FIRs in August 2018 during Congress government. In the same resolution, it also withdrew two more FIRs related to violence, entrusted to CBI barely four days before the move. There are a total of four FIRs registered to probe the incidents of violence. The high court order came on the 2019 plea of Gurdeep Singh Pandher, a former sub-inspector with Punjab Police and then Kotkapura SHO, being probed in these FIRs, who had approached the high court levelling allegations against IGP Singh and sought his ouster from the SIT. The second petition was of head constable (retd) Rashpal Singh, who suffered injuries in the clashes. The petitions demanded transfer of probe to CBI or speed up the probe into the initial FIR of 2015 on Kotkapura violence registered on the complaint of policemen. The SIT had taken over probe in this FIR too and named some cops as accused. The probe report has been quashed in this case too, Cheema added. The plea had argued that challan filed in the 2018 FIR revealed that it has been filed by IGP Singh alone without the assent of four other SIT members. The injured policemen have been left as mute spectators in the political fight between the two regimes and the SIT is hell-bent to implicate the senior police officials by conducting investigation in a biased manner and also by suppressing real facts from the court, the plea had alleged, further arguing that August 7, 2018, FIR was registered for the same incident where an FIR stood registered in October 2015. The high court at one point had asked government whether it can reconsider its decision of replacing IGP Singh. However, the government, as well as the DGP, had categorically told the court that it may not be in the interest of the integrity of the investigation to change the constitution of the SIT at this stage or to remove the IGP from the SIT. The probe is being supervised by head of Bureau of Investigations (BoI), the government had contended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-post-sacrilege-violence-hc-quashes-sit-probe-reports-asks-punjab-to-form-new-team-101617997996973.html

The chief secretary was directed to comply with the directions and file compliance affidavit within a period of two weeks. The court had also directed Shri Bhoop Ram, who had cut the trees, to deposit a sum of ₹34.6 lakh (the value ascertained by the forest officials of the felled trees).The court further observed that it is apparent from the affidavits of the chief secretary and DSP (City), Shimla, that charges were framed only against three officials — one beat guard and two block officers (one of whom has retired) — and FIR(s) have also only been registered against the three officials and Bhoop Ram.The court observed that the respondents have not complied with the directions passed by this court in letter and spirit and what action has been taken by the respondents is just an eye wash, as no liability has been fixed on the officials who are higher in rank.The court directed the principal chief conservator to file an affidavit indicating on what basis, the officials, who are in lower rank, were held responsible in allowing felling of trees.The court also directed the additional advocate general to file an affidavit, indicating therein status of the FIR(s), investigating report and status of the trees/saplings, which were planted where illicit felling took place.

Addressing third and fourth convocation of Indian Institute of Management (IIM) at Jammu, he underlined India’s commitment to the overall development and addressing all the challenges. He called upon national institutes such as IIMs to offer innovative courses and diplomas based on new market realities. He also emphasised on the need of reorienting higher education in tune with the realities of the world. To this extent, he called for bringing diverse fields like agriculture, business, technology, humanities and management together. “This is the spirit of the multidisciplinary push of the new education policy. We cannot solve the problems of future with the same superficial and segregated approach of the past,” he said. Naidu told the students that as future managers, they have to respond to a world that is changing rapidly. “Your ability to make decisions in an uncertain world and your agility to adapt to new contexts will become very crucial,” he added. He advised the institutions of higher education to “adapt, evolve and respond” to situations that have never before been faced by mankind. Calling upon the aspiring entrepreneurs, managers and consultants to identify innovations at the grassroots and use their expertise to achieve scale for indigenous solutions, he urged them to bring in technology to complement the traditional skills of craftsmen and increase farm productivity to help farmers. Naidu also urged the management students to work with farmers to improve the marketing of farm produce. “E-NAM is a great tool for better price realisation. This should be further scaled up and new innovations be brought into post-harvest facilities,” he said. Terming skill development and quality education crucial development accelerators, he stressed the need for enhancing access and quality of education. Naidu said that industry-institute linkages should be further strengthened. Our industry will also greatly benefit from the fresh perspectives young minds can offer, he added. Noting that pandemic has shown the necessity and potential of technology in delivering education, the vice-president called for more extensive and prudent use of technological tools. However, in this process, the existing digital divide should not widen, he cautioned. “The most remote areas and most underprivileged students should be enabled to benefit from this technological revolution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-will-continue-to-be-an-integral-part-of-india-vice-president-naidu-101617997696623.html

Of 16 lakh tonnes of legacy waste that sits on 45 acres, around 5 lakh tonnes will be disposed of in the first phase, which will approximately cost ₹28 crore. The technical committee has also approved a financial bid for appointing a contractor for construction and demolition of waste in the Dhandari area. The project has been hanging fire.Apart from legacy waste that has been piling up for years, over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is added to the dump on a daily basis. The MC’s troubles have been exacerbated by the fact that the refuse derived fuel (RDF) plant and compost plant on the site have not been used since the solid waste management contract, handled by A2Z company, was terminated on February 4.Residents’ health affected With the temperature rising, highly combustible methane gas that is emitted by the decomposing waste catches fire, which is causing respiratory issues among residents of Mahavir Colony, Kakka village, Sandhu Colony and other areas around and downwind of the site. The MC has also repeatedly got the stick from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for its failure in dealing with legacy waste. MC commissioner-cum-chief executive officer, LSCL, Pardeep Sabharwal said,”The project to dispose of legacy waste is being taken up under smart city mission on the directions of mayor Balkar Sandhu. In the first phase, the MC will appoint a contractor for dealing with 5 lakh tonnes of legacy waste.”Nod to proposals for development of sports infraThe technical committee has also approved multiple proposals for renovation of the hockey ground at Punjab Agricultural University, development of a basketball court at the Guru Nanak Stadium, and badminton courts in Shastri Hall among other projects.

Chadha and his son, Inderpreet Singh, who later committed suicide, were booked for sexual harassment and criminal intimidation on the complaint of the woman principal on December 28 in 2017. Later, the cops who investigated the case, asked court to scrap the FIR stating “he (Chadha) cannot be held guilty in the case”.Chadha approached the Akal Takht on several occasions pleading to lift the ban, but to no avail. His fresh plea was taken up at a meeting of the Sikh clergy headed by Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on March 31 and it was decided to lift the ban. A letter from the Akal Takht office on April 1 intimated Chadha that the ban on him has been lifted. In 2018, the Sikh clergy headed by Giani Gurbachan Singh stated that “after two years, Chadha will send a written request to the Akal Takht for religious atonement.” But the Takht took one more year to lift the ban.“I thank the jathedar for considering my plea.

After a farmer lands in mandi, it is the arhtiyas who provide labour for cleaning, packing and loading wheat. Their respective offices maintain all procurement records related to farmers and if these agents stayed away, there is absolutely no other way,” said an official engaged in purchase.State authorities have deputed officials for procurement duties and all arrangements, including sanitisation, drinking water, hand sanitisers and Covid-19 vaccination at the mandis.Officials said the situation may go out of hand if farmers arrive in grain markets and there is no work.“Malwa belt districts, particularly Mansa, Bathinda and Sangrur, have a common practice where the farmer unions gather in a large numbers even at the slightest incident. The police administration is needed to be on alert for smooth working in mandis across the state,” said another official.Bathinda mandi officer Preet Kanwar Singh Brar said there is hardly any demand for purchase on day one. “We will issue coupons on the basis of demand by farmers. Harvesting will pick up pace in the next week,” he said.Ranjnish Goel, head of Mansa district, said coupons have been issued to arhtiyas on Thursday and the department expects a smooth procurement season.1,830 coupons issued in PatialaPATIALA: All preparations are in place for wheat procurement in Patiala. To avoid rush of farmers at the purchasing centres in wake of Covid-19, the administration has issued 1,830 coupons and set up 352 additional purchasing centres to ensure that precautions and protocol related to Covid-19 are followed. Only farmers with hologram coupons will be allowed to enter the purchasing centres to ensure hassle-free operations.

10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana car trader duped of ₹8 lakh by friend, 3 others||Four people were booked on Friday for duping a city-based car trader of ₹8 lakh on the pretext of buying used cars from the Russian Embassy in New Delhi. The accused are Avinash Bhatti of Issa Nagri, Ankush Kumar Malik of Dugri, Abhishek of Sahibjada Ajit singh Nagar and Rinku Bawa of Ludhiana. The complainant, Sukhwinder Singh, 45, of Bajra village, who deals in old cars said Malik, a broker, who had earlier helped him sell two cars, had told him about three cars of the Russian Embassy that were in good condition and were available for sale. Malik took him to the embassy where they were joined by Bhatti, Abhishek and Bawa. He was shown three cars — a Toyota Innova and two sedans.He paid ₹8 lakh for the cars but the vehicles were not delivered to him. Upon realising that he had been duped, he lodged a police complaint on July 21, 2020. After eight-and-a-half months of investigation, a case was registered. Sub-inspector Pooran Singh said the cars parked outside the embassy had no link with the embassy officials. A case had been registered under Sections 406 (breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sahnewal police station. 70-yr-old farmer assaulted, robbed of car in Raikot Three unidentified men have been booked for assaulting a 70-year-old man and stealing his car in Raikot on Thursday evening. The complainant, Gurdeep Singh, 70, of Burj Hari Singh Nalwa village of Raikot, a farmer, said the incident took place when he had gone to attend a workshop on making gates and grills on Barnala Road. He parked his car in front of a congregation centre and started walking towards the workshop when three men accosted him and demanded the keys of his car. When he resisted, the accused assaulted him, took his keys and drove off in his Maruti Suzuki Swift. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Balbir Singh, who is investigating the case, said as per the victim, the accused were 25 to 30 years old and had covered their faces with masks. He said the accused had been booked under Sections 379-B (snatching with hurt, wrongful restraint or fear of hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

10-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC warns of action against politicos getting jabs at home||“Leaders of Maharashtra are not a class apart and cannot get jabs at their homes,” the Bombay high court (HC) noted while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens and specially-abled persons. The court observed that while the President and Prime Minister had gone to a government vaccination centre to gets the jabs, Maharashtra leaders should also have gone to vaccination centres rather than getting jabs at home. The bench asked the government pleader to inform the concerned department of the court’s warning that if it came to know of political leaders getting jabs privately, it would initiate action accordingly. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a PIL filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, was informed that there were many senior citizens and specially-abled persons who were unable to go to vaccination centres set up by the government and local municipal authorities to get jabs. The PIL, hence, sought directions from the court to the Central and state governments and municipal authorities to have a policy for door-to-door vaccination for such persons. While citing the communication of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal that vaccination could not be provided in the HC medical centre for judges, lawyers and court staff as it did not have an operational intensive care unit (ICU), the bench sought to know how jabs were being provided to political leaders at their homes. “Are ICUs available in the homes of leaders,” HC asked. The bench then referred to reports wherein it was stated that a certain political leader had got vaccinated at home and remarked, “How is that important political leaders are getting Covid-19 jabs at home if there is no door-to-door policy? There has to be a uniform policy. What has happened has happened. If we find any report that any political leader is taking a jab at home, we will see to it.” The court then asked government pleader Poornima Kantharia to inform the concerned officials of the court warning. Citing the example of the leaders at the centre, the bench said, “If the President of India and the Prime Minister can get vaccinated at the centres, then why can’t the political leaders in Maharashtra go to centres too? They are not class apart. This sends out a wrong message.” Addressing the concerns of the petitioner regarding helpline numbers for senior citizens willing to visit vaccination centres, the court said, “There has to be something for the senior citizens along with a simplified online procedure for vaccination.” The court then directed the Central government to file a short affidavit on the vaccination protocols and whether a policy for door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens can be put in place. In the previous hearing the bench had noted, “We do not want senior citizens collapsing after taking the vaccine. There has to be an ambulance with ICU facilities. We are not interfering with government policies. What we are seeking is some improvement.” The court observed that it was cognisant of reports of shortage of vaccines, but said it was another concern which would be addressed at a relevant time and posted the next hearing on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-warns-of-action-against-politicos-getting-jabs-at-home-101617996375608.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 500,000-mark of Covid-19 cases, the quickest jump so far||The city crossed the 500,000-mark of Covid-19 cases on Friday, over 13 months after the first case was reported in March 20020. Of the 500,000 cases, around 100,000 were reported in the past two weeks (since March 29) — making it the quickest surge so far. The number of cases in Mumbai has gone up since the past one month owing to the intensified testing by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). However, the positivity rate in the city has come down in the past two days, as of Thursday.Mumbai crossed the 100,000-mark in July last year, 200,000-mark in September, 300,000-mark in January this year and 400,000-mark on March 29. According to data, the positivity rate in the city was around 18% on Thursday, which had touched 26% earlier this week after a sharp increase since February 10. It was between 4% to 7% in February and early March and went up to 15%-20% by March-end. On Friday, the city reported 9,202 cases and 35 deaths, taking the case tally to 501,182 and toll to 11,916. The recovery rate in the city stands at 79% with 400,173 recoveries on Friday. Mumbai’s case fatality rate is 2.37% and there are 88,503 active cases in the city.According to BMC officials, daily Covid cases in the city are stabilising between 8,000 and 10,000 and there is a possibility of a downward trend post April 20.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had earlier this week said, “If we look at the current scenario in the city of a second wave, the daily cases being reported in the city have almost stabilised between 8,000 and 11,000. If this trend continues, cases will start to go down post April 20, but only if citizens continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.”Chahal added, “ Covid-appropriate behaviour and taking the vaccine for those eligible are the two most important things citizens have to follow. We need to undertake Covid-19 vaccination on the lines of polio vaccination. And for this, we are trying to mobilise citizens. BMC is yet to get permission for door-to-door vaccination, and hence I have requested elected representatives from the city to mobilise citizens for Covid-19 vaccination.”Meanwhile, experts said the surge in the number of cases is not only due to increased testing or mutations in foreign countries but also due to local mutations and lax behaviour of citizens. Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of Microbiology at BYL Nair Hospital, said, “Covid-19 is undergoing mutation called as antigenic drift. It occurs very frequently, that is around six times a week. This mutation helps the virus spread rapidly, infecting many people in close families. Infections are mostly very mild in 85% to 90% people. Many are asked to remain in home quarantine.”He added, “However, the effect multiplies when they (Covid-positive patients) do not follow restrictions at home, move around freely because nobody monitors them. So, the virus infects all others in the family. This has also happened due to prolonged lockdown last year, citizens are bored and frustrated. The second wave is not due to UK, South Africa or Brazil strains; it is mainly due to our own Indian mutated strain which spreads fast but causes mild or asymptomatic infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-500-000-mark-of-covid-19-cases-the-quickest-jump-so-far-101617996255557.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Attack on CLU scam whistle blower: Court dismisses anticipatory bail plea||Asserting that anticipatory bail should not be granted in cases pertaining to heinous crimes, the court of additional district and sessions judge Dr Ajit Atri on Friday dismissed the bail plea of two persons charged with attacking RTI activist Kuldeep Singh Khaira in January 2018. The court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Baljinder Singh Kahlon and Sukhbir Singh alias Sony Randhawa who had been booked under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass), 295­A (injuring), 506, (criminal intimidation) and 120­B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, they have not been arrested so far. The court observed that while the FIR was lodged in January 2018, the applicants are at large and have evaded the process of the law. The court ruled that when the allegations were taken in their entirety, it was clear that all efforts were made to silence the complainant, who seems to be the torchbearer for highlighting the wrong acts of some builder. “It is not the case of the applicants that they are not connected with the said project, against which the complainant had moved the complaint. This kind of conduct to silence the person by giving him threats and beatings will make out that the accused have no respect for the law and they want to go as per their wishes.” What had happenedOn January 23, 2018, Kuldeep Singh Khaira had alleged that he had been attacked by three unidentified miscreants with covered faces while he was at his shop. It was alleged that he was attacked by the henchmen of RK Builders against whom he had filed a complaint with the vigilance department and the MC had recommended filing an FIR in the case. Khaira had alleged that the builder was constructing flats on agricultural land in Ishar Nagar illegally and had written to the chief vigilance officer a week prior to the incident. He also alleged involvement of MC officials in the case and was the whistleblower in the CLU scam.During the course of investigation, Khaira had submitted a supplementary statement in court saying Kahlon and Randhawa, owners of the flat constructed by RK builders, were his attackersand and had threatened him to not to proceed with the complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/attack-on-clu-scam-whistle-blower-court-dismisses-anticipatory-bail-plea-101617996136178.html
10-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid spike in Covid cases, fresh restrictions coming up in Haryana||Amid rising coronavirus cases, the Haryana government has decided to shut schools for students of Classes 1 to 8, anganwaris, and creches.The government, however, is yet to take a call on imposing night curfew. The state on Friday recorded 2,994 cases taking the tally of active cases to 18,142.“Formal orders regarding fresh restrictions will be issued in a day or two,” said an official.Meanwhile, state health minister Anil Vij said that a “vaccination festival”, as suggested by the Prime Minister, will be held in the state from April 11 to 14. In these four days, the health department expects to vaccinate 6-7 lakh people free of cost. Directions have been given to cancel holidays of doctors and staff of medical colleges.Vij said that vaccination will be done in all major villages, town colonies, settlements, worksites, public places, markets in state as promised by PM Modi. People will be made aware of the vaccination and coronavirus screening with the help of posters and banners at roads, bus stands, railway stations, hospitals, and other places.Vij added that there is sufficient amount of vaccine in state, yet we will demand more vaccine from the central government.He said that help of Panchayati Raj institutions, anganwadi centres, prominent people in villages and cities, NGOs, MLAs and other dignitaries will be taken for the vaccination festival.

10-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Housing societies start imposing curbs, prohibit home deliveries, visitors||With the surge in Covid-19 cases, housing societies have started imposing restrictions on residents like they did last year during the lockdown. Managing committees of housing societies have now put several restrictions such as not allowing home deliveries, prohibiting visitors, closing down amenities like gymnasium and games, and even fining people if found without masks or not following Covid-19 protocols.“We have started imposing restrictions like last year. We have started restricting outside vendors to the lobby level. Many have also stopped visitors,” said Dhaval Shah, chairman of Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Citizens Association. He, however, said there has been a lot of resistance to restrictions from the residents this time. “There was tremendous fear of Covid-19 last year and residents adhered to the various restrictions, but that is not the case anymore,” he added.Civic officials are advising managing committees to fine people and take their photographs if they fail to wear mask or violate Covid-19 guidelines. “Since we cannot be everywhere, it makes sense for societies to fine people,” said a civic official who refused to come on record.State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the state is mulling over granting special police power to chairman and secretary of housing societies to rein in errant members. If allowed, the office-bearers will have the power to fine members and use force if necessary.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has opposed the proposal saying it would lead to friction between office-bearers and other residents. “Housing societies are facing so many issues, and if you give police power to two people, it may cause havoc. These people, if they use police power, will have to bear the effects for years,” said BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Advocate Vinod Sampat also voiced similar concerns and called it a bad step. “The government is abdicating its responsibility. These office-bearers are not trained to perform policing jobs, and the whole atmosphere of the housing society will get spoiled by such acts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaihousing-societies-start-imposing-curbs-prohibit-home-deliveries-visitors-101617995955595.html

They said farmers are being harassed due to new mode of payments adopted by the government.They said the government should ensure that their produce is procured on minimum support price (MSP) without any delay.“Agencies concerned are not procuring our wheat and we were waiting in mandis since four days. This is even after the produce is fit for procurement,” alleged the protesting farmers.They slammed arhtiyas for not procuring their wheat and forcing them to wait at mandis.“Why are the farmers being harassed by the commission agents? Farmers have the right to get direct payment and will return the dues of arhtiyas if their produce is procured,” said BKU (Charuni) Kaithal district president Hoshiar Singh Gill, adding that the government is not taking any action to resolve the issue.After high drama of hours and assurance of the district administration, the farmers ended their protest and lifted the blockade.

10-04-2021||Mumbai||Isolation railway coaches on standby for Covid-19 patients in Mumbai||Railway officials on Friday said that isolation railway coaches for Covid-19 patients in the city have been kept on standby. In case of non-availability of bed in the city, the railway authorities will provide the isolation coaches on demand from the state government. Around 153 isolation coaches for Mumbai are presently available with the Central and Western Railway, of which 128 coaches are available with the Western Railway (WR) and 25 with Central Railway (CR).The coaches can facilitate nearly 3,600 patients at one time. Each coach can accommodate nearly 24 patients. The coaches are also equipped with medical oxygen. The isolation coaches are generally used for patients with mild symptoms.“We have appraised the state government regarding the isolation coaches. We have not yet received any demand from the government. The coaches will be ready within 24 hours after the state government asks for them,” said GVL Satya Kumar, divisional railway manager, WR. The coaches were not used in Maharashtra last year but were made available to other states including Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. The coaches are deployed only on the request of the state government.The Indian Railways had, in 2020, converted more than 5,000 railway coaches into isolation units for covid-19 patients. Of these, over 800 coaches were provided to CR and WR. The coaches were converted at cost of ₹2 lakh and will be stationed at the designated railway stations. There will be no movement of the trains from the railway station where they are stationed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/isolation-railway-coaches-on-standby-for-covid-19-patients-in-mumbai-101617995715416.html

10-04-2021||Other||Kerala minister Jaleel not fit to continue in power: Lokayukta||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Lokayukta on Friday found state higher education minister KT Jaleel guilty of favouritism, abuse of power and violation of oath of office, and ruled that he has no right to continue in the council of ministers. The verdict against the minister, who was grilled several times in connection with import of dry dates and holy books by central agencies, came on a complaint regarding the appointment of his relative KT Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited in 2018. There was a big uproar when Adeeb was appointed allegedly by flouting all norms and later forced to resign. Later, a lawyer V K Mohammad Shafi, had filed a compliant with the Lokayukta, which on Friday ruled, “The action of the respondent (Jaleel) was actuated in a discharge of his function as minister by personal interest to favour his second cousin. It amounted to favouritism and nepotism and also lack of integrity in his capacity as the minister.” The verdict was passed by Justices Cyriac Joseph and Harun-al-Rasheed. It also said he diluted qualifications and norms for the post just to favour his kin. Lokayukta found that the minister’s earlier assertion, that Adeeb was selected after many candidates appeared for the interview, unsuitable. “In spite of objections raised from many quarters, the minister directed to issue an order and in the process other eligible candidates were denied the opportunity,” it said. Muslim League leader P K Firoze was first to raise the allegation. After his appointment snowballed into a major row, Adeeb quit his post and rejoined his parent organisation, South Indian Bank. The opposition Congress and BJP had sought Jaleel’s immediate resignation. “He has no right to continue in power. The CM should drop him,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. But the minister maintained that the case was rejected by high court and he would take a decision after consulting legal experts. “Former Governor Justice Sathasivam and High Court had rejected the petition two years back. I will take a decision after consulting my lawyers,” he posted his comment on social media. After the gold smuggling case involving the UAE consulate came to light last year, Jaleel was questioned by the Customs and Enforcement on several occasions. Trouble started brewing for him after call records of Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the gold smuggling case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently in the list. Soon after the list came out, the minister said he had called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate in the state capital.But the minister’s clarification invited more trouble as he was not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the Ministry of External Affairs and experts said it was a clear violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the probe, the customs also found that a heavy consignment came in last March in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took these packets to his constituency and said they were religious books. The customs also found that between 2017 and 2018, about 17,000kg dry dates was imported by the consular office. Considered close to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the party had defended the minister, who was the minority mascot of the party on several times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-minister-jaleel-not-fit-to-continue-in-power-lokayukta-101617995475334.html
10-04-2021||Mumbai||Complete weekend lockdown in force in Mumbai, may get extended next week||As Maharashtra starts its weekend lockdown from 8pm on Friday till 7am on Monday, wherein nobody will be allowed to step out of their homes without a valid reason, all establishments, except essential services, will be shut, the Maharashtra government is mulling it till 7am on April 19 (next Monday) to break the transmission chain. Through this, the civic body will be able to impose a full nine-day lockdown which will help in bringing the situation under control, officials said. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has called an all-party meeting on Saturday evening where the proposal is likely to be discussed in detail. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said the state is heading towards complete lockdown and is hoping to bring the situation under control before that. “We are heading towards complete lockdown. However, we are hoping to control the situation. I am not in favour of imposing it immediately, but if hospitals are overwhelmed and we start facing shortage of doctors, healthcare workers, health infrastructure and medicines, then lockdown has to be imposed to break the chain,” Tope told NDTV. “All activities categorised under essential services can remain open. No person can move without a valid reason, which includes reasons specified in the order as well as reason for requirement of performing an essential service,” states a clarification issued by Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management and relief and rehabilitation department on Friday. During the weekend lockdown, restaurants and eateries will be allowed to serve only take-aways. It has also allowed all Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (AMPC) markets to remain open during weekend lockdown, provided they ensure strict adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour. If local authorities feel indiscipline in any APMC can lead to further transmission of the virus, they may close it after seeking permission from the state government. It is expected that local authorities will keep a strict vigil over these, the order stated. It further allowed restaurants and bars to function following timings determined by local authority with the constraint that no seating and dining will be allowed inside. Only parcels will be allowed to be picked up from restaurants and bars by customers themselves from 7am to 8pm. Home deliveries through e-commerce have also been allowed during the restricted period, it added. A complete lockdown has to be imposed from at least 15 days to three weeks and it should be followed very seriously, only then some positive impact can be expected from the entire exercise, Tope said, in reply to a question. The issue of imposition of lockdown was discussed in a meeting called by CM Thackeray on Friday to discuss deferment of Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examinations scheduled on April 11. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who was present in the meeting, demanded that a lockdown be imposed for three weeks. Few leaders such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, revenue minister and former Congress state chief Balasaheb Thorat said are in support of a complete lockdown. “There is a need to enforce a three-week lockdown across the state to save the lives of innocent people. I made this demand in the meeting before the chief minister,” Wadettiwar told reporters. Pravin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the legislative Council who also attended the meeting, said the issue was discussed during the meeting and he demanded an all-party meeting to discuss the same, which the CM accepted. “I demanded that an all-party meeting be called to discuss the issue of imposing complete lockdown in the presence of former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP president Chandrakant Patil as the debate over the same started during the meeting called to decide postponement of MPSC exam,” Darekar said. Only home delivery allowed for liquorThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a circular issued on April 9 said wine and beer shops in the city would be able to sell liquor only via home delivery on all days of the week between 7am to 8pm in the backdrop of restrictions implemented in the city. BMC also said that a shop, which is a licence holder, can deliver liquor but to a permit holder only. However, one cannot purchase by going to the shop for the same.BMC commissioner IS Chahal, in an order, said the person who will be sent for the delivery of the same should be wearing a mask and sanitising hands regularly. The state order which was issued earlier this week had stated that restaurant and bars inside hotels were to be open for in-house guests while only takeaway would be allowed for outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/complete-weekend-lockdown-in-force-in-mumbai-may-get-extended-next-week-101617995295240.html
10-04-2021||Other||Farmers’ numbers decrease at Singhu border||For the first time in over four months since the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws began, number of protesters at Singhu border has decreased as compared to Tikri border.As per farm leaders, at present people at Singhu border are thinning and less than 10,000 farmers are camping there while nearly three to four times the number of protesters are present at Tikri.Since the farm stir started, Singhu border was the epicentre of the stir and all decisions were being taken there by the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM).SKM leader Inderjit Singh said the farmers’ numbers have reduced at both protesting sites as many have gone to their villages for rabi crops harvesting and will return after selling the yield.“The impact can be seen at Singhu border more because it has more presence of Punjab farmers while Tikri border is dominated by Haryana farmers. It is not easy for Punjab farmers to visit Singhu border on daily basis due to distance and crop procurement season, while Haryana farmers can visit Tikri on a work-free day due to their proximity,” Singh added.Another SKM leader Darshan Pal Singh agreed that the protesters gathering at Singhu have decreased as compared to Tikri.“Most protesters at Singhu hail from Punjab and have returned to their villages. We expect that labourers, farmers and students from Punjab will return to Singhu protest in next two weeks and the protest will once again gain momentum,” he added.Balbir Takhan, state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, who is camping at Tikri said that over 30,000 farmers are protesting here and the number of farmers will double by the end of April, once harvesting and procurement process concludes.The farmers are protesting with the same zeal and will not go back until the farm laws are repealed,” he added.FARMERS TO BLOCK KMP FOR 24 HRS TODAYIn view of SKM’s call to shut down Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway for 24-hours on Saturday, Haryana issued a traffic advisory.

10-04-2021||Mumbai||86 of 120 vaccination centres in Mumbai did not operate on Friday||Of the 120 vaccination centres in Mumbai, 86 centres could not conduct sessions on Friday as they ran out of vaccine, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Effectively, only 36 vaccination centres carried out the vaccination drive on Friday. BMC is expected to receive 100,000 vaccine doses by Friday late night.“The vaccination drive will take place only at government and municipal hospitals on Saturday and Sunday,” municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Friday night. Private vaccination centres will not conduct vaccination drive on April 10, 11, and 12 as BMC directed all private vaccination centres to cancel any scheduled sessions on these days and inform beneficiaries who have signed up for these dates.There are 33 municipal-run vaccination centres and 16 state and Central government-operated vaccination centres in Mumbai, where vaccination will continue between 12noon and 6pm on Saturday, and between 9am and 5pm on Sunday. KEM Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital, Mahim Maternity Hospital and BKC jumbo Covid centre will also operate till 8pm on Saturday as these facilities have signed up for two sessions of the vaccination drive per day.“However, if more vaccines become available, efforts will be made to resume vaccinations in private hospitals,” BMC’s public health department said.At the end of Thursday’s vaccination drive, BMC had utilised about 50% of the 103,320 vaccine vials in stock and the remaining were left for Friday. Following this, BMC vaccinated 33,551 beneficiaries on Friday, as opposed to around 50,000 beneficiaries vaccinated daily in the past week. On Friday, 29,187 beneficiaries received the first dose of their vaccine, and 4,364 beneficiaries received their second dose. These figures do not include final figures reported during the second session on Friday, which went on till 8pm.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, on Friday said, “BMC will receive 100,000 vaccine doses by Friday night.

10-04-2021||Other||Maharashtra: 4 Covid patients die in Nagpur hospital blaze||At least four patients, including a woman, died following a massive fire that broke out in a Covid hospital at Wadi area of Nagpur on Friday night. According to unofficial sources, around 27 patients at the hospital were shifted to government-run medical college and hospital and Indira Gandhi Medical College in a serious condition. This is the second such tragedy in the state after Mumbai where several patients being treated for Covid-19 at Sunrise Hospital were killed after a fire broke out last month.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Samir Meghe, who represents the area, said the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. “Prima facie it appears that short-circuit could have triggered the fire,” said Meghe, who overseeing the rescue operations. Sources said the fire started on the first floor of Well Treat Hospital at Wadi, and the smoke spread to the second floor where 10 patients were in the ICU. Of these, the hospital staff managed to rescue six patients while the remaining four died of asphyxiation due to toxic smoke. “We can’t comment on the health condition of others as we are busy shifting the patients to other hospitals,” said commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar. Four fire tenders rushed to the spot and it took about an hour to bring the blaze under control. Names and identities of the deceased were not yet known. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has instructed Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut to visit the spot and ordered an inquiry into the incident. District collector Ravindra Thakare said he had a talk with the civil surgeon and asked him to conduct a probe and submit a report as soon as possible. Meanwhile, over 6,5,50 new Covid-19 cases and 67 deaths were reported in Nagpur on Friday. RSS chief tests positive for Covid-19Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) supremo Mohan Bhagwat tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday.

10-04-2021||Gurugram||Traffic violators started receiving real-time challans starting Friday||Gurugram Traffic Police on Friday issued 30 real-time challans from three locations, Galleria Market, Bakhtawar Chowk and Iffco Chowk Metro station. This was the first time that the process of issuing traffic challans was automated in the city.Police said they will expand to 10 more locations by the end of the month.In December, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) had installed 315 red light violation detection (RLVD) cameras at 28 locations across the city.Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said one RLVD camera atop traffic signal could capture an entire intersection and detect wrong side driving and spot red light violations. “With the help of integrated command and control system (ICCC), cameras are linked to the traffic signals, with light sensors detecting the changes,” he said.Balhara said the violators would receive instant text messages. On Friday, four traffic violations, wrong side driving, red-light jump, driving without a helmet and speeding, were in focus. The camera switches on as soon as the traffic light turns red and the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system will capture violators and send it to the ICCC command centre in Sector 44.Police said a copy of the challan along with the violation evidence would be sent to the registered address of the vehicle owner within two days.Trials of the new system held in February and Marchwas a resounding success following which the system was approved for deployment, said police.Balhara said the plan was to deploy the systems at 28 locations but due to ongoing construction of underpass and flyovers, only 13 locations are equipped with ANPR cameras that can identify the four violations. “Once the cameras detect high-security number plates, data will be transferred over the optical fibre network and will be sent to the ICCC,” he said.A team of 10 traffic policemen at the ICCC monitor the feed and challans are generated automatically. Data on the offending vehicle owners are accessed from the ministry of road transport’s national database Vahan.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said the exercise will also help to keep a watch on street crime and offenders involved in snatching cases. “The policemen keeping a watch from ICCC informs the local police control room van and rider after he witnesses any suspicious activity at any intersections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/traffic-violators-started-receiving-real-time-challans-starting-friday-101617994035176.html
10-04-2021||Gurugram||Man booked for impersonating son of property owner, selling land for crores||Police have booked a man for alleged impersonation and forgery to sell property worth several crores that was not his in Palam Vihar.According to police, a man named Aalok Kumar allegedly sold the property of Palam Vihar resident Braham Kumar Bishnoi. The property was then used to secure a bank loan and then sold again to another person who also used it to secure a bank loan.The crime was discovered when Bishnoi approached Palam Vihar police on February 20 and complained that Ankit Yadav, a resident of Moulsari Avenue in DLF Phase 3, had illegally bought his property.Yadav said he told police that he was looking to buy property in the city in 2019 when he met two property brokers named Kamal Arora and Amrit.“They introduced me to Aalok Kumar who said he was the son of Braham Kumar Bishnoi and the sole owner of a 435-square meter property in F-Block. He also produced a transfer deed dated August 2019 to this effect, his passport, Aadhar card, bank passbook and even an allotment letter,” he said. He said he then proceeded with the deal and bought the land, paying a stamp duty of ₹16 lakh. He did not disclose the price he paid for the land.But as it turned out, Bishnoi did not have a son in the first place and Yadav said he got to know of this only when police came knocking at his door. “I thought I bought the property legally and sold it legally,” said Yadav.Yadav said he had mortgaged the land for a ₹2.5 crore bank loan. “The bank too did its due diligence before granting the loan,” he said.In July 2020, Ankit sold the property off to another person who also took a bank loan.On March 5, Ankit Yadav filed a complaint on the basis of which a case was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (Cheating), 467 (forgery), among others, at the Palam Vihar police station.Police are yet to verify the suspect’s identity or that of the persons who introduced him to Yadav.“A case has been registered. We are verifying the facts and once the investigation is complete, we will arrest the suspect,” said K K Rao, commissioner of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-booked-for-impersonating-son-of-property-owner-selling-land-for-crores-101617993977063.html
10-04-2021||Gurugram||No plan to impose lockdown or night curfew in state: CM||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said his government was not considering imposing curfews to deal with the rising Covid-19 cases.Instead, Haryana will follow directions from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and focus on testing, tracking and strict enforcement of Covi-19 health protocols, he said. In-person classes till grade 8, however, will remain suspended till further notice.Khattar was in Gurugram to attend the eighth Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).Gurugram is in the midst of a surge in Covid-19 cases. On Friday, it reported 703 cases, taking its tally to 68193 . The active cases were 4,591 and the total death toll was 368. Haryana recorded 2,994 cases taking the tally to 310,504. It suffered 11 more deaths due to the disease, taking the death toll to 3,241.Delhi, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar had ordered a night curfew between 10 pm and 5 am earlier this week. Their Covid-19 case rise had been sharp with record levels of new cases this year. With Gurugram also witnessing a rapid rise in the spread of Covid infections in the last month, there was strong apprehension among the residents that the state government could impose a similar curfew.Khattar said the focus was on ensuring normal life continued in the cities with strict measures to control the spread of the coronavirus disease. “Both preventive and punitive measures will be taken and different strategies will be implemented that suit different cities in the state. This year, most of the patients are in home isolation, but we are also confident that the health care system will be able to manage the situation as it did last year,” he said.The CM also said that district administrations across the state have been told to ensure safeguards such as wearing masks, social distancing, check on public and social gatherings and sanitization of public spaces is done on priority and continuously. “Vaccinations and testing are also going on smoothly and it will be further expanded,” he said.He said that situation in various cities was being continuously monitored and there was no need for panic.Given the surge in the Covid 19 infections, Khattar said that the government has decided that schools up to class eighth should remain closed. “There is no need for lockdown or similar measure right now and the situation is being monitored. We had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which CM’s of all the states were present and the Covid situation was discussed in detail and directions were issued as to how to manage the situation,” said Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-plan-to-impose-lockdown-or-night-curfew-in-state-cm-101617993975652.html
10-04-2021||Other||47 waterless urinals installed in Gurugram mini secretariat||Gurugram: To reduce the use of water, a water management society has installed 47 waterless urinals in the mini secretariat complex in Gurugram. Officials said the urinals -- installed by GuruJal society in collaboration with a private firm over the past one week -- will help save nearly 1.5 kilolitres (KL) of water per urinal per annum. Osho Kalia, a senior member from GuruJal working on the project, said, “We have recently installed waterless urinals with zero odour technology in the mini secretariat complex... It is estimated that a total of 7,050 KL of water per annum will be saved through this initiative.” A hub of most government offices in the district, including the deputy commissioner’s office, the mini secretariat complex witnesses a footfall of at least 3,000 people daily. The latest data obtained from the agricultural department’s groundwater cell revealed that between June 2019 and June 2020, the groundwater table in Gurugram district dropped by 0.27 metres and stood at 29.86 metresWhile the long-term functionality of these waterless urinals has often been questioned, especially since its failure in neighbouring Delhi, Kalia said they have taken steps towards ensuring regular maintenance. “We understand that failures have been witnessed before due to lack of maintenance, but as the mini secretariat already had its own sanitation staff, they have been trained regarding its maintenance. The toilets will be cleaned once every day and a perfumed substance is also put in the system once every month to keep it odourless,” added Kalia. With the groundwater table continuing to drop in Gurugram, officials also hope the new urinals will set an example in water conservation.Between 2014 and 2018, the groundwater table in Gurugram district reduced by 2.5 metres. In 2014, the district recorded an average groundwater level of 26.3, but this had dipped to 28.9 metres across four monitoring blocks of Gurugram, Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar, by 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/47-waterless-urinals-installed-in-gurugram-mini-secretariat-101617993976302.html

10-04-2021||Other||Now book affordable homes online on DTCP portal||htreporters@hindustantimes.comGurugram: To ensure all home buyers get equal chance to book affordable flats and the practice of collecting premiums from buyers at the time of submitting applications is curtailed, the town and country planning department has launched an online webpage on its portal to allow prospective buyers to book flats online, officials from the department aware of the development said on Friday. Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram, said the module for online booking of affordable plots has been launched. Buyers can access the DTCP website and apply for a flat. “At the time of applying for a flat, the buyers can select whether they want a one BHK, two BHK or three BHK flat. At the time of submitting the application, they will have to deposit 5% of the cost of the flat,” he said adding that in case the application is not successful, the applicant will get a refund of the booking amount. DTCP officials said the portal to book affordable homes was launched on Wednesday after buyers complained that either forms were not available or only limited forms were being made available. It may be recalled that on February 18, 2020, KM Pandurang, director of DTCP, had called for the creation of an online portal to provide applications forms for affordable housing projects. As per the directions issued by the director, DTCP, “The applications shall be invited online through STP of the respective circle and then allotment shall be made by the coloniser. The first draw of lots shall be held within four months from the date of first advertisement and there shall be a gap of at least three months between any two such advertisements. After three such attempts by STP, the coloniser will make allotment of flats on a first-come, first-serve basis but on pre-defined rates.”Mann, who is also the nodal officer for the portal, said the module will be fine tuned further based on the feedback of applicants. “The objective is to ensure transparency in allotment of affordable homes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-book-affordable-homes-online-on-dtcp-portal-101617993916756.html
10-04-2021||Gurugram||Construction on stretch linking Rampura Chowk-Pataudi Road to commence next month||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development (GMDA) is likely to start revamping a key 5.6-kilometre road that links Rampura Chowk on national highway (NH) 48 and Pataudi Road from next month.The stretch carries a heavy volume of traffic from Pataudi and Western Peripheral Highway towards the new Gurugram sectors. For those travelling on NH 48 from Jaipur towards Delhi, the stretch will serve as an alternative to bypass the heavily congested Kherki Daula toll and can also provide easier access to residents living on Dwarka Expressway.Currently, the stretch is designed as a “sector dividing road” passing through residential sectors such as sector 81, 81A, 82, 82A, 85, 86, 89, and 90. It is riddled with potholes, heavily broken and unlevelled, making it extremely difficult to drive on. It is also inadequately lit, with several dark stretches.GMDA officials said that they will be building the road afresh as its existing base cannot handle the large volume of vehicles, especially the weight of heavy vehicles that lead to its degrading.As part of the construction, GMDA will be expanding the stretch to a six-lane road with service roads, cycle tracks and footpaths on both sides of the road, running parallel to each other.“The tendering process has started, and all the submitted bids will be opened on May 5, following which a contractor will be finalised. We are aiming to start on-site construction from May-end onwards,” said Shweta Sharma, executive engineer, infrastructure division 1, GMDA, who is overseeing the project.On Thursday, GMDA opened bids for this project for potential contractors.“We have set a deadline of 18 months for the concessionaire to complete the project. Besides cycle tracks, footpaths, service lanes; three roundabouts and two T-junctions will also be redeveloped in this project,” said Sharma.GMDA officials said that the finalised contractor will maintain the stretch for a period of four years after construction.As per GMDA officials, privy to the matter, LED streetlights will also be installed along the six-kilometre stretch under this project along with the development of green belts.They further said that the drains will be aligned in such a manner that rainwater will first be sprinkled on green belts before proceeding towards stormwater drains.As per GMDA’s design plan, each carriageway will measure around 5.6 kilometres in length and 14 metres in width. The five-kilometre footpath and cycle track will be two metres and 2.5 metres wide respectively on each side. The service lane will measure around 5.2 kilometres with 5.5 metres width.The entire project is expected to cost around ₹57 crore, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/construction-on-stretch-linking-rampura-chowk-pataudi-road-to-commence-next-month-101617993915533.html
10-04-2021||Noida||Delhi Meerut E-way: Traffic violations continue, NHAI yet to approve automatic registration-plate reader and toll rates||Ghaziabad: It has been nine days since the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) opened to the public on April 1, but traffic violations, such as over-speeding, continues unabated at the expressway section. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that although automatic number plate readers (ANPRs) have been installed at various locations along the e-way, approval to run them is pending, along with levying toll rates. HT on Friday visited the UP-Gate to Dasna section of the DME and found that the ANPRs in operation at Indirapuram displayed speed of vehicles over the limit of 100kmph, which is permissible under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh. Further ahead, autos and private buses continued to remain parked on highway lanes, blocking the traffic, and a similar situation prevailed at the Lal Kuan intersection. NHAI officials said traffic violations data is being recorded with the help of ANPR systems but they did not share the number of erring vehicles noted so far. “We have ANPR systems installed at six entry/exit points of the expressway and at eight other locations as well. We are monitoring traffic violations and fines will be sent to the district officials once the ANPRs get approval. At present, we are conducting only dry runs with ANPRs. The approvals for these as well as toll rates are also pending, and we are expecting them soon. In case of any accidents, the respective commuter will be held responsible,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI. The ANPRs are high-resolution CCTV cameras which detect speed violations and also read the registration plate of vehicles at the entry and exit points so as to ascertain the toll amount on the basis of distance travelled by the vehicle. According to official sources, the DME, in 24 hours from midnight of April 7 to midnight of April 8, witnessed movement of about 94,800 vehicles, of which about 99% were cars and the rest were light-weight commercial vehicles, buses, trucks and other multi-axle vehicles. Sources said that about 55% of the overall vehicles were found using the FASTag facility on the expressway, while those without FASTags were cars. On the DME, only those vehicles with FASTags would be allowed once toll operations start, while non-FASTag vehicles will be penalised double the toll rate for the entire DME’s 60km section.“It would have been better if officials had taken some more time and finished the pending works. The works of commuter safety come first. Wrong-side driving and even people crossing the expressway, risking their lives, is a common feature on the DME,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association. Instances of jaywalking near Sector 63, Noida, and also at places in Vijay Nagar continue unabated on DME. Officials of the Ghaziabad traffic police, meanwhile, said they have not received any penalties yet from NHAI, hence are not acting against speed limit violation. “This is because their ANPR systems are not connected and fully functional for fines. On our part, we are taking up enforcement against wrong side driving and also autos plying on DME. About 200 fines have been issued so far since April 1, when the DME was opened,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/delhi-meerut-e-way-traffic-violations-continue-nhai-yet-to-approve-automatic-registration-plate-reader-and-toll-rates-101617993916114.html
10-04-2021||Noida||Feral dogs major threat to wildlife in Dhanauri wetland, say experts||Feral dogs are a major threat to the already struggling wildlife at unprotected habitats like Dhanauri wetland in Gautam Budh Nagar, according to experts. Recently, a video showing a small pack of free-ranging dogs chasing an injured Sarus crane in Dhanauri wetland made the rounds on social media platforms.“We saw four dogs chasing the bird with an injured right wing on Saturday. The Sarus crane spread its wings and struggled to defend itself. It tried to take flight every time the pack came close to it. We have informed animal rescue NGOs and the forest department, but not much was done about it. We have not spotted the crane since that day,” said Rohit Sharma, a city-based birder who frequents the wetland.Recalling a similar incident, Sharma said that some feral dogs had killed a Nilgai in Dhanauri two months ago, adding that they often charge at nests in the wetland.Meanwhile, the forest department said that it has formed a team to find and rescue the injured bird. It also mentioned multiple incidents where feral dogs hunted endangered species like Blackbuck and Sarus in the district.“Feral dogs have become one of the major threats to the wildlife in the division, especially to species like Sarus crane in Dhanauri, but no one wants to highlight this sensitive issue as it might lead to backlash from activists and dog lovers. There have been incidents of injuring or killing of the scheduled species too. Last year, feral dogs killed three Blackbucks in Maksudpur and Jewar, and a Nilgai in Surajpur reserve forest,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO), Gautam Budh Nagar, adding that the forest department is working on building the first rescue centre for the scheduled species in the district.‘Dogs responsible for driving down endangered birds’ population’Researchers said that these dogs are responsible for driving down the population of endangered birds like black-necked cranes in Trans-Himalaya and Ladakh, and the Great Indian bustard in central India. Regions of western Uttar Pradesh, with the healthy Sarus crane population, must be worked upon, they added.According to conservationists, for a place like Dhanauri — with dropping water levels and more non-breeding population or the birds looking actively for partners — feral dogs bring birds under stress, affecting the possibility of pairing too.“Dhanauri is a perfect place for Sarus cranes, however, the threat posed by dogs has sub-lethal effects which is far more dangerous because we are not able to quantify it. For western Uttar Pradesh, the non-breeding population is almost 50-60 %, which means the population is healthy. But at the same time, we need more wetlands and a safe environment for them to survive, roost, etc. Amid the threats from the dogs, they don’t get a place to rest. This is a disturbance of balance between feeding and resting,” said KS Gopi Sundar, scientist, Nature Conservation Foundation. He is also the global co-chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Group (SIS-SG).Sundar said that the recent evidence, like nesting in dry areas, shows that Sarus cranes are going towards an adjustment phase due to the unseasonal rainfall and land use change pattern, and the rising population of dogs now emerges as the biggest threat to the cranes.“The increasing population of feral dogs leads to more competition for the resources, consequently affecting the birds and their nestlings for easier food options. These feral dogs are posing a threat to their future population too,” said Manisha Bisht, researcher, Wildlife Institute of India (WII).On a decreasing population trend across the world, Sarus crane is listed as “vulnerable” under the IUCN red list. As per the last forest department census held in the 2019 summer, 80 out of 140 Sarus cranes spotted across the district were from Dhanauri.‘India home to 60 million of the world’s estimated 1 billion dogs’Stating that the free-ranging dogs are loosely associated with humans, researchers called for an urgent need to control the population.“India is home to about 60 million of the world’s estimated 1 billion dogs. Many researchers and scientists reported that dogs are the third human-introduced predator which contributes to the extinction of wildlife animals. There is still an untamed conflict with scientific and rational policies in India, such as the animal welfare community in India, that has promoted the maintenance of unowned dogs in public places and even areas with the wildlife. There is an urgency in controlling the impact of free-ranging dogs on the wildlife,” said Sipu Kumar, research scholar, WII.According to Anand Arya, a city-based birder, “Feral dogs have become a menace in Dhanauri, and much could not be done until the wetland is not protected. The forest department must speed up the process of recognising the habitat.”The activists, however, put the onus on the forest department, saying that they are “neither feeding the dogs living inside the wetlands, nor are they doing anything to control the population”.“The population of the dogs must be controlled immediately through sterilisation, but the forest department is not doing so. Dogs living in the wetland would obviously follow the natural instincts, just like the pack that chased the Sarus crane. The department is neither providing food to them, nor are they sterilising them. The question is: what are they doing to control the issue?” asked Kaveri Rana, director, People for Animals, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/feral-dogs-major-threat-to-wildlife-in-dhanauri-wetland-say-experts-101617993856367.html

Among the criteria for the event management firm includes experience in handling at least five events presided by the Prime Minister or chief ministers.“Officials said the authority will also carry out the groundbreaking ceremony of the Film City project later this year after completing all formalities. We have started the process to hire the event management company because the process takes time and we have to follow procedures to finalise a company,” said a Yeida official, who asked not to be named.The UP government has already handed over 1,334 hectares of land to Swiss company, Zurich International AG, which is likely to start work on the airport project at the ground by June this year. Officials said the firm is currently in the process of completing the required formalities before starting the work on the ground.The state government has also sanctioned ₹2,000 crore for acquiring 1,365 hectares of land for the expansion of airport project.“We will start deciding on land rates for the second phase once the social impact assessment survey is completed. We are in process of shifting farmers so that the airport work can begin,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.A total of 8,971 farmers’ families have given either their agricultural land or houses for the airport. Of them, 3,627 families will be displaced, the officials said, adding that each farmer/family will given a plot which is 50% of their existing land/house. The administration has allotted at least 1,000 plots to farmers who will be displaced while the remaining will be shifted after allotment of land, “probably next month”.“We are shifting farmers to airport townships properly so that the work can start on time,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.Meanwhile, Yeida has sought permission from the UP government to issue a global tender to hire a developer to build the first phase of Film City on 376 of the total 1,000 acres of land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uttar-pradesh-okays-groundbreaking-ceremonies-for-noida-airport-film-city-101617993855632.html

In the past two days, they have imposed fines against 9,370 persons for not wearing masks and collected ₹937,000 from them for violating Covid-19 protocols. Police have also issued challans to 2,947 vehicle owners and collected ₹3.62 lakh as fine.On Friday, the Noida police fined 6,006 persons against 3,364 on Thursday and collected ₹600,600 against ₹336,400 a day earlier.

They also registered 30 FIRs against 77 persons for violating Covid-19 protocols on Friday, against 30 cases against 70 persons on Thursday.Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, reminded people that wearing a mask is mandatory. “The police teams are conducting awareness drives in different markets and public places and are urging people to follow Covid-19 protocols. We are conducting an enforcement drive and have asked people to maintain social distancing and other such norms. We have also fined people for not wearing masks,” Kumar said.Rajendra Kumar, sub-inspector, Sector 39 police station, said that his team is conducting the enforcement drive in the neighbourhood.“While on duty in Noida Sector 94, we saw a person standing without a mask.

The Ghaziabad district magistrate, however, said the facility is safe for those coming for jabs or testing. According to sources at the hospital, the hospital has 118 beds and as of April 9, occupancy was 10%. They added that the vaccination centre at the hospital has an average of more than 500 visitors per day, while about 70-80 persons come for Covid-19 testing. Last year, a similar testing booth was from the hospital when the hospital was declared as a dedicated Covid-19 facility; the authorities had later shifted the booth to another centre. “As per norms, there has to be a separate entry/exit point for the Covid building. In private hospitals which double up as a Covid and non-Covid centres, officials ensure there is a separate entry/exit for the Covid and non-Covid blocks. And these have to be clearly marked as red and green zones. If the hospital is a dedicated Covid facility and has two other centres operating, there is likely to be mixing of people coming there,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). The Sanjay Nagar hospital has a main entrance through which ambulances pass. The same is also used by a majority of people coming for vaccination as well as testing. The distance between the vaccination centres and the Covid testing booth is barely 20-25 metres, while the two are adjacent to the dedicated Covid block whose entry gate is on the other side. The Ghaziabad district administration, however, said that there is no mixing of people and the hospital is not a containment zone. Last year, the facility was declared as a containment zone when it started operation as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. “The Covid block is separate, and the testing and vaccination centres are also separate. So, there is no mixing of people and all three can run from the same hospital,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said. Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital, could not be reached for comments. 50% AMBULANCES TO BE USED FOR COVID PATIENTSMeanwhile, state officials released yet another order regarding the ‘108 ambulance service’ in which they said that only 50% of the number of ambulances available in Uttar Pradesh districts will be used for non-Covid patients while the rest can be used for Covid patients. The order was issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary, on April 8. An earlier order on April 4 had said that all 108 ambulance service vehicles can be used for ferrying any kind of patients. “It is now decided that only 50% ambulances in the districts will be used for Covid patients and rest 50% for non-Covid patients. In case more than 50% vehicles are required for ferrying Covid patients, approval of director general (health) is mandatory. However, in case of extraordinary circumstances, the permission for usage over 50% can also be given by district magistrates,” said an officer from district health department, requesting anonymity. The Ghaziabad district has 16 ambulances under the 108 service and another set of five advanced life-support ambulances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dedicated-government-covid-hospital-in-ghaziabad-doubled-up-as-vaccination-and-testing-centre-101617993796324.html
10-04-2021||Noida||Vaccination centres run of out of stock, district left with 4,700 doses||Ghaziabad: The announcement of the upcoming four-day event of ‘Tika Utsav’ from April 11 to April 14 has come as a breather for the Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) as the state officials directed that on Saturday, the vaccination will take place only at medical colleges and district hospitals. Officials in Ghaziabad said they will operate only two government vaccination centres. There are 100 CVCs in the district, including 34 private CVCs. On an average, the district is conducting vaccination of about 8,000 beneficiaries per day in April to meet its target of inoculating 216,000 beneficiaries by the end of the month. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said on Friday that there is no shortage of vaccine in the district and added that the district will get 10,000 more doses by Friday night. However, officials in the know said the district was left with only 1,000 doses of Covishield, which is widely being used for vaccinating beneficiaries, and 3,700 vials of Covaxin. “There is shortage of vaccine. However, we are expecting that we will get more vaccine doses by Saturday night. As directed, we will inoculate beneficiaries only at MMG Hospital and community health centre at Dasna on Saturday. Only doses of Covaxin will be administered in both the vaccination centres. The 1,000 doses of Covishield are available in small batches at variouss CVCs and not as a whole bunch,” said an officer from the health department, who didn’t want to be quoted. Officials said that ahead of the ‘Tika Utsav,’ the staff at vaccination centres will take up training for the event. “During the event, we will take up comprehensive vaccination at 6,000 centres and will scale up to 8,000 centres midway during the event,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). Dr Raj Kumar, additional director (health) at Meerut, said vehicles will move to the vaccine depots at Agra and Lucknow to get new stock of the doses. “The vehicles will get vaccine stocks from Agra for Bulandshahr and Gautam Budh Nagar districts. Likewise, vehicles from Ghaziabad will bring stock of vaccine from Lucknow for Meerut and Ghaziabad district. As of now, we don’t have the approximate number of doses that will be made available,” said Kumar. Meanwhile, private CVCs continued with their “out-of-stock” run on Friday. “We have no stock of vaccine at our hospital hence, no vaccination has taken place. We have made the payments but the officials have told us to wait for a couple of days,” said Mohit Tyagi, accounts manager at Ganesh Hospital in Nehru Nagar. Lalit Goyal, manager operations from St Joseph Hospital at Nandgram, echoed similar views. “We administered the last vaccine on Saturday. We were to get a stock of 200 doses but got only 100, all of which were administered to the beneficiaries. Though the beneficiaries keep calling us, we cannot assure them about the availability of vaccines as the officials have told us to wait for a few more days,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccination-centres-run-of-out-of-stock-district-left-with-4-700-doses-101617993795545.html

He is survived by his wife and a son.“He started writing for Hindustan Times in late 1990s, when our father YP Datta, a journalist, died. Since then he has been continuously writing for Hindustan Times with the zeal of a young man. He was admitted to Delhi hospital 12 days back, when he experienced difficulty in breathing after testing positive for Covid-19,” said Sunil Datta, Kapil Datta’s brother.Kapil Datta’s wife 62-year -old Lata Datta is also down with Covid and is under home isolation.

10-04-2021||Noida||Vaccine crisis: GB Nagar admin to run only 3 vaccine centres today||NOIDA: After repeated claims that Gautam Budh Nagar district has adequate doses of Covid-19 vaccines, district health officials admitted on Friday that there is an acute crisis of vials. The revelation comes on a day when the district reported 225 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest single-day case surge registered so far this year. According to the state health bulletin, the Covid-19 tally in the district increased to 27,046 on Friday. The death toll stood at 93 as no fresh fatalities from the infection were reported in the last 24 hours. The shortage of vaccines has forced the district administration to run only three inoculation centres on Saturday (today), where beneficiaries will be administered only Covaxin jabs. After the vaccination drive concluded on Friday, only 7,727 vaccine doses-- 798 doses of Covishield and 6,929 shots of Covaxin--are in the stock of the district. District magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar Suhas LY said the district will get the next lot of vaccine from Agra and Meerut depots by Saturday morning. “It can’t be called a crisis as we inoculated 68,343 people against the target of 53,000 beneficiaries in the first nine days of April. The shortage of the vaccine is only due to the imbalance between the demand and supply as we used 12 days’ stock in nine days. I have spoken with the higher officials. We will get ample doses of the vaccine by Saturday. From Sunday, the vaccination drive will regain momentum,” he said. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that if the issue of vaccine shortage persists, the inoculation drive after Saturday will be badly affected. “We are left with only 7,727 vaccine doses. Since a major portion of the stock is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, we have little option but to reduce the vaccination centres from 60 (on Friday) to three on Saturday.” The district hospital in sector 30, the Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute – better known as Child PGI-- in sector 39, and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida will provide only Covaxin jabs to the registered beneficiaries,” said Ohri. Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Neeraj Tyagi, who is also the in-charge of Covid-19 vaccination in the district, said 12,000 vaccine doses have been wasted so far. “Nearly 8,500 doses were wasted during the vaccination drive of health care workers and frontline workers in January and February. After that, the percentage of wastage has gone below 2%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccine-crisis-gb-nagar-admin-to-run-only-3-vaccine-centres-today-101617993735077.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||AAP MLA acquitted by court for rioting at Tripoliya Gate||A Delhi court on Friday acquitted AAP MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi and 15 others in a 2013 case of rioting at Tripoliya Gate.Tripathi and the others had been accused of allegedly instigating a mob of 300 people against police officials for not taking action against a murder accused.CBI Judge Geetanjali Goel, however, convicted Tripathi for unlawful assembly and voluntarily obstructing any public servant in the discharge of duty.Another accused, Geeta (identified by first name only) was found guilty of 147 (rioting), 186 (obstructing public servants in carrying out their duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 333 (causing hurt to public servant) read with section 149.In January 2019, a city court had framed charges against Tripathi and 16 others for rioting, obstructing the Delhi Police from discharging duty, using criminal force and causing voluntary hurt, after all the accused pleaded not guilty.According to the charge sheet, the mob had brought the dead body and kept it in front of Tripoliya gate at GT Karnal road to block the traffic.Around 50 workers of Aam Aadmi Party, who were wearing white caps, joined the crowd and started shouting slogans against Delhi Police, which allegedly led the mob to pelt the policemen with stones.Advocate Prashant Manchanda, appearing for Tripathi and others who were acquitted, had vehemently argued that all the accused were falsely implicated by the active political players of the erstwhile government who also facilitated the actual culprits to get off the hook.He had said that the entire incident was a ploy used by erstwhile ruling dispensation to nip rising the political opponent, Aam Aadmi Party.On Friday, the court said that the prosecution has proved the guilt of Tripathi beyond reasonable doubt for the offence under Section 186 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and he is convicted for the same. It however, acquitted him of all the other charges.The judge asked the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to furnish the income details of the convicts to provide compensation to the victims.The matter would be now heard on April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapmlaacquitted-by-court-for-rioting-at-tripoliya-gate-101617993677341.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Gopal Rai visits Narela, says no FCI counters buying foodgrains at MSP||Delhi agriculture minister Gopal Rai on Friday inspected the wholesale grain market in Narela and alleged that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has not set up any counter inside the market to procure food grains at minimum support prices (MSP).The Union ministry of food and public distribution, however, dismissed the allegations.Addressing a press conference later in the day, Rai said he has called a meeting with senior officials of FCI at the Delhi Secretariat on Saturday to resolve the issue.“In Narela Mandi, neither any procurement is being made nor has any counter been set up. FCI claimed that they set up a counter, but our visit reveals something else. Some of their officers had said that counters had been set up in the godown. But, even over there, no purchases were being done, and instead, farmers were being asked for documents. This system is such that the farmer is just being made to go from the mandi to the godown throughout the day,” he said.Rai said the government has decided to authorise some senior government officials in the market in order to create a system in which farmers are able to avail all facilities from a single place.Responding to Rai’s allegation, a spokesperson of the Union ministry of food and public distribution dismissed the allegations and said the FCI will send visuals of the counter at the market to the Delhi government.On Wednesday, the FCI and its Delhi region office had taken to Twitter calling the AAP-led Delhi government’s claims of no counters having been set up for purchase of produce from farmers “baseless”. “Allegations made by the Delhi government are completely baseless. FCI Delhi is fully prepared to procure wheat from farmers of Delhi at FSD Narela, Mayapuri & APMC Najafgarh mandi, which have been operational since April 1 & FCI has already procured 158 Qt wheat as on April 7,” tweeted FCI Delhi region, along with photographs of FSD Narela.Leader of opposition (LoP) in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, challenged Rai to prove his claim that the FCI is not procuring grains from the Narela market.“If his allegation turns out to be false, he should resign and if I am proved wrong, then I will step down as Leader of Opposition. The FCI had already started procuring wheat at its three centres in Narela, Najafgarh and Mayapuri from April 1 at the MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal,” he said.Bidhuri further said that on April 10, he along with some farmers will go to meet Kejriwal. “If Kejriwal refuses to meet us, we will stage a dharna outside his residence. We demand that all obstacles in the way of procuring wheat from Delhi farmers at MSP be removed at once and that the farmers be given 50% extra as promised by Kejriwal. Also, there should be an announcement of free power supply to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gopal-rai-visits-narela-says-no-fci-counters-buying-foodgrains-at-msp-101617993676718.html

His response is awaited,” said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal.Police have also served a similar notice to AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan asking him to join investigation into the case registered against him under Indian Penal Code’s sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Khan, who had reacted to the head priest’s video with threats on Twitter, was asked to be present at the Parliament Street police station at 6 pm on Friday and record his version in the case.When contacted, Khan confirmed that he had received the notice.The priest’s inflammatory remarks, seen and heard in a video that was circulated on social media, attracted sharp reactions from people who also demanded police action against him.The Delhi Police responded by saying that they had taken cognizance of the viral video and a case under Indian Penal Code’ Sections 153 A and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs) was registered at Parliament Street police station.Despite repeated attempts, Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati could not be reached for comments.Among many leaders who had reacted on the priest’s remarks was Khan, who on last Saturday shared the video clip on Twitter and demanded that action be taken against the priest for making the derogatory remarks. Khan’s strong remarks attracted censure from many who also demanded action against him.Delhi Police took cognisance of Khan’s intimidating remarks and registered a case against him for allegedly threatening Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, who also heads the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-notice-to-dasna-temple-head-priest-for-derogatory-remarks-against-islam-101617993676098.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Woman whose husband poisoned her with thallium dies after a month in coma||After more than a month in coma, Divya Arora, whose husband Varun Arora had poisoned her and several of her family members with thallium, died at a hospital in the city on Thursday.Divya’s sister and mother died of the poisoning earlier, while her father and their domestic help recovered after being treated.Varun, a realtor who lives in Greater Kailash-1, was arrested on March 24 for poisoning her family with thallium, a toxic substance.The suspect served them fish laced with the lethal chemical at his in-laws’ house in west Delhi’s Inderpuri on January 31 this year, said police. Investigators involved in the case said he made sure that neither he nor his two children ate the poisoned food.Divya’s sister Priyanka Sharma was the first casualty of the conspiracy and died on February 15. Varun’s mother-in-law, Anita Sharma, was hospitalised on March 4 and died on March 22, while Divya was admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on March 6.One of Divya’s cousins, who asked not to be named, said, “She was in coma since day one of hospitalisation. Varun is still in medical custody and we demand strict action against him. Divya’s father Devender Sharma is still recuperating and is still under medical supervision due to the poisoning,” she said.The relative said Divya’s family will also pursue legal options for custody of their two children.Police found that Varun bought the chemical online from a pharmaceutical company in Panchkula, Haryana, and got the consignment delivered to his relative’s house in Gurugram to avoid suspicion.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said they are verifying if the firm had sold thallium to Varun after carrying out the requisite checks. “We are yet to verify if the pharmaceutical company sold the chemical after verification or not. The documentation between them is also being checked. Any possible negligence is being looked into,” she said.Varun had told police earlier that since thallium is tasteless, he had mixed it with water and poured it over the fish that he had cooked for dinner. To save his four-year-old twins, he gave them milk to drink right before dinner, so that the family members did not serve them the fish. He made a religious excuse and did not eat the fish himself.The police also recovered thallium from his GK-1 house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-whose-husband-poisoned-her-with-thallium-dies-after-a-month-in-coma-101617993675525.html
10-04-2021||Other||Snatchers held for robbing lawyer using monkeys||New Delhi:Over a month after an advocate was robbed of ₹6,000, allegedly by three men who threatened him with trained monkeys, police arrested two men for the crime from Chirag Dilli on Thursday and are on the lookout for a third suspect. While only one such case has come to light so far, police suspect the accused used the same modus operandi to target others.According to police, the accused -- identified as Balwan Nath (26) and Salin Nath (23), who originally belonged to a community of snake charmers -- played drums at weddings and other events before the pandemic curbs affected their livelihoods. Subsequently, to make money, the accused allegedly caught monkeys from forested areas in south Delhi and started using them to seek donations on the road.On March 2, police said, the accused surrounded the lawyer, who was travelling in an autorickshaw in Malviya Nagar, and demaned money from him after setting their trained monkeys on him. “When the lawyer pulled out his wallet, which contained ₹6,000, to pay them off, the accused snatched it and fled,” said an officer.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the Malviya Nagar police received a call from the advocate, following which a police team rushed to the spot. The victim was on his way to the Saket court when the accused targeted him.Police scanned CCTV cameras from the area and also tapped their human intelligence network.On Thursday, the investigating team received information that the suspects were present at Chirag Dilli bus stop with the monkeys, following which a team caught the two suspects and their monkeys, said the DCP.In addition to robbery, the accused have also been charged for cruelty to animals and using them for a crime as well as livelihood. While the two have been sent to jail, the monkeys were handed over to the wildlife department.“We also booked them under the Wildlife Protection Act for showing cruelty to the animals. The monkeys were deposited at the wildlife SOS centre. Raids are on to nab the third suspect, Ajay,” added DCP Thakur.Meanwhile, police suspect they may be involved in other cases as well. “Although the arrested duo claimed that the Malviya Nagar’s robbery was the only crime they had committed, we have reasons to believe that they may have used the monkeys for committing similar crimes. There are possibilities that the victims may not have filed complaints,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/snatchers-held-for-robbing-lawyer-using-monkeys-101617993674935.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Traffic mayhem as commuters look to get home before night curfew||Roads around Delhi’s borders were packed with vehicles on Friday evening as commuters tried to cross over to Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram before the night curfew kicked in at 10pm. Delhi traffic police officials said checkpoints in the city and at its border points had a knock-on effect and slowed movement down in several parts of Delhi, leading to serpentine snarls.A senior Delhi traffic police official said that though the curfew starts at 10 pm, many stretches and crossings in the city have seen snarls since the evening, with many residents looking to return home well before the restrictions, with the Capital, Noida, and Ghaziabad all under a curfew between 10pm and 5am. Gurugram, meanwhile, has banned the entry of private vehicles into the city after 10pm.“Till 7pm, we had already received 43 calls from commuters reporting the long wait at the borders. In order to be able to cross the borders before time, many vehicles swarmed the borders from around 6pm, which has led to the chaos at the borders. The traffic situation was under control till Wednesday, but Noida and Ghaziabad also imposed night curfews on Thursday and the checkpoints at borders are causing traffic jams in the Delhi side,” the traffic official said.He added, “There is a lot of confusion and fear among people about the guidelines of the night curfew in different states and this panic was seen on the roads.”The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday imposed the night curfew in the Capital till April 30, restricting all movement, except for people involved in essential services, in cases of medical emergency, for Covid-19 vaccinations, and for travel to and from the airport, railway stations, and bus terminals.Delhi traffic police control room recordings show that on Friday long traffic snarls were witnessed around Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway, Noida Link Road, Chilla Border, Kalindi Kunj bridge, Anand Vihar, Ghazipur border, Vikas Marg, Dhaula Kuan, Rao Tula Ram Marg, Airport Road, Dwarka Road, Ashram intersection, Jasola Vihar and Delhi-Gurugram Expressway.Traffic officials said that jams are expected to intensify as more barricades will be placed across the city to check vehicles after the 10pm deadline.Love Kumar, additional commissioner (law and order), Noida, said all vehicles entering the UP city are being stopped at the borders and drivers are being asked the reason for their movement.“After 10pm, all drivers will have to state the reason for travelling during the curfew hours. We are allowing them to enter Noida only if we find their reason for commute to be satisfactory. Many people were not aware of the night curfew yesterday (Thursday) but from today (Friday) the restrictions will be imposed more strictly,” said Kumar.Commuters, however, said that the administrations seemed unprepared to handle the curfew, which was causing these long traffic jams.Rohan Kataria, who travels from Noida to Delhi for work, said that his shift gets over by 10pm. On Thursday, the transit from Noida to Delhi was smooth, but his colleagues have warned him of heavy barricading and checking on Friday.“Everyone does not have a 9-5 job where they can get free from work and be home before 10pm. If the administration is planning such restrictions then people like us should be given some consideration. The system should be better prepared to manage such curfews, so that people are not inconvenienced,” said Kataria.Many commuters also narrate their woes after getting caught in the traffic on Friday.Shiv Raj Kathal, a Twitter user, tweeted at 7.10pm, “Stuck near Hauz Khas for the last 2hrs, crossed two barricades even though the curfew has not even started. Traffic is inching at snail’s pace (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traffic-mayhem-as-commuters-look-to-get-home-before-night-curfew-101617993616177.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||8,521 new infections: Second highest Covid-19 case spike in Delhi||The Capital on Friday reported 8,521 new Covid-19 cases, the second-highest single-day spike in infections recorded in the city ever, as the infection continued to swell at rates not seen at any point during the previous three waves in Delhi.Delhi’s record case-spike was on November 11 last year, when it added 8,593 infections.Friday’s surge came on the back of record Covid-19 testing in the city, with 109,398 samples collected, more than the previous high logged on April 6, when 103,453 people were tested. Less than 65% of Friday’s samples used the RT-PCR method, regarded as the gold-standard of Covid-19 diagnosis. The Centre has urged states to ensure that at least 70% of all tests conducted use the RT-PCR technique.While the test positivity rate fell to 7.79% on Friday from 8.10% the previous day, this is still higher than the 5% threshold that experts recommend, before an infection can be considered under control in a region.The test positivity rate has been on the up consistently in the city during the current surge of infections, rising from an all-time low of 0.17% on February 16.Delhi had kept the positivity rate below 5% for 124 days, between December 2 and April 4.The state government’s health bulletin also reported 39 deaths due to the viral infection on Friday, the most in a day since 41 fatalities were recorded on December 15.The last time Delhi saw as many cases was at the peak of the third and worst surge of cases in November.Also Read| DDMA discusses increasing Covid beds, capping passengers in buses but no lockdown yetThe number of new cases recorded each day increased from 4,000 to 8,000 within six days during the current wave. In comparison, it took 20 days from the end of October end to reach 8,000 in mid-November.“The pace of increase in the infections is certainly very fast this time. But, there are a lot of unknowns, including why the cases went down sharply after the November surge. I think it was because of the high sero-prevalence of 56% that reduced transmission. Then came the laxity. Everybody thought Covid-19 was over. People started mixing, partying, and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).He said the night curfew, in place between 10pm and 5am, was not enough to curtail the spread, even though it helped reduce the number of parties and late-night gatherings. “We need to increase restrictions in places such as restaurants. We should learn from the world. A study from Columbia district of Washington showed that the number of cases went down when they reduced these social interactions and shot up again as soon as restaurants were opened up,” he said.Dr Khilnani added that disease was not milder. “The number of deaths is likely to increase sharply as well because people fall sick and die a few days after getting the infection,” he said. The current seven day rolling average case fatality ratio is at 0.39%.The number of hospital admissions is also fast increasing, with the Delhi government having to order increases in bed capacity thrice within seven days. The number of hospitalisations has increased from over 2,700 to over 4,700 in the last six days. As on Friday night, 5,112 were hospitalised, occupying 47% of the 10,832 beds earmarked for Covid-19 treatment, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app.Test positivity rate 1.28% at transit points: GovtBetween March 23 and April 7, the city administration tested 94,828 passengers arriving in the city at various transit points, of which 1,221 (1.28%) tested positive for Covid-19, showed government data.At the New Delhi railway station, 4,729 samples were collected during this period, of which 113 (2.38%) tested positive. At the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi cantonment railway station and Dhaula Kuan bus stand, a total of 13,821 tests were conducted, of which 197 (1.42%) passengers had the infection.At Kashmere Gate ISBT, 361 (1.40%) of the 25,749 tests came positive. At Anand Vihar, which has a metro station, an ISBT and a railway station, 358 (1.29%) of the 27,736 tests came positive.At the Kapashera-Delhi-Gurugram border, five people tested positive after 1,585 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/second-highest-one-day-covid-spike-in-delhi-ever-101617993615540.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Man moves court over privacy breach by doctor||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought working status of mental health boards in the city after a man said there is no authority to consider his complain against a psychiatrist, who told her mother about his homosexuality in breach of his privacy and confidentiality.Justice Prathiba M Singh asked the State Mental Health Authority (SMHA), represented by advocate Tushar Sannu, to file status reports on the current functioning of the Mental Health Review Board (MHRB), SMHA and its members, on the plea by a 19-year-old man who was taking treatment from a psychiatrist after being diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in 2016.The petitioner, a student of BA (Hons) in Psychology at Delhi University, was taking treatment from a doctor at a private hospital from June 15, 2019, and alleged that the latter compromised his privacy.During the course of his session with the doctor on that day, where he was present on his own, he claimed that he informed her that he was exploring his sexual orientation. He said that he categorically told the doctor that he was fearful of his parent’s reaction and the consequences if he told them about it.Following this, on June 29, 2019, he was referred to a clinical psychologist for cognitive behavioural therapy. While starting weekly sessions with the clinical psychologist, he would periodically discuss his progress with the psychiatrist.In July 2019, the man turned a major and the plea contended that the doctor never insisted him to bring his parent prior to this. During a session on August 3, 2019, when the man was accompanied by his mother, the doctor had a private conversation with his mother, the details of which were not divulged to him.During the subsequent session on September 14, 2019, the doctor allegedly informed him that based on her conversation with his mother; she also believed that his parent would not accept a non-normative sexual orientation. In June 2020, while the man was again accompanied with his mother, the doctor reportedly had a lengthy private conversation with his mother once again.On June 25, 2020, the man reportedly got to know that the doctor revealed his sexual orientation to his mother. The plea claimed that during the course of the conversation between the man’s mother and the doctor on June 20, 2020, his mother made a specific enquiry regarding his sexual orientation and the doctor divulged the details that had been confidentially communicated to her by the petitioner, despite knowing that he did not want to tell his parent about the same.The plea said that the man was still exploring his sexuality, and had informed the doctor in complete confidence about this. Anticipating his parent’s likely adverse reaction, the plea further pointed out that the man needed sufficient time before he could talk about his sexuality with them.“The process of coming out, that is, of informing others about one’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or both, which may include one’s family, friends and colleagues, is a deeply personal experience with profound implications on an individual’s life and safety. A person’s sexual orientation and gender identity are intimate aspects of their life and the decision to discuss this with others rests entirely with that person alone….,” the plea read.On Friday, advocate Mihir Samson, appearing for the petitioner, told the court that he had written to the private hospital to take action against the erring doctor, though the request was not entertained. He said that he wanted to complain to the MHRB, since it has been the authority of the second instance.However, due to the failure of the Delhi government to implement the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, the state authority set up under the repealed Mental Health Act, 1987, continues to operate as the SMHA for Delhi under the 2017 Act, as well as the MHRB which is entirely contrary to the scheme of the Act, he submitted.While the Delhi government, represented by advocate Devesh Singh sought time to seek instructions, Sannu, appearing for the SMHA, disputed the submission of the petitioner. He said that both the authorities are working even though there is a temporary arrangement in place.He said that retired district and sessions judge Subash Goel was currently presiding over the MHRB, adding that action will be taken against the doctor if a complaint is filed with the doctor.Following this, the court asked him to file status reports and posted the matter for hearing on July 22||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/privacy-breach-by-doctor-hc-seeks-status-of-mental-health-boards-for-legal-recourse-101617993615041.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||DDMA discusses increasing Covid beds, capping passengers in buses but no lockdown yet||New Delhi: Members of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday discussed strategies such as increasing Covid-19 beds in city hospitals by at least 6,000, shutting schools, capping the number of passengers in state-run buses and regulating weekly markets to contain the sharp increase in the cases of the infection even as all members were unanimous that a lockdown was not feasible.Measures such as ensuring adequate contact tracing, maintaining the current testing numbers and increasing enforcement against gatherings in the light of upcoming festivities such as Navratras and the Muslim fasting month of Ramzan were also discussed during an authority meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and attended by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and senior administration officials.Soon after a meeting of the authority concluded, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is the vice-chairperson of DDMA, announced closure of all schools in the city. “Due to increasing cases of Covid-19, all schools, government and private, in Delhi are being closed for all classes till further orders,” he tweeted.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairperson of DDMA, directed health officials to augment bed strength further up to the number of Covid-19 beds that Delhi had during the third wave of the disease in November.“On November 11, 2020, when Delhi recorded 8,593 cases, we had 16,500 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in government and private hospitals. The L-G and the expert panel on Friday suggested that the number of Covid-19 beds be matched to that at least,” said a senior official who attended the meeting on condition of anonymity.There have been suggestions to revive the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Covid hospital in Delhi Cantonment area, which was managed by the DRDO, officials aware of the matter said. The hospital can provide 1,000 Covid beds. The facility had shut operations on February 12 this year on the directions of the Union ministry of home affairs as Covid cases had declined.On Friday, Delhi recorded 8,521 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths, according to the state government bulletin. It also showed that as on Friday, 5,097 Covid beds were occupied against a total of 10,832 beds. As per the Delhi corona app, 427 ICU beds with ventilators out of 1,156 were available and 711 ICU beds without ventilators of total 1,770 were vacant on Friday.On Thursday, the Delhi government directed 115 private hospitals with a bed capacity of at least 50, to reserve either half of the ICU and ward beds or 1.25 times the number of beds occupied by Covid patients at present, whichever is higher. The bed capacity in the government-run Lok Nayak Hospital and GTB Hospitals has been increased 500 each.A second senior official who attended the DDMA meeting said the members also discussed if the number of passengers in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses should once again be capped (up to 50% capacity). Currently, all seats in the state-run buses are allowed to be occupied, but passengers are not allowed to stand while travelling. The Delhi Metro is already operating at half of its strength so no changes were suggested in that regard, the official said.After the DDMA meeting, the L-G said that he told all the district administrations to ensure optimum utilisation of existing Covid care centres, apart from ensuring enhanced capacity and dedicated resources in hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients.“After detailed deliberations with experts, in view of the recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behavior was emphasised, particularly in market places, public transport, workplaces etc, especially in wake of the upcoming festivals,” Baijal said in a tweet.Officials said the focus will continue to be on preventing any form of gatherings which are likely to happen in the light of the upcoming Navratra and the Muslim fasting month of Ramzan and other festivals.“Officials were advised to further strengthen the implementation of testing, tracing and treatment strategies with focus on micro-containment zones and geographical areas with high incidence of Covid-19 cases. The health department has been advised to scale up vaccination efforts so as to enhance coverage…” read another tweet by the L-G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ddma-discusses-increasing-covid-beds-capping-passengers-in-buses-but-no-lockdown-yet-101617993555511.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Covid: JNU, Jamia, DU issue guidelines for students, suspend all offline academic activities on campus||New Delhi: Higher educational institutions in Delhi, including Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia, and Ambedkar University have issued guidelines for students to observe all Covid-19 protocols on campus and suspended all offline activities till further orders in the light of a sharp spike in the Covid-19 cases in the city.Calling for necessary enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines on campus, JNU registrar Anirban Chakraborti on Friday said in a statement that since the phase-wise reopening initiated by the university in November last year, over 281 Covid-19 cases have been reported from the campus.Currently, there are 27 active cases, of which 24 are students. There have been five deaths including staff, he said.“Wearing face mask is mandatory in public places, including streets, health centre, school buildings library, offices, markets and located on the campus. The security personnel are authorised to take photographs, if anyone is not wearing the face mask. Appropriate disciplinary action including fine will be imposed in this regard,” Chakraborti said, adding that visitors’ entry will be restricted to only through the north gate of the campus.Ambedkar University also issued a circular on Friday, cancelling all offline classes on its campus until further notice. Until Friday, final-year students were allowed to physically attend classes on campus. “Offline classes shall be suspended in all campuses of the University till further notice. All classes will be held online as per prior schedule,” registrar Nitin Malik said in a notice on Friday.Meanwhile, Jamia Millia Islamia has constituted a vaccination camp committee to organise Covid-19 vaccination camps for teaching and non-teaching employees of the university. The decision to constitute the committee was taken in the meeting between university officials and deans of faculties on April 7.“The committee shall decide the venue of the camp and its duration as early as possible. All the permanent teaching and non-teaching employees of the age of 45 years and above shall be vaccinated in the vaccination camp in the first phase. In the second phase, the dependents of the permanent staff members and family pensioners eligible under medical reimbursement scheme will be vaccinated. The cost of the vaccination will be reimbursed by the university as per rules,” the university said in a statement.On Thursday, the university advised students to stay at home and “avoid physical presence for their academic work, library, laboratory, etc. unless it is very essential”. The varsity also suspended booking of conference halls, auditorium, and seminar halls till further notice.Delhi University last week issued guidelines asking students to stay at home or hostel and avoid going to the campus for academic work unless it was unavoidable. The university said it will review the situation in 10 days. The circular came shortly after at least 13 students and two staff members of St. Stephen’s College tested positive for Covid on April 1, following a college trip in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnu-jamia-du-issue-guidelines-for-students-suspend-all-offline-academic-activities-on-campus-101617993554992.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Surge hits health staff: 20 AIIMS docs, six MBBS students test Covid-positive||At least 20 doctors and six MBBS students tested positive for Covid-19 in the last ten days at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Most of them were not vaccinated against the viral infection, said hospital authorities aware of the matter.According to the officials at the hospital administration, among the 20 doctors who have tested positive for the viral infection are two faculty members, each of who had received the Covid-19 vaccine.A senior administrator from the hospital said the number of health care workers infected could be as high as 50 in the last one week. “There are at least three faculty members who have tested positive for the infection. Each day, we have eight to twelve people (from among the staff) who are being diagnosed with the infection. The number of cases had gone down to zero to one each day when very few cases were being reported from across the city,” said the administrator.So far, 65% of the hospital staff have received at least one jab of the vaccine. “A majority of them have taken their second shot as well,” said the administrator. The window period for getting the second shot of Covishield has been increased to up to eight weeks. However, for Covaxin, the window period is between four and six weeks.On Friday, the hospital further curtailed the number of patients at its outpatient clinics, day care, and non-emergency cancer surgeries. The hospital has already stopped walk-ins in outpatient departments (OPDs) and stopped all routine surgeries Friday onwards.At the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital, 11 staff members-- four doctors, five nurses and two sanitation workers-- have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last three days. None of them were working in the Covid-19 ward.“We haven’t analysed whether they have received the vaccine. It is likely that they have received the jabs as most of our staff have been inoculated,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital administration.In another incident, 250 medical students from Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) were asked to get themselves tested for Covid-19 after the patient examined by those in the ENT department for their practical exam tested positive later. At least one senior resident doctor tested positive after the incident, according to the doctors at the medical college.“We have again stopped physical classes, lectures will resume online from tomorrow (Saturday). We have also created a facility for students to get tested at the college,” said Dr Ritu Arora, dean of MAMC.These developments came on a day when chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Dr DS Rana after 37 of their doctors tested positive for Covid-19. Most of the doctors were fully immunised. Of the 37 doctors, 32 are in home isolation with the five others with comorbidities are taking treatment in the hospital.“Our doctors have been at the forefront in fighting Covid-19. I pray for a swift recovery of all the doctors who have tested positive. The hospital can reach out to the Delhi government at any point, if and when required, and we will provide them all possible help,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/20-doctors-6-mbbs-students-test-covid-positive-101617993495301.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Porta cabins sought for the homeless Delhi||With night curfew in place in Delhi till April 30, civil society members want the Delhi government to put up porta (portable) cabins or make arrangements for homeless people in the city.The Delhi government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which runs shelter homes in the city, recently removed the temporary shelters it had put up during winter.Activists and civil society members said with the imposition of the night curfew, a large number of people’s livelihood has been impacted as many are daily wagers working as labourers or loaders in various markets in Delhi.Indu Prakash, member of the Supreme Court appointed monitoring committee on shelter homes, said, “These people are sleeping out in the open. I have suggested to Dusib to put up porta cabins to provide shelter to the homeless people. With their livelihood affected, they are finding it difficult to arrange food. I have asked Dusib to tell us about their plan.”Last year, Dusib, which has over 210 shelter homes in the city, had put up 120 additional temporary shelters to accommodate people during winter. Officials from Dusib said the NGOs that were running the temporary shelters were also providing food to people free of cost.“We had put up more tents last year compared to the previous years to ensure social distancing in the temporary shelters amid the outbreak of Covid-19. We have removed the tents now as winter is over,” said Dusib officials.A senior Dusib official said, “We have space at some of our shelters where the homeless can be accommodated only if they are willing to go. They will be provided food also at these shelters.”As per the data available on the Dusib’s website, as on April 8, 5,108 people put up in 205 shelter homes, which collectively can accommodate upto 9,086 people, at night.Dusib officials said the 205 shelter homes can accommodate over 18,000 people, but due to the Covid-19 oubreak, the collectively capacity of the shelter homes has been reduced to a little over 7,000.Bipin Rai, member of Dusib, said, “We are planning to set up temporary shelters (for homeless people). We will take up this matter in the board meeting on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/porta-cabins-sought-for-the-homeless-in-city-101617993435727.html
10-04-2021||Other||April 17 inauguration of revamped Chandni Chowk stretch cancelled||New Delhi: The scheduled inauguration of the first phase of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on April 17 has been cancelled, an order issued by the PWD minister’s office to the engineer-in-chief on Friday stated. While the government is yet to officially share the reason behind the cancellation, officials familiar with the matter said the decision was taken in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases that the state has been witnessing in the past few days. A senior official in the chief minister’s office confirmed that the inauguration was cancelled owing to the raging pandemic . “Yes, the programme has been cancelled because of the rising Covid-19 cases in the city. The chief minister’s focus is on the Covid-19 management now and also it is not appropriate to organise events when the positivity rate is on a rise. It will also give a message that people should not organise events or gatherings ,” said the official on condition of anonymity. Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said that work on the site will continue as before. “Work on the site is continuing, but there has been an impact due to the night curfew. We are no longer able to carry out work at night due to the restrictions,” said Panigrahi. As part of the much-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, a 1.3-km stretch of the main road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque has been completely pedestrianised. While the redevelopment project was proposed in 2006, work on the project finally started in December 2018, following the directions and monitoring of the Delhi high court. The project envisages complete makeover of Chandni Chowk and aims at reviving the lost glory of Shahjahanabad, which was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Chandni Chowk is one of the most congested parts of the Capital and the redevelopment plan also aims at streamlining the movement of pedestrians, non-motorised vehicles and automobiles. The initial deadline for the project was fixed for March 2020, but it was revised to March 2021 due to several delaying factors, including majorly the Covid pandemic and the legal issues in removing encroachments, including some religious structures. Around ₹99 crore has been spent on the project till now. In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables and other networks were taken underground, and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed. Facilities such as toilets, ATMs, and benches for visitors have been provided in the redeveloped space. SRDC will work towards improving the façade of the heritage market in the second phase.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that the project had faced delays in the past as well and while there was no clarity on the reason behinds the cancellation, a significant amount work of was yet to be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/april-17-inauguration-of-revamped-chandni-chowk-stretch-cancelled-101617993434970.html
10-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Restaurant owners say sales down by almost 70% since night curfew||A number of restaurant owners across the city said that their sales had dipped by nearly 70%, ever since the a night curfew was imposed from Tuesday onward to curb the spread of Covid-19.Restaurateurs said that while the industry was already reeling from the after effects of last year’s nationwide lockdown, the latest night curfew had further hurt their interests. They said that the curfew timings requires them to wrap up services by 9pm — a crucial period for sales.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday had ordered a night curfew from 10pm to 5am till April 30 in the back drop of rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that the seven-hour-long curfew was imposed in the capital as people were found organising parties and other events where Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, were often ignored.Delhi on Friday added 8,521 fresh cases at the back of 109,398 tests being conducted. The positivity rate of the city — proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — hovered around the 7.79% mark.Delhi’s positivty rate has increased from 0.17% to over 8% within a month. Last month, the daily positivity rate hovered around the 0.17% mark. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the positivity rate, for a region with a comprehensive testing programme, should be at or below 5% for two weeks in order to consider a viral outbreak to be under control.Saurabh Suman, manager of Pebble Street in New Friends Colony (NFC), said that the restaurant’s sales had declined by 60-70% since the imposition of restrictions. Suman said that while the restaurant used to close around 11pm on normal days, the timing has been moved up to 9pm in view of the fresh restrictions. “People are not stepping out on account of fear. The footfall in the NFC market is also low. Earlier, we used to see huge crowds. Nowadays, we barely see 50-100 people come here,” said Suman. He said that while the restaurant had seen some improvements in terms of business in the first three months of the year, business was starting to nose-dive once again. “Things had started looking up since January. We did well last month as well. However, since the new restrictions were imposed, we are again losing a lot of business. The market is looking dull and our staff is scared about losing their jobs,” said Suman.He said that while the government was taking all necessary steps for the safety of residents, it could make some concessions for restaurants that deliver food. “We are doing home-delivery till 11pm, so restaurants should be allowed to open till then at least,” said Suman.Ramesh Kitchloo, founder of Samavar restaurant in Pamposh enclave, said that sales had declined by 70%. “Earlier, our sales would be around ₹80,000- ₹90,000 but now sales are around ₹20,000- ₹30,000 only. In normal days, people from far-flung places would visit our restaurant. Now, the footfall is less. Most people visit us during the day and opt for take-out,” said Kitchloo. He echoed that the curfew imposed by the Delhi government had exacerbated the financial crisis for restaurateurs. “The restrictions have ruined our prospects. This time, the impact is harder and much more severe. People had started holding marriage and engagement functions but all that has stopped now,” said Kitchloo.SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant, Regal Building, said that sales had reduced by 50% since the imposition of fresh restrictions. “From August to November last year, we saw around 30-40% of sales as compared to pre-Covid times. Then our sales had slowly crawled up to the 60% mark between December-February. The sales have reduced again and are back to the 30-40% mark,” said Kaushal. He said that the restaurant was not taking orders beyond 9pm to ensure compliance with curfew timings. “We take the last order at 9pm so that we are able to vacate the premises by 9:30. The staff has to reach home before 10pm as well. The timings are causing problems,” said Kaushal.In a statement issued by the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on Wednesday, Kabir Suri, vice-president, NRAI, said that it was highly unlikely that the restaurant sector would be able to sustain the pressure any longer. “We were shut for the most part of last year. We have been operating at 50% since and have restricted hours. We had just started seeing a little surge in consumption, which had helped us in hiring back people we had let gone off earlier. Now, we have been left in a lurch again,” stated Suri, adding that the curfew timings affect the delivery business that contributes to the major proportion of revenue in their business.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said that in the current situation, it was necessary to curtail unnecessary movement to stop the transmission of infection. “The issue is that we need to stop movement to contain the infection. Light-night parties and outings need to be stopped especially when people are not abiding by Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. These restrictions have become unavoidable in the prevailing situation,” said Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/restaurant-owners-says-sales-down-by-almost-70-since-night-curfew-101617993374940.html
10-04-2021||Pune||MPSC exam postponement evokes mixed response from students in Pune||Following a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the group B preliminary combined examination of the Maharashtra Public service Commission (MPSC) scheduled on April 11 is postponed by the state government. The decision was taken following record spike in Covid cases in the state. A new date of the examination will be declared soon, according to the state government officials. Meanwhile, many candidates have tested positive and unable to appear for the exams. While many students and unions have welcomed the postponement of exams considering the safety of students, some students have criticised the move. “It is a welcome decision taken by the state government and looking at the hike of Covid cases across the state it was necessary to postpone the exams. Last week one of the students who had tested positive died during treatment. And many students are still positive and cannot appear for the exams. It is a relief not only for students, but also to their parents.” said Sharmila Yeole, a student. Last month, when on similar grounds MPSC had postponed the preliminary examination, protests were carried by students across the stats. Hundreds of students had hit the streets in Pune in protest, after which the chief minister had to interfere and declare the next date for the exams. While opposing the decision, Kuldeep Ambekar, a student and president of Students Helping Hand organisation said, “The decision taken today by the state government is wrong as it is going to impact adversely on students. As majority of students come to Pune from rural areas, now their daily rent, food mess and other expenses will also increase till the next date of examination. It is true that some of the students have tested positive, but postponing the exam is not the solution and the government should have given some other option to the candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mpsc-exam-postponement-evokes-mix-response-from-students-in-pune-101617981552674.html
10-04-2021||Pune||FIR against 33 traders, including Fatehchand Ranka, for protesting on Laxmi road||Following protests by shop owners, Pune police have booked 33 traders including Fatechand Ranka, president, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The FIR was lodged at Vishrambaug police station late on Thursday under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005, based on a complaint made by police constable Ganesh Turke. Earlier on Thursday, traders and shop owners took to the streets to protest against the new Covid restrictions imposed by the state government to keep non-essential shops closed until April 30. While the traders vowed to open shops on Friday, they later postponed the decision until Monday, said Ranka. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on the other hand has formed teams to act against shopkeepers trying to reopen their establishments. “We have already asked shopkeepers to follow government directions given the seriousness of the situation. If there are any violations, we will act against shopkeepers based on the orders from the state government,” said PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. Earlier on Wednesday, during a meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, traders were assured of a solution. The traders said they hope Thackeray will consider their demand and withdraw the lockdown. Members from at least 50 traders’ associations from across the district participated in the protest on Laxmi road. They were seen standing outside shops holding banners starting from Quarter Gate chowk to Vasant Talkies chowk. “We have written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday and conveyed our demand to allow us to reopen non-essential shops. We are ready to follow all protocols, so why this compulsion of closing non-essential shops just before the festive season,” said Ranka. “We held a protest today on Laxmi road and tomorrow (April 9) we will reopen non-essential shops at 10.30 am across Pune,” he said. Darshan Rawal, secretary, United Hospitality association, said, “The newly imposed restrictions are equal to a complete lockdown for us. The decision by the government is affecting lakhs of people.” Rahul Yemul, owner, Peshwai Creations, said, “Though our shop is closed, our daily expenses have increased. We have to pay for the salaries of our staff, electricity bills and shop maintenance. We will take all safety measures, but lockdown is not the solution.” Jetharam Tak, one of the workers at a cloth shop, said, “I am completely dependent on this job to earn for my family. All our savings have been used up in the last year due to the lockdown. Common public is suffering due to the pandemic; the government should not burden us more.” Meanwhile, the hospitality associations organised silent protests, under the aegis of the United Hospitality Forum of Maharashtra, against the recent lockdown order. The campaign #MissionRoziRoti has gained momentum on social media with restaurateurs and hoteliers posting pictures, messages, and videos showing support and solidarity to the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fir-against-33-traders-including-fatehchand-ranka-for-protesting-on-laxmi-road-101617980292377.html

Every inch of the lake is currently covered with hyacinth, and environmentalists and ornithologists claim the bird count at the lake has dropped below 50 per cent. “There have been numerous news stories on the condition of Pashan lake and issues here. However, no real action has been taken. When the project of beautification of Pashan lake was implemented under the JNNURM scheme, all the microhabitats were destroyed by the project. The bird count has gone down below 50 per cent since its glory days in the 1980s. What you see today are only resident birds like Indian Pond Heron, Purple Moorhen and a few egrets. In the peak of winter too there was almost no presence of Wagtails this year, which were once very common at the lake,” said Dharmaraj Patil, ornithologist, head, environment division, Raintree Foundation. Patil further added that there is a serious need for all types of auditing of the beautification project.“The lake restoration plan has also been given to PMC, but no action has been taken as of yet. Water hyacinth is just a tip of the iceberg. The natural system is at a collapse and we have to revert the actions taken in the name of beautifying the lake,” he added. Shreedhar Yeolekar, executive engineer, PMC’s drainage department, said, “The drainage department received an order to work on the removal of water hyacinth last week and since then we have teams on site working. Usually, the water hyacinth is removed by December. We use a spider machine and 10 to 12 nets of 100 sq metres each, which are used to remove the hyacinth. It is a slow process.” Shrikant Gabale, a geotagger who is tagging lakes and rivers said, “Pashan lake is an important element of the green belt, which is under a lot of duress, with concrete buildings and other elements creating hurdles for this lake. Though this lake was man-made, it has a small natural island as its key component which should be protected at all costs. The concretisation and building of gardens, people’s movement and dumping of garbage are adding a threat to its ecosystem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/water-hyacinth-at-pashan-lake-poses-a-threat-to-natural-ecosystem-101617980232505.html

Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner sent the notice and asked the hospitals to reply within 48 hours. Residents have complained about Aditya Birla Hospital, Lokmanya Hospital and DY Patil Hospital selling the Remdesivir injection at higher rates. Since the last few days Remdesivir has been in great demand with cases rising in Pune and PCMC. “In the current crisis situation, people are already suffering due to a shortage of Remedesivir drugs and it should not be sold at higher costs,” said Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner. In January, the demand for Remdesivir was 700 vials everyday but it has increased 20 times since the past week. The drug should be given to only those patients whose blood oxygen level is below 93 to 92 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmc-serves-notices-to-three-private-hospitals-101617979872412.html
10-04-2021||Pune||Students unable to pay fees sent transfer certificates by post||Students who have been unable to pay the previous academic year’s fees in full, are receiving transfer certificates (TC) from city-based private schools by post. Parents also allege that schools are not giving admission to these students for the next academic year. Imran Khan, a parent who has two children enrolled in a city-based private school said that the TC of both the students was sent by post. “My elder son is promoted to Class 10 now. We received the TC for both my children. I had given post-dated cheques to the school. However, both my students have been asked to leave,” said Khan. Khan is also a member of the parents’ association of Pune. Jayshree Deshpande, president of the parents’ association of Pune, said that there are 20 students who have lost their admissions recently. “The students have lost admission solely because the parents were not able to pay full fees. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many parents are going through financial difficulties; some of them paid partial fees. These students are an easy target for schools. Unfortunately, even authorities are mute spectators in this. Despite several complaints, the education department is moving at snail’s pace to resolve the matter,” said Deshpande. She added that students are in a lot of stress due to this situation. Rajendra Singh, president of the Federation of School Association of Maharashtra said that the schools have taken the right decision. “The schools are suffering losses and paying fees is important for the smooth functioning of the school. As the academic year has ended, parents are free to find an affordable school for their ward,” said Singh. The education department believes that students should not be given a TC for failing to pay the fees in full, it has issued an order dated April 8, instructing schools to immediately start the online education of students who have been issued a forced TC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-unable-to-pay-fees-sent-transfer-certificates-by-post-101617979752422.html

10-04-2021||Chandigarh||12,000 bags of wheat smuggled from Bihar seized in Bathinda||Bathinda: The Bathinda district authorities confiscated more than 25,000 bags of wheat, weighing 50kg each, being transported illegally from other states on Friday, the eve of procurement in Punjab. BJP leaders Sukhpal Sra and Sandeep Aggarwal noticed the unauthorised movement of wheat at the local mandi (grain market) and reported the matter to the police late on Thursday night. “We alerted the police but did not get much assistance. There were 35 trucks in the mandi with most bearing Punjab registration numbers. Only three trucks were impounded and the rest got time to flee. This is the tip of the iceberg as illegal movement of wheat stock is impossible without the state’s political leadership’s patronage,” Sra said. Official sources said it was an attempt to smuggle wheat bought for about ₹1,100 from Bihar and other places to be sold at a higher minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,975. State mandi officials said the involvement of a commission agent (arthiya) in Bathinda has come to the fore. 9,000 bags of wheat found stacked on roadside Punjab Mandi Board deputy general manager, Ferozepur division, Kuldeep Singh Brar said the three trucks-laden with wheat were impounded from the grain market, but a stock of wheat packed in more than 9,000 gunny bags was found on the roadside. He admitted that the drivers did not have a purchase document. “Inquiries have shown that the consignment belongs to a commission agent’s firm, named Babu Ram Ashok Kumar. A police complaint has been filed and the licence of the firm will be cancelled,” he said. District mandi officer Preet Kanwar Singh Brar said another stock of more than 8,000 bags was recovered from two makeshift godowns. “Transportation and stocking wheat was illegal as the mandi office had no record in this regard,” said Brar. Kotwali station house officer Daljit Brar said a case has been registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Bathinda Arhtiya Association president Satish Kumar Babbu demanded strict action against the commission agent. “The association condemns any such illegal activity,” he said. Official sources said after Haryana brought transparency in crop procurement to much higher level under ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal, traders have started eyeing Punjab for illegal sale of foodgrains. “Probably it is for the first time that Punjab is witnessing wheat arrival from other states while illegal mixing of paddy from outside the state is quite a common practice. After Haryana, Punjab is the only market, where the government agencies pay MSP for wheat and paddy and traders, see a scope to buy the produce at lower prices from other states and sell it to the government agencies in collusion with officials,” a state functionary said. BJP leaders want probe, say godowns full already BJP leaders demanded a probe into the incident, alleging godowns in the local industrial area and other places are already flooded with wheat stocks bought from other states. Activists of farmer unions gathered at the mandi to register their protest against the illegal transportation of wheat from other states. They demanded an assurance from the state government that no food grain will be allowed from other states. Senior superintendent of police BS Virk said the district administration and food and civil supplies, officials were immediately alerted to ascertain the legality of the wheat stock. 40 wheat trucks from UP impounded in RupnagarRupnagar: Forty trucks laden with wheat from Uttar Pradesh were confiscated in Rupnagar on Friday. The wheat was ordered by a Rupnagar-based private flour mill, Megastar Foods Limited. District mandi officer Bhajan Kaur said the trucks were sent back to UP. “There is no provision to take action against private firm under any Act,” she said. Following the incident, local farmers blocked the Rupnagar-Chandigarh national highway for around two hours. “A meeting was convened between officials of Megastar Foods Limited and the protesting farmers in which the owner said he was willing to donate ₹2.5 lakh for farmers protest,” she said, adding that the flour mill also submitted in writing that they will purchase wheat from Punjab mandis only.FIRs registered against 3 firms: Ashu Chandigarh: Food and Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said FIRs have been registered against three firms trying to sell wheat in state mandis brought from outside the state. He said a department team had found around 8,000 gunny bags in yard of M/s Babu Ram Ashok Kumar and Lakshmi Oil Mill in Grain Market Bhatinda. Upon further inquiry, it was found that the wheat had been procured from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan at lower prices and was to be sold at MSP here. Besides this, total of 17,000 bags have also been seized from godowns of these two firms. The minister said 8,000 to 9,000 wheat bags have also been recovered from Kishan Trading Company of Bugga Mandi in Ferozepur. He said that cases have been filed against these three firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/12000-bags-of-wheat-smuggled-from-bihar-seized-in-bathinda-101617969492128.html
