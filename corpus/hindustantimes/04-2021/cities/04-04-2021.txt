The district officials said that the system will be put in place within a week. Considering the emergence of new cases, the district administration on Sunday directed the officers to hold meetings with the groups of different stakeholders and implement the token system. “The token system will help regulate overcrowding in places like malls, restaurants, multiplexes and others. The owners at their respective establishments will also have to create a waiting area and allow a group of people inside only when the same number of people makes an exit. The tokens will also have estimated time of visit. The system will be implemented this week once we conduct meetings,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Ghaziabad has been witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. According to the state control room figures, the district reported 19, 73, 55 and 63 new cases in the first four days of April, respectively. “We have also directed that all such places must ensure adherence to Covid protocols. Outside the establishment, we have also directed for putting up a display system about number of people inside and estimated time in which those waiting outside will be able to move inside. In the waiting area, there will be strict adherence to social distancing and other protocols,” Pandey added. Likewise, the Gautam Budh Nagar district officials have also decided to act tough against such public places if they do not adhere to Covid protocols. “Our teams are visiting different sites and checking if there is adherence to Covid protocols. If we find that there is violation, strict action will be taken up against such establishments,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. No further registrations for healthcare, frontline workers The officials said that they have stepped up surveillance, testing and contact tracing activities while they have also stepped up vaccination coverage. In Ghaziabad, it is being taken up by the 93 Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), including 57 of government facilities, while in GB Nagar it is taken up with the help of 90 CVCs, including 51 government centres. The officials said that they have received directions that there will be no fresh registrations of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) on the Co-Win portal with immediate effect and they have stopped any further registrations. “The directions were issued by the Union ministry of health and it is done as many ineligible beneficiaries were getting registered at some Covid vaccination centres and getting vaccinated. The directions were issued by the ministry to different states, including Uttar Pradesh,” said an officer from the Ghaziabad health department. The directions issued by the ministry on April 3 said, “Various inputs were received from different sources that in some CVCs, some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as HCWs and FLWs and getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines.

04-04-2021||Noida||UP rolls out guidelines for containment zones, directs for strict surveillance||Ghaziabad: Amid the rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government has issued fresh guidelines for creating containment zones and directed for bringing them under tight surveillance. The guidelines said that an area within a radius of 25 metres will be a containment zone in case of emergence of single Covid-19 case while 50-metre radius area will be a containment zone in case of two or more cases and will be considered as a cluster. The new directions will be applicable for all 75 districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, and also has details about the containment guidelines for high-rises. The directions issued on Saturday night by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari said that an estimated 20 houses (in 25-metre radius area) will be contained and put under surveillance in case of emergence of a single case while 60 houses (in 50-metre area) are likely to fall under zones having more than one cases. For the high-rises, the guidelines said that in case of emergence of one Covid-19 case, the entire floor will be contained while the entire tower will be contained if multiple cases are detected. As per the previous directions in October 2020 for containment zones in high-rises, one floor was to be contained in case of one positive case and respective floors were to be sealed in case more than one floors received positive cases. The latest guidelines have also defined that the containment area will be removed from the list of containment zones if it has no new case for 14 days from the date of sample collection of the last positive patient. “As of now, the guidelines have not detailed any restriction on movement of people in and out of containment zones, but directed for strict surveillance. We will get the guidelines implemented at the earliest after meeting with our departments. Also, for public places like hotels, restaurants, gyms, clubs and others, we are considering strict regulation if they are found violating Covid protocols,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. Ghaziabad officials said that the teams will be deployed in containment zones and conduct door-to-door surveillance to find out suspected cases. “Also, we scan for people having Covid-like symptoms like cough, cold, fever, etc. All the details of such persons will be sent to the health department and there will be 100% testing of suspected cases,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. “The guidelines have stressed on surveillance and testing. For testing, we have chalked out six dedicated teams for containment zones while we have one dedicated team each for every containment zone to carry out surveillance activities,” Pandey added. The guidelines also said that sample collection of suspected cases must be taken up within 24 hours and the local administration, on the basis of recommendation of the chief medical officer, can also take up more activities of surveillance based on local conditions. In his October 2020 directions, the UP chief secretary had said that micro containment zones would be defined in case one house has one or more Covid cases. It also said that in addition to the house having Covid patient, one house each on either side will also be included in the micro containment zone where testing was directed to find out cases of infection. In case of cluster where multiple houses had positive cases, the directions said that containment area was to be extended to one house adjacent to the last affected house.Till last year before the micro containment zones came into picture, the containment zones had strict perimeter control with sealing of entry/exit points with the help of tapes or sticks. The entry of residents was also restricted expect in cases of medical emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-rolls-out-guidelines-for-containment-zones-directs-for-strict-surveillance-101617560772006.html
04-04-2021||Gurugram||Cycle tracks, footpath repairs expected to streamline traffic at Rezang La Chowk||In a move to decongest Rezang La Chowk, one of the city’s worst traffic bottlenecks, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority has constructed a 1.1-kilometre cycle track, repaired footpaths and shifted electric cables below the surface, to set up traffic signals at short notice for traffic management purposes as well as for installing streetlights, as part of its redesign plan.“The construction of cycle tracks and footpaths is completed. Work on markings, installing relevant signage is pending, which will be completed within the next 15 days. The redesign is part of GMDA’s long-term plan of providing cycling and pedestrian tracks across major intersections and junctions,” said Jitender Mittal, chief engineer, GMDA.Mittal said that the GMDA is also compacting the roundabout by a small margin and aligning its geometrics to ensure proper dispersal of traffic at all ends. “The roundabout is marginally wider at one end, due to which dispersal of traffic is not equal from all ends. We will be reducing the width of the roundabout for better traffic management,” said Mittal.Mittal said that electrical cables were placed underground to erect traffic signals. “We did not want to excavate any part of the road again and wanted to finish all utility works under a single project. Electrical cables have, thus, been placed for both streetlights and traffic signals. The streetlights are already functioning, and the traffic signals and their poles will be erected on short notice, whenever it is required as a traffic management solution,” said Mittal.The redesign was done by GMDA in collaboration with World Resources Institute (WRI) and Raahgiri Foundation.“Despite having a high number of pedestrians and cyclists accessing the junction, Rezang La Chowk did not have even a single pedestrian amenity until now. The redesign was, hence, carried out to address the issues of non-motorised transport as well as for better traffic management,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder, Raahgiri Foundation.Rezang La Chowk in Palam Vihar derives its name from a war memorial inaugurated at the junction in December 2012 to honour 114 martyrs, a large majority of them from Haryana, who died defending the high-altitude pass near Ladakh in 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cycle-tracks-footpath-repairs-expected-to-streamline-traffic-at-rezang-la-chowk-101617560172711.html
04-04-2021||Gurugram||Manesar factory owners, residents concerned over maintenance activities||Factory owners and residents of industrial areas and villages under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) expressed concern over maintenance activities, alleging that while the MCM is yet to be equipped to provide services, contracts for existing activities undertaken by other agencies ended on March 31.Industry owners on Sunday said that with fresh contracts being put on hold, the authorities must ensure that the new corporation area is not left struggling due to this confusion.Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Manesar Industrial Association, said that all tenders of HSIIDC expired on March 31, and HSIIDC has not carried out any re-tendering process as the MCM has taken over the maintenance. “The situation is tricky as the corporation is not yet ready to manage this huge area. In industrial sectors alone, 3.5 lakh (350,000) people work daily. The population in villages is also large and without services, things will go bad,” he said.However, officials of MCM and HSIIDC dismissed concerns over a dire situation and said they are working with stakeholders to ensure basic services are delivered without a hitch.Manish Sharma, commissioner, MCM, said that they held a detailed discussion with residents on Sunday and decided that existing operations in villages, residential and industrial sectors will continue. “There is no shortage of resources and workers who were providing these services are continuing to do their job, and they are being paid accordingly. In some areas, due to the change in the situation, there have been instances where the workforce has become lax, but we are going to strictly enforce monitoring. We are also evaluating the performance of agencies in different areas,” said Sharma.The HSIIDC, meanwhile, will meet factory owners on Tuesday and will propose to continue maintenance in industrial sectors. “Till the time MCM gets ready to take over maintenance, we will provide maintenance services as usual. A meeting is scheduled on Tuesday and a decision in this regard will be taken,” said Subash Vats, estate officer, IMT Manesar, adding that deploying contractors to start work won’t take more than a couple of days.The MCM includes 29 villages, 12 large industrial sectors of HSIIDC and sectors 75 to 95 along the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and Dwarka Expressway.Locals also said the tenure of the panchayats of the villages is also over and these have neither funds nor authority to carry out maintenance, cleaning or sanitation work.Factory owners said that the authorities should ensure that the public does not suffer due to lack of communication between MCM and HSIIDC. Manoj Tyagi, general secretary, IMT Industrial Association said that before operationalising the MCM, the government should have designed the structure of the civic agency and hired the staff to execute operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/manesar-factory-owners-residents-concerned-over-maintenance-activities-101617560171923.html

The MCG carried out the drive on both sides of the nine-kilometre stretch between Vatika Chowk and Kherki Daula toll on National Highway 48 (NH-48).According to the MCG officials, the violators had constructed illegal tea stalls, tobacco stalls, houses, construction material shops, among other small-time stores — mostly temporary structures — along the stretch on the MCG land and the government green belts.“Such structures were demolished with earthmovers under heavy police presence. More than 100 police officials from three police stations in sector 50, sector 65 and Badshahpur were present during the drive. However, there were no major incidents of violence or resistance by the violators. The violators were let off with a warning that FIRs will be registered, and legal action will be taken against them over future encroachments,” said Rajiv Yadav, sub-divisional officer (SDO), MCG.The MCG will execute more such drives at different parts of the city for reclaiming the civic land throughout April, Yadav added.While the MCG has executed anti-encroachment drives along Vatika Chowk, it was for the first time that the civic body carried out such a large-scale drive on the SPR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-demolishes-200-illegal-structures-along-southern-peripheral-road-101617560171316.html
04-04-2021||Gurugram||Environmentalists raise concerns over waste dumping in forest||Environmentalists and citizens alleged that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) dumped waste in forest land near Mohtabad and Pali villages in Faridabad on Saturday night, to reduce the volume of legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill ahead of a hearing in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) this week. Locals alleged that plastic and household waste under the garb of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) was dumped in the forest land, which is a crucial leopard habitat. The site also has boards stating that it was a temporary site for storing RDF. Despite several attempts, Vinay Pratap Singh, the commissioner of MCG could not be reached for comment till the filing of the copy. Officials of the forest department and the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) said that they did not allot the space to MCG for the temporary storage of RDF. Yashpal Yadav, the MCF commissioner, said, “Last month, the MCG had sought support from us for temporary storage of RDF and we had allotted a site near Pali crusher zone. But later, we learnt that a case is underway in the high court regarding the said land, so we gave orders that no more waste will be dumped there. After that, we had informed MCG that we are looking for alternative land, but no land has been approved by us so far.” Raj Kumar, divisional forest officer for Faridabad, said, “I learnt about RDF being dumped on Aravalli forest land near Pali-Mohtabad late on Saturday evening and I sent a team for inspection. The team was not able to locate the area and on Sunday, I did not get any further update. I will be checking with the authorities concerned and action will be taken accordingly.” The NGT is scheduled to hear a matter regarding the remediation of legacy waste of Bandhwari landfill on April 7. On March 9, the NGT, while hearing a case on clearing of legacy waste from Bandhwari landfill site, said that it was giving a last opportunity to authorities for ensuring meaningful action on the ground level. Environmentalists and residents said that the area where the waste was dumped is a crucial wildlife corridor, and is frequented by leopards. Sunil Harsana, a resident and wildlife researcher who visited the site on Saturday night, said, “Around 8.30pm on Saturday, I learnt that eight trucks of waste from Bandhwari landfill was being taken to the forest land for dumping. I reached the site around 11pm when I saw that solid waste, including plastic, was dumped at two to three different sites almost one kilometre inside from the main road.” “This area is a key habitat of leopards found in this landscape as it has old mining quarries where the big cat finds shelter, food and water. If waste is dumped here, then there will be regular movement of vehicles leading to disturbance,” he said. Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, said that a 2017 report by the Wildlife Institute of India had shown that the said landscape has a presence of over 30 leopards. “Since the past one month, waste is being dumped inside forest areas in different parts of Gurugram and Faridabad as the authorities have to tell the NGT that they have taken action to clear the legacy waste at Bandhwari. But this is being done without any permissions or clearances… because it is inside the forests, it goes unnoticed by most people, but that does not mean it is not harmful to the environment,” she said. The NGT, on March 9, asked the MCG to submit a future action plan that must provide for placing information about day-to-day progress on the website and to ensure processing of current waste at a different site. The court also asked the secretary of urban development/local bodies and the commissioner of MCG to be present in person or through videoconference with a report of meaningful action during the next hearing, scheduled for April 7. The Bandhwari landfill receives around 2,000 tonnes of waste every day from Gurugram and Faridabad. Municipal solid waste from both these cities is being dumped at the site since 2015. As per a report by the Central Pollution Control Board submitted to the NGT in September 2020, the height of the dumpsite increased to 36 metres from 27 metres (recorded by CPCB in February 2020) and the total waste dumped stood at 3.1 million tonnes, approximately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/environmentalists-raise-concerns-over-waste-dumping-in-forest-101617560113363.html
04-04-2021||Gurugram||Factory associations want review of job reservation law||Industrial associations and factory owners based in Manesar and Gurugram on Saturday reiterated their objections to the 75% job reservation law, slated to come into effect on May 1, as they are apprehensive about the job situation that has already been affected by the pandemic. They said that the government should make the law flexible by adopting suggestions made by industry leaders and associations.Manmohan Gaind, secretary of the Manesar Industries’ Welfare Association, said this law is regressive in letter and spirit and that their association would challenge it in the court once the rules are notified. “This is an attempt to introduce reservations in the private sector through the back door. We will oppose this law as it is regressive in character. The industries in the Gurguram-Manesar industrial belt are already suffering due to the impact of Covid-19 and this reservation will hit it further,” said Gaind. Last month, the Haryana governor green-lit the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, which provides for 75% reservation in jobs that have a salary of less than ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms, etc., based in Haryana. The quota will initially be applicable for 10 years, as per the bill. The move to reserve jobs in the private sector did not go down well with local industries, particularly small and medium enterprises, which primarily depend on migrant labour for production. “A huge amount of revenue is generated by the operation of small and medium enterprises but this law will ensure that their operations, which are dependent upon migrant labour, become unviable. There is fear among locals that the existing jobs and industry, which are somehow thriving and surviving in this industrial belt, will shift to neighbouring Rajasthan and Noida,” Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Manesar Industrial Association. Factory owners also claimed that the negatives of this law were so profound that neighbouring Punjab has started attracting investment by stating that they have no local reservation laws. “I saw an advertisement about it in which it was mentioned that there is no reservation there,” said a unit owner, requesting anonymity. Local industry leaders said that the law needs to be reviewed thoroughly and feedback needs to be incorporated to ensure that it is not misused to harass the industry. “We don’t want another era of licence permit raj in the state. The government must be flexible with the rules,” said JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association.Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Friday, while announcing that the new law job reservation law would be applicable from May 1, said that the government was not averse to making changes. “The jobs which require technical skills would be exempted from reservation. We are holding discussions with the industry and feedback would be incorporated into the rules,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/factory-associations-want-review-of-job-reservation-law-101617560114059.html
04-04-2021||Gurugram||Spot check reveals signs of mining in Aravallis||After allegations of illegal mining in Gurugram surfaced, a spot check of the Aravalli forests at Teekli village, near Sohna Road, by HT showed fresh signs of stones being mined, with tractor tracker marks dotting the route and makeshift bridges in place for vehicles.Almost two kilometres inside the forest, a large hole was noticed on one particular hill, where holes made by drilling for blasting the rock using dynamite were also visible clearly. On the ground, large stones and loose sand was spotted along the way. Anil Kumar, Gurugram’s mining officer said, “I will be sending my team to this particular location for an inspection. Our vigilance team is strong, but I am not denying that something like this might be happening illegally. Our team will inspect, check on what scale it is being done and action will be taken against those responsible.” While coming out of the area, the team also noticed two tractors without any registration number plates going inside the forests. When asked, the drivers said that they were going to a nearby village. While the tractor marks extended for almost two kilometres, the makeshift bridges were made using sacks of construction and demolition waste. Gurugram’s deputy commissioner Yash Garg also said that the administration will take action after inspecting the area. On April 2, HT had reported that a group of environmentalists claimed to have found evidence of large-scale stone mining in the Aravallis near Gurugram. Talking about the area where the makeshift bridge had been made, Prabhat Verma, an avid hiker who showed the trails to the HT team, said, “Even until one month ago, this area had not been mined and these were flatlands. But now, this temporary bridge has been made with 20-30 metre pits on both sides of the bridge where loose sand material is getting accumulated.” “These tractor tyre marks clearly indicate that the mined material is loaded on the vehicles and taken out either in dark or in early morning hours,” Verma said, adding that trees were cut to level the land. Another environmentalist who accompanied the HT team, requesting anonymity, said, “I visited this place first around six months ago in November, when this hole existed, but the roots of the trees on the edge of the wall were not exposed. Only with regular mining and loosening of the soil can the roots get exposed. Even on the opposite side, a hollow cave-like sign has developed on the rock that was not present earlier.” In 2009, the Supreme Court had banned mining in the sensitive mountain range, considered to be the oldest in the country and a rich quarry for construction stones and sand. The ruling applied to the Aravallis in Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat. In October last year, the Haryana government appealed for resuming mining in Gurugram and Faridabad, based on the 2009 order. The Aravallis are considered to be the lungs of the Delhi-NCR region and also support a rich biodiversity that includes leopards, sambhar, fox, jackals and palm civets, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/spot-check-reveals-signs-of-mining-in-aravallis-101617560112665.html

He alleged the BJP government was responsible for nearly 400 deaths in four years caused due to illicit liquor consumption in the state. He alleged illegal liquor manufacturers and smugglers were running a parallel business of over ₹10,000 crore and the government was either shying away from acting against them or doing just lip service to them in the name of initiating effective action against them. “The honourable High Court on April 12, 2017, had ordered stringent measures such as Gangster Act, life imprisonment against illegal liquor traders. But the state government had failed to check illegal liquor manufacture, trade, and deaths in the state capital and the areas and districts nearby. Liquor mafia was earning crores of rupees by smuggling illegal liquor from other states also,” the UP Congress chief said at a press conference in Lucknow. “The state has a nexus of excise department, police, and liquor mafia and in their greed for money they are distributing death,” he said. The UPCC president said the government made tall claims but so far has not able to punish even a single liquor mafia. After every tragic incident, the government makes a readymade statement that “toughest of action will be taken after investigation report come in”. “However, in reality one never gets to know about those tough actions,” he said. Giving district wise and date wise incidents of hooch tragedies in the state in four years, Lallu said that from time to time, the liquor mafia also had attacked police. Dheeraj Gurjar, the national secretary of Congress, at the press conference demanded an independent judicial probe into all the illicit liquor deaths in the state in four years and file murder cases against the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-govt-responsible-for-400-deaths-due-to-illicit-liquor-lallu-101617559871336.html

04-04-2021||Other||New permit rules:Now, tourist vehicles can ferry individual passengers too||Lucknow: The new All-India tourist permit rules that became effective from April 1 have allowed tourist vehicles to transport passengers individually also and not necessarily in a group apart from enabling them to deposit the tax online centrally rather than pay the same individually to the states concerned on the borders.The new provisions named ‘The All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021’ may, however, take some time to be fully operational in UP, like in most other states, with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) developing the requisite system.“The new all-India permits rules have been notified coming into effect from April 1 but it may take some time for the new system to be fully operational before the NIC in Delhi makes necessary changes in the software,” transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu said. The new rules, he said, had several important provisions to benefit transporters engaged in the tourism sector. The most striking feature of the new rules, according to another senior transport official, is that now any transporter with an all-India tourist permit can freely take passengers individually from different locations to different destinations. “Though the same has not been explained in as many words, its interpretation means the same,” he claimed.Till now, a transporter could ferry tourists only in a group and not individually after obtaining a contract carriage permit that would be valid for the specified routes and for the specified number of days. “But now they can get permits on an annual basis and operate on any route across the country taking passengers from and dropping at different points,” said the officials. The rules themselves define the term ‘authorisation’ granted by the transport authority to enable tourist vehicles operator/ owner to ply tourist vehicles throughout the territory of India subject to the payment of taxes or fees, if any, levied by the state or Union territory through which it plies.Defining the scope and validity of authorisation or permit, the rules clarify the first authorization/ permit “shall be valid throughout India” and second the authorization/permit “shall be used for the transport of passengers individually or in a group, along with their personal luggage”.According to the rules any transporter can submit application along with the prescribed fee for the all-India tourist permit electronically through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ website https://parivahan.gov.in/parivahan/.Liberalising the permit obtaining process the rules make it binding on the Transport Authority to issue the authorisation or permit within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of application.“If no decision is taken by the Transport Authority within thirty days of receipt of the application, the authorisation or permit shall be deemed to have been granted and generated through electronic system,” rules say.The rules also provide that permit shall not be granted to a tourist vehicle after the completion of twelve years from the date of first registration of the vehicle but in case of a diesel vehicles registered in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, permit this duration has been further curtailed to 10 years only.Also, the tourist vehicles which have been granted permit are required under these rules to prominently display the words ‘All India Tourist Permit’ on the rear left side of the vehicle in white letters in blue background along with the validity of the permit.Although the new policy’s stated objective is to promote the tourism and the transport sectors by encouraging transporters to buy and ply more tourist vehicles, the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC has its own apprehensions with regard to certain provisions.“The provision allowing tourist vehicles to transport passengers individually will finish the sanctity of nationalized routes and eat into the revenue of country’s all state transport undertakings, including the UPSRTC because now transporters can get stage carriage permits to transport tourists individually even on the nationalized routes that are otherwise reserved exclusively for STUs,” a senior UPSRTC official pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-permit-rules-now-tourist-vehicles-can-ferry-individual-passengers-too-101617558431310.html

Lucknow tested 16135 samples on April 2, 19845 on April 3 and 20620 on April 4. With increased sampling in the past one week, results might take a little time. We are working to bring down the result tim,” said Yogesh Raghuvanshi, spokesperson for the office of the chief medical officer of Lucknow. The Lucknow health department has tested the highest number of samples among all the districts in the state. Till now, over 21 lakh samples have been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/close-to-first-wave-peak-lko-reports-1129-cases-101617557771242.html

As per the proposal that is to be taken up in the meeting on Monday, the permits are to be issued to the private operators for this entire route, barring between Muzaffarnagar to Yamuna Bridge, the 70 km patch that is the nationalized one where the UPSRTC alone can get stage carriage permits to ply. “Our contention is that since the 70 km Muzaffarnagar-Yamuna Bridge patch is an intrinsic part of the same route for which the STA proposes to grant permits for private operators, it is natural that private buses will use the entire route, including the 70 km nationalized patch once they get the stage carriage permits,” said a UPSRTC employee union leader preferring anonymity. “Our hunch is that permits to private operators may be given for more similar routes in the state, especially for 26 prime routes in western UP once the move for the grant of permits for the Meerut-Yamuna Bridge route succeeds,” he said, adding “We will opposed any such bid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sta-meeting-today-may-grant-permits-to-pvt-buses-for-contentious-meerut-ambala-route-101617557531291.html

04-04-2021||Other||Not negotiating for any post with anyone, says Sidhu||Former Punjab cabinet minister and cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday said that he was not negotiating for any post with anyone. Sidhu’s statement comes amid conjecture that he may leave the Congress, as his talks with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for a return to the cabinet have remained inconclusive. “My opponents have been spreading lies that I am negotiating for returning to the state cabinet. I have never negotiated with anyone for any post in any party. Even my son left the post of assistant advocate general and my wife didn’t accept the chairmanship of a board, even as these were offered to them. I am into politics for Punjab and not for personal gains,” Sidhu told reporters on the sidelines of a press conference he held on the direct system of payment of farmers. Sidhu had quit the cabinet in June 2019 after a change in portfolio from local government to power. Since then, the Congress high command has been working for his return to the government and the party hierarchy. Efforts of successive All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries have not yielded result. Sidhu has not joined any party poll campaign since leaving the cabinet, even after being named a star campaigner. On March 18 this year, he had met the CM at his residence, where Amarinder said he had asked Sidhu to join the cabinet. Dodging questions on the functioning of the CM and the state government’s performance, Sidhu said “It’s not you or me, who have to judge the policies and the functioning of the Punjab government. It is the public, which has to pass the final judgement. The government will regain power, if its policies are good.” ‘CENTRE BLACKMAILING PUNJAB’ On Centre’s mandate of making direct payment to farmers for their produce, Sidhu claimed that the BJP was trying to divide Punjab’s farmers and the timing of the directive raised eyebrows. “Union minister Piyush Goyal is patently wrong when he says that the Punjab revenue department has complete information about land record of farmers in the state,” he said, adding that as per data collected by National Sample Survey for 2012-13, more than 24% (almost one-fourth) of land under cultivation in the state is under tenancy. These tenancy contracts are oral/unwritten in nature. “It is, therefore, not practical to implement direct payment in Punjab. If today, the sale of wheat crop is allowed only with ownership rights, over 24% of growers in the state will not receive payment,” he claimed, adding, “This amounts to economic blackmail by the Centre to force farmers and the Punjab government to withdraw their agitation against the three farm laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-negotiating-for-any-post-with-anyone-says-sidhu-101617556331966.html
04-04-2021||Pune||Covid mutants are spreading fast in Maharashtra, lockdown can contain it, says Dr Shekhar Mande, director-general CSIR||PUNE Curbs on the movement of people can help stop the spread of the virus, which has mutated into a more transmissible avatar in Maharashtra and other states of the country, said Dr Shekhar Mande, director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). His remarks came on Sunday when the Maharashtra government imposed new restrictions, including complete lockdown on weekends. Mande, while speaking to reporters in Pune via video conferencing, said one of the mutants seen in Maharashtra is a matter of concern for health authorities.“The state has seen double mutation with two variants E484Q and L452R. The E484Q mutation has been detected in Maharashtra before and L452R was found in patients in California in the United States and is most likely to have transmitted here after people travelled from the US to India,” he said.“We have asked the state government to monitor L452R mutant, which is causing concern. On this, I am in constant touch with state government,” said Mande, adding people not following rules is another reason besides mutation of virus for the rapid spread of Covid infection in Maharashtra. When asked if there is a concrete study to show lockdown do work, Mande said, “The lockdown has shown it contains the spread as people stay indoors. Even if the virus spreads, it only affects the family members and it will not spread outside. If you see the last year’s lockdown in India, the spread of the disease was quite slow in the country to compare to other countries including Italy where the explosion of Covid was witnessed.” Mande, however, said there is a need to balance between restrictions and saving the economy. “There are side effects of the lockdown too as it affects economy adversely which leads to job loss. So we need to look for the balance while imposing the lockdown. Possibilities need to be seen whether full or partial lockdown can be imposed,” he said On the effectiveness of vaccines, especially when the virus is mutating, Mande said there is little evidence that the vaccine would not work on the mutants. “There are two divergent views that have emerged in the scientific literature in last one or two months that some vaccines are acting less effective on mutants, but it has been challenged by some who say that vaccine is equally effective on mutants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-mutants-are-spreading-fast-in-maharashtra-lockdown-can-contain-it-says-dr-shekhar-mande-director-general-csir-101617555551224.html

Currently, this stretch of NH 80, running 108km, is 5.50 to 7 metres wide. However, the proposed plan will make it 10 metres wide that includes paved shoulder for extra space on traffic. This is an important route to connect eastern Bihar with Jharkhand and Bengal via Bhagalpur and Sahebganj. Additional chief secretary, road construction department (RCD), Amrit Lal Meena, who was recently in Delhi, said that the entire stretch of NH 80 from Munger to Mirzachowki will be made with concrete material to ensure its durability. “All the bridges in the way will also be renovated and strengthened. The strengthening work will not require land acquisition, as the RCD has sufficient unused patch of land on both sides,” said Meena. Officials of RCD said that the work will be executed in two sections, from Muger to Bhagalpur (50.87km) and then Bhagalpur to Mirzachowki (57.25km) at the cost of ₹477.54 crore and ₹566.15 crore respectively. The construction firms, which will rebuild the stretch, will be given the task to maintain it for ten years after completion of the project, including two years within the award of work. The RCD had prepared the detailed project report (DPR) for strengthening of the road after chief minister Nitish Kumar instructed them to go for a complete makeover of the road after he made an aerial survey in January 2019. The NH wing of RCD will execute the project, the tenders to rope in reputed construction firms will be publicised in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has floated the expression of interest from reputed firms to build a four-lane greenfield road project, parallel to NH 80, from Munger to Mirzachowki.

Bihar recorded 836 cases on April 2 that was more than double the cases reported a week back, taking the number of active cases to 2,942. The state health department had also requested the AIIMS to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients, seeing the sudden spike in cases after Holi. Owing to unavailability of beds, the AIIMS-Patna has been refusing to admit Covid-19 patients since last three days. “We are not able to accommodate any Covid-19 patients for the last three days as all our beds are full. Ninety-five beds for Covid-19 patients in our institute were occupied till yesterday. We are increasing the number of beds to 110, following the state health department’s request,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna. The AIIMS had reduced the bed count for Covid-19 patients to 40, with 20 beds each in ward and the intensive care unit (ICU), early this month. However, cases have spiked after Holi, prompting the state government to request the AIIMS to increase the same. “We are adding 10 beds to the existing 20 in the ICU for Covid-19 patients. The remaining 80 beds will be in wards. We cannot increase any further beds at this point of time because we also need to cater to non-Covid patients, who are admitted at our hospital,” added Dr Kumar. “We had gone down to only 17 Covid admissions at our institute early last month, but there has been a sudden surge in cases after Holi. People should support us by following Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing mask, social distancing and hand sanitising. We cannot afford to lower our guard,” said Dr Kumar. Meanwhile, state health minister Mangal Pandey said, “The civil surgeons have been directed to do full testing in micro-containment zones where new cases have been detected.” He said the health department was making arrangements to treat those found positive during random testing at public places, including airport, railway station and bus stands. However, passengers at airport, railway station and bus stand were still callous and not taking the government advice on following Covid appropriate behaviour seriously. Pandey said Covid-19 cases had increased in 11 states, including Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi. In Bihar, too, cases had gone up in the last 10 days and the curve was on the ascendancy. Expressing concern over the spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state, Pandey appealed to the people to not only follow Covid appropriate behaviour but also take vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/spike-in-covid-cases-patna-aiims-caps-opd-patients-to-50-per-department-a-day-101617554772338.html

04-04-2021||Pune||Students face difficulties getting daily meals due to strict restrictions||Rakesh Kulkarni and his roommates staying in a PG hostel at Sadashiv peth are facing difficulties finding a dinner meal due to the newly imposed restrictions in Pune district, followed by the statewide strict restrictions and the weekend lockdown. From Saturday, night curfew began in Pune from 6 pm and the challenges for most students like Kulkarni who have arrived in the city for studies rose. As most of them are dependent on hotels and food mess, they used to get a tiffin or have dinner at a hotel but now as the curfew starts at 6 pm, they are unable to go out and get the meals. “Yesterday when I went to my regular mess to get tiffin on Tilak road, I was stopped by one policeman and he shouted at me and told me to go back to room. We are here for studying and now our parents also fear to allow us to stay in Pune. It has been already a difficult situation for us from the last one-month, delayed exams, financial burden and now these strict restrictions,” said Kulkarni. In Pune city, there are different types of private coaching classes, right from school level boards’ classes, 10th and 12th board subject classes, entrance exams classes and competitive exams classes. As Pune is known as an educational hub in the country thousands of students from across the country and from foreign countries come to Pune. They join these classes or go to study circles for studying, stay in PG rooms or rent flats and also eat outside in hotels and mess. So, an entire financial eco-system is dependent on these private classes and study circles. Prajakta Dahiphale who stays in a rented flat in the Bharati Vidyapeeth area is caught in a similar situation. Dahiphale said, “As we are students, we are all dependent for our daily meals on either the hotels or regular mess. We do cook at home, but it is difficult to do it daily and now going out in the evening to bring tiffin is just not working out for us and we cannot afford to order online food daily and waste our money in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-face-difficulties-getting-daily-meals-due-to-strict-restrictions-101617551411157.html

Trainee doctors from the B J Medical College and Sassoon Hospital have immediately demanded the recruiting of a new team of doctors, nurses, cleaning staff and required manpower, to treat Covid patients. These doctor students want the new staff brought in immediately so that they may be released to continue their regular academics, as most are into their final year of medicine.“We are working tirelessly for the last one year, fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, but the state government knew that the second wave will come, and there is no preparedness for it. Now suddenly, when numbers are increasing, we are given extra duties and the burden of Covid, while senior doctors just come for a round and go away. Our demand is for new recruitment of doctors and other necessary staff at Sassoon immediately,” said Mard Pune president, Dr Vijay Jadhav.There are 450 such trainee doctors doing their master’s degree in different specialisations from BJ Medical College. Another doctor, Dr Dnyaneshwar Jamkar, secretary of the association, said, “Last month 50 doctors tested positive. There is a shortage of basic medical equipment, medicines and other things like the PPE kits given to us are of very poor quality. We are working round the clock by risking our lives and at the same time our education has gone for a toss. We would get the degree, but there won’t be any practical knowledge. If our demands are not listened to we are planning to go on strike soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/resident-doctors-at-sassoon-up-in-arms-against-covid-situation-101617549370952.html
04-04-2021||Bangalore||Expert predicts 6,500 Covid-19 cases daily in Bengaluru by April 20||Experts have predicted that continued negligence to maintain social distancing and following other safety protocols in Bengaluru is likely to send the rapidly evolving Covid-19 crisis into an uncontrollable spiral. “At this rate, #Bengaluru will have ~6500 daily cases by 20th April. Even if 10% of them require hospitalization, the health system will run out of capacity in (a) few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get (a) vaccine when eligible,” epidemiologist Girdhara R Babu said in a tweet on Sunday.Babu, who is a professor at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19, said that most of the congregations are preventable and measures that could have been taken at a local level are fast evolving, necessitating national level mitigation. He said that this was a “conservative estimate” and not a pessimistic approach.Even if 10% of those testing positive each day require hospitalisation, the system will collapse, he added. Bengaluru reported 2,787 new Covid-19 infections on Saturday, taking its active case count to 28,098. The active case count in Karnataka approached the 40,000-mark as 4,553 fresh infections were reported across the state. Also read: Karnataka cinema halls to cap seating capacity at 50% from WednesdayMysuru, about 125 kilometres from Bengaluru, reported 260 new cases while the situation in Bidar, Kalaburagi, Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan and Dharwad, among other places, also deteriorated, as per the data from the daily bulletin of the health department. There were 93 new infections in Ballari, 147 in Bidar, 155 in Bengaluru Rural, 83 in Dakshina Kannada, 100 in Dharwad, 104 in Hassan, 170 in Kalaburagi and 107 in Tumakuru, data showed. “While the lockdown in 2020 was mostly unavoidable, the impending one in 2021 is mostly preventable,” he added. The predictions come at a time when Bengaluru and several other districts of Karnataka have seen a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases, indicating that the second wave of infections was spreading faster than what was seen the first time since March 2020. The area of concern remains the rapidly surging positivity rate in the state. On Saturday, the positivity rate remained at 3.79% while 331 people were in the intensive care units of various hospitals in the state including 158 in Bengaluru alone. The state government is hoping the Covid-19 vaccination drive to contain the spread of the virus. However, Babu said vaccination can prevent Covid-19 from turning serious or fatal but doesn’t guarantee immunity from the virus. He said that those who have got both doses of the vaccine should continue to wear masks as they are not immune from the virus and can spread it further. The Karnataka government has vaccinated 43,55,893 people across categories. In a brief statement on Sunday, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said that on request from Karnataka, the Government of India is making an emergency supply of 15.25 lakh doses to the state. The statement added that the state has 7 lakh vaccines and that it inoculated 2.5 lakh people on Saturday alone. “Karnataka will receive 15,25,500 doses of Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow in two consignments. One consignment of 5,25,500 doses will arrive at Belagavi by road and another consignment of 10,00,000 doses will arrive at Bengaluru by air through a late evening flight,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/expert-predicts-6-500-covid-19-cases-daily-in-bengaluru-by-april-20-101617547151526.html

The teams have been deployed at their designated stretches in three shifts, which keep patrolling the area round-the-clock,” a senior police officer said."These patrolling teams also keep a tab on PCR calls related to their designated routes and nearby area, and reach the spot instantly. These teams also check suspects by implementing 'roko-toko' strategy," he said.The officer said they have chosen Outer Ring Road as it is usually easy for criminals to escape via this route after committing the crime.The patrolling staff has so far checked 19,786 vehicles. A total of 3,808 vehicles were checked in January, 10,346 in February and 5,632 till March 15, the officer said, adding that 709 vehicles have been impounded this year so far.According to police, 463 vehicles have been deposited under section 66 of the Delhi Police Act (police to take charge of unclaimed property) this year. This number was 304 in 2020.The number of calls about street crime has come down due to this initiative. The strategy is effective as criminals know the stretch where strict patrolling is done and they avoid taking that route, police said.Although robbery incidents have marginally gone down, snatching cases have seen a sharp decline as compared to last year in six police stations -- Kotwali, Kashmiri Gate, Civil Lines, Timarpur, Wazirabad and Burari -- which cover Outer Ring Road of the district, police said.In January this year, there were 26 calls of robbery and 83 calls of snatching. In the previous year, the number of robbery calls were 28 and snatching calls 172, they said.Similarly, in February 2021, police received 31 calls of robbery and 98 calls of snatching.

04-04-2021||Kolkata||Abhishek Banerjee got ₹900 cr from coal, cow smuggling, alleges BJP; releases ‘proof’||Bharatiya Janata Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, who contested against chief minister Mamata Banerjee at East Midnapore district’s Nandigram assembly seat on April 1, released an audio clip at a press conference on Sunday and claimed that Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew and TMC’s youth wing president, received ₹900 crore from rackets that smuggled cow, coal and sand. “We have heard that ₹400-500 crore is being used by the TMC in the ongoing polls. This money came from the smuggling of coal and sand. Central agencies will probe these but the people of Bengal have to decide during the remaining six phases of polling whether they want a corrupt government. The operations started in 2012-13. Initially, Abhishek Banerjee used to get ₹15-20 crore a month. Later, the amount increased to ₹35-40 crore. Inspector Ashok Mishra used to carry the money to him with a police escort. Anup Majhi used to run the operation,” said Adhikari.The BJP claimed the audio clip contained a conversation between Kolkata-based businessman Ganesh Bagaria and Vinay Mishra, the absconding general secretary of the youth wing of the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Bagaria and Mishra are suspects in the multi-crore coal smuggling scam that central agencies are probing. Mishra is suspected to have fled to a foreign country. Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national information technology cell, who was also present at the press conference, alleged that the rackets were involved in human trafficking as well. In the audio clip, the veracity of which was not independently verified by HT, one man could be heard telling the other that money from the coal scam went to Abhishek Banerjee.Also read: On Mamata’s Nandigram claims, EC replies ‘allegations factually incorrect’The BJP released the clip less than 12 hours after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Ashok Mishra, an inspector of the West Bengal police who was posted in Bankura district. “He has more evidence, which will be released later,” said Adhikari. Without naming TMC’s poll strategist Prashant Kishor or i-Pac, his company, Adhikari said, “The agency hired by the TMC is also being paid from these illegal funds.” It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several hundred crores of rupees, has been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Several ECL officials have already been grilled by central agencies. Majhi has been summoned thrice for interrogation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). He will be grilled again on Monday. The sub-divisional police officer of Radhunathpur in Bankura has also been summoned. In the last two months, the CBI and the ED have grilled more than a dozen police officers, businessmen and suspected members of the coal smuggling racket. None of the agencies has made any official statement on these investigations till now. On Sunday, too, no official commented on the audio clip. The CBI has already questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Naroola, her sister Maneka Gambhir, the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and his father Pawan Arora in the coal smuggling case. Earlier, several cow traders and Border Security Force officers were grilled by the CBI in the cow smuggling case. On November 6, the CBI raided properties and offices owned by Majhi at 18 locations in the state. Union home minister Amit Shah had lunch at a tribal home in Bankura district on that day as part of his two-day trip to Bengal. Since then, the BJP is campaigning on this issue, saying the TMC is hand in glove with the coal mafia. In December, the CBI raided three residences of businessman and youth TMC general secretary Vinay Mishra. Ever since the probe started in September, the BJP has been alleging that the money from the illegal sale of coal and cow was whitewashed through shell companies and siphoned into the funds of the ruling party.Dismissing the fresh allegations made on Sunday, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Why is the BJP making these allegations in the middle of the elections? They brought similar charges in the past as well. It had no effect. This, too, will prove to be a futile attempt.”Other opposition parties upped the ante against the TMC. “People need to know how the TMC is getting money to hire helicopters for the ongoing campaign. Didn’t the chief minister know anything about this largescale corruption,” said CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty, the outgoing MLA from Jadavpur in south Kolkata. “The chief minister cannot shake off her responsibility. The truth must be revealed,” said state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/abhishek-banerjee-got-rs-900-cr-from-coal-cow-smuggling-alleges-bjp-releases-proof-101617544211607.html

She ultimately died on April 2, on her way to another hospital.“I am her only son and there was no one else to take her to hospital but me. I thought I would get admitted to the same hospital as my mother, but even after visiting several hospitals, I could not get a bed for her. Her oxygen level kept dropping and she took her last breath near the Kharadi bypass signal, when we were going to the next hospital,” said the son.Also read | Maharashtra govt announces weekend lockdown, oppn backs stricter Covid-19 curbsHe is currently admitted in Rising Medicare Hospital, Kharadi.Pune Municipal Corporation officials said that they are not aware of this incident, but admitted shortage of beds. “I am not aware of this particular incident.

We will have more beds available by Monday,” said Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer, PMC.The head of Shree Hospital Kharadi claimed that the hospital already has Covid patients on the waiting list and because of the full occupancy, they can not accept new patients. “On Sunday, by the afternoon I had to transfer seven Covid patients because we do not have beds available.

Maoists fired indiscriminately from two hilltops, police said. “The security personnel were caught unaware and were at a disadvantageous position as rebels kept firing from the top of the hills on two sides. It was a U-type ambush,” said a police officer. “Despite that, they valiantly fought back and the encounter continued for more than three hours till late Saturday evening,” the officer added. Police officials familiar with the development said that the entire Maoist operation was led by the commander of battalion number-1, Madvi Hidma, who held training for the encounter for the past two weeks and was waiting for security personnel to enter the Terrem jungles.The officials did not rule out the possibility of a trap laid by Hidma by providing false intelligence input to security forces about his presence in the jungles. The security personnel were looking for Hidma, a top Maoist commander, for years. There was intelligence input that Hidma was present in the area for the past 17 days, a police officer said. On Friday, at about 11 pm, around 1,700 security personnel from different camps in Bijapur and Sukma districts started one of the biggest combing operations to nab Hidma.On Saturday, a team of about 450 security personnel reached Jeera gaon, Jonaguda and Tekulgudam villages. They were ambushed around noon, police officials said. Sources familiar with the encounter said the force got trapped in their ‘killing area’ in the three villages. The villages where the encounter took place were vacated by the Maoists. “Tactically, the Maoists targeted the commanders of the security forces,” said an intelligence officer. The security forces tried to hide in the empty huts but were subsequently killed. Also read: The 22 soldiers who were killed in Chhattisgarh Maoists attackAnother police officer said the apparent reason for the Maoist attack was the Chhattisgarh Police’s plan to open a security camp in Silger village just ahead of Terrem. The region is considered a core area of Maoists. The camp would have cut a crucial Maoist corridor connecting Bijapur to Sukma and the rebels would have lost control over the region.“Hidma called over 300 armed cadres from different parts of Bastar who gathered close to the encounter spot,” said a police officer, adding that most of them were armed with automatic rifles. The officer said the presence of so many Maoists in the area was to lure the security forces inside the forest. “Hidma planned to lure security forces but for 15 days the security forces did not reach the area. He was getting desperate,” the officer said.Learning about his desperation, the police officer said, the Chhattisgarh Police decided to take Hidma head-on as elimination of the best Maoist battalion would have been a major setback to the rebels in the bastion. “We had information about their strength but somewhere there was a lack of strategic planning. We also underestimated the efficiency of the Maoists. It seems that they trained extensively in the terrains,” a senior Chhattisgarh police officer said, requesting anonymity.The officer said that the encounter would force the security personnel to have a strategy re-think as the forces cannot provide Maoists with any more strategic advantage in the encounters.What could have averted the damage? Senior officials of Chhattisgarh Police believe the specialised anti-Maoist security forces (COBRA, DRG, STF) should have been used at a much larger scale for such specific intelligence operations. The striking force didn’t have enough personnel hence the Chhattisgarh Police personnel were outnumbered. “Ambush sites were not adequately covered by the security forces, which should be the priority,” a senior official said. “Madvi Hidma led the batallion-1 and was grossly underestimated in the planning of operations by the security forces. The other reason behind high casualty was the field commanders getting targeted by the Maoists. Bullet injuries to CRPF CoBRA and District Reserve Guard (DRG) field commanders led to total disarray in command and control,” said the official, adding that specialized commanders and troops from the DRG and the STF from adjoining districts should have been involved in this important operation. Who is Madvi Hidma? A 38-year-old battle-hardened Maoist commander was the mastermind of the ambush on security forces. Hidma reportedly got guerilla warfare training in the Philippines and was said to be the mastermind behind the attack with other Maoists. Hidma, also known as Hidmalu and Santosh, is also believed to have carried out several attacks in the last decade. Considered one of the most dreaded Maoist leaders in Bastar, Hidma was born in Purvati village of south Sukma. He has built up a reputation as a ruthless rebel leader who runs a network of dedicated informers across the region. He belongs to the Muriya tribal community of Bastar region. His village is still out of bounds for the police. “Bastariya muriya tribals are brutal and aggressive and Hidma has already established himself as a master strategist and successful operational commander. His promotion will further motivate him and his team,” said another police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-20-security-personnel-die-in-u-shaped-maoist-ambush-in-villages-chhattisgarh-police-101617541691421.html

All residents above the age of 45 were vaccinated.“Societies should have 400 residents above the age of 45, only then the camp will be set up. The vaccination programme will continue at other places as it is going on,” said Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.One such camp was also organised at Shivnagri, Bijlinagar, in Chinchwad.“Residents of five societies got the vaccination at the camp,” said Radhika Natu, resident of Bijlinagar.Salve added, “We will continue such initiatives in the coming days.”The PCMC is aiming to vaccinate 25,000 residents on Monday.“Our priority is to give vaccination to super- spreaders, which includes vegetable vendors and employees working in public transport. We will be organising special buses for people from slum areas. All our centres in PCMC will be operating from 8am to 8pm. I urge people to get vaccinated and follow all the norms,” said Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) does not have any plans to take its vaccination drive to housing societies yet.“There are no such instructions from the government as of now. I will check with PCMC on how they are organising camps in societies,” said Vikram Kumar, PMC Commissioner.“There are strict restrictions imposed in Pune to stop the spread of Covid and at the same time our focus is now on increasing vaccination. We are planning to give jabs to people above the age of 45 at public places, where super-spreaders are present.

The finance committee will operate under the chairmanship of the commissioner.Last year, the committee was operational as per state government directives, under which civic bodies are allowed to spend only 40 per cent of budgetary allocations on priority works. The state also instructed the committee to keep a tab on wastage of money. The committee included an additional commissioner, a zonal commissioner, and a chief financial officer (CFO).After the annual budget of ₹8370 crore for the financial year 2021-22 was passed, commissioner Vikram Kumar decided to scrap the financial committee in February.Now the committee has been reformed and will meet every Monday to review work orders and tenders.Kumar stated that all department heads should submit proposals to the committee. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The commissioner scrapped the committee as last year’s financial period was almost over and a new budget was drafted. However, in the current situation, the commissioner has reformed the finance committee. The committee will decide priority of work. Last year, we had given priority to monsoon work, health, water, road, drainage, sanitation, repair and maintenance work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-chief-reappoints-finance-committee-to-prioritise-spending-101617538990571.html

During the peak last year in September, the CFR was 4.62 per cent.Doctors attribute this drop to awareness about Covid and timely treatment of critical patients. Experts also emphasised that high risk patients should get vaccinated to limit the severity of Covid-19.Speaking about the number of deaths per day, Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief of the health department at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said that as on April 4, the CFR for Pune city is 1.9 per cent.“If we see the last peak, every day the deaths were as high as 60, and the number of cases went as high as 2,000. This time, though the number of cases have gone up to 4,000, the deaths are limited. Deaths reported every day have not crossed 40 as of now. This is the reason for the lower CFR,” said Wavare.He added that though the deaths are low as of now, there is a possibility that the number may increase.“Citizens should wear masks and follow social distancing all the time. Taking vaccination is also an important part to keep oneself safe. Moreover, if anyone shows symptoms, they must isolate themselves at home and avoid crowded places. Getting tested is also important to ensure that you and your loved ones are safe,” said Wavare.Though the CFR is less for Pune city, the doubling time of cases is now at 49 days. Doubling is the period needed for a number of cases to double. The daily positivity rate in the city is at 19.84 per cent.At least 20,000 tests are done every day in the city and there are 3,84,236 beneficiaries who have been vaccinated since January, as per the PMC.Dr Mahesh Lakhe, consultant - internal medicine and infectious diseases, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said that the increase in cases has been very sharp and sudden this time.“The ongoing second wave has so far had a low case fatality rate indicating that this is a less virulent wave. At the same time, given the fact that we have now been one year into the pandemic we also have a better understanding of treatment modalities and preventing complications,” said Dr Lakhe.“Since in most cases fatality happens after 15 days, we might well witness an increase in CFRs in the coming weeks. The only way to keep fatality rates low is early diagnosis and intervention among seriously ill people. Increasing testing numbers and ensuring that all diagnosed get medical attention immediately can keep fatality rates low,” said Dr Lakhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-cfr-at-1-9-docs-point-to-better-covid-treatment-and-awareness-101617537310600.html

Primarily, in the view of the curfew, transport to and from school is a major issue.In addition to the restrictions, many students who are single parents, are losing jobs and struggling to put food on the table for their families. Pradnya Deshmukh, a 32-year-old single parent who works as a house help, said that she walks to her night school every day.“I have two daughters and I want to complete my education. I haven’t decided what I want to pursue, post Class 10. I am very focused. Everyone in my family works in the police and has respectable jobs. I wanted to continue my studies so that I can work and support my family,” said Deshmukh.Deshmukh is a student of the Poona Night High School and Junior College.“I walk to the school as I live nearby, but there are other students who have to commute from far away. Because of the curfew, it is difficult now,” said Deshmukh.Maruti Shinde, another student of Class 10, said that he cannot study during the day due to his job at a hotel.“I work at a restaurant at Dhankawadi and I am the sole earner in my family. I have two children and a wife to support. I don’t get a single day’s leave from work. It is difficult to study, but I am determined.

It will be put before the standing committee, after which, it will be passed by the general body meeting. Then it will be sent to the state government for approval. We need extra water against the background of an increase in population in the city, with reference to the inclusion of 23 villages in PMC limits.”Manisha Shekatkar, executive engineer, water supply department, said, “We will raise a demand for 5 TMC of water quota from Mulshi dam for the city. The state water resource department has already started work on an appointing a committee to check the feasibility of the project.”A senior official of the PMC water supply department, speaking anonymously, said, “We have prepared a preliminary proposal. The Khadakwasla irrigation division of the water resource department wants to reduce the 2.5 TMC water quota from Khadakwasla dam, as the city is getting that much water from the Bhama-Askhed dam. If that happens, we will need 5 TMC from Mulshi dam.”Pune district has not been drawing water from the Mulshi dam.

Those who need to come for necessary and unavoidable work will be allowed on humanitarian grounds and transportation of goods will continue," he said, citing the spread of Covid-19 in the neighbouring states.Chouhan said patience is needed to control the pandemic."I will go out with a loudspeaker on my vehicle at 6 pm on Monday and appeal to people to maintain physical distance and wear masks," the chief minister said.Maharashtra on Saturday reported 49,447 new Covid-19 cases, the highest rise in a day so far, taking its tally to 29,53,523.Besides, Chhattisgarh recorded 5,818 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, its highest single-day spike, taking the count of infections in the state to 3,63,796, as per official figures.Chouhan said those coming to MP from these states for necessary and unavoidable work were being screened.If found necessary, they will be kept in isolation, but the general movement of people will not be allowed."They are our brothers and sisters, but we have to take such measures to control the spread of the coronavirus," he said.The CM said more than 3,000 fresh cases of coronavirus were reported in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.He also said there will be a limited lockdown in the affected areas whenever needed, but there will be "no lockdown in the entire state".He urged social workers and religious leaders to run a public awareness campaign to check the spread of the viral infection.Chouhan noted that a three-day lockdown is going on in Chhindwara and two-day restrictions are in place in Betul."I don't want such lockdowns because this affects businesses and employment. Our priority is to protect the people without a lockdown," he said.Chouhan said the BJP is likely to announce an awareness campaign on Sunday under which its MLAs, MPs and other leaders will appeal to people to use masks and maintain social distancing to defeat the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-restrict-movement-of-people-from-chhattisgarh-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101617532915012.html
04-04-2021||Pune||How I beat a personal lockdown||With the city entering a mini lockdown, a few of our shows have been cancelled. Shows in Mumbai too are staring at cancellation and by the time this article is published, I suppose they will be called off. Of course, we are assuming that they are still on unless expressly told otherwise, and are continuing our rehearsals and marketing in whichever way possible. It is heartbreaking to say the least, but we respect the fact that safety comes first. A few years before, when we weren’t introduced to the term “lockdown” and theatres weren’t shut by law, I went through a personal lockdown of sorts. I had recently quit Chartered Accountancy and had taken to theatre and films with a thirst I haven’t experienced since. I was away from all this and hadn’t directed a play for quite sometime. I remember that I directed six plays in eighteen months! All of them were full-length plays – two acts each. Most of these plays were made on a commercial basis since I needed to earn something. It wasn’t much but it kept me from asking my parents for financial support. This was the first time that I had taken up theatre as my profession and not just a hobby. Up to this point I had enjoyed the support of many of my peers and seniors, who were pursuing theatre passionately, but they weren’t financially dependent on it. I started noticing that some of them weren’t happy with the artistic choices in the plays. A few of these plays were age-old Sangeet Natak and some of these friends even opposed the very thought of presenting an archaic text. I think I had experimented with the form and staging but it wasn’t working for them. I vividly remember one of them coming up to me immediately after an opening show, hug me tightly, whisper “I am very disappointed” in my ears and leave without a discussion. So, after eighteen months, I was back to where I started. In fact, at that time, I felt as if I was probably in a worse position than I was in while pursuing Chartered Accountancy! I was confident that I wanted to pursue theatre and films and nothing else and suddenly I wasn’t sure if I had made the right choice. Maybe I wasn’t cut out for it and should go back to the stability being a CA offered. And with these thoughts began my self-imposed lockdown. I stopped doing anything new. I feared the reactions of these friends. Things continued like this for nearly a year. I directed one play but did not stage it publicly. We just performed it in front of a limited audience in our rehearsal hall and that was it (It was wrong on my part, for the cast that gave me their time for rehearsals and I regret that decision now). After nearly a year I watched two plays in a matter of weeks – “Piya Behrupiya” directed by Atul Kumar and “Stories in a song” directed by Sunil Shanbag. And watching these plays turned out to be therapeutic for me. The most important thing I noticed was the clarity and confidence in the direction. These weren’t commercial plays but both the directors knew exactly what they were doing and there was no pretence in that. They had embraced their form and were honest and unabashed about the fact that they were entertaining! Both the shows enjoyed full houses and were being enjoyed by everyone. At the curtain call I involuntarily stood up to give them a standing ovation and realized that I was not alone. Everyone was on their feet! And I remember those as extremely cathartic moments. I had just found the way and the will to do what I wanted. And no amount of words or counselling would have had this effect!

However, citizens are complaining that they are being overcharged by private labs for the RT-PCR test. According to the fixed government rates, the RT-PCR test at labs should be charged ₹500 while tests conducted at home should cost ₹800. “Recently I had taken the service of one of the private pathology labs to test my family after I tested Covid positive and the lab charged ₹1,000 per person and the hospital where I tested positive, they charged ₹1200,” said Kinjal Yadav, a resident of Shivjai raje housing society, Hadapsar. “We are charging as per government rates either you come to our lab or we visit your home to offer service,” said a doctor from Krsnaa Diagnostics. “People should raise questions before taking the test. There are some labs in the city that may charge extra in regards that a person is not aware, and he/she is visiting the lab in a panic mode. The law says labs should strictly follow according to the government circular,” said Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer at Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre (SUHRC). Dr Natrajan added, “People should raise their concerns to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) or the Pune police if such a thing is happening at labs.” Gunjan Khiwsara, a Keshav Nagar resident said, “One month back when I did a test in Yavatmal, the doctor charged ₹1400, while in Pune last week when my husband did the RT-PCR test in a private lab he was charged ₹900.” With record-breaking Covid positive cases in Pune for the past week, more people are approaching for the test at the labs now. “The PMC has also increased tests at their centres while the rush has also increased at private labs. Few people complained of overcharging while they visited our hospital for the test, but we are charging normal rates,” said Purnima Rao, Sahyadri Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/private-labs-overcharging-for-rt-pcr-tests-citizens-say-101617532210320.html

04-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC grants bail to 5 excise officials, seven others in 2020 tax evasion case||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has granted bail to 12 persons, including five excise officials, who were booked by the Punjab vigilance bureau in a multi-crore tax evasion case in 2020. The excise officials are Japp, alias Japsimran and Varun Nagpal, Ram Kumar, Satpal Singh Multani and Vishavdeep Singh Bhangu. The other accused are Shiv Kumar, Vishwa Nath, Jasmeet Singh, alias Prince, Sukhwinder Singh, alias Shinda, Ranjit Kumar, alias Gogi, Kamal Kumar Ahuja, alias Rocky, Harshdeep Verma, alias Harshdeep Singh and Ishu Sharma. They all are into transport business. The FIR was registered on August 21, 2020, by the vigilance bureau. It was alleged that the officials caused huge losses to the state exchequer in connivance with private transporters. Tax evasion was allegedly committed through transporting goods of traders in and out of Punjab by paying less or no tax. It was argued that the prosecution of officials was not maintainable since sanction to prosecute them was not obtained. It was also submitted that the matter was already investigated and the challan presented. In the case of others, the court was told that challan was presented and there was no need to keep them in judicial custody. The bench of Jaishree Thakur granted them bail taking note of the fact that sanction to prosecute the officials was not obtained even as they were in custody since the registration of the FIR. No useful purpose would be served in keeping them behind the bars any longer, the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-grants-bail-to-5-excise-officials-seven-others-in-2020-tax-evasion-case-101617479290846.html

A case of attempt to murder was registered against sarpanch Harpreet Singh alias Happy Latha, Dhanbir Singh, Gurpreet Singh and Ajmer Singh, all residents of the same village, an official said.

04-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC imposes ₹1 lakh fine on Moga woman for fake rape allegation||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh on a Moga woman for levelling fake rape allegation against a local Congress leader. The bench of justice HNS Gill said the “proceedings initiated are false and frivolous and it is clear that an attempt was made not only to abuse the process of law but also overawe the authorities”. The court said it was a fit case for imposing an exemplary cost upon the complainant, a health department employee, who was directed to pay the fine amount to the Institute for the Blind, Sector 26, in Chandigarh. The FIR was registered against Congress leader Varun Joshi on June 2, 2020. She alleged that Joshi used to visit her office and eventually started raping her. She also claimed that her mother paid ₹4 lakh to the accused who started demanding more money saying he had objectionable photos of her. The woman moved the high court seeking a CBI probe into the matter after the police probe gave Joshi a clean chit. In June last year, the HC directed the police to record her statement. In October, the director general of police (DGP) was asked to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) which called for cancellation of the FIR. The SIT claimed that the woman and Joshi were in a consensual relationship and the dispute arose only when her husband came to know of this. The matter escalated to the extent of divorce and this is when the woman approached the police, the SIT concluded. The call location of the woman and the accused were different on the day of the alleged rape, it was found. Besides, the two stayed together in a hotel on different dates with the woman’s consent for which the hotel manager also testified, the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-imposes-rs-1-lakh-fine-on-moga-woman-for-fake-rape-allegation-101617479288856.html

The decision was taken by the party in a meeting of its core committee, the highest decision taking body of the SAD. Party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal presided over the meeting. “The protests will focus on the back-breaking hike in power tariffs from ₹5 to ₹10 per unit, unbearable state taxes accounting for the bulk of the hike in the prices of diesel and petrol and the denial of post-matric scholarship to SC students,” said a party statement. The protests will also focus on the “total breakdown” of the law-and-order machinery in the state, it said. Sukhbir Badal’s principal adviser Harcharan Bains said the party condemned the alleged attack on farmer leader Rakesh Tikait and sought a judicial probe into it. Some people on Friday had thrown stones at a cavalcade of Tikait, damaging his car’s rear windshield when he was going to address a rally in Rajasthan’s Alwar district. Bains said the party’s core committee slammed the Centre for its missive to the Punjab government over the use of bonded labour in its border villages. A resolution describing it as “an attempt to defame state farmers” was also passed. The party also condemned Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for maintaining a “conspiratorial silence over the home ministry’s malicious communication”. A resolution was also passed, accusing the chief minister of “abdicating his constitutional obligations for the maintenance of peace, communal harmony and law and order”. The SAD core committee also delegated full powers and authority to the party president to take all decisions with regard to the forthcoming elections of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-to-hold-statewide-protests-against-amarinder-govt-s-policies-on-april-5-101617479051366.html

The decision comes in the wake of postponement of Class-10 exams due to surge in covid cases in the district. Class-10 students of government-aided schools and private schools affiliated to Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) and those belonging to below poverty line (BPL) families with smart cards are eligible to register. A general category student should have secured 70% and Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) student should have a score of 65%. The website to register is www.ssapunjab.org. There will be a common entrance test, which has not been conducted yet due to the coronavirus pandemic and schools being closed till October 2020. To date, 5,000 students have registered against 4,600 seats in Class-11 across the 10 meritorious schools in the state. For Class-12, 2,400 students already pursuing studies in government and other schools in Class-11 have shown interest in taking admission. Meritorious schools are in Amritsar, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala, Hakumat Singh Wala village in Ferozepur district, Ghabdhan village in Gurdaspur, Sangrur, and Talwara in Hoshiarpur.

04-04-2021||Delhi||Soon, head to Delhi zoo to spot some unique tree species||In the coming months, the Delhi zoo will not just be a place to watch birds and animals, but also a spot to sight over 100 native and exotic species of trees, officials said. The National Zoological Park is working towards creating an arboretum on the zoo premises for visitors to see and learn about the different tree species in the capital.Considering that the park already boasts of some rare species such as the baobab tree or kalpavriksh, having a “tree point” seems right on par for the zoo to become an “inclusive natural space”.Ramesh Kumar Pandey, director, Delhi zoo, said an open space in the centre of the zoo premises, which was pretty much an abandoned space, is being planted with various trees and will be converted into a full-fledged tree point by this monsoon.“The idea behind this initiative is to elevate the status of the zoo from just a place for sighting animals and birds, to an inclusive natural space. The park which we are converting into the tree point already had around 29 tree species. We have already started planting more trees species there and, by the end of April, we will have a total of 60 tree species in the arboretum,” Pandey said.He said the plantation will be continuous and by the end of monsoon in Delhi, which is considered the ideal time for plantation, over 100 species of trees will be planted at the tree point.The Delhi zoo, which was shut for over a year due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, opened its gates to the public on April 1. The zoo was shut to visitors on March 18, 2020, a week before a nationwide lockdown that went on for 68 days. Although most services gradually reopened in the past few months, plans to get visitors back to the zoo were hit by cases of avian flu being reported earlier this year.Officials said once the tree point is developed, the zoo plans to conduct tree walks and educational trips to educate interested visitors about different species, the country from which they originate and how to differentiate between tree species.“For instance, a lot of people have not seen the semal tree, even though it is planted in huge numbers across the city, and some do not know how to differentiate the semal tree from a palash tree because both have red flowers blooming at this time of the year. People can come here and see these trees at different stages of the year -- when they bloom, when they are bearing fruits and when they shed leaves,” Pandey said.At present, the Delhi zoo is home to varieties such as semal, kachnar, palash, the golden trumpet, mango, bamboo and varieties of palm. Apart from the usually sighted trees, the Delhi zoo is also known to house some rare species that are not easily spotted outside its gates.For instance, the whole of Delhi has just four baobab trees, commonly known as kalpavriksh (Adansonia digitata). The zoo has three of them. It also has two of only four remaining winged calabash or gourd tree (Crecsentia alata) in Delhi.Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said it is important to have such spaces in the city where people can come and learn about the city’s rich ecology.“It is important to have such spaces within the city. At the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, we have over 40 unique flowering plants. It is imperative to preserve some tree species and that will happen only if people are aware of them,” Khudsar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/soon-head-to-delhi-zoo-to-spot-some-unique-tree-species-101617478519599.html

While donations from the alumni are a regular affair for the Institute of Eminence, this is the first time that it has made a dedicated effort to raise capital to fund various aspects of academics and research from its alumni network. Launched in February, Cherish IIT Bombay is the first-ever annual fundraising campaign of the institute. In its first chapter, the campaign, launched only in India, ran for six weeks, during which time IIT-B was able to connect with 164 alumni members, who donated a total of ₹55.41 lakh. “The main objective this time has been to connect them and also to inculcate a thought of donating every year,” said Suhas Joshi, dean, alumni and corporate relations, IIT-B. The funds raised will be used for the creation of under-graduate education laboratories, modernisation of lecture halls, establishing maker space of IIT-B and providing Young Faculty Awards, Joshi added. “The alumni network helps IIT-B in numerous ways, by supporting its initiatives to expand and maintain world-class infrastructure for a rapidly-increasing student base.

04-04-2021||Other||After spending 11 years in jail, New Panvel teacher accused of 9-yr-old’s rape acquitted by Bombay HC||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) recently cleared a teacher from allegations of raping a nine-year-old student, after he spent about 11 years behind bars. The division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NR Borkar set free the 39-year-old former biology teacher of a New Panvel school and junior college after noticing several discrepancies in the prosecution’s case. The alleged incident, according to the prosecution, took place on June 21, 2010. The Class 3 student said that when she went to the washroom along with a friend around 4.00pm, a male teacher obstructed her way and took her to the gents’ washroom, where another teacher held her hand and a third one teacher sexually assaulted her. The biology teacher was arrested the next day. He was prosecuted for the crime and convicted by an additional sessions judge at Alibag on November 23, 2013, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The next year he moved HC, through advocate Shine Kamaluddin Mohammed, against the verdict. On March 22, HC allowed his appeal, primarily after noticing that though the child was sexually assaulted by someone, there was no evidence to link the biology teacher to the heinous crime. HC noted that the child had initially disclosed to her parents that it was her drawing teacher who had sexually assaulted her, but when on the next day after the incident she went to the school with Kalamboli police for identifying the accused, she pointed at the photograph of another teacher, as the person who assaulted her. However, her mother maintained that she knew the other teacher and was sure that he would not commit such an act. The child was then shown the photograph of the biology teacher, who was arrested after the nine-year nodded in affirmative. HC, however, noticed that on the date of the incident, the biology teacher had been to the school at 7.30am, and left at 3.00pm, and nobody had seen him in the institute thereafter. Besides, HC also noted that the doctor, who had examined the child, had categorically opined that there was evidence to suggest she was habituated to sexual activity, and was taking some medication prescribed by a private gynaecologist, almost a year prior to the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-spending-11-years-in-jail-new-panvel-teacher-accused-of-9-yr-old-s-rape-acquitted-by-bombay-hc-101617478028826.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||₹26.8L taken out from Vaze’s joint account after arrest: NIA||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court extended the remand of Sachin Vaze till April 7 during a Saturday hearing of the suspended Mumbai police officer who is under arrest for his alleged role in parking an explosives-laden car outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February.Vaze is also being investigated for his role in the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran who is linked to the SUV found parked outside Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening letter addressed to the industrialist. The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested two men, Vinayak Shinde (a former cop) and Naresh Gor (a bookie) for their role in the murder and named Vaze as the prime suspect in the case, before the NIA took over the probe on March 20.The federal probe agency informed the special court that Vaze, the former head of the Criminal Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, had a joint account in the Versova branch of a private bank, which reportedly held a sum of ₹26.80 lakh. However, when the agency searched the branch on March 18, five days after arresting Vaze in connection with the security scare case, it found only Rs. 5,000 in the account. The NIA told the court that the duo owned a locker, which was found to be empty during their search.The probe agency did not reveal the name of the person whom Vaze reportedly held the account and locker with.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh representing NIA informed the court that the agency needs to interrogate Vaze in custody to find out as to who withdrew the amount from the bank.“It appears that there was some incriminating material and / or documents in the locker which were also removed, and the agency needs to find out as to who had withdrawn the money and removed contents of the locker and on whose instructions,” he said.Vaze’s counsel, Abad Ponda, told the court that the 49-year-old cop did not have any such bank account or locker.Ponda further challenged the NIA’s claim that a haul of evidence from Mithi river last month did not implicate his client.“Mithi river is an open place for the whole Mumbai and other parts. Anyone can come and drop anything into the river. They (NIA) are just claiming these as recoveries, and they are planting all those things in Vaze’s name,” the ANI reported Ponda as saying.On March 25, professional divers for the NIA recovered several items from the Mithi river including two CPUs, a laptop, a printer, 2 Digital Video Recorders and a set of registration number plates of a Maruti Eco stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020, all of which had been damaged before being thrown in the river.Singh said that the NIA needed to confront Vaze about this evidence, as well as 120 TB of data collected from several CCTV footage samples collected in the course of the investigation.Singh added that during the search at Vaze’s house at Saket Complex in Thane, NIA has recovered a passport of an unknown person and it was yet to be ascertained as to who that person was, how was he connected to Vaze.Singh said the agency has on April 2 seized one more luxury car, a white Mercedes, in connection with the crime. He, however, did not elaborate as to whom the car belonged and how it was connected to the crime.He added that the agency had raided in a club in south Mumbai where officials found a diary that indicated that some amounts were paid to Vaze and it was necessary to find out why the amounts were paid to the arrested police officer.The NIA is also probing Vaze’s reported extortion activities. This comes in the wake of a letter written by former Mumbai police commissioner, Param Bir Singh, who accused the home minister of running an extortion racket and setting a target for police officers, including Vaze, to collect ₹100 crore from establishments like shops.The senior advocate also opposed the prayer for extension of Vaze’s custody, contending that NIA was seeking extension of his remand 15 days after it invoked provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), but not a single ground under anti-terror Act was mentioned in their remand application.On March 25, the NIA invoked sections 16 and 18 of the stringent anti-terror law, against Vaze. The two sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act.Hiran’s body washed up ashore a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra on March 5, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. All his belongings including a gold ring, chain, mobile phone, wrist watch and wallet were missing.Special court calls for Vaze’s detailed medical reportThe special NIA court on Saturday directed the federal agency to submit a detailed medical report, indicating whether Vaze required any treatment or surgical intervention after Vaze addressed the court and claimed that he had blockages in his heart, which required him to undergo an angiography and angioplasty.Vaze claimed to have suffered stroke-like symptoms last week.The directive came after Vaze himself addresses the court during hearing on his remand and claimed that he suffered a cardiac stroke on Sunday.His counsel, Ponda also submitted Vaze’s medical reports to the court on Saturday.The NIA, however, maintained that Vaze’s eco-cardiogram results were conducted and after perusing the reports, a doctor had opined that Vaze’s heart was working normally. It further told the court that Vaze was under supervision of a doctor.Vaze on Saturday met his brother Sudharm in the special NIA court and spoke to him for some time with permission of the court. Sudharm also handed over some clothes to Vaze and while stopping out of the court told news channels that he had “full faith in the NIA and our judicial system.”Sudharm Vaze had filed a habeus corpus petition in the Bombay HC last month challenging the legality of his brother’s arrest, after he was cooperating with the NIA in their investigation. Vaze has denied playing any role in the commission of the crime pertaining to the explosives case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/268l-taken-out-from-vaze-s-joint-account-after-arrest-nia-101617478028331.html

04-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Tough Covid-19 curbs Maha need of the hour’||With Covid-19 cases continuing to spike as never before, the Maharashtra government is inching towards a lockdown in a step-by-step manner, with stringent restrictions likely within a day or two. And if cases are not controlled, then a complete lockdown will be imposed, insiders in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government said on Saturday.“We are starting with stringent restrictions to control cases as the rise in cases is sharp. But if cases continue to rise with the same speed and if resources start falling short, then we will be left with no option, but to impose lockdown,” Rajesh Tope, state health minister told HT.Meanwhile, experts, too, said some tough decisions that will not adversely affect the economy needed to be taken by the administration. Putting more curbs on non-essential events like weddings and parties as well as non-essential activities such as morning and evening walks, and introducing staggered timings for offices to reduce peak-hour train and road traffic should be considered immediately, they opined. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already warned for a lockdown as the cases are rising sharply and there are concerns that the health infrastructure would crumble after a point of time.On Saturday, the state reached close to the 50,000 mark as 49,447 new cases were reported, which was also the highest in a day and it is likely that the daily cases will cross 50,000 in a day or two, the officials said.Senior officials said that Thackeray is of the view that the transmission of cases can be arrested only by imposing lockdown. However, consensus among the ruling parties is yet to be made — NCP and Congress are still not in favour of complete lockdown.On Saturday, the chief minister held various meetings with various sections of society, asking them for their support in the decisions to be taken by the state government as they will be in the interest of all.He said, “The entire state is going to face losses, but we have to give priority to life over work and thus it is imminent to take certain steps. We cannot ignore the current circumstances and make all the efforts to break the chain of the spread,” the chief minister said in a virtual meeting held with the owners of cinema halls, multiplexes and Marathi theatres.“We are not of the view to shut down this or that but to overcome the crisis in time we have to make efforts from now onwards,” he added.Thackeray also discussed the ongoing crisis owing to the pandemic with gym owners, and editors from the media industry on Saturday.“The chief minister has made up his mind to impose lockdown, but we were not ready for it. However, the situation is going out of hand and some harsh decisions have to be taken. We cannot allow the situation to be continued like this and lockdown will be the only alternative left before us in the coming days,” said a MVA minister, wishing not to be named.On Friday in his live address on social media platforms, Thackeray warned that the state’s healthcare infrastructure may be overwhelmed in the next two weeks and also appealed to political parties, industrialists and ordinary people to cooperate and obey safety guidelines.“I am not announcing a lockdown, but definitely warning about it. I am sure we can avoid a lockdown if we decide firmly about it. We will observe for the next couple of days, if people are observing protocol strictly. But in case no such solution is found, I cannot allow the situation to go out of hand,” he said.Experts, too, believe some tough decisions that will not adversely affect the economy need to be taken by the administration to check the rise in the number of cases in the city and the state. It should include curbing non-essential events like weddings, parties, non-essential activities such as morning and evening walks, and introducing staggered timings for offices to reduce peak-hour train and road traffic. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the government’s Covid-19 task force said, “No one wants the economy to be hampered again due to a lockdown. But curbs can be put on non-essential activities, such as on morning and evening walkers, and on those who leave homes just for an outing, such as in parks or beaches. This will not affect any businesses, on those dependent on such business for their day-to-day income.” He also stressed on not allowing weddings to any social gatherings in the state.He further said, “If office timings can be staggered for even those 50% employees who are not working from home right now, then it will reduce load on local public transport. The shift of these employees should be determined at the interval of two hours, so that some employees can start work at 7am, others at 9am. In that case, those asked to start with a delay of two hours will work two hours more at the end of the day. Presently, local public transport gets very crowded during office hours around 9am and 5pm to 7pm.”Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the state-appointed death audit committee, stressed on ramping up vaccination in the state, while Dr Pandit said the state must now start vaccinating all above the age of 18.Meanwhile, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis criticised Thackeray, saying lockdown cannot be a rule and can be imposed only in exceptional circumstances. Prime Minister Narendra Modi provided food grains and transferred money in the bank accounts of the common people before imposing lockdown. The state should also consider doing all the same before taking such a decision, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tough-covid-19-curbs-maha-need-of-the-hour-101617477908229.html

Thackeray assured to resolve the issue, if any. The leaders, during the meeting at CM’s official residence Varsha, also raised an objection against the statement made by Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut over the latter’s suggestion to make Nationalist Congress Party (BJP) chief Sharad Pawar as the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), a post currently held by interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party insiders said.It was also decided to constitute a coordination committee to review the common minimum programme on the basis of which the MVA government was formed. The committee will have national and state-level leaders from the three ruling parties — Sena, NCP and Congress.The delegation of Congress leaders, including state Congress president Nana Patole and public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, was led by party’s Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil. It was Patil’s first meeting with Thackeray after he took over charge of the state Congress unit.“We have brought to the notice of CM some concerns raised over the distribution of funds and how the departments handled by Congress ministers are suffering owing to want of funds. CM also expressed his concern about the issue and assured to look into it. He also said he will resolve the lapses, in case there are any,” Patil told reporters outside Varsha.On Friday, Patole had said that Congress ministers are getting an unequal share in fund allocation. “There is a discontent among Congress legislators over the distribution of funds. NCP and Shiv Sena [ministers] are getting more development funds,” Patole had said after attending a meeting of Congress ministers and leaders.Speaking over Raut’s statement on UPA leadership, Patil said, “With regard to Raut’s statement, I have received lots of complaints. But today in a news report, Raut said he didn’t mean that Sonia Ji be replaced. I think after this [clarification], there is no issue left.”Patil also said the party wants the common minimum programme to be reviewed. “He [Thackeray] said it will be reviewed at ministers’ level. Also, a committee, with two representatives from national and state level from each of the parties, will be set up. They will review its implementation and make improvements, if needed,” the Congress in-charge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-leaders-meet-cm-over-unequal-fund-allocation-raut-s-remarks-on-upa-chief-101617477849420.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||Starting today, civic body will vaccinate citizens on Sundays too||Mumbai, for a third consecutive day, reported its highest single-day spike with 9,108 cases on Saturday, along with 27 deaths, taking the tally to 441,475 and toll to 11,754. On Saturday, Mumbai’s active cases also crossed the 60,000 mark. With the increasing cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday said that starting this weekend it will also vaccinate on Sundays and all its vaccination centres will be running in two shifts for the same.The Central government earlier last week told all state governments to conduct vaccination even on Sundays in order to ensure the vaccination drive picks up pace in the country.Sheela Jagtap, BMC’s immunisation officer, said, “All our vaccination centres will function on all Sundays up to April 30, and further going a decision will be taken at a later stage. From tomorrow, all vaccination centres will function even on a Sunday there is no decline in numbers there.”The BMC has 116 vaccination centres and till now, it has vaccinated 1,330,573 citizens so far. On Saturday, 44,500 citizens between 45 and 59 age group were vaccinated followed by 12,389 senior citizens. Overall, including frontline and health care workers, 64,186 were vaccinated on Saturday.Further, according to state health department’s data, city’s recovery rate is 83% with 367,899 recoveries, followed by mortality rate of 2.66%. There are 60,846 active cases in the city. The BMC has anticipated that the city will experience a scenario wherein daily, around 60,000 tests will be conducted in the city, followed by it reporting around 10,000 cases daily.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal last week said, “Assuming that the number of positives in due course of time in Mumbai increases to 10,000 cases per day with assumption that approximately 15% of these would be symptomatic, and further assuming that every symptomatic patient will require a bed, the total number of beds required to handle 10,000 cases every day for a period of six to eight weeks will be around 21,000 beds.”On Saturday, the BMC in a statement said, “Patients who are home isolated will be discharged from the civic body’s patient list after 10 days from symptom onset and if they have no fever for three consecutive days and their oxygen saturation is above 95.”Thereafter the patient shall be advised to isolate at home and self-monitor their health for a further seven days. There is no need for a test after the period of home isolation is over. This would mean that a patient would remain isolated for a total of 17 days. The BMC allows home isolation in case of a patient being asymptomatic, or has mild symptoms, or is elderly, or has comorbidities but with no symptoms, after evaluation from an assistant medical health officerMeanwhile, the BMC in a statement on Saturday appealed to citizens to behave in a Covid-19 appropriate manner in order to ensure the spread of Covid-19 is contained. The BMC also appealed to citizens to not take symptoms lightly and consult doctors or BMC clinics, in case of any difficulty. The BMC also said that over 2.4 million citizens have been fined in the last one year for not wearing a mask in which over Rs49 crore has been collected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/starting-today-civic-body-will-vaccinate-citizens-on-sundays-too-101617477848799.html
04-04-2021||Other||10-19 age group hit during second surge of Covid-19 infection||rupsa.chakraborty@htlive.comMumbai At a time when Mumbai continues to struggle with an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, it is facing yet another challenge — an increased rate of infection among children and teens.In February, a total of 12,312 patients in the age group of 10-19 got infected. In March, the number surged to 17,109 (including one death), which is as a 39% rise, as per the data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). However, most of the patients are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. According to public health experts, children are most vulnerable now because they are more exposed to outdoor activities, functions and gatherings, which was not the case earlier due to lockdowns.“It is a challenging job to keep children indoor for months. Now, they go outside to play and participate in social gatherings. Earlier, they were more protected. Now as parents also know that the infection rate is less among children, they have also put their guard down,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Although, most of the children recover in home isolation, the infection may prove fatal if a patient has underlying health conditions. At least 32 patients in the same age group have died across the city during the start of the pandemic.“We have hardly received any case where a child needed hospitalisation. But children ailing with tuberculosis and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) have low immunity and there needs to be extra caution taken for them,” said Dr Bela Verma, head of paediatric department at Sir JJ Hospital.The same age group has been hit in other parts of the country too, such as Delhi. Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Science), Delhi, said, “With the unlocking, children have started going out, which provides a suitable opportunity for the virus to thrive. Also, children often don’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, which makes them more vulnerable to acquiring the infection.”Public health officers also believe that the children are becoming a source of infection spreaders among family members, especially the elderly.“As soon as children enter home, they remove their masks without following proper sanitation. That’s when they end up infecting older family members. Then the cycle of infection keeps circulating,” said Dr Deepak Baid, in-charge of Covid-19 patients in Rajawadi Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1019-age-group-hit-during-second-surge-of-covid-19-infection-101617477848246.html
04-04-2021||Other||Ahead of MC polls, Anil Sharma trains guns on HP CM||Days after chief minister Jai Ram Thakur attacked his colleague and party legislator from Mandi, Anil Sharma, for not campaigning during the municipal corporation elections, the latter launched a counter-offensive and hit back at the government over lack of development in the town popular as ‘Choti Kashi’.Anil Sharma, who was the power minister in the Jai Ram cabinet, was compelled to give up his cabinet berth after his son Ashray Sharma contested on a Congress ticket during Lok Sabha polls. “Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur is a decent man, but he is being misled by his cabinet minister Mahender Singh Thakur,” said Sharma.BJP did not include Sharma, a local legislator from Mandi, in the panel constituted for the municipal elections. But with no party member being able to match up to Sharma’s popularity in Mandi, the CM entrusted the poll responsibility to Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur.“Jai Ram Thakur has begun lying in the company of Mahender Singh Thakur. He is making false claims on development of Mandi town,” said Sharma addressing the media in Mandi town. “Mahender Singh and Lok Sabha members had committed to remain resolute for the development of Mandi but nothing has been done so far. Who will trust them in future?” asked Sharma. “I will no longer remain silent. The CM allocated ₹3 lakh for the under-construction school in Kotli that has an estimated cost of ₹1.5 crore,” he said. Sharma also credited his own father for the development of Mandi. “Fifty years ago when my father contested elections from Mandi, there was no sewage plant and the town was dependent on manual scavenging,” he said. “Shankaumar jee is remembered largely as Paani waala Mukhya Mantri and Dhumaljee as Road waala Mukhya mantra, but Jai Ram jee is only known Seraj waala Mukhya mantra,” he said. Claiming that he was pushed to the margins, Sharma said, “I was not allowed to share the stage with him; there was no invitation for historic Shivratri mela. If my son made a mistake by contesting on a Congress ticket, then why am I being punished?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-mc-polls-anil-sharma-trains-guns-on-hp-cm-101617477791476.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar gets discharged from hospital, advised seven days complete rest||National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, 80, was on Saturday discharged from Breach Candy Hospital, four days after he underwent an urgent endoscopic procedure for removal of a gallstone on Tuesday night. Doctors have advised him a seven-day complete rest. He will likely be operated for gallbladder surgery if all of his parameters come normal after 15 days.“Sharad Pawar saheb was checked by a team of Doctors today and his health is stable, he will be discharged from hospital today. He has been advised rest for 7 days and after 15 days if all his health parameters are stable, surgery on his gall bladder will be performed,” said Nawab Malik, NCP chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister, in a series of tweets.He also urged party cadre and all well-wishers to refrain from visiting Pawar as he needs complete rest to recuperate. Pawar was looking fit as he walked up to his house and climbed stairs without any help after getting down from the car on Saturday afternoon.The former Union minister was diagnosed with stones in the gallbladder. On Tuesday night, he underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure to remove one of the gallstones that had slipped into his bile duct, causing blockage to the flow leading to immense pain, mild jaundice and inflammation of pancreas called pancreatitis.The veteran leader had been recovering at the hospital since then. From Thursday evening, he was allowed by the doctors to walk and have solid foods. Now, he will have to be operated for gallbladder surgery for which he will have to be admitted once again. This may take two weeks as he has swelling and inflammation in the pancreas. He was also suffering with jaundice, when admitted to the hospital, according to doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-gets-discharged-from-hospital-advised-seven-days-complete-rest-101617477789909.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Public getting negligent because of low fatality rate’||Despite over a four-fold rise in active Covid-19 patients in Mumbai, the case fatality rate (CFR) has remained under 1%. Though it is a silver lining for Mumbaites, doctors believe it is leading to casual behaviour among the public who are violating Covid safety rules.Suryakanth Mishra, 62-year-old, who fought the virus for 12 days in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in SevenHills Hospital, Marol, succumbed to the infection on March 17. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in 2017, but successfully recovered by the end of 2018. However, the infection had left his lungs damaged and scarred, which became an easy target for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“Considering he was a TB survivor, he didn’t delay his diagnosis. As soon as he started showing symptoms, we did his Covid-19 test. But even before we could get the report, his oxygen saturation dropped below 85%,” said Pradeep Mishra, his son.Although the CFR has remained within 1%, due to the four-fold rise in Covid-19 cases, cumulative death rate increased by 91% in March compared to the previous month. In February, a total 111 Covid-19 deaths were recorded in the city, which increased to 212 in March.But doctors believe that because of the low fatality rate, the public have become careless and not following Covid precautionary measures like maintaining social distance, wearing masks and sanitising hands regularly.For instance, on Thursday, the city reported 8,646 new Covid-19 cases. But only 18 deaths were reported in the same 24 hours. On March 31, as many as 5,394 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the city with only 15 deaths.“The CFR in the second wave is still under control. But people shouldn’t take this for granted. People are irresponsible in their Covid-appropriate behaviour. If infection rate increases further, hospitals would run out of beds. Delay in treatment can contribute to rise in deaths,” said Dr Avinash Supe, in-charge of Covid-death committee.On March 1, the city had only 9,690 active cases which has now increased to over 51,000. As almost 10-15% of the newly infected patients require hospitalisation, over 80% of the Intensive Care Units (ICU) beds are occupied. The public health experts believe that soon, the city may face shortage of beds if cases keep rising further.As a precautionary measure, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed all ward officers and hospitals to keep a detailed record of the deceased patients for analysis.“In June, when the mortality rate was over 5%, we initiated Mission Save Life. Now, again we have reissued the same guidelines. We have asked hospitals and civic officials to maintain records of the deceased like when the patient was detected, how long the deceased took to get admitted, what medicines were provided among others,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “If fatality rate increases, it would help us to understand the reason behind the deaths and make adequate changes in policies,” he added.In January, the positivity rate in the city was only 4%, which has now increased to over 20%. “We are focusing on three aspects— mass vaccination, increasing hospital beds and testing as much as possible. But the public needs to be more responsible. In fact, we are asking the beneficiaries who have taken the jab to keep wearing masks just as a precautionary measure,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/public-getting-negligent-because-of-low-fatality-rate-101617477788854.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||Students of classes 1 to 8 will be promoted without exams: Edu min||As schools in several parts of Maharashtra remain shut due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, the state education department has decided to promote all students between Classes 1 and 8 to the next classes, based on a monitoring process.State education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the announcement on Saturday afternoon. “All state board students across Maharashtra state from Class 1st to Class 8th will be promoted to the next class without any examinations. A decision regarding students of class 9th and 11th will soon be taken,” stated a tweet by Gaikwad. “We could not open schools for Classes 1 to 4. Even schools for the higher grade could not open. Hence it has been decided to promote students this year,” she added. The department shall soon release a manual on promoting students to the next grade, as per which schools have to assess their performance.Principals welcomed the move. “We have made several representations in this regard and are happy that they have been accepted. Students should not be subjected to stress during the current situation,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principal’s Association. As per the RTE Act, students between Classes 1 and 8 are promoted on the basis of their continuous comprehensive evaluation (CCE) monitored throughout the year.The state education department allowed schools in the state to reopen for Classes 9 to 12 from November 23, 2020 and for Classes 5 to 8 from January 27, 2021. The final decision of reopening schools rested with the local authorities and schools in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai did not open. However, with the rising number of Covid-19 infections, even those in various parts of the state that had opened had to close down.Gaikwad said that even as schools remain shut, students are getting access to learning through TV, radio mobile phones and through various online channels of the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/students-of-classes-1-to-8-will-be-promoted-without-exams-edu-min-101617477789327.html
04-04-2021||Mumbai||Researchers from MU identify edible species of jellyfish on Mumbai shores||Researchers from the department of life sciences of the University of Mumbai (MU) have identified an edible species of jellyfish that washes ashore the coast of Mumbai. This is the first time that an edible species has been identified through a modern technique in India that is documented.Romil Dagha and Komal Kumari, with their guide Nisha Shah, assistant professor at MU’s life sciences department, set out to better understand and manage jellyfish blooms by accurately identifying species.In collaboration with Pavan Annam-Kumar, senior scientist, Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE), Mumbai, the researchers used molecular markers along with morphological characters to distinguish the jellyfish. Their work was published in the March issue of the Indian Journal of Geo Marine Sciences.“Every year we experience large swarms of jellyfish blooms, some of which possess venomous stings. Therefore, it’s important to identify all the different types of species. Jellyfish are difficult to identify, even for taxonomic experts. So we used a modern method of identification,” said Dagha.Using morphology and molecular markers, they identified Rhopilema hispidum from the Mumbai coast, an edible species that has a huge market in south-east Asian countries. Molecular studies help understand the species diversity across geography by comparing the markers with same species from different geography (in this case Malaysia).A total of nine individual jellyfishes were collected from Juhu beach, Mumbai, during September 2017. The morphological characters were observed and documented from fresh specimens following existing literature.“In India, previous studies on jellyfish have focused mostly on aspects of jellyfish stings, envenomation (exposure to a poison or toxin resulting from a sting) and toxicology of their venoms,” the study said. While previous studies have documented the Rhopilema hispidum from the Indian coast using morphological characters, studies on molecular identification of jellyfish are very limited.Molecular studies provide a confirmatory remark towards identification of any species. The partial gene sequence of ITS1 region obtained from this study will serve as a reference for identification of this species in future from Arabian sea, according to Dagha.“This study gives us confirmation of the presence of a new type of jellyfish off Mumbai shores. Jellyfish are notorious for occupying fish space in fisherman’s catch due to which there is a huge financial loss to them. But it is actually a hidden market opportunity for the Mumbai fish industry with huge demand for jellyfish in eastern countries,” he said.“This is the first time that the specimen is identified with molecular tools in India. Rhopilema hispidum is a common species in the Indo-Pacific, reported earlier from India from the east coast. This is also reported from Pakistan, and this study shows that it could be distributed both in east and west coast of India,” said A Bijukumar, professor and head of the aquatic biology and fisheries department of University of Kerala, who was not involved in the study,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/researchers-from-mu-identify-edible-species-of-jellyfish-on-mumbai-shores-101617477788303.html

The state also recorded more than 200 deaths, with 277 deaths recorded on Saturday. The state now has more than 400,000 active cases. The state’s tally has reached 2,953,523 with 55,656 fatalities.In the past three days (since April 1), the state has recorded more than 100,000 cases with 140,457 new infections.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageMumbai, which has been witnessing a sharp spike in cases also reported upwards of 9,000 new cases with 9,108 infections and 27 deaths on Saturday. The city’s tally is now 441,475 with 11,754 fatalities. Mumbai also has 60,846 active cases, second-highest in the state after Pune, which has 73,599 active cases as on Saturday.Other cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur also recorded 5,778, 2,459 and 2,854 new Covid cases on Saturday.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday, in his address to citizens said that he will be consulting experts before announcing stringent measures in the state in a day or two. He also held meetings with various groups to look at alternatives to a lockdown.“I am giving an indication for a complete lockdown, but not announcing it formally. If things do not improve visibly in a couple of days and if no other solution is found, we will have to announce another lockdown like it is being done globally,” Thackeray had said in his address.Experts have earlier said that the number of cases in the state is expected to rise for another two weeks before it hits a plateau.With the western state being the worst affected owing to the ongoing second wave in the country, sources said that there might be tighter restrictions introduced in affected areas. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state-appointed task force, had earlier said that the government must look at restricting non-essential activities.“No one wants to economy to be hampered again due to a lockdown. But curbs can be put on non-essential activities, such as on morning and evening walkers, and on those who leave homes just for an outing, such as in parks or beaches. This will not affect any businesses, on those dependent on such business for their day-to-day income,” Dr Pandit had said.

04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Termination of service: HC awards up to ₹5-lakh relief to 16 Punjab financial corp ex-workers||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed Punjab Financial Corporation (PFC) to give a compensation of ₹65,000 for each year of service to 16 of its former workers terminated in the past 20 years. The court, however, put a ₹5-lakh cap on the maximum sum a worker will be paid.The high court acted on the plea of the former workmen, who had sought directions that corporation be directed to reinstate them or in the alternative appropriate compensation be granted for illegal termination of their services. A Patiala tribunal though had refused orders for their reinstatement, but directed that they be compensated with up to ₹8,000 for each year of service rendered by them. They were appointed between 1984 and 1994 and were working as watch and ward staff duties. The corporation deals in taking over properties in the case of default in re-payment by loanees. All the workmen were employed to carry out watch and ward duties over such properties. The corporation had opposed reinstatement as well as award of compensation, stating that there was no relationship of master and employee between them. The court found that the workmen were not appointed against a regular post and they were appointed for watch and ward staff duty of the units. In view of this, the court said that they are not entitled to reinstatement. As of compensation, it said that the court is required to balance the interest of both the parties. While the corporation is spending the public money on the other hand, workmen were chucked out of service without following the provisions of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947, have to be granted an appropriate relief. The orders of terminating the services of the workmen were passed without following the procedure under the law, the court held, directing that the petitioners will be entitled to compensation of ₹65,000 per year, subject to maximum cap of ₹5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/termination-of-service-hc-awards-up-to-5-lakh-relief-to-16-punjab-financial-corp-exworkers-101617477488983.html
04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Embers of spring||In the Shivalik foothill jungles that loom over the tricity, fires have flushed the complexion of predominant tawny-olive flora. Blood-stained, tiger claw-shaped or parakeet beak-shaped flowers of the ‘flame of the forest’ tree have come to abundant bloom. They are beauteous beacons to behold. A raging pyre of spring’s last rites, these April ‘phools’ embody an eloquent dread of summer’s advancing inferno.The awkward looking tree with a crooked trunk and ungainly branches sports the most unusual flowers, whose elegance has inspired poets as exalted as Rabindranath Tagore and enriched India’s diverse folk cultures. In contrast to the tree’s rugged grey bark, the blooms are silken to touch but lacking in the gentle, esoteric whiff of a jungle flower. The palash, dhak or tesu is the state flower of Chandigarh and three states, though it is a rare spectacle to behold within the city’s green lungs. However, nature enthusiasts would do well to drive out just 30 minutes from the heart of the city to savour clumps of palash trees in the foothills. They are especially visible along dry, seasonal rivulets. If the human soul revels in the tree’s post-Holi exuberance, an astonishing diversity of birds, bees, butterflies and insects are attracted to its blooms by its riveting colour, edible petals and nectarine gifts. It is not unusual to come across langoors on this tree or a civet silhouetted against bloom and moon. What was missing from the repertoire of photographs was a leopard clambering aboard the tree. Though the Shivaliks enjoy a good representation of leopards, no photographer has chanced upon that vivid spectacle. It was, therefore, a definitive moment in the palash’s reputation as one of the most unconditional hosts when photographers recently discovered a leopard clan amid the blooms in the Jawai hills of Rajasthan. I take great delight in sharing a mesmerising image with Wildbuzz readers. Repeat offenceLast week, another Sambar died in horrific, blood-curdling contortions after it was impaled while attempting to jump over the crude, spear-tipped fence that cuts off Nagar Van from Uttar Marg, opposite Sector 5. In November, a fawn had similarly perished while attempting a leap within the Sukhna Lake Nature Trail over a speared fence. The fence, whose height varies between 5.5-7ft, is a death trap for young, infirm and old sambars or those who panic and misjudge the leap while seeking foraging pastures outside Nagar Van. These senseless deaths anguished a Chandigarh-based educationist, Divye Mathur, who saw both the dead sambars impaled in brutal fashion while out for a walk early in the morning. Flagging the issue on social media, he said: “What is the point of these sharp spikes? These poor creatures had to die in such a brutal manner just because this killer boundary has been installed. Has it been installed to save wild animals or to kill them? Everywhere else a net fencing is installed around wildlife areas not these spear tips,” Mathur, a Sector-8 resident, told this writer.The good news is that the forest and wildlife department is finally rectifying the issue. “On a trial basis, we are welding flat plates on top of the spikes so as to remove the threat, especially along routes frequented by animals. If it works, we will remedy the fencing more exhaustively,” chief wildlife warden Debendra Dalai told this writer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-embers-of-spring-101617477071419.html

Prof Gill replaced Prof Amritpal Kaur, who, along with 39 other officials, had tendered resignation last week from their respective posts, citing alleged discrepancies in the working of V-C. The working of the university has come to standstill as none of the officials attended their office post resignations. Even the varsity was unable to hold finance committee and syndicate meetings on March 30 for approving the annual budget for 2021-22 financial year. On Wednesday, the V-C appointed Prof Varinder Kumar Kaushik as new registrar for one year. “I have held three meetings with Prof Amritpal in past one week and asked her about negligence in performing her duties as dean academic affairs. I have not received any satisfactory explanation from her side,” the V-C stated in her order issued on Saturday. She added that former dean academic affairs has not attended her office since March 26 due to which the varsity failed to hold key meetings, including finance committee and syndicate. “We need to make certain instant changes as smooth functioning of the institution has been disrupted due to recent episodes. Moreover, in interest of the varsity, such negligent approach could not be tolerated,” the V-C said. Meanwhile, Punjabi University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) Nishan Singh Deol said they not only condemned the appointment but also the language used by the vice-chancellor while issuing written orders. “The language used is derogatory for the teaching community, especially for Prof Amritpal Kaur, who had done her duty with full responsibility and commitment. She tendered resignation due to autocratic approach of the V-C,” Deol said. “We are writing again to Punjab governor and chancellor of the varsity VP Singh Badnore seeking his immediate intervention as the autonomous status of the institution has been encroached. We are also considering legal options in order to challenge the recent appointments in Punjab and Haryana high court,” Deol said. Meanwhile, the PUTA appealed to chancellor that “orders that are derogatory, divisive, technically and legally non-tenable and violative of the University Calendar should be declared null and void and revoked with immediate effect”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pbi-varsity-v-c-appoints-new-dean-academic-affairs-puta-fumes-101617476949426.html
04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: The battle of favourites||It is a truth universally acknowledged, that parents do not pick favourites among their children, even though their wards at different times may feel their sibling is the favoured one or vice versa. However, grandparents are free of any such compunctions, as the Punjabi saying goes ‘mool naalon, vyaaz payara’( interest is dearer than the principle), and as such blatantly love and pamper their grandchildren more than their own children.My wife and I came to this realisation when our first granddaughter was born in Canada. Our all-encompassing love for her brought us to Canada for a few months every year and when she turned two, we stayed with her for almost a year. As doting grandparents, we would make it a point to spend as much time as possible with her, happily volunteering to feed her, play with her, take her to the park and to the swings. Our bonding was so strong that when it came time to part, I felt choked with emotions. The idea of spending months without her seemed unfathomable. The toddler, however, mercifully, could hardly understand the pangs of separation. Treasuring memories Back in India, we would speak over the phone and visit Canada periodically and my yearning for her kept growing. Later, our grandson was born. However, we did not get to stay with him for long periods as we did with our granddaughter. He is equally dear to us but somewhere I have always had a special spot for my granddaughter. She grew up as a very playful and cheerful child. At times, we would miss her call and she would confidently leave a message on the answering machine. Those messages are a pleasure to hear even after all these years, making them one of my most treasured possessions. My grandson is not without endearing qualities. He is quiet, sharp and studious. A sensitive and emotional soul, he is happy to help with household chores and has a passion for baking and cooking. It is always a pleasure to indulge in long discussions on finances, cars, travel tourism, and sports with him. He wears his heart on his sleeve, once when we arrived for a surprise visit to Canada, he was moved to tears. Staking a claim Our granddaughter is his polar opposite, she is carefree, loves fast food and always finds excuses to not cook, and palm off household chores. She loves playing pranks on her grandparents but calls for us as soon as she spots a bug, spider or a fly. She recently celebrated her 16th birthday and received a new phone. She saved her number in my phone as ‘favourite grandchild’, clearly staking a claim. To reiterate her point, she has also fixed a ringtone which sings ‘favourite grandchild calling’ whenever she calls. As she is now eligible to get a driving licence, I have yet again volunteered to become her driving instructor as it gives me a chance to enjoy more of her magnetic personality. An intelligent child, she has picked up driving quickly, and I shall be sad once the lessons end. I have to concede that she is truly my favourite!

04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Delay in test results hits fight against pandemic in Chandigarh||At a time when Chandigarh and its satellite cities are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, which is turning out to be even more serious than the first wave, people getting tested are ending up waiting for up to six days to get their reports. The delay is proving detrimental in the fight against the pandemic, as it not only hits timely isolation but also contact tracing and declaration of containment zones.Around 2,000 tests are being conducting daily in Chandigarh, up from 1,300 on an average when the cases were declining in early February. Earlier, most of the people were undergoing rapid antigen tests, which provide quick results but are not that reliable. After the Centre issued directions to bump up RT-PCR tests to 70% of the total, the authorities were caught off guard as the testing capacity could not be stretched beyond 900 samples. Considered the gold standard of testing, RT-PCR tests have a longer turnaround time. Earlier, while the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research was testing around 300 to 400 samples daily, Government Medical College and Hospital was conducting around 100 tests.To increase the capacity, the authorities roped in private players, but the system is still to be streamlined, which is evident from the fact that residents are complaining that they have to wait for anywhere between three to six days to get test results. Lokesh Sharma, 70, who provided his sample at the Civil Hospital in Sector 45 on March 29 had not received his report till April 2. “I was told there is a huge rush, and thus processing of samples is taking time,” he said. Ashwani Kumar, a resident of Sector 48 who got his test results after five days on March 27, said the claims of the administration that everything is on track are false. “You cannot blame people for everything. How can a person isolate himself if he has no idea of the infection status?” he said.The Centre had recently asked Chandigarh to effectively implement the test-track-treat strategy and escalate testing till the positivity comes down below 5%. At present, the weekly test positivity rate is hovering around 13%, among the highest in the country. Vijoy Kumar Singh, additional secretary and financial adviser, Union ministry of textiles, who is heading the central team sent to Chandigarh to assist the local authorities in containing the Covid-19 surge, said he was aware of the delay in test reports and the administration will be advised to bring down the turnaround time to 24 hours.Dr Ravi Gupta, medical superintendent of GMCH, said the lab at the hospital is functioning round the clock and all samples are being tested within 48 hours. Arun Kumar Gupta, UT health secretary, said the system is being streamlined and delays, if any, should be brought to the notice of the authorities. Meanwhile, a senior health official, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that the department was receiving complaints about delayed test results. “In the present scenario, reports should be made available within 16 hours, or at most within 24 hours. Otherwise, the infection will spread further,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delay-in-test-results-hits-fight-against-pandemic-in-chandigarh-101617476708928.html

He added that over the last year, they have incurred a loss of around ₹40 crore owing to the pandemic. Tourism industry’s contribution to the state’s economy is around 7%. Majority of the weekend visitors to Himachal are from the neighboring states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Chandigarh. Tourists from Haryana and Chandigarh prefer hill stations such as Kasuali and Chail over Shimla. But the pandemic-forced restrictions have meant that fewer tourists from Punjab are visiting the hills. “Himachal also sees a large number of tourists from Gujarat and Maharashtra in the months of March and April, but owing to the fresh surge in cases and travel restrictions, we have hardly been getting any visitors from these two states,” said Mohinder Seth, a Shimla-based hotelier and president of the Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association. Seth added, “The increased tourist flow in winter months had given us some hope but now, we are back to square one.” He further said that the industry received no help from the government and hoteliers are reeling under the burden of heavy bills in the form of water charges and property tax. “If the government does not extend us timely help, the industry will crumble,” said Seth. Vijay Inder Karan, a Dharamshala-based hotelier, said the occupancy which had reached 40-50% in December has again come down below 10%. “There are no advance bookings. We only get walk-in tourists,” said Karan.After the peak tourists’ season of December and mid-January, it is the Chaitra Navratri festival that attracts a stream of domestic holidaymakers from West Bengal and Maharashtra to the hill states in March and April. Foreigners start descending by June-mid for adventure tourism with the opening of high mountain passes after winter snowfall. In the fiscal year 2020-2021, a total of 32, 13, 379 tourists visited the hills, which comprised 31, 70, 714 domestic and 42, 665 foreigners. In 2019-2020, the number stood at 1, 72, 12, 107, of which 1, 68, 29, 231 were domestic travelers and 3,82, 876 foreigners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/weekend-tourism-sees-a-dip-in-hp-amid-second-wave-101617476528962.html

Besides having close interaction with the veterans, who were finding themselves neglected in the past, special efforts are being made to bring those to the party fold who were feeling ‘unhappy’ or had been ‘expelled’ in the recent past. “The Congress has begun making efforts to bring the party veterans back into its fold. They never went away from us. They are our leaders and will always remain with the party,” said a senior Congress leader, adding, “UPCC held a meeting of party’s former legislators and MPs last month. The party now proposes to hold a get together of former district and city party unit chiefs soon.” The Congress party’s move to expel 10 senior leaders, who held separate celebrations to mark birth anniversary of former prime minister late Jawahar Lal Nehru on November 14 in 2019, led to an apparent divide between UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu’s new team and the old guards. The expelled veterans though held separate programmes to mark the party’s foundation day on December 28, 2019, the divide continued to grow. While the party later revoked the expulsion of a senior leader, others are still waiting for such a gesture. Those aware of the development said efforts had been stepped up to bring all the partymen together following appointment of former MLA Satish Ajmani as the UPCC treasurer last month. It is learnt that the party high command is upset with the growing divide between the new team and the old guards and wants a united front ahead of the assembly elections. Ajmani though refused to comment those close to him said he had been contacting the old guards on day-to-day basis. UPCC president Ajy Kumar Lallu has also gone on record that the state Congress was working to bring all the partymen together, especially those who left the party for some reason. It is learnt that the high command was in favour of finding a middle path. “Those expelled on the charges of indiscipline are our senior leaders. A move to withdraw the expulsion may be made anytime if those expelled express regret for their conduct. We are moving close to finding a middle path,” said another leader. “We have heard that some senior leaders have taken up our case with the high command that is not happy with reports of a divide between the old and the new. We hope a decision in this regard is taken soon,” said one such party veteran.“The Congress has been facing a leadership crisis at the state level too. If the Congress is bringing them back, the party should also think about changing the situation that compelled the veterans to leave the party. Congress president Sonia Gandhi may also consider taking a call on changing the party’s leadership at different levels,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-polls-up-cong-extends-olive-branch-to-disgruntled-veterans-101617476470687.html
04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: When Dhoni, Irfan got their first chopper joyride||The year was 2006. I had embarked on a new career in civil aviation as a commercial pilot after prematurely retiring from the Indian Army. Little did I know that I would get a chance to take cricketing legends Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Irfan Pathan for a joyride on my helicopter.At the time, I was working for an air charter company whose major clients were political parties. Sometimes we flew great distances to reach the spot where we had been hired for a few hours. On one such occasion, I flew a helicopter from New Delhi to Guwahati. It involved a flying time of approximately eight hours with a night halt at Patna.The day after landing at Guwahati, we were ready for a day of flying to a few political meetings. Remarkably, we had been hired to fly members of the Samajwadi Party and Telugu Desam Party, who had little stake in the region as far as I knew. It turned out they had come to campaign in support of the Asom Gana Parishad, which was hoping to dethrone the Congress government. Everything went off smoothly and we were back at the Guwahati airport by late afternoon. The politicians went back to New Delhi in their chartered jet and we went back to our hotel as we could only start our return journey the next day.A hitch in the planHowever, on the day of our return, which was also happened to be the day of the one-day international between India and England, we had filed our flight plan for our trip to Patna and were just checking the aircraft when one of the air traffic controllers came running and requested us to help the organisers of the match who were in a fix . I told him that we had to fly back immediately to keep up with our schedule, but he requested us to wait for the cricket official, who was on the way to the airport.I relented and delayed our departure. Soon the man was with us. He told us that an overnight torrential downpour had rendered the cricket stadium at Guwahati unsuitable for the game, much to the disappointment of fans who had turned up for the match.The organisers wanted to hire our helicopter for an hour to try and dry the outfield by the downdraft of the hovering helicopter.I told him that it would be a useless endeavour as there was not enough time, but he told us that they wanted to show the restive crowd that all options had been exhausted before cancelling the match. They were afraid that the crowd would go on the rampage and cause extensive damage to the stadium if the match were to be cancelled. So, we decided to help them out provided they paid us ₹95,000. He immediately agreed to pay us the moment we landed at the stadium.Crowd electrifiedSoon, we were hovering over different wet patches, knowing as we did it that it was not going to work. The crowd, however, sent up a big cheer as the helicopter flew to different parts of the ground. After about 40 minutes of hovering, we got a signal to land back, and the engineer told us that a couple of cricketers wanted to get on board for a ride. On my approval, a stocky looking guy with long shoulder length hair and another lanky guy approached the helicopter. I recognised them as Dhoni and Pathan, who were both very promising and budding cricketers at the time.We resumed the hovering and the two of them were absolutely thrilled as this was the first time they had been on a helicopter. Finally, before ending the sortie, I decided to give them a treat. I took off and climbed up to 500ft and then did a speed run across the stadium, during which I dived down to 10ft above the ground and then did a pull up. I finally ended with a wing over before landing back. The two young lads were whooping with joy at the thrill of it all. Hands were shaken and after unloading them we went back to the airport. Our mission in aid of Indian Cricket was done. As predicted, the match had to be cancelled after another couple of hours.After refueling, we took off for our first port of landing, Bagdogra. As I flew back, I marvelled at our mission that was a win-win for all. We got an additional ₹95,000, the crowd was pleased with the effort, the organisers heaved a sigh of relief as the crowd did not riot and there were two happy cricketers who had the thrill of their first chopper ride. I had also done my bit for the sport that I loved so much!( The Gurugram-based writer is a Vir Chakra awardee)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-when-dhoni-irfan-got-their-first-chopper-joyride-101617476470252.html

As Bengaluru expanded , it began adding villages within its limits. In her book ‘The Promise of the Metropolis’, author Janaki Nair writes that between 1901 and 1971 Bengaluru absorbed around 100 villages into the city structure and by 2020, the city added over 500 urban villages. The katees are a link to the old. Despite this expansion, the villages retained their old ways. One of them was Trees, especially banyan and pipal, have been culturally important in the city’s culture often acting as a glue for a community. “The ashwath kattes are an epicentre of sacred and social gatherings. People have been passing on this tradition to generations, even though the city has been expanding rapidly around them,” said Kiran Keswani, the co-founder of ‘veryday City Lab and researcher on the katte culture. The kattes are just a part of Bengaluru’s history with trees which dates backs to the inception of the city itself. AN Yellappa Reddy, a former forest official and environmentalist says Bengaluru’s founder Kempegowda encouraged his followers to build tanks and plant trees. “He introduced ‘udyana vanas’ (pleasure gardens) and ’pushpa vatikas’ (temple gardens) with trees from outside the city,” Reddy said. According to him, in 1760, Hyder Ali, the father of Tipu Sultan, envisioned Lal Bagh on the line of the Mughal gardens. “He introduced trees from Delhi, Arcot, Multan and even Lahore to the city,” Reddy added. This was continued by Tipu Sultan who added 30 more acres of greenery to the city and added to the variety with plants from Kabul, then Persia, and Mauritius. Gustav Krumbiegel, who took over as the botanist for Lal Bagh, introduced more exotic plants from Africa, Burma, Australia, Singapore, Russia and America. According to the horticulture department, today Lal Bagh has one of the largest varieties of trees in the world.Two mango trees planted by Tipu Sultan are still part of the city’s collection. But the expansion of the city has come at the cost of some old trees. A committee set up by the Karnataka High Court, on March 2, said that as many as 100 heritage trees can be saved if the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL) makes minor changes in the alignment of four road widening projects proposed in areas surrounding Bengaluru. This was one of many projects where a large number of trees were facing the axe in the city. A 607-page report submitted by an expert committee constituted by the High Court said that a majority of these trees are at least 50 years old and as tall as a two-storied building. In this case, the number of trees recommended for transplantation is 1,737. The report adds that while the forest department has approved the felling of 5,297 trees, the committee has found it necessary to cut only 1,721. Vijay Nishant, an environmentalist, who is also known as the tree doctor, said that during his surveys he found that recent development work has changed the ecosystem in the city. “We were used to trees blooming throughout the year in the 1990s but now, it has changed drastically because of tree cutting. We are conducting a survey to record what trees Bengaluru has lost over the years to make a case for cutting fewer trees.” According to Harini Nagendra, a Bengaluru based environmentalist and columnist for Hindustan Times, Bengaluru’s older trees had a diverse distribution with several large-sized species. “However, the newer trees in the city are less diverse. They are mostly small-statured with narrow canopies.” She added that the lack of variety has serious implications for the city’s ecology. “There is a need to protect large street trees on wide roads from tree felling, and to select an appropriate and diverse mix of large and small-sized species for new planting.” Meanwhile, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) in its budget has earmarked ₹214 crore in comparison to last year’s ₹84 crore for the maintenance of around 1,200 parks in Bengaluru. Another ₹39 crore has been allocated to the forest department and there are plans to plant a million saplings this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/urbanisation-bid-crowds-out-bengaluru-s-cherished-trees-101617475630855.html

The order restores the services of former temple head priest Dr A V Ramana Deekshitulu, who was forced to retire three years back on attaining the age of superannuation at 65 years, a spokesman of the TTD said. Deekshitulu confirmed to HT that he had received the orders and he would be taking over as the head priest of the temple again. “Along with me, at least 10 others of the Tirumala temple and other associated temples like Lord Padmavathi temple at Tiruchanur and Govindarajulu Swamy temple at Tirupati, have also got back their jobs,” he said. On May 16, 2018, the TTD, for the first time, introduced retirement rule for the priests, according to which all those who attained the age of 65 years would have to retire. The rule was brought in at the TTD board meeting following serious allegations of corruption in the temple administration made by Deekshitulu the previous day. Deekshitulu had alleged that the administrators of the temple were siphoning off the temple money and destroying its sanctity and demanded an open audit into the donations received and expenditure incurred by the TTD. He also alleged that precious ancient jewellery of the temple went missing and demanded that the TTD be brought under the purview of the Right to Information Act. Along with Deekshitulu, three other priests – Narasimha Deekshitulu, Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu and Narayana Deekshitulu – were also forced to retire. In their place, the TTD appointed four other priests. After the YSR Congress government came to power, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had done away with the rule of retirement for priests, following a high court order of December 2018, which said the retirement rule would not be applicable to the temple priests. The Jagan government issued an order in October 2019 stating that there would be no retirement for the priests of various temples on the basis of age. “A priest shall continue in the post till he is physically fit to perform his archakatvam (priesthood) duties,” the order said. However, the order was not made applicable to TTD, as it is governed by its own rules. As a result, Deekshitulu could not get back his post. Instead, the TTD appointed him as Agama advisor and also honorary chief priest. Now, with the new order, Deekshitulu will be re-joining the duties as head priest of the Tirumala temple. Of the remaining three main priests of the temple, Srinivasa Murthy died of Covid-19 on July 20 last year. The remaining two would also be getting back their jobs in the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/retired-tirumala-priests-back-into-service-after-ttd-restores-their-jobs-for-life-101617475630249.html
04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh logs 300+ Covid cases after 6 months||For the first time since the first wave in September last year, the number of daily Covid-19 cases crossed the 300 mark in Chandigarh on Saturday. Noting the surge, wherein more than 250 cases are being reported daily for the past 10 days, the health department issued an advisory on Saturday, claiming that the present wave is more infectious and virulent and could send more people to hospitals with moderate to severe disease. The UT had touched the peak of 449 cases on September 13, while more than 300 cases were last reported on September 16. The same day the number of active cases had reached 3,171, the highest so far. With 310 people testing positive on Saturday, the number now stands at 3,162, just nine below the peak. However, during the first wave, the average positivity rate in September had shot up to 16%, which remained around 9% in March. Still, concern remains over the weekly positivity rate of 13%, which places Chandigarh among top three states and UTs. Meanwhile, the number of total cases has reached 27,853. While 24,309 patients have recovered, 382 have died, including a 74-year-old man from Sector 40 who was the lone fatality reported on Saturday. Even as cases are rising at a fast pace, only 28 deaths have been reported since March 1. In September last year, 106 deaths were reported. However, the impact of the heavy case load in September was seen over the next four months, as even though the number of cases were on a downward trend, fatalities kept going up till December.“The effect of the present surge will start to be seen in terms of fatalities in the next two weeks, and that is why immediate control measures should be taken,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. In its advisory, the health department has urged people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour, wear masks, maintain appropriate social distance, avoid crowding and wash their hands regularly. “For your own safety, get vaccinated. This will protect you from severe illness,” stated the release.Mohali clocks 360, P’kula 82 casesMohali district continues to report bulk of the cases in the tricity, with 360 people testing positive on Saturday. Panchkula reported a drop to 82 cases, which took the tricity’s total to 752, a day after 889 cases, the highest since the outbreak, had surfaced. At 3,529, Mohali has the highest number of active cases in the tricity, and Panchkula has the lowest with 1,033 people undergoing treatment. The numbers are among the highest in their respective states.Mohali’s total has reached 27,881, of which 23,910 patients have recovered and 442 have died, including two reported on Saturday. In Panchkula, 13,453 people have tested positive so far, of whom 12,266 have been cured and 154 have succumbed to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-breaches-300-mark-after-6-months-101617475570291.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi again reports over 3.5k new Covid cases, 10 deaths||Delhi reported over 3,500 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the second day in a row, adding 3,567 on Saturday to take the total tally to 672,381, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The city also reported 10 deaths due to the infection.The fewer tests conducted on Friday – reported a day later in Saturday’s bulletin – resulted in an increase in the city’s positivity rate to 4.5%. There were 79,617 tests reported on Saturday as against 87,505 the day before, pushing the positivity rate up from 4.11%.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – is an indication of the ongoing transmission in an area. Experts believe the transmission is under control if the positivity rate remains below 5%.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageDelhi’s positivity rate has remained below 5% for 122 days now, but its rise has experts worried.“This is a new wave of cases in Delhi and it is largely happening because people are not following Covid appropriate behaviour. Even with a 56% seroprevalence and many people having received the vaccine, there is still a sizeable chunk of people who are susceptible and this increase and decrease in cases will continue till there are. Also, we need to remember that this seropositivity is not uniformly distributed – it is high in slums and other densely populated areas and low in posh localities. Those who had been inside their homes for so long, started venturing out when the number of cases went down leading to the current increase,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor in the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The experts called for an increase in the pace of vaccination.“My thinking is that what we are seeing today is the impact of deeds done two to three weeks back. Whatever you may do now will not stop the escalation tomorrow. We need to stop all unnecessary gatherings and outings and we need to vaccinate more people,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also agreed, urging the centre to open up the vaccination drive. “The only way to swiftly break the chain of the COVID-19 virus is to vaccinate people of all ages. Mass vaccination, and not full-lockdown, is the way to defeat this deadly virus,” said Sisodia after he and his family received the first dose of Covaxin at the Maulana Azad Medical College associated with Lok Nayak hospital.“I request the Government of India to increase the supply of Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi and begin the vaccination drive for citizens below the age of 45, if we want to stop the spread of the virus. We aim to vaccinate all the citizens of Delhi by May 3 or 4, once the Delhi Government receives a good number of Covid-19 vaccine doses by the Central Government,” he said.Delhi saw a record number of immunisations on Saturday, with over 80,000 jabs being administered in a day for the first time. The increase was largely driven by people between the ages of 45 and 59 for whom the vaccination drive opened up on Thursday. Nearly 46,000 of the total shots were administered in this category on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-again-reports-over-3-5k-new-covid-cases-10-deaths-101617475211564.html
04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination drive gets a boost in Chandigarh||The extension of Covid-19 vaccine to all above 45 years of age from April 1 has given a much-needed fillip to the drive in Chandigarh.In the previous weeks, the number of people vaccinated was seeing a constant decline, and dropped to 8,188 between March 20 and 26. However, in the following week (March 27-April 2), it went up to 9,559.Between March 1 — when along with senior citizens, people in the age group of 45-59 and having comorbidities were allowed to get the vaccine — and March 31, only 4,164 in the latter group had received the first dose. However, just within three days after the restrictions were removed, the number shot up to 10,113.The response among the seniors, however, is dwindling. In the first half of March, around 19,000 people took the jab, but the number in the latter half of the month dropped to around 12,000.A total of 88,299 doses have been administered in the city so far. The coverage among health-care workers stands at 52%; among the front-line workers from other departments, only 60% of the registered employees have been inoculated.The low response, when compared to the city’s daily capacity of inoculating 7,000 persons, has prompted the UT health department to start the exercise of mapping all households with members above the age of 45 years.As per the plan, dispensary-level health workers will cover the area under their jurisdiction to identify reasons of poor coverage and apprehensions among the people. The move is aimed at motivating people and allaying their fears.Dr Amandeep Kang, UT director of health services, said, “Vaccination is the key to break the transmission chain at the earliest. With vaccines, the severity of the disease will lower and mortality rate will come down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-drive-gets-a-boost-in-chandigarh-101617475211049.html
04-04-2021||Other||TDP asks HC to monitor CBI probe into murder of CM Jagan’s uncle||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Saturday urged the Andhra Pradesh High Court to review the progress of the probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the murder of former MP YS Vivekananda Reddy, uncle of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. YS Vivekananda Reddy was murdered on March 15 , 2019 at his house in Pulivendula.“Narreddy Sunitha, daughter of Viveka (as the former MP is better known), is going from pillar to post in New Delhi, seeking to know the progress of the investigation into her father’s death. It was unfortunate that she was pleading with the media in Delhi to investigate her father’s death,” TDP politburo member and general secretary Varla Ramaiah said.Ramaiah said it was unfortunate that no headway was made in the case even a year after the case was handed over to the CBI by the state High Court.He pointed out that soon after Viveka’s murder weeks before the assembly elections in the state, Jagan Reddy tried to gain political mileage by pointing an accusing finger at the then TDP government and filed a petition in the High Court demanding a CBI inquiry into his uncle’s murder. “But after he became the chief minister in May 2019, Jagan withdrew the petition in the High Court withdrawing his demand. Does it not mean he was aware of the killers?” Ramaiah asked.Also read: ‘Don’t trust SEC’ - TDP boycotts MPTC, ZPTC polls in Andhra PradeshHe requested the High Court to intervene in the matter and direct the CBI to expedite the investigation, in view of the growing suspicions among the people that the probe was being suppressed deliberately.On Friday, Sunitha told reporters in Delhi that she had met with the top CBI officials and requested them to speed up the investigation into her father’s death. She expressed several doubts over the slow progress of the probe and even alleged that some people were pressuring her to give up her fight for a speedy probe.“It was purely a political murder. So far, not a single person has been arrested or questioned. A key witness in the case died last year and we suspect he was murdered. If the investigation is delayed, there would be no further witnesses in the case in future,” she said.Sunitha said she was shocked when a senior police official told her not to press further on her father’s murder case. “He said such political killings are very common in Kurnool and Kadapa. He told me to forget whatever had happened and drop the case in the interest of my children’s future,” she said.“My father was an ex-MP and ex-minister. He was the brother of former chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy and uncle of present chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. If the CBI cannot crack this murder case even after a year, what will become of the cases pertaining to the common people?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tdp-asks-hc-to-monitor-cbi-probe-into-murder-of-cm-jagan-s-uncle-101617474729570.html

04-04-2021||Chandigarh||Random testing: 86 educators in Chandigarh have tested +ve since March 16||Eighty-six teachers and lecturers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Chandigarh since March 16 when the health department initiated random testing in different schools and colleges. The department has conducted 3,122 tests since March 16. The drive was kicked off at the Postgraduate Government College, Sector 11, where four people tested positive. The highest number of positive cases were found at Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 45, where 17 infections were detected, followed by GMSSS, Karsan, where 15 cases were detected and GMSSS Sector 22-A where 12 cases were detected. Six cases each were reported from GMSSS, Dhanas and Sector 52. Of 43 schools and colleges where tests were conducted, 20 reported zero cases.Though the health teams were also supposed to test students, none came forward for testing. “Students were required to bring a consent form duly signed by their parents, which they did not furnish. An announcement regarding the same was made on March 19. However, from March 23 onwards, all educational institutions were closed for students till April 5,” officials said.UT education director Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We are complying with the administration’s directions. Wherever a teacher was found positive, extensive contact tracing was carried out. Government teachers have been allowed to take up to 30 days of leave, in case they test positive. The institutions have also been sanitised.”UT Cadre of Educational Employees Union president Swarn Singh Kamboj said, “With cases increasing across the city, it was a good call to close schools for students. However, teachers should also be given a few days off.”“While teachers are following all protocols, some lapses cannot be avoided. Sometimes teachers eat together, which can cause the infection to spread,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-testing-86-educators-in-ut-have-tested-ve-since-mar-16-101617473830433.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||Man held for vandalising temple over ‘grudge against god’||A 28-year-old homeless man was arrested for allegedly vandalising a temple in west Delhi’s Paschim Puri Pocket 2 near Punjabi Bagh on Saturday. The man allegedly told police that he attacked the temple to “settle a score with god”.The incident briefly caused tension in the area with visuals of the vandalism making their way onto social media. Police, however, quickly denied any communal angle in the incident.The temple that was vandalised was the Vaishno Mata Mandir, located near a residential colony in the locality.Police said the man, who they identified as Vicky Mal, had lost his livelihood during the Covid-19 lockdown last year.Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam said the 47-year-old temple priest Ranjeet Pathak called the police at around 8.45 am and reported the vandalism. A police team was then immediately sent to the spot, he said.“The priest told police that he had locked the temple gates at around midnight on Friday,” said Gautam. “When he opened it on Saturday, he found statues outside the temple slightly displaced, and bricks and stones, which were not there earlier, on the floor inside.”Police said they scanned CCTV footage from nearby that showed a man outside the temple at around 12.30 am.“He was seen throwing bricks at the statue outside. He also climbed the gate and threw stones inside. He was there for about 20 minutes and then left the area. He did not enter the temple,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named. “We identified the suspect as Vicky Mal, who had no home in Delhi, and caught him from near Raghubir Nagar drain. He was wearing the same clothes as seen in the CCTV footage.”Additional DCP Gautam said they questioned Mal.“He told us that he had come to Delhi with his father some years ago and they were scrap collectors and sellers,” said Gautam. “However, their business failed during the lockdown and Mal’s father returned to Bihar, while he stayed back. As he had no source of livelihood and no place to live, he had a grudge against god for giving him the life of a homeless person and vandalised the temple.”Mal was arrested and booked under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) covering deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage reli­gious feelings and trespassing, at Punjabi Bagh police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-held-for-vandalising-temple-over-grudge-against-god-101617473410915.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||Police lodge two FIRs in constable’s wife suicide case||Two days after the wife of a Delhi Police constable allegedly died by suicide inside their home in Ghitorni and her two sons – aged three years and three months – were found unconscious in the bathroom of the house, the police have registered two cases in connection to the incident.While a case of dowry death has been registered against the constable and his family on a complaint received from the woman’s relatives, a second case of attempt to murder of the two children was registered against the constable’s wife. The constable has been removed from the police station where he was posted and has been sent to district lines till further orders, said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh.The police have also requested the Delhi government to constitute a medical board to conduct the autopsy of the constable’s wife, whose body has been preserved at the mortuary of a government hospital.On Thursday evening around 8pm, the constable made two calls to the police to inform that the door of his flat was locked from inside and his wife had failed to respond to his repeated knocks and calls. A police team later reached the spot and broke open the door to find the constable’s wife hanging from a ceiling fan. The children were found unconscious in the bathroom with their mouth gagged with cloth and were rushed to a private hospital for treatment. While the condition of the younger child was serious, the elder son was stated to be stable.Police suspect the woman might have gagged and poisoned her kids, before hanging herself from the fan . No suicide note, however, was recovered from the house. The couple married in 2014 and lived in a two-bedroom flat.Help is just a call away: Snehi: 011-65978181; Sumaitri: 011-23389090||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-lodge-two-firs-in-constable-s-wife-suicide-case-101617473409815.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade barbs over proposed increase in parking charges in south Delhi||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) proposal to double the rates of surface parking was another method devised by the civic agency to loot people.The BJP, however, was quick to deny this allegation and said that the AAP should stop misleading citizens.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, senior AAP leader and MLA from Kalkaji constituency Atishi said this was the tenth time within a year that the BJP-ruled south civic body had come up with a proposal to increase surface-level parking rates, by as much as 100%.“The standing committee of SDMC has released a proposal to increase the surface parking rates by around 100%. This means, if this proposal is notified, people will have to pay double to park their cars at any marketplace, mall or Metro station. This decision will directly affect those living in all areas of south Delhi” she said.Atishi further said that the south corporation had also proposed imposing professional taxes, raising the rate of property taxes, and increased the rate of tax for property transfer by 1%. “They have even increased the commercial taxes,” she said.“We want them to take back this recommendation, and the SDMC must not approve it. Otherwise, it shall be extremely upsetting for the people of Delhi,” Atishi said.The Delhi BJP, however, urged the AAP and its leaders to stop misleading people. “Parking rates in general have not been increased by the SDMC. A multi-level parking has been constructed by the south civic body near Green Park market and to encourage its use, the rates of parking on Green Park road have been increased, that too as per the directive of the Supreme Court,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.Meanwhile, AAP’s Vikas Goyal, who is also the Leader of Opposition in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, alleged that despite an increase in house tax collection by ₹100 crore, the civic body was not giving salaries to its employees.“The BJP ruled north corporation last year collected ₹548 crore as house tax and this time they have collected ₹100 crore more. Despite this, they have not paid the salaries of their employees. I want to ask Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta why is the BJP not paying salaries,” he said.The Delhi BJP rejected Goyal’s comment and said the north corporation has been able to release salaries of all its employees till January 31 this year with the increased contribution of property tax.“By next week, the wages for February of sanitation and health staff will be released. Goyal should understand that economics of north corporation will improve only when Delhi government releases the constitutional funds. If Goyal actually cares for salaries of municipal staff and development works, then he should take up the matter of funds with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” said Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-trade-barbs-over-proposed-increase-in-parking-charges-in-south-delhi-101617473410279.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||New academic session on but govt yet to initiate entry-level EWS/DG admissions||The admission process for general category children on 75% seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten (KG), and class 1 — in private schools concluded on March 31, and most schools have started classes from April 1. But the government is yet to announce the schedule for a separate admission process it conducts for 25% seats reserved under EWS/DG categories, as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act, to these classes in private schools.Kamal Singh, who works at a garment shop in Laxmi Nagar, east Delhi is worried about the admission of his five-year-old son. Singh, who hails from Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi district, said that he had come to Delhi three years ago just to ensure good education for his son. “I had heard about EWS admission from my elder brother, whose two kids are enrolled in a private school. I also want my son to study in a good school like them. We had moved to Delhi immediately after his birth. This year he is eligible for nursery admission and we are still waiting for the process to begin. Online classes have already begun for other children in many schools. I don’t know how my son will catch up,” he said.Every year, at least two lists of selected candidates under the EWS/DG category is released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) before the commencement of the academic session. This year, the application process for the general category was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Another parent, Anil Kumar, a labourer at Molarband extension in Badarpur, said he is seeking admission under the EWS category for his sons, aged 5 and 6. “I have never been to a school. But I want both my sons to get a good education. We went to schools near our home but were told that the admission process has not even started for EWS students. I don’t know why the government is delaying the admission process for poor children. Who will make up for their loss?” he asked.Officials at the DoE said that the process this year got delayed due to the prevailing pandemic. “The directorate has already sought information about the number of available EWS/DG seats from all private schools. We are waiting for the situation to normalise before issuing the admission notification. We will try to speed up the process to minimise academic loss of students,” an official said.A senior official from the Delhi government’s education department added, “The government will surely conduct admission on the reserved category seats. Parents should not be worried. The department is working on some final modalities.”Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working with EWS children in Delhi, said, “Even if the government starts the admission process from this week, the application process will continue till May. Another one month will go for completing the admission, and then the summer vacations will begin. It means these students will join classes, offline or online, only in July. By that time, general category students would have covered a big part of the syllabus. This will put children, who are already from the marginalised section, at a disadvantaged position.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-academic-session-on-but-govt-yet-to-initiate-entry-level-ews-dg-admissions-101617473408589.html
04-04-2021||Delhi||DU colleges demand clear guidelines on trips during Covid-19 pandemic||Delhi University (DU) colleges on Saturday asked the varsity administration to come out with “clear guidelines” on trips during the pandemic, after 13 students from St Stephen’s College tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a “chapel trip”.Later on Saturday, DU announced that it was restricting entry of outsiders into its campuses and cancelled all bookings for events at college conference centres and seminar halls, in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, till further orders.The St Stephen’s students had returned from the trip, arranged by the college, to Dalhousie on March 31 and tested positive on Friday. While the DU administration said that the college did not consult it, St Stephen’s principal John Varghese had told a college governing body member on email, which HT has seen, that they had taken permission from the students’ parents for the trip. Two staff members who had travelled with the group also tested positive and all the patients are in isolation within the campus, college officials, who did not wish to be named, said.Delhi University’s spokesperson Balram Pani, who is also the varsity’s Dean of Colleges said, “The university has been releasing instructions from time to time to colleges asking them to adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The college (St Stephen’s) decided to take a trip amid the pandemic without consulting with the University administration ... they are responsible for this carelessness.”St Stephen’s principal Varghese did not respond to several calls and texts for a comment on the issue.But faculty members at several DU colleges said the university should not blame St Stephen’s in the absence of any clear guidelines.“Why is there no clarity from the administration’s side on if the colleges can take students for trips amid the pandemic? Many colleges are organising trips. DU could order only mandatory educational trips as required for courses,” said an associate professor, requesting anonymity.Principals from Dyal Singh College and Shaheed Bhagat Singh College (evening) confirmed that they had recently organised students’ trips that is required for their coursework.“It was for final-year geography students and was required for their course. We took all measures and all our students are safe. Besides, there had been no guidelines from the university administration regarding educational trips,” said Sudhir Sinha, principal of Shaheed Bhagat Singh College (evening).“There is no restriction on travel at present in the country. Also, our educational trip was organised days before the surge of Covid-19 in Delhi. We took all the necessary precautions and all our students are safe,” said Vinod Paliwal, principal of Dyal Singh College.But a university academic council member insisted that caution was key at this time.“Since both these colleges, unlike Stephen’s, don’t have hostels, we would not know if any student was infected or symptomatic. DU administration should issue guidelines regarding outstation trips,” said the member who did not wish to be named.DU spokesperson Pani said that the administration may issue a new notification on Monday.DU registrar Vikas Gupta, meanwhile on Saturday, issued fresh guidelines to all colleges and departments after an emergent meeting. “All students are advised to stay at home /hostel and avoid physical presence for their academic work at libraries, laboratories, unless very essential. Entry will be restricted inside faculty of science, faculty of arts, hostels, and halls. No outsider will be permitted,” the order stated. “The situation will be reviewed after 10 days and further decisions will be taken accordingly. The University of Delhi urges all its colleges, departments, centres, and hostels to remain vigilant to handle the present Covid-19 situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-colleges-demand-clear-guidelines-on-trips-after-st-stephen-s-students-test-positive-for-covid19-101617473408108.html
04-04-2021||Pune||Pune’s vaccination model a silver lining in fight against Covid||Pune’s vaccination model proves to be a success and the district has been vaccinating close to 70,000 beneficiaries, which is now the highest in the state. The administration is now prepping to vaccinate about one lakh beneficiaries daily starting from Monday.In the past one week, Pune has reported highest per day vaccinations, followed by Mumbai, Kolhapur and then Nagpur.On Saturday, Pune district reported its highest vaccination numbers so far as 76,954 people got the jab.Since April 1 the central government has approved vaccination for all above 45 years which makes 28 lakh people in the district eligible for vaccination.Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner, Pune division, during the meeting on Saturday with the administration and hospitals, head and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) said that one principal reason why Pune has registered a higher number of cases over the past few weeks is the higher number of infected people arriving from other countries in the city through other cities like Mumbai, New Delhi and Ahmedabad.He said, “Due to the new criteria of the active patient caseload in the vaccine dispatches to the districts across the countries has enabled Pune district to secure a larger number of vaccines over the last few days. Within the division, quick replenishment of the vaccine supplies is being ensured and any bottlenecks if any are being brought to the notice of the administration.”“We need to push the vaccination drive to 1,00,000 from April 5 and also daily for the coming days. As the administration, we have ensured hospitals all support in addressing the issues relating to stocks of vaccines and logistics. Pune is already the number one district in the country in terms of vaccination,” he said.Rao has also agreed to allow the hospitals to vaccinate citizens from 9am to 9pm.Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, who also participated in the virtual meeting, said, “Aggressive vaccination drive in the coming days would be helpful to prevent a larger wave in the coming weeks. Data from Israel, UK and USA suggest that vaccinating larger sections of the population has helped in preventing deaths and instances of hospitalisation.”“A weekly plan of vaccination can be drawn up instead of a daily appointment schedule to manage the crowds better. Many of the citizens turn up without appointments which puts pressure on the system,” he said.Sudhir Mehta-President, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) and lead coordinator for Pune platform for Covid response, said, “If we can vaccinate all the currently eligible beneficiaries then we as a district can request the Centre to further ease the vaccination criteria for other age groups. Pune could become the first district to vaccinate one lakh daily and also vaccinates the highest number of beneficiaries in the country.”Rao, meanwhile, said that there is room to increase the available beds to treat Covid patients as we have not even reached 80 per cent of the bed availability of last year’s peak even though the daily infections have increased from 5,200 from last year’s peak to 9,200 currently.“Of course it is a comforting factor that rate of hospitalisation and deaths is on the lower side in this wave. However, every available bed category needs to be utilised judiciously – for example, the ventilators need to be reallocated to a more critical patient and the treated patient may be shifted to oxygen bed/another required resource,” he said adding that many hospitals can convert their conference rooms /corridors into oxygen centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-vaccination-model-a-silver-lining-in-fight-against-covid-101617469387937.html

04-04-2021||Pune||PWD plans restoration of Chhatrapati Shivaji market in Camp||The Public Works Department (PWD) has started taking measurements of the burnt structure of the Chhatrapati Shivaji market in Pune Camp and work for the restoration of the market is likely to start by April end. PWD superintendent Atul Chavan assured stall holders that the restoration and repair work for the preservation of the British era heritage structure will begin by month end. The stall holders association had met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who had instructed the PWD department to start the restoration work at the earliest. PWD superintendent Chavan visited the market on Thursday and carried out the measurements. “As part of the development plan, 25 shops will be reconstructed and restored,” he said . A massive fire broke out at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market on the night of March 15 which destroyed at least 25 shops in the fish and chicken section of the market. Fire tenders from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) were rushed to the spot and the fire was brought under control within an hour’s time. Chhatrapati Shivaji Market, a grade I heritage structure, has been a bustling marketplace since its construction in 1885 by British army officer Lt Gen John Ross as per the design by Gen Cecil D’Urban La Touche and WM Ducat. According to historical records, the structure was one of the highlights of Pune city during the pre-Independence era and served as a platform to feed servants and the quarters of the then “white population” in the Pune cantonment area. Conservationists and heritage lovers have written about its Victorian Gothic style with high ceilings. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) in 2014 had asked its engineers to conduct a detailed evaluation of the structure and suggest mandatory steps to fix damaged stones and roof replacements due to leakage during the monsoon season. It had recommended repair and re-plastering of walls. The restoration plan has been on paper since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pwd-plans-restoration-of-chhatrapati-shivaji-market-in-camp-101617461587610.html
